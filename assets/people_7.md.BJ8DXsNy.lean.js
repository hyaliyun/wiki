The collection of paintings, sculpture, drawings, prints, rare books, and manuscripts reflects the development of British art and culture from the Elizabethan period onward. ==Creation== The center was established by a gift from Paul Mellon (Yale College Class of 1929) of his British art collection to Yale in 1966, together with an endowment for operations of the Center, and funds for a building to house the works of art. The building was designed by Louis I. Kahn and constructed at the corner of York and Chapel Streets in New Haven, across the street from one of Kahn's earliest buildings, the Yale University Art Gallery, built in 1953. The Yale Center for British Art was completed after Kahn's death in 1974, and opened to the public on April 15, 1977. The exterior is made of matte steel and reflective glass; the interior is made of travertine marble, white oak, and Belgian linen. Kahn succeeded in creating intimate galleries where one can view objects in diffused natural light. He wanted to allow in as much daylight as possible, with artificial illumination used only on dark days or in the evening. The building's design, materials, and sky-lit rooms combine to provide an environment for the works of art that is simple and dignified. The Center is affiliated with the Paul Mellon Centre for Studies in British Art in London, which awards grants and fellowships, publishes academic titles, and sponsors Yale's first credit-granting undergraduate study abroad program, Yale-in-London. ==Collection== The collection consists of nearly 2,000 paintings and 200 sculptures, with an emphasis on the period between William Hogarth's birth (1697) to J. M. W. Turner's death (1851). Other artists represented include Thomas Gainsborough, George Stubbs, Joseph Wright, John Constable, Joshua Reynolds, Thomas Lawrence, Robert Polhill Bevan, Stanley Spencer, Barbara Hepworth, and Ben Nicholson. Interior of the fourth floor Fourth floor lobby The collection also has works by artists from Europe and North America who lived and worked in Britain. These include Hans Holbein, Peter Paul Rubens, Anthony van Dyck, Canaletto, Johann Zoffany, John Singleton Copley, Benjamin West, and James McNeill Whistler. Some areas of emphasis of the collection are small group portraits, known as \\"conversation pieces\\", including those by Hogarth, Gainsborough, Johan Zoffany and Arthur Devis; landscape paintings by Gainsborough, Richard Wilson, Constable, Richard Parkes Bonington and Turner; and British sporting and animal paintings, featuring George Stubbs, John Wootton, Benjamin Marshall, and Alfred Munnings. Other genres include marine paintings, represented by Samuel Scott and Charles Brooking; London cityscapes; travel art from India, scenes of Shakespearean plays, and portraits of actors. Sculptors represented include Louis-Francois Roubiliac, Joseph Nollekens, Francis Chantrey, Jacob Epstein, and Henry Moore. The collection of 20,000 drawings and watercolors and 31,000 prints features British sporting art and figure drawings. It includes works by Hogarth, Paul Sandby, Thomas Rowlandson, William Blake, John Constable, Samuel Palmer, Richard Parkes Bonington, John Ruskin, J. M. W. Turner, Walter Sickert, Duncan Grant, Paul Nash, Edward Burra, Stanley Spencer, Augustus John, Gwen John, and the Pre-Raphaelites. The Center's collection of rare books and manuscripts comprises 35,000 volumes, including maps, atlases, sporting books, and archival material of British artists. It also has some 1,300 leaves originating in illustrated incunabula. The collection also includes a complete set of William Morris's Kelmscott Press publications as well as a growing collection of contemporary artists‚Äô books. The core of the collection of illustrated books is the material amassed by Major J. R. Abbey‚Äö one of the first collectors of British color-plate books, and includes more than 2‚Äö000 volumes describing British life‚Äö customs‚Äö scenery‚Äö and travel during the period 1770‚Äì1860. The Center's collection also contains a significant number of early maps and atlases. The four-floor Center offers a year-round schedule of exhibitions and educational programs, including films, concerts, lectures, tours, symposia, and family programs. It also provides numerous opportunities for scholarly research, including residential fellowships. Academic resources of the Center include the reference library (40,000 volumes) and photo archive, conservation laboratories, and a study room for examining works on paper from the collection.

A shallow pan is used, unlike the deep pans used in Sicilian-American, Chicago, or Detroit- styled pizzas. Its crust is typically spongy, airy, and light, like focaccia but not as thick. The crust is also rather oily, due to the coating of oil applied to the pan during preparation. In the United States, Greek-style pizza is common in New England and parts of eastern New York State. ==History== Greek pizza was invented by a Greek from Albania in Connecticut in 1954. His system consisted of preparing a full day's supply of crusts in 10-inch pans in the morning rather than tossing and stretching the dough to order. In Connecticut, by the 1980s, 40% of pizzerias were operated by Greeks.Donna R.

At up to 14 feet (4.27 metres) in shoulder height, it was one of the largest elephant species to have ever lived. It is believed that P. recki ranged throughout Africa between 3.5 and 1 million years ago. P. recki was a successful grass-eating elephant until it became extinct, perhaps by competition with members of the genus Loxodonta, the African elephants of today. Its descendant taxon, \\"Elephas\\" jolensis persisted into the late Middle Pleistocene, c. 205-130 kya in Kenya, after which it was replaced by Loxodonta africana after a severe drought period. P. recki is believed to be the ancestral species from which the Palaeoloxodon species of Eurasia are derived. A male of P. recki from Koobi Fora was 40 years old when it died. At that age it was tall and weighed . The species is known from the Middle Atlas of Morocco.Marinheiro, J., Mateus, O., Alaoui, A., Amani, F., Nami, M., & Ribeiro, C. (2014).

The research also found a wide range of morphological variation, both between the supposed subspecies and between different specimens previously identified as belonging to the same subspecies. The degree of temporal and geographical overlap, along with the morphological variation in P. recki suggests that the relationships between any subspecies are more complicated than previously indicated.Todd, N.

A former left full back or midfielder, he is now a first team coach for Olympique de Marseille joining in 2020 after leaving the post of head coach of Rangers W.F.C. in the Scottish Women's Premier League. Vignal played in the top division in five countries ‚Äì England, France, Spain, Scotland and Greece ‚Äì and in the second tier in a sixth, Germany, though never played in more than 30 league games for any club. At international level, he represented France at under-20 level in the 2001 FIFA World Youth Championship and has also been capped at under-21 level. ==Playing careerLiverpool and loans=== Born in Montpellier, Vignal began his career at his home-town club, Montpellier. He soon established a reputation as a promising young player, and was signed by Liverpool in September 2000 for ¬£500,000. He immediately impressed in his first reserve team outings and made his first team debut against Rotherham United in the FA Cup. He went on to make a further six appearances during the 2000‚Äì01 season. Vignal returned for the following season having featured in the World Youth Championship with the France Under-18 squad, and staked his claim for the left-back spot with some impressive performances at the start of the 2001‚Äì02 season. However, he found it hard to displace the reliable and experienced John Arne Riise. He went on to make nine appearances that season. He made just four appearances during the first half of the 2002‚Äì03 season and was loaned to Bastia for the remainder of the campaign in mid-January 2003. During the 2003‚Äì04 campaign Vignal was again loaned out to Rennes for the first half of the season, and to Espanyol for the latter half. Vignal had a season in Scotland at Rangers as the club regained the Scottish Premier League title, playing 42 games and picking up a Scottish League Cup winner's medal as well as the league title. ===Portsmouth=== At the end of the 2004‚Äì05 season Vignal's Liverpool contract expired, and with him available on a free transfer Rangers wanted him to sign a permanent contract with them; however, he failed to agree terms, instead opting to move to Portsmouth. He was then released from Portsmouth after failing to impress Harry Redknapp on his return in the 2005‚Äì06 season. ===RC Lens and loans=== Vignal then moved to Lens on a free transfer and was loaned out to FC Kaiserslautern for the second half of the season in January 2007. After a trial with the club, Vignal joined Southampton on a season-long loan on 27 July 2007. He scored his first goal for Southampton with a free kick in a 2‚Äì0 win over Leicester City in the FA Cup, and his first league goal came from a penalty against Scunthorpe United while playing with a broken arm. He scored another penalty in the 2‚Äì2 draw with Wolverhampton Wanderers before being sent off for an off-the-ball incident. However, he later won an appeal against the card. He scored four goals from 23 appearances in the 2007‚Äì08 season. During the summer of 2009, Vignal had a trial with Queens Park Rangers which did not bring the offer of a contract. ===Birmingham City and later career=== Vignal then played in a friendly match against Sporting Gij√≥n as part of a trial with Birmingham City, newly promoted to the Premier League. After producing what manager Alex McLeish described as a \\"strong performance\\", Vignal signed a one-year contract with the club, with an option for a further year, subject to medical examination. Injury disrupted his season, which combined with the form of Liam Ridgewell at left-back restricted the player to just nine first-team appearances. The club chose not to take up the option of a second year. In July 2010, Vignal had trials with Sheffield United and Cardiff City. In September 2010, he joined Atromitos. He then left the Athens club in December 2010. On 12 September 2012, Vignal signed a contract with Scottish Premier League club Dundee United until January 2013, but left in November without having made a first-team appearance. He returned to France, where he signed for CFA (fourth-tier) club AS B√©ziers ahead of the 2013‚Äì14 season. ==Coaching career== After a period working with Rangers as a coach for their youth academy teams, in July 2019 Vignal was appointed the head coach of the club's senior Women's team with the incumbent Amy McDonald moving to a role as the overall women's section manager. , he would leave Rangers in August 2020 to take up a first team coaching role at Marseille ==HonoursClub=== Liverpool *FA Cup: 2000‚Äì01 *UEFA Cup: 2000‚Äì01 *UEFA Super Cup: 2001 Rangers * Scottish League Cup: 2004‚Äì05 * Scottish Premier League: 2004‚Äì05 Lens * Ligue 2: 2008‚Äì09 ===International=== France * UEFA European Under-18 Championship: 2000 ==References * *Liverpool FC profile *LFCHistory.net profile *Beyondthekop.com where are they now Category:1981 births Category:Living people Category:Sportspeople from Montpellier Category:Association football defenders Category:French footballers Category:France youth international footballers Category:France under-21 international footballers Category:Castelnau Le Cr√®s FC players Category:Montpellier HSC players Category:Liverpool F.C. players Category:SC Bastia players Category:Stade Rennais F.C. players Category:RCD Espanyol footballers Category:Rangers F.C. players Category:Portsmouth F.C. players Category:RC Lens players Category:1.

Its GRAU designation is 9K79; its NATO reporting name is SS-21 Scarab. It is transported in a 9P129 vehicle and raised prior to launch. It uses an inertial guidance system. The OTR-21 forward deployment to East Germany began in 1981, replacing the earlier Luna-M series of unguided artillery rockets. ==Description== The OTR-21 is a mobile missile launch system, designed to be deployed along with other land combat units on the battlefield. While the 9K52 Luna-M is large and relatively inaccurate, the OTR-21 is much smaller. The missile itself can be used for precise strikes on enemy tactical targets, such as control posts, bridges, storage facilities, troop concentrations and airfields. The fragmentation warhead can be replaced with a nuclear, biological or chemical warhead. The solid propellant makes the missile easy to maintain and deploy. OTR-21 units are usually managed in a brigade structure. There are 18 launchers in a brigade; each launcher is provided with 2 or 3 missiles. The vehicle is completely amphibious, with a maximum road speed of and in water. It is NBC-protected. The system has been in development since 1968. Three variants were developed. ===Scarab A=== The initial Scarab A entered service with the Soviet Army in 1975. It carries one of three types of warhead: * of conventional HE * fragmentation (lethal radius more than * nuclear The minimal range is about , maximum range is ; its circular error probable (CEP) is estimated to be about . 9M79K missile for 9K79 Tochka missile system ===Scarab B=== The improved Scarab B (Tochka-U) passed state tests from 1986 to 1988 and introduced in 1989. Improved propellant increased the range to . CEP significantly improved, to less than . ===Scarab C=== A third variant, Scarab C, was developed in the 1990s. Again, range increased (), and CEP decreased to less than 70 m (229 ft). Scarab C weighs . === Configuration === * 9M79 missiles with various types of warheads (-9M79-1 for Tochika U Complex). * Launcher 9P129 or 9P129-1M (SPU); * Transport and loading machine 9T218 or 9T128-1 (TZM); * Transport vehicle 9T222 or 9T238 (TM); * Automatic testing machine 9V819 or 9V819-1 (AKIM); * Technical service vehicle 9V844 or 9V844M (MTO). * Set of weapon equipment 9F370-1 (KAO); Educational means * Simulator 9F625M; * Missile overall weight model (such as 9M79K-GVM). * 9M79-UT training missile and 9N123F (K) -UT, 9N39-UT warhead. 9H123F-R UT; * 9M79-RM missile and 9N123K-RM missile split training model. ==Use in combat== * In 1994 the Yemeni government used Tochka missiles against southern forces during the 1994 Yemen civil war.Zaloga, Steven J. Scud Ballistic Missile and Launch Systems 1955-2005, page 39. * In 1999 Russia used the missiles in the Chechen Wars. * At least 15 Tochka missiles were deployed by Russian forces from 8 to 11 August 2008 during the 2008 South Ossetia war. * CNN reported that at least one has been used near Donetsk during the War in Donbass by either the Ukrainian army or the Russian-backed separatist forces. The Ukrainian army issued a statement in which they denied the use of the ballistic missile. The Ukrainian Army continued to use ballistic missiles throughout the conflict, until February 2015 when the second Minsk Accords were signed. In total, no less than 43 missiles were launched, with both fragmentation and cluster warheads, only two of the latter achieving hits on military targets. * In early December 2014, the Syrian Army fired at least one Tochka against Syrian rebels during the Siege of Wadi al-Deif (near Maarat al- Numan, in Idlib province) . * On 20 August 2015, during the Saudi Arabian-led intervention in Yemen, Republican Guard (Yemen) loyal to Ali Abdullah Saleh fired a Tochka targeting a Saudi base. * On 4 September 2015 Houthi forces fired a Tochka missile at Safir base in Marib killing over 100 Saudi-led coalition personnel. * On 14 December 2015 Houthi forces fired another Tochka missile at Bab Al Mandab base killing over 150 Saudi-led coalition personnel stationed there. * On 16 January 2016 Houthi forces fired a Tochka at Al Bairaq base in Marib killing dozens of Saudi-led coalition personnel * On 31 January 2016 Houthi forces fired a Tochka at Al Anad base in Lahj killing and wounding over 200 Saudi-led coalition personnel * On 26 April 2016 the Syrian Army fired a Tochka at Syrian rebels in the Syrian Civil Defense Center in west Aleppo * On 14 June 2016 the Syrian Army fired a Tochka at Syrian rebel groups Al-Rahman Legion and Jaysh Al-Fustat in Eastern Ghouta, killing several fighters. * On 20 March 2018 the Syrian Army fired a Tochka towards the Turkish Hatay province, which fell in the border district of Yayladaƒüƒ± without causing any casualties or damage. * On 23 July 2018 Syrian Army fired two Tochka missiles near the Israeli border. Initially thought to be inbound to Israel near the Sea of Galilee, two David's Sling interceptors were fired by Israel. A few moments later it became clear they were going to strike within Syria, as such one interceptor was detonated over Israel while the other one fell inside Syria.\\"Second David's Sling-missile fell in Syria without hitting target\\", The Jerusalem Post, 25 July 2018 One Tochka missile landed 1 kilometer inside Syria. * Azerbaijan claimed Armenia fired Tochka-U rockets at its territory during the 2020 Nagorno-Karabakh conflict.

Where no such overlap is given, in other words where there is no rational agreement possibility, the inverse notion of NOPA (no possible agreement) applies. Where there is a ZOPA, an agreement within the zone is rational for both sides. Outside the zone no amount of negotiation should yield an agreement. Zone of Possible Agreement shown graphically An understanding of the ZOPA is critical for a successful negotiation,, but the negotiants must first know their BATNA (best alternative to a negotiated agreement), or \\"walk away positions\\". To determine whether there is a ZOPA both parties must explore each other's interests and values. This should be done early in the negotiation and be adjusted as more information is learned. Essential is also the ZOPA‚Äôs size. Where a broad ZOPA is given, the parties might use strategies and tactics to influence the distribution within the ZOPA. Where the parties have a small ZOPA, the difficulty lies in finding agreeable terms. ==Identifying a ZOPA== To determine whether there is a positive bargaining zone each party must understand their bottom line or worst case price. For example, Paul is selling his car and refuses to sell it for less than $5,000 (his worst case price). Sarah is interested and negotiates with Paul. If she offers him anything higher than $5,000 there is a positive bargaining zone, if she is unwilling to pay more than $4,500 there is a negative bargaining zone. A ZOPA exists if there is an overlap between each party's reservation price (bottom line). A negative bargaining zone is when there is no overlap. With a negative bargaining zone both parties may (and should) walk away. ==Overcoming a negative bargaining zone== A negative bargaining zone shown graphically A negative bargaining zone may be overcome by \\"enlarging the pie\\". In integrative negotiations when dealing with a variety of issues and interests, parties that combine interests to create value reach a far more rewarding agreement. Behind every position there are usually more common interests than conflicting ones. In the example above, Sarah is unwilling to pay more than $4,500 and Paul won't accept anything less than $5,000. However, Sarah may be willing throw in some skis she received as a gift but never used. Paul, who was going to use some of the car money to buy some skis, agrees. Paul accepted less than his bottom line because value was added to the negotiation. Both parties \\"win\\". A negotiator should always start considering both parties' ZOPA at the earliest stage of his or her preparations and constantly refine and adjust these figures as the process proceeds. For every interest there often exists several possible solutions that could satisfy it. == See also == * Bargaining * Best alternative to a negotiated agreement * Search theory * Transaction cost ==ReferencesFurther reading== * Jung, Stefanie; Krebs, Peter (2019). \\"The Essentials of Contract Negotiation\\". doi:10.1007/978-3-030-12866-1. * * Category:Business terms Category:Personal selling Category:Negotiation Category:Dispute resolution ","title":"Zone of possible agreement"},{"id":"2222265","text":"C√©lestin Lain√© (1908-1983) was a Breton nationalist and collaborator during the Second World War who led the SS affiliated Bezen Perrot militia. His Breton language name is Neven H√©naff. He was a chemical engineer by training. After the war he lived in Ireland. == Breton nationalism == the Monument to the Union of Brittany and France, destroyed by Lain√© in 1932. He was born in 1908 in Nantes and was brought up in Ploudalm√©zeau, Finist√®re. He later entered the √âcole Centrale. He became closely linked to Guillaume Berthou, a fellow chemist and Breton separatist. Contrary to myth, he denied any involvement with the secret society Kentoc'h Mervel (Sooner Death), formed by Berthou in 1929, though Berthou had approached him to join. Instead, in 1930 he set up with Herv√© Helloco the paramilitary organisation, Gwenn ha du ('white and black'). It was named after the colours of the flag of Brittany, designed by Morvan Marchal in 1925.See the external link, Gwen ha Du. davantage en fran√ßais. Lain√© published an article summarizing its creed under the title Nos deux bases, Irlande et Prusse (Our two models: Ireland and Prussia), referring to the revolutionary zeal of the IRA and the authoritarian discipline of Prussian militarism. The gang perpetrated several bombings. Lain√© claimed he made the first bomb in his bedroom from nitroglycerin in a condensed milk carton with a detonator supplied by a forestry worker. Kristian Hamon claims it was not he but fellow nationalist Andr√© Geffroy who placed the bomb which blew up Jean Boucher's statue depicting the Unity of Brittany and France in Rennes. It happened on the morning of 7 August 1932. According to Hamon, Geffroy placed the bomb on the monument, which portrayed the duchess Anne of Brittany kneeling before King Charles VIII of France.L'Union de la Bretagne √† La France Two people were crossing the Town Hall Square at the time but they subsequently refrained from saying what they had seen, despite the offer of a reward. The explosion tore the mass of bronze from its niche and smashed it on the ground. All the windows within a hundred metres were shattered. Parts of the sculpture have been preserved. In 1936 Lain√© created the Kadervenn (Combat tool), a paramilitary unit based on the IRA model, comprising a dozen members engaged in military manoeuvres. This organisation instructed new recruits and in 1938 participated in exercises in the Landes de Lanvaux, a belt of heath and woodland north of Vannes. The following year he spent a period in Germany where he organised the delivery of a batch of arms, which was shipped on board the ship Gwalarn. However the ship beached at Locquirec in the night of the 8th and 9 August 1939. The arms were recovered and stored in the abbey at Boquen. == Collaboration == Before and during the Second World War, Lain√© sided with the Germans. He favoured aggressive tactics and sought to establish a distinct Breton army to work with the Nazis against the French state. (\\"We will continue the tradition of those who, throughout the centuries, have struggled, arms in hand, to affirm our national rights.\\") With Yann Goulet he participated in the creation of the Bagadou Stourm (Stormtroopers).Bagadou means 'troops': stourm means 'combat' or 'struggle': a name clearly based on that of the German Sturmtruppen, developed during the First World War to pass through enemy lines in small numbers and to harass the enemy's immediate rear while other troops followed up with a frontal attack. He also set up a unit of volunteers that he controlled personally, called the Service Sp√©cial (or Lu Brezhon in Breton). This paramilitary unit was in charge of the maintenance of order within the Breton National Party. In 1941, Lain√© helped to oust Olier Mordrel from the leadership of the Breton National Party when it became evident that the Germans objected to his strident anti- Vichy position. There followed a split between the Bagadou Stourm and the Service Sp√©cial, as Lain√© became increasingly close to the Nazis. On the 11 September 1943, at Rennes, he and Colonel Hartmut Pulmer (chief of the Sicherheitsdienst at Rennes) signed the foundation convention of a new unit to be called Bezen Kadoudal, named after the Breton rebel Georges Cadoudal. In 1944 it took the new name Bezen Perrot (Perrot Militia), the name referring to Abb√© Perrot, a parish priest and ardent defender of the Breton language who had recently been assassinated by the French Resistance. His group brought together around a hundred people; his deputy was Alan Heusaff. In 1943, the organisation functioned as an auxiliary police force for the Nazis fighting against the Resistance. The soldiers of Bezen Perrot enrolled in the Waffen- SS, wearing SS field-uniforms. In May 1944, he symbolically founded a new Breton national party on extreme nationalist lines. At the Liberation of France, these collaborationist activities brought opprobrium on the whole of the Breton movement. == Exile == Hunted out of Brittany by the defeat of the Nazis, the last fighters of this unit found themselves at T√ºbingen, from which many stayed in Germany under false identities, assisted by Leo Weisgerber. Sentenced to death in absentia, Lain√© fled to Ireland, where he lived until his death in 1983 in various locations around Ireland, notably County Dublin and Oranmore in County Galway. Olier Mordrel, co-founder of the Breton independence party, wrote that he \\"was a strange man. He had become the prophet of a Celtic religion made for himself, where Nordic racism was married to the Nietzschian will to power, and not without flirting with an air of romantic druidism.\\" ==NotesReferences== * Breiz, E.

Weber (born April, 1947) is the Frederic E. Nemmers Distinguished Professor of Decision Sciences at the J.L. Kellogg Graduate School of Management, Northwestern University.Faculty directory, Kellogg School, retrieved 2010-01-30. ==BiographyEducation=== Weber received his bachelor's degree in mathematics in 1969 from Princeton University, and both his MS in 1972 and Ph.D. in 1974 in operations research from Cornell University. ===Career=== Weber became a faculty member at Yale University, where he belonged to the Cowles Foundation for Research in Economics and the Yale School of Management. In 1979 he moved to Northwestern. Weber's general area of research is game theory, with a primary focus on the effects of private information in competitive settings. Much of his research has been centered on the theory and practice of competitive bidding and auction design. His 1982 paper, \\"A Theory of Auctions and Competitive Bidding\\", co-authored with Paul Milgrom, is considered a seminal work in the field. In that paper the authors analyzed auctions with interdependent values, and introduced the linkage principle. He served as an external consultant on a 1985 project leading to revisions in the procedures used to auction petroleum extraction leases on the U.S. outer continental shelf, and he co-organized (with representatives of the Federal Reserve Board and the U.S. Treasury) the 1992 public forum which led to changes in the way the Treasury auctions its debt issues. Since 1993, he has represented private clients during both the rule- making and bidding phases of the FCC's sale of licenses of spectrum for the provision of personal communications services. In the early 1970s, Weber proposed an alternative to the traditional \\"plurality rule\\" for elections involving more than two candidates. This alternative, which he named \\"approval voting\\", a multi-candidate binary rating system of social choice, has generated a substantial body of research, has been adopted by a number of professional organizations, and has been used in several public elections. His later work in this area includes \\"A Theory of Voting Equilibria\\", co-authored with Roger Myerson. For a summary see \\"Approval Voting\\". Weber has also conducted research on negotiation and arbitration. Among his activities have been preparation of a research survey for the American Arbitration Association, and development of classroom materials for the National Institute for Dispute Resolution. He is a founding member of the Center for Research on Dispute Resolution at Northwestern University, and has served on the editorial board of the International Journal of Game Theory. In 1990 he was designated the outstanding professor of the year by the students in Kellogg's Managers' Program, and in 1998 he received the Sidney J. Levy Teaching Award. In 2008, he was chosen as Alumni Professor of the Year. ==External links== * Personal Website ==References== Category:1947 births Category:20th-century American mathematicians Category:21st-century American mathematicians Category:Cornell University College of Engineering alumni Category:Living people Category:Kellogg School of Management faculty Category:American operations researchers Category:Princeton University faculty Category:Yale University faculty ","title":"Robert J.

In November 2018, the World Anti Doping Agency imposed a lifetime ban on Bruyneel for his role in a doping scandal that saw Lance Armstrong stripped of his seven Tour de France titles. == History  Professional cyclist === Born in Izegem, Belgium, Bruyneel was a successful professional cyclist. Early wins included the 1990 Tour de l'Avenir, the 1991 Rund um den Henninger Turm, the 1992 Grand Prix des Nations and Coppa Placci, and stage 6 (Evreux > Amiens) and finishing 7th at the 1993 Tour de France. His stage win set the record for fastest stage at 49.417 km/h, since then only broken by two cyclists. His greatest successes as a pro cyclist came in 1995. At the 1995 Tour de France, he won stage 7, which began in Charleroi and ended in Li√®ge, Belgium, and took the yellow jersey in his home country. Bruyneel launched an escape and was joined by eventual winner Miguel Indurain. The Spaniard took the lead and rode the stage as a time-trial to gain time on his main rivals, with Bruyneel latched onto his wheel, barely able to follow the tempo. He then beat Indurain in the end sprint to win the stage. Bruyneel admitted he felt somewhat uneasy about how he had won. However, the win into Li√®ge afforded him a chance meeting with the King of Belgium during the prize presentations. That same year, Bruyneel achieved his only podium finish in a Grand Tour when he finished 3rd at the 1995 Vuelta a Espa√±a and won the Aalst criterium. In the 1996 Tour de France, he missed a curve when descending a hill in stage 7 (Chamb√©ry > Les Arcs), and disappeared into a ravine. The moment was captured by a camera team that was driving right behind the group of descenders. After some time, Bruyneel could be seen climbing out of the ravine and getting back onto his bike to continue the stage, apparently unscathed. === Team director === Bruyneel (left) with Pat McQuaid during the 2006 Tour of California Following his retirement from cycling in 1998 at age 34, Bruyneel accepted the position of managing director of the U.S. Postal Service cycling team, whose star, Lance Armstrong, had finished fourth in the 1998 Vuelta a Espa√±a, but whose team, in Armstrong's words, was \\"the Bad News Bears, a mismatch of bikes, cars, clothing, equipment,\\" with a total budget of only $3 million.Johan Bruyneel and Bill Strickland, We Might As Well Win, Houghton Mifflin, 2008, p. 4. Bruyneel's team promptly won eight of the next nine editions of the Tour de France, with Armstrong winning seven straight prior to his retirement in 2005 and then Alberto Contador winning in 2007 with Levi Leipheimer finishing third. However, Discovery Channel, which had taken over as the sponsor of the team in 2005, decided to withdraw in 2007 in the wake of the sport's extensive doping scandals, and the team disbanded. At that point, Bruyneel's teams had won ten Grand Tour championships in nine years (8 Tours de France, 1 Giro d'Italia (Savoldelli, 2005) and 1 Vuelta a Espa√±a (Heras, 2003). Seven of these victories have since been nullified with the disqualification of Lance Armstrong from 1999 to 2005 from the Tour de France by USADA with ratification from the UCI At the time, Bruyneel announced his retirement and his plans to write a book. Bruyneel's book, We Might As Well Win, was published by Houghton Mifflin on 4 June 2008. Also, on 29 May 2008, Bruyneel joined the Board of Directors of World Bicycle Relief. But his retirement did not materialize. In October 2007, after negotiations with the Kazakh government, Bruyneel was signed to take over control of the embattled team, which had been kicked out of the 2007 Tour de France for doping violations and was in shambles over its doping connections. He brought Discovery's Contador and Leipheimer with him for the 2008 season. Although the team was banned from the Tour de France for its past doping history, Contador won both the 2008 Giro d'Italia and the 2008 Vuelta a Espa√±a, making Contador the youngest rider to win all three Grand Tour championships. Additionally, Leipheimer finished second at the Vuelta. Contador's victory in the Tour de France meant that Bruyneel had won four of the last six Grand Tours that his teams entered, and thirteen Grand Tour championships in eleven years (seven of these victories have since been nullified with the disqualification of Lance Armstrong from 1999 to 2005 from the Tour de France by USADA with ratification from the UCI). In 2010, Team RadioShack was formed with sponsorship from Radio Shack and Trek Bicycle Corporation. Bruyneel confirmed his departure from Astana at the end of the 2009 season to join Team RadioShack. === Conviction for doping === As of May 2010, he was under investigation by the Belgian cycling federation, after being accused by Floyd Landis of involvement in systematic doping while director sportif of Lance Armstrong's US Postal team. On 28 June 2012, Bruyneel was accused by USADA (United States Anti-Doping Agency), although he is not an American citizen. Allegations include the assumption that Bruyneel was part of a long-running doping conspiracy, including the use of banned methods to augment the performance of the cycling teams that he directed. As a result of the allegations, Bruyneel declined to appear at the 2012 Tour de France, where he had been expected to direct the RadioShack-Nissan team. While some accused in this case, such as Lance Armstrong and Michele Ferrari, did not seek to formally contest the charges via arbitration, Bruyneel asked for an arbitration hearing. In October 2012, while still waiting for his hearing, Bruyneel left his position as managing director of , shortly after documents from the USADA case were released to the public. The termination was by mutual agreement with owners of Leopard SA. The day after Armstrong's acknowledgment that he doped during all of his Tours, Bruyneel announced that he would be in Brussels as soon as possible to speak to the Belgian national cycling organization and cooperate with its investigation. In November 2013, Armstrong settled a lawsuit with Acceptance Insurance Company (AIC). AIC had sought to recover $3 million it had paid Armstrong as bonuses for winning the Tour de France from 1999 to 2001. The suit was settled for an undisclosed sum the day before Armstrong was scheduled to give an oral deposition under oath. In a written deposition for the lawsuit, Armstrong stated under oath that, \\"Johan Bruyneel participated in or assisted with Armstrong's use of PEDs, and knew of that use through their conversations and acts.\\"Schrotenboer, Brent, \\"Lance Armstrong named names under oath\\", USA Today, 10 April 2014\\"Lance Armstrong Reveals Names in Lawsuit\\", New York Times, 10 April 2014 In April 2014, Bruyneel was given a ten-year ban by USADA, who noted that ‚Äúthe evidence establishes conclusively that Mr. Bruyneel was at the apex of a conspiracy to commit widespread doping on the USPS and Discovery Channel teams spanning many years and many riders.\\" Said Bruyneel about the ban, \\"I do not dispute that there are certain elements of my career that I wish had been different. However, a very small minority of us has been used as scapegoats for an entire generation.\\"Associated Press, \\"Longtime Lance Armstrong coach banned 10 years for doping conspiracy\\", Washington Times, 22 April 2014, In November 2018, the World Anti Doping Agency successfully increased his ten-year ban to a lifetime ban.[2] ==Palmar√®sAs rider=== 1989 * 2nd and 9th stages of the Tour of Switzerland * 3rd place, Tour de Vend√©e 1990 * 1st, Tour de l'Avenir 1991 * 1st, Rund um den Henninger Turm * 2nd place, Tour of the Basque Country 1992 * 1st, Coppa Placci * 1st, Grand Prix des Nations * 12th stage of Vuelta a Espa√±a 1993 * 6th stage of Tour de France 1994 * 3rd stage of Vuelta a La Rioja 1995 * 5th stage of Grand Prix du Midi Libre * 7th stage of Tour de France 1996 * 3rd stage of Hofbrau Cup 1997 * 1st, La Fl√®che Namuroise ===As director=== * Giro d'Italia (2): Winner of the general classification with Paolo Savoldelli in 2005, and with Alberto Contador in 2008. * Tours de France (2): Winner of the general classification with Alberto Contador in 2007 and 2009. :*Lance Armstrong was disqualified from seven Tour de France victories directed by Bruyneel. * Vuelta a Espa√±a (2): Winner of the general classification with Roberto Heras in 2003 and with Alberto Contador in 2008. == Written work == * We Might As Well Win: On the Road to Success with the Mastermind Behind a Record-Setting Eight Tour de France Victories, ==See also== *Johan Bruyneel Cycling Academy == References  External links == * * Official Tour de France results for Johan Bruyneel * Category:1964 births Category:Doping cases in cycling Category:Belgian sportspeople in doping cases Category:Living people Category:People from Izegem Category:Belgian male cyclists Category:Belgian Tour de France stage winners Category:Cyclists at the 1996 Summer Olympics Category:Olympic cyclists of Belgium Category:Belgian Vuelta a Espa√±a stage winners Category:Directeur sportifs Category:Tour de Suisse stage winners Category:Vuelta a Espa√±a cyclists Category:Tour de France cyclists Category:Sportspeople from West Flanders ","title":"Johan Bruyneel"},{"id":"2222285","text":"Emily J.

He served as a member of the Legislative Assembly of Manitoba from 1922 to 1927, and again from 1932 to 1936. Barclay was born in Turriff, Aberdeenshire, Scotland, the son of Hugh Barclay and Imogene Smedley, and came to Manitoba in 1911. He settled near Tyndall. Barclay served with the Royal Engineers during World War I. He was reeve of the Rural Municipality of Brokenhead from 1932 to 1933. He was first elected to the Manitoba legislature in the 1922 provincial election, as a candidate of the United Farmers of Manitoba (UFM). Campaigning in the electoral district of Springfield, he defeated Liberal candidate William Black by 160 votes. The UFM unexpectedly won a majority of seats in this election, and formed government as the Progressive Party of Manitoba. Barclay was selected as chairman of the caucus meeting which selected John Bracken as the party leader. Barclay served as a backbench supporter of Bracken's government for the next five years. He was defeated in the 1927 provincial election, losing to Liberal Murdoch Mackay by eighteen votes. In 1932, the Progressive and Liberal parties formed an electoral alliance to prevent the Conservatives from coming to power. Candidates supported by the government were called \\"Liberal-Progressives\\", and Mackay ran under this banner in Springfield. Despite Barclay's background with the Progressive Party, he ran against Mackay as an independent \\"Farmer-Labour\\" candidate, and won election by 652 votes. He was injured in an automobile accident on the night of the vote, but recovered to take his seat in the legislature. Once elected, Barclay appears to have become a government supporter again. He was offered re-nomination as a Liberal-Progressive in the 1936 election, but declined. In 1943, he was named agricultural representative on the National War Services board, replacing William Bryce. He died in Winnipeg at the age of 84. == References == Category:1961 deaths Category:Progressive Party of Manitoba MLAs Category:1876 births ","title":"Clifford Barclay"},{"id":"2222303","text":"== Publications and events  January === * January 11: After two years of publication Charles M.

He was a delegate for New Hampshire to the Continental Congress in 1784. Jonathan was the son of Colonel Joseph Blanchard (1704‚Äì1758) and Rebecca (Hubbard) Blanchard (1710‚Äì1774) of Dunstable. He was the sixth of eleven children who lived to adulthood. His father, the Colonel, was also an active leader in New Hampshire as a judge in the Superior Court and member of the Governor's Council. Jonathan was active in the New Hampshire Militia, rising to the rank of major by 1765. That year he married Rebecca Farwell (1739‚Äì1811) and they made their home in Dunstable for the rest of their lives. They would have six children: Rebecca (1766), Grace (1768), Sophia (1769), Abigail (1770), Charles (1776), and Elizabeth (1777). As New Hampshire moved toward a revolutionary government, Blanchard was elected first to the Provincial Congress in 1775 and then to the state's House of Representatives in 1776. He served on New Hampshire's Committee of Safety from 1776 to 1778. When a new government was established Blanchard served as the Attorney General for New Hampshire from 1777 until 1782. In 1783 he was named as a delegate to the Continental Congress but wasn't able to attend. He was re-appointed the following year, and took his seat in the Congress. In 1784 Blanchard was elected to the New Hampshire State Senate. He was also named as Brigadier General of the state's militia, a position he held until his death. He died at home in Dunstable and was buried in the town's burying ground. Dunstable is now named Nashua, New Hampshire, and the cemetery is called the Old South Cemetery, located on the Daniel Webster Highway. ==External links== * Category:1738 births Category:1788 deaths Category:Continental Congressmen from New Hampshire Category:18th-century American politicians Category:New Hampshire militiamen in the American Revolution Category:People of colonial New Hampshire Category:People of New Hampshire in the American Revolution Category:People from Hillsborough County, New Hampshire Category:New Hampshire Attorneys General ","title":"Jonathan Blanchard (statesman)"},{"id":"2222308","text":"A post-industrial economy is a period of growth within an industrialized economy or nation in which the relative importance of manufacturing reduces and that of services, information, and research grows.

These dates conventionally delimit the year in which most tropical cyclones form in the Atlantic basin. However, this season got off to a very early start, with a Category 2 hurricane forming on March 6, making it the third earliest hurricane on record to form in the Atlantic Basin after Hurricane One in 1938 and Hurricane Alex in 2016. It is the only known Atlantic tropical cyclone to exist in the month of March. Another hurricane formed and existed during the last week of May, and became the earliest hurricane to hit the U.S. in recorded history. Cape Hatteras was affected by two hurricanes and one tropical storm this year.

The system was initially observed by a ship at 12:00 UTC on March 6 while located about northeast of Barbuda. Tracking in an unusual south-southwest direction, the storm intensified into a Category 1 hurricane on the modern day Saffir‚ÄìSimpson hurricane wind scale. Shortly before reaching the United States Virgin Islands early on March 8, the hurricane intensified into a Category 2 hurricane, peaking with maximum sustained winds of 100 mph (155 km/h) and a minimum barometric pressure of , which was observed in Basseterre, Saint Kitts and Nevis. Once in the Caribbean Sea on March 8, the system slowly began to weaken, losing hurricane status the following morning. The storm was last noted about north of Blanquilla Island late on March 9\\\\. On Saint Barth√©lemy, some buildings were damaged. Winds in Saint Martin toppled peasant tents and damaged crops. The city of Basseterre on Saint Kitts reported winds at and rainfall reaching . The storm beached 24 small crafts and boats and severely damaged crops. ===Hurricane Two=== A tropical depression developed on May 24 at 12:00 UTC about 50 mi (80 km) southwest of Cockburn Town, Turks and Caicos Islands. Moving northwestward, the depression struck the Turks and Caicos Islands. Around 06:00 UTC on May 26, the depression intensified into a tropical storm. By late on May 27, the storm curved northeastward. The cyclone strengthened into a hurricane by 06:00 UTC the following day. It made landfall west of Cape Hatteras, North Carolina, with winds of 75 mph (120 km/h) around 21:00 UTC on May 29\\\\. A barometric pressure of was observed at Hatteras, the lowest in relation to the storm. A few hours later, the cyclone reemerged into the Atlantic Ocean. Early on May 30, the hurricane weakened to a tropical storm. Accelerating northeastward, the storm struck eastern Long Island, New York, with winds of 40 mph (65 km/h) late on May 30, just prior to making landfall near Noank, Connecticut, at the same intensity around 23:00 UTC. The storm became extratropical over southern Maine early on May 31\\\\. The remnants continued northeastward until dissipating over the northern portion of the state several hours later. In North Carolina, the storm produced sustained winds up to at Morehead City. Winds disrupted communications with towns along the Outer Banks. Rough seas generated by the storm in New Jersey swept away a significant amount of sand, especially at Long Branch. An oceanfront street in the city was closed after waves washed out approximately of the road. In Rhode Island, storm surge and abnormally high tides wrecked many boats at Narragansett Bay. One person died of exhaustion during the storm and another suffered a serious injury when a tree fell on a car. Damage in the state was estimated in the thousands of dollars. It was one of only three May hurricanes during the 20th century in the Atlantic Basin; the others were Able in 1951 and Alma in 1970. It marked the earliest date for the season's second hurricane to form in any Atlantic season on record, and it was the earliest hurricane to hit the U.S. in recorded history. ===Hurricane Three=== This storm formed north of The Bahamas on July 24. The storm then made a loop north of the Bahamas and became a hurricane shortly after. The storm grazed North Carolina and moved into the Atlantic. On July 31, it made landfall. The storm dissipated on August 3. The hurricane washed away cottages and boardwalks in Wrightsville Beach, North Carolina. ===Tropical Storm Four=== A tropical depression developed just offshore Sabine Pass, Texas, around 00:00 UTC on July 29\\\\. Moving southeastward, the depression intensified into a tropical storm about 12 hours later. Early on July 30, the storm peaked with maximum sustained winds of 60 mph (95 km/h). Eventually, it recurved to the north- northwest and headed toward Louisiana. At 22:00 UTC on July 31, the cyclone made landfall on Marsh Island, Louisiana, at the same intensity. The storm weakened to a tropical depression early on August 2, around the time it curved northeastward. By late on August 3, the system dissipated over northern Mississippi. It turned around and made landfall in Louisiana, dropping at Franklin, Louisiana, between July 26 and August 2. ===Tropical Storm Five=== A ship detected a tropical storm about 230 mi (370 km) southeast of Cape Hatteras, North Carolina, at 12:00 UTC on August 30. The storm moved westward, until turning northeastward late on August 31\\\\. At 00:00 UTC on September 1, the system peaked with maximum sustained winds of 50 mph (85 km/h). Eight hours later, it made landfall near Cape Lookout, North Carolina, at the same intensity. Shortly thereafter, the storm reemerged into the Atlantic Ocean. The system transitioned into an extratropical cyclone at 18:00 UTC on September 2, while located about 135 mi (215 km) southeast of Nantucket, Massachusetts. The storm brought strong winds to portions of North Carolina and Virginia. ===Hurricane Six=== The sixth and strongest storm of the season was a Category 3 hurricane in mid-September that moved across the central Bahamas and turned out to sea. The storm killed at least 19 people in the Turks Islands. ===Tropical Storm Seven=== A ship first observed this tropical storm about 245 mi (395 km) north-northwest of Telchac Puerto, Yucat√°n, at 12:00 UTC on September 16. The storm intensified gradually while moving northwestward, peaking with maximum sustained winds of 70 mph (110 km/h) at 00:00 UTC on September 18\\\\. However, the cyclone soon quickly weakened, falling to tropical depression intensity about 18 hours later. It then dissipated about 70 mi (115 km) south-southwest of the Texas-Louisiana state line. ===Hurricane Eight=== 1908's eighth storm was a Category 2 hurricane in late September and early October that crossed the Lesser Antilles, moved over Hispaniola and eastern Cuba, and crossed over the Bahamas before turning northeast. It then made a loop and became extratropical on October 7. It caused extensive damage to the Greater Antilles. ===Hurricane Nine=== A ship indicated that a tropical depression developed about 160 mi (255 km) north- northeast of Nombre de Dios, Col√≥n, on October 14 at 12:00 UTC. Moving westward, the depression became a tropical storm early the following day. The storm later curved to the west-northwest and intensified into a Category 1 hurricane around 12:00 UTC on October 16\\\\. About 24 hours later, it became a Category 2 hurricane. Late on October 17, the hurricane peaked with maximum sustained winds of 105 mph (165 km/h). Early the next day, it made landfall near the North Caribbean Coast Autonomous Region-South Caribbean Coast Autonomous Region line in Nicaragua at the same intensity. In mid-October, the ninth storm of the season, a Category 2 hurricane, struck Nicaragua. Because it moved slowly, very heavy rainfall fell in its path, although there is no known damage or deaths from the hurricane itself. ===Tropical Storm Ten=== This storm formed off of the Carolinas on October 19. It stayed out in the Atlantic until it transitioned into an extratropical cyclone and made landfall in South Carolina shortly before dissipating. ==See also== *Atlantic hurricane season *List of tropical cyclones ==References *Monthly Weather Review *March hurricane Category:1908 meteorology Category:1908 natural disasters ","title":"1908 Atlantic hurricane season"},{"id":"2222324","text":"This image conveys a joke without the use of words. In comedy, a visual gag or sight gag is anything which conveys its humour visually, often without words being used at all. The gag may involve a physical impossibility or an unexpected occurrence. The humor is caused by alternative interpretations of the goings-on. Visual gags are used in magic, plays, and acting on television or movies. ==Types== The most common type of visual gag is based on multiple interpretations of a series of events.Carroll, page 148 This type is used in the 1935 Alfred Hitchcock film The 39 Steps. Lead actor Robert Donat was kidnapping actress Madeleine Carroll and they were handcuffed. When they checked into an inn, the innkeeper assumed that they were passionate lovers because of the handcuffs. The film used dialogue that could be interpreted both ways. Another visual gag is a switched image, often at the beginning of a film. A subsequent view of the scene shows something not viewed before.Carroll, page 152 Switched movement may be the gag, such as Charlie Chaplin in The Pawnshop. Chaplin fights with his coworker and punches at him once. Their boss walks in mid-swing and Chaplin changes the motion to act like he was dropping to his knees to scrub the floor. Noel Carroll established the most influential taxonomy of sight gags, breaking down the varieties into six types, two of which are enumerated below. Mutual Interference: The audience is fully aware of the on-screen situation, but a character comically misunderstands Mimed Metaphor: A variety of virtual simile an object may be treated as if it is a different object or be used in an unconventional way, such as acting like a doughnut is a barbell or using a tuba as an umbrella holder.Carroll, page 153 ==History== There are numerous examples in cinema history of directors who based most of the humor in their films on visual gags, even to the point of using no or minimal dialogue. Visual gags began in live theater. The first known use of a visual gag in a film was in the Lumi√®re brothers' 1895 short, L'Arroseur Arros√© (\\"The Waterer Watered\\"), in which a gardener watering his plants becomes the subject of a boy's prank. An early pioneer in visual gags was Georges M√©li√®s. The filmmaker experimented with techniques in the then-new film media creating techniques to trick viewers. Vaudeville actors often used gags in their routines. A classic vaudeville visual gag was for two actors to mirror each other's actions around a prop. Visual gags were continued into silent films and are considered a hallmark of the genre. In silent films, the actors in the mirror bit performed in silence with no music playing. Comedians including Charlie Chaplin, Buster Keaton, Harold Lloyd and the Marx Brothers often used visual humour because the technology used to record voices in film (and play it back in a synchronized presentation) did not yet exist. Often the differences between people are part of the comic duos, especially thin and fat actors are used such as Abbott and Costello and Laurel and Hardy.Carroll, page 147 The New York Times cites the fourth Gilligan's Island episode, \\"Goodnight, Sweet Skipper\\", as a classic American sight gag. The castaways were trying to contact civilization with a radio. In the episode, Skipper can recall only how he converted the radio into a transmitter in World War II when he was sleepwalking. After Skipper was unsuccessful, Gilligan got it to work by pounding on the radio; he used it to briefly contact a pilot flying overhead. Gilligan retrieved Skipper and demonstrated how he pounded on the radio, causing the guts of the radio to fall out. Their rescue was foiled. ==See also== *Joke *Wile E.

Alicudi () is the westernmost of the eight islands that make up the Aeolian archipelago, a volcanic island chain north of Sicily. The island is about west of Lipari, has a total area of , and is roughly circular. It is located at . ==History== The island was formed by the long-extinct Montagnola volcano, roughly 150,000 years ago. It has been suggested that the last evolutive act of the island took place only 27,000 years ago. The island was first populated as long ago as 17th century BC, as some archaeological evidence from this period has been found. Roman ceramic fragments, dating from many centuries later, can be found on the eastern coast of the island. The modern name of \\"Alicudi\\" is a corruption of the island's Ancient Greek name of Ereikousa, derived from the plant known as erica, more commonly known as heather, which still grows on the island‚Äôs slopes. For many centuries, Alicudi was the target of frequent incursions by pirates. Consequently, the island‚Äôs population was forced to find shelter in small houses constructed on high terraces and also meant that simple agriculture and cultivation of the peach were the foundations of the modest island economy. In more recent times, the island became known for its alleged witches and sorcerers whose explanation has come to be attributed to ergotism in local grain-based foodstuff which was consumed regardless due to scarcity. ==Demography== Today there are around 120 inhabitants who mostly live off fishing, or the small agriculture of the island. There is only one restaurant on the island and the menu depends greatly on what fish the local fishermen have caught, or what food supplies the hydrofoil brings. ==See also== *List of volcanoes in Italy ==Notes and references== * ==External links== *About Alicudi *Aeolian Island tourism website *Topographic Map of the Island *Alicudi web *BBC Travel - Alicudi: Italy's LSD island Category:Frazioni of the Metropolitan City of Messina Category:Stratovolcanoes of Italy Category:Aeolian Islands Category:Pleistocene volcanoes ","title":"Alicudi"},{"id":"2222352","text":"The Philippine Dynasty, also known as the House of Habsburg in Portugal, was the third royal house of Portugal. It was named after the three Spanish kings who ruled Portugal between 1581 and 1640 in a dynastic union of the two crowns. The three kings, all named Philip (; , ), were from the House of Habsburg. The history of Portugal from the dynastic crisis in 1580 to the House of Braganza monarchs was a period of transition. At its beginning, the Portuguese Empire spice trade was near its height. It continued to enjoy widespread influence after Vasco da Gama had finally reached the East by sailing around Africa in 1497‚Äì1498. Vasco da Gama's achievement completed the exploratory efforts inaugurated by Henry the Navigator, and opened an oceanic route for the profitable spice trade into Europe that bypassed the Middle East. Throughout the 17th century, the increasing predations and beleaguering of Portuguese trading posts in the East by the Dutch, English and French, and their rapidly growing intrusion into the Atlantic slave trade undermined Portugal's near monopoly on the lucrative oceanic spice and slave trades. This sent the Portuguese spice trade into a long decline. To a lesser extent, the diversion of wealth from Portugal by the Habsburg monarchy to help support the Catholic side of the Thirty Years' War also created strains within the union, although Portugal did benefit from Spanish military power in helping to retain Brazil and in disrupting Dutch trade. These events, and those that occurred at the end of the House of Aviz and the period of the Iberian Union, led Portugal to a state of dependency on its colonies, first India and then Brazil. ==The continuity in the administrative system== Spanish Habsburgs' family tree and connection with Portugal royal house of Aviz Due to complexity in the management of government affairs, the Spanish Monarch established auxiliary bodies called Councils (Consejos), dedicated to providing advice toward resolution of problems. The Councils needed a permanent seat, and so King Philip II of Spain established in 1562 the permanent capital in Madrid, seat of the Royal Court and of the administrative staff. During a brief period (1601‚Äì1606), the whole administrative staff held court in Valladolid. Administrative correspondence originated from different Councils and was delivered by each Council Secretary to Madrid for the attention of the Crown. The king would later assemble the secretaries to request the Council's opinion. The meetings of the Councils took place in the royal palace, and they did not count on the presence of the king habitually. In this polisynodial system stood out for its importance, the Consejo de Estado (Council of State). Relating to the particular government of the kingdom of Portugal itself. During the union of the kingdom of Portugal to the Spanish monarchy, the Spanish Habsburgs on the whole respected the pledges made at Thomar in 1581 to allow considerable Portuguese autonomy and to respected the territories of its empire. Public offices were reserved for Portuguese subjects at home and overseas. The king was represented at Lisbon sometimes by a governor and sometimes by a viceroy. So, Spain left the administration of Portugal and its empire largely to the Portuguese themselves, under general supervision from Madrid channeled through a viceroy in Lisbon. Important matters, however, were referred to Madrid, where they came before the Council of Portugal. In the kingdom of Portugal, the polisynodial system is reinforced: *Council of State. The Conselho de Estado of Lisbon is the King's private Council, entrusted of debating major issues related to the Crown, especially foreign policy. The counselors would send their remarks to the king, and the King consulted them through his Viceroy. Although the Conselho de Estado of Lisbon worked as the great adviser Council to the King's delegate, this Council of State was without clearly defined administrative powers and actually it did not perform relevant roles of coordination. The Spanish kings maintained the system of two secretaries of state, one for the kingdom and the other for \\"India\\", that is to say, for the colonies, despite several conflicts over jurisdiction, until the creation of the Conselho da India in 1604. *In the same way, Spanish kings retained the Mesa da Consci√™ncia e Ordens, which was both tribunal and as a council for religious affairs and was responsible for administering ecclesiastical appointments and for the property of the military orders in the colonies as well as in the home country. *Portuguese Inquisition remained independent from the Mesa da Consci√™ncia e Ordens. There were three major courts in Lisbon, Coimbra and √âvora. *Also preserved was the Desembargo do Pa√ßo. The pinnacle of the entire Portuguese judicial system was the Desembargo do Pa√ßo or Royal Board of Justice in Lisbon. This board, the highest court in the kingdom, controlled the appointment of all magistrates and judges and oversaw the Casa de Supplica√ß√£o or Court of Appeals in Lisbon, as well as the high courts in the Portuguese overseas territories. The first function of the Desembargo do Pa√ßo was to control the recruitment of the magistrates (leitura de bachareis) and to monitor them in the exercise of their charge. Its control spread to the whole of the juridical professions. The Desembargo do Pa√ßo had to arbitrate conflicts between other courts of the kingdom. This court granted dispensations, acts of legitimization and other relevant issues about the justice and the grace, and which on occasions advised the king on political and economic as well as judicial matters. Moreover, a commission of jurists set up to reform the legal system produced a new code for Portugal, the Ordena√ß√µes filipinas, promulgated in 1603. *The Casa de Supplica√ß√£o and the Casa do Civel, both are two royal courts of appeal for civil cases as criminal cases. The Casa do Civel exercised jurisdiction over the northern part of the kingdom, and the Casa de Supplica√ß√£o over the rest on the realm including the islands and overseas. *In 1591, the four Vedores da Fazenda (overseers of the Treasury) were replaced by a Conselho da Fazenda composed of one Vedor da Fazenda presiding over four counsillors (two of them lawyers) and four secretaries. The Conselho da Fazenda exercised a control over the officials of finance, administered the particular king's goods and exercised its jurisdiction over the customs and the arsenals, the court of accounts and the administration of the monopolistic trade with overseas. *From 1604, the newly created Conselho da India was invested with powers for all overseas affairs, apart from matters concerning Madeira, the Azores and the strongholds of Morocco, and colonial officials were appointed and their dispatches handled by it. Nevertheless, the political conjuncture needed urgent reactions, and in this context a system of meetings appeared for specific issues, as the Junta for the reform of the Council of Portugal (1606‚Äì1607, 1610), the Junta for the classification of the debts to the treasury (since 1627) or the Juntas for the organization of the navies of succor of Brazil (since 1637)... ==The Portuguese Empire challenged== The union of the two crowns deprived Portugal of a separate foreign policy, and Spain's enemies became Portugal's. England had been an ally of Portugal since the Treaty of Windsor in 1386. War between Spain and England led to a deterioration of the relations with Portugal's oldest ally, and the loss of Hormuz. English help provided by Elizabeth I of England in a rebellion against the kings assured the survival of the alliance. War with the Dutch led to invasions of many countries in Asia, including Ceylon (today's Sri Lanka), and commercial interests in Japan, Africa (Mina), and South America. Even though the Portuguese were unable to capture the entire island of Ceylon, they were able to keep the coastal regions of Ceylon under their control for a considerable time. Brazil was partially conquered by both France and the Seventeen Provinces. In the 17th century, taking advantage of this period of Portuguese weakness, many Portuguese territories in Brazil were occupied by the Dutch who gained access to the sugarcane plantations. John Maurice, Prince of Nassau-Siegen was appointed as the governor of the Dutch possessions in Brazil in 1637 by the Dutch West India Company. He landed at Recife, the port of Pernambuco, in January 1637. By a series of successful expeditions, he gradually extended the Dutch possessions from Sergipe on the south to S√£o Lu√≠s de Maranh√£o in the north. He likewise conquered the Portuguese possessions of Elmina Castle, Saint Thomas, and Luanda, Angola, on the west coast of Africa. After the dissolution of the Iberian Union in 1640, Portugal would reestablish its authority over the lost territories of the Portuguese Empire. The Dutch intrusion into Brazil was long-lasting and troublesome for Portugal. The Seventeen Provinces captured a large portion of the Brazilian coast including Bahia (and its capital Salvador), Pernambuco (and its capital Recife), Para√≠ba, Rio Grande do Norte, Cear√°, and Sergipe, while Dutch privateers sacked Portuguese ships in both the Atlantic and Indian Oceans. The large area of Bahia and its city, the strategically important Salvador, was recovered quickly by a powerful Iberian military expedition in 1625. This laid the foundations for the recovery of remaining Dutch controlled areas. The other smaller, less developed areas were recovered in stages and relieved of Dutch piracy in the next two decades by local resistance and Portuguese expeditions. On the other hand, the Iberian Union opened to both countries a worldwide span of control, as Portugal dominated the African and Asian coasts that surrounded the Indian Ocean, and Spain the Pacific Ocean and both sides of Central and South America, while both shared the Atlantic Ocean space. ==Decline of the Habsburg Empire and revolt of Portugal== John IV of Portugal (Jo√£o IV) When Philip II of Portugal (Philip III of Spain) died, he was succeeded by Philip III (and IV of Spain) who had a different approach on Portuguese issues. Taxes raised affected mainly the Portuguese merchants (Carmo Reis 1987). The Portuguese nobility began to lose its importance at the Spanish Cortes, and government posts in Portugal were occupied by Spaniards. Ultimately, Philip III tried to make Portugal a royal province, and Portuguese nobles lost all of their power. This situation culminated in a revolution by the nobility and high bourgeoisie on December 1, 1640, 60 years after the crowning of Philip I. The plot was planned by Ant√£o Vaz de Almada, Miguel de Almeida and Jo√£o Pinto Ribeiro. They, together with several associates, killed Secretary of State Miguel de Vasconcelos and imprisoned the king's cousin, the Duchess of Mantua, who had governed Portugal in his name. The moment was well chosen, as Philip's troops were at the time fighting the Thirty Years' War and also facing a revolution in Catalonia. The support of the people became apparent almost immediately and soon John, 8th Duke of Braganza, was acclaimed King of Portugal throughout the country as John IV. By December 2, 1640, John had already sent a letter to the Municipal Chamber of √âvora as sovereign of the country. ==Restoration War== Afonso VI, second King of the House of Braganza. The subsequent Portuguese Restoration War against Philip III () consisted mainly of small skirmishes near the border. The most significant battles being the Battle of Montijo on May 26, 1644, the Battle of the Lines of Elvas (1659), the Battle of Ameixial (1663), the Battle of Castelo Rodrigo (1664), and the Battle of Montes Claros (1665); the Portuguese were victorious in all of these battles. Several decisions made by John IV to strengthen his forces made these victories possible. On December 11, 1640, the Council of War was created to organize all the operations.(Mattoso Vol. VIII, 1993) Next, the king created the Junta of the Frontiers, to take care of the fortresses near the border, the hypothetical defense of Lisbon, and the garrisons and sea ports. In December 1641, a tenancy was created to assure upgrades on all fortresses that would be paid with regional taxes. John IV also organized the army, established the Military Laws of King Sebastian, and developed intense diplomatic activity focused on restoring good relations with England. After gaining several decisive victories, John quickly tried to make peace. His demand that Philip recognize the new ruling dynasty in Portugal was not fulfilled until the reign of his son Afonso VI during the regency of Afonso's brother Infante Pedro (later King Pedro II of Portugal). ==Origins of the House of Braganza== The Portuguese Royal House of Braganza began with John IV. The dukes of the House of Braganza were a branch of the House of Aviz created by King Afonso V for his half-uncle Afonso, 8th Count of Barcelos, illegitimate son of John I, first monarch of the House of Aviz. The Braganzas soon became one of the most powerful families of the kingdom and for the next decades would inter-marry with the main line of the Portuguese royal family. In 1565, John, 6th Duke of Braganza married Princess Catherine, granddaughter of King Manuel I. This connection with the Royal Family proved determinant in the rise of the House of Braganza to a Royal House. Catherine was one of the strongest claimants of the throne during the succession crisis of 1580 but lost the struggle to her cousin Philip II of Spain. Eventually Catherine's grandson became John IV of Portugal as he was held to be the legitimate heir. John IV was a beloved monarch, a patron of fine art and music, and a proficient composer and writer on musical subjects. He collected one of the largest libraries in the world.(Madeira & Aguiar, 2003) Among his writings is a defense of Palestrina and a Defense of Modern Music (Lisbon, 1649). Abroad, the Dutch took Malacca (January 1641) and the Sultan of Oman captured Muscat (1648). By 1654, however, most of Brazil was back in Portuguese hands and had effectively ceased to be a viable Dutch colony. John died in 1656, and his widow, Luisa of Guzman, married their daughter Catherine to Charles II of England in 1661 while she was regent for their son Afonso VI. Her dowry consisted of Tangier, Bombay and ¬£1,000,000 sterling, making it the largest dowry ever brought by a queen consort. John IV was succeeded by his son Afonso VI. ==Monarchs of the House of HabsburgCoats of arms of Titles held by the House of Habsburg== { border=\\"1\\" border=\\"1\\" cellpadding=\\"4\\" cellspacing=\\"0\\" style=\\"width:100%; margin:0.5em 1em 0.5em 0; background:#f9f9f9; border:1px #aaa solid; border-collapse:collapse;\\" - ! style=\\"width:8%; background:#ffdead;\\"Coat of Arms ! style=\\"width:32%; background:#ffdead;\\"Title ! style=\\"width:10%; background:#ffdead;\\"Time Held ! style=\\"width:8%; background:#ffdead;\\"Coat of Arms ! style=\\"width:32%; background:#ffdead;\\"Title ! style=\\"width:10%; background:#ffdead;\\"Time Held - 90px King of Portugal 1581‚Äì1640 75px King of the Algarve 1581‚Äì1640 } ==NotesReferences== *Leslie Bethell, The Cambridge history of Latin America, Cambridge University Press (1984) *Jean-Fr√©d√©ric Schaub, Le Portugal Au Temps Du Conde-duc D'olivares , Casa de Vel√°zquez (2001) *Luis Su√°rez Fern√°ndez, Jos√© Andr√©s Gallego, La Crisis de la hegemon√≠a espa√±ola, siglo XVII, Ediciones Rialp (1986) ==See also== * History of Portugal * List of Portuguese monarchs * Timeline of Portuguese history * Portuguese House of Burgundy * House of Aviz * House of Braganza * Portuguese Succession War * Struggle for the throne of Portugal * 1580 Portuguese succession crisis ","title":"Philippine dynasty"},{"id":"2222391","text":"2001 Estate Cabernet label Kathryn Kennedy (July 28, 1927 ‚Äì August 23, 2009) was a California wine grower, establishing her vineyard during the growth phase in the California wine history known as \\"The Wine Boom of the early 1970s\\". While not the first woman winemaker (Zelma Long and others), Kennedy was one of the first owners of a brand to bear a woman's name in California, and one who came to the scene independent of the young women graduates of the University of California-Davis. ==Early life== Born 1927, Kennedy moved from Santa Cruz to Santa Clara Valley at the age of 15, earning a degree from Stanford University at the age of 19. Married, and with the first of her four children, Kathryn moved to her Saratoga property in 1949 where she later decided to plant a vineyard.C. Fallis, editor The Encyclopedic Atlas of Wine pg 93 Global Book Publishing 2006 In preparation for planting her , she attended two semesters of the viticulture program at University of California, Davis. There she was advised to plant Cabernet Sauvignon on her property. This recommendation was based not only on the \\"Region Two\\" climate classification for her land in Saratoga, but also on the market projections that were held during the late 1960s. ==Viticulture and winemaking activities== In planting her vineyard, Kennedy had Clone #8 cuttings sourced from David Bruce Vineyards developed for one year in an on-site nursery before planting in 1973. After selling fruit for two vintages to Mount Eden Vineyards in Saratoga, Kathryn established her brand and winery in 1979. Her adviser and first winemaker was Bill Anderson, who went on to be the longstanding winemaker at Chateau Julien in Carmel Valley AVA. From 1979 until 1988 Kathryn's winery produced only Estate Cabernet. Joining the process after the survey work of Ken Burnap and David Bennion, Kennedy contributed to modifying the boundaries of the Santa Cruz Mountains AVA, which was created in 1981. She successfully sought to include her land in this new appellation in order to be associated with the premium wine producers of this region. ==Death== Kennedy died August 23, 2009, at home surrounded by her family, after a long battle with cancer. ==Winery== Kathryn Kennedy Winery is a small winery located in Saratoga, California. It is located on of land in the foothills of the Santa Cruz Mountains near the Silicon Valley. Kathryn Kennedy Winery produces Cabernet Sauvignon, Syrah, Sauvignon blanc, and a Lateral blend. Kennedy left the winery in the hands of her youngest son Marty Mathis, who has been winemaker since 1981.A. Domine (ed.) Wine, pp. 830, Ullmann Publishing, 2008 In 2003 production was expanded to include a 4000 case red blend named Lateral made in Napa Valley as well as a Sauvignon blanc made from organic grapes.

Both councils, at least in theory, preside over the church, although the apostles have tended to supersede the standing high council in both of the largest Latter Day Saint denominations, The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and the Community of Christ. Both presiding high councils function as second presidencies to the church, the apostles overseeing the mission field, and the standing high council overseeing the stakes of Zion (or areas where the church has been organized into sustained units). Historically, the standing high council had oversight over all other high councils within the stakes of Zion and was equal in authority to the Quorum of the Twelve. Because the standing high council oversaw stake high councils, the Quorum of the Twelve had oversight over the Seventy. ==Types of high councils== In the revelations of Joseph Smith, at least three types of high council are mentioned: *Stake high councils, with standing or authority in only one particular stake; *a standing presiding high council, also called the High Council in Zion or the High Council of Zion, with jurisdiction over all the stakes of Zion; and *a traveling presiding high council, later called the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles), with jurisdiction over the mission field outside of the established stakes. The standing presiding high council was intended to be located at the \\"center place\\" of Zion, or church headquarters. The center place itself is not considered a stake. Building upon the Book of Isaiah's imagery of Zion as a tent (Isaiah 54:2), the church leadership is found at the center pole of the tent, with the stakes of Zion providing support and balance to the center place. The standing presiding high council in Zion acts with the First Presidency as a second presidency to the church. The traveling presiding high council acts to govern the church outside of the organized stakes. One of Smith's revelations states that \\"the high council in Zion form a quorum equal in authority in the affairs of the church, in all their decisions, to the councils of the Twelve at the stakes of Zion.\\"Doctrine and Covenants 107:37 (LDS Church ed.). The two presiding high councils, when combined, are equal in authority to the First Presidency. At the same time, both are subject to the First Presidency, which has undivided authority over all the church. In addition to these two presiding councils, each of the several standing high councils in the stakes of Zion, when combined, are deemed to be equal in authority to standing high council in Zion.D&C; 107:36 (LDS Church ed.). As such, the combined stake high councils potentially form a third-tier presidency of the church. ==History== On February 17, 1834, Joseph Smith, the founder of the Latter Day Saint movement, created the church's first high council at church headquarters in Kirtland, Ohio.D&C; 102 (LDS Church ed.). This body consisted of twelve men and were under the direction of the First Presidency. This high council took on the role of chief judicial and legislative body of the church, except in areas where the church was not organized, and handled such things as excommunication trials and approval of all church spending. When church headquarters moved to Jackson County, Missouri, the newly formed Missouri high council took on a presiding role as the high council of Zion, and the Kirtland high council became subordinate. Later, when other high councils were established in newly formed stakes of the church, the high council of Zion took on the role of \\"presiding\\" over the lesser high councils. For example, cases tried in the high councils of outlying stakes were regularly appealed to the presiding high council. The president of this high council was the President of the Church, who at all relevant times was Smith.D&C; 102:9 (LDS Church ed.). Originally, the standing high council, under the direction of the First Presidency, was in a de facto supervisory role over the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles, which was a traveling high council with jurisdiction only outside of Zion or its stakes. For example, in 1838, when vacancies arose in the traveling high council, it was the standing high council at Far West, Missouri, that voted on and filled the vacancies. Later, as the traveling high council evolved and began to be known as the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles, it acquired equal status with the standing high council. When the standing high council was dissolved after church members were expelled from Missouri, the high council organized at the new church headquarters in Nauvoo, Illinois, where it continued to function as the presiding high council of the church, overseeing appeals from high councils in outlying stakes. The original members of the standing high council in Kirtland were:Doctrine and Covenants 102:3 (LDS Church ed.). *Joseph Smith, Sr. *John Smith *Joseph Coe *John Johnson *Martin Harris *John S. Carter *Jared Carter *Oliver Cowdery *Samuel H. Smith *Orson Hyde *Sylvester Smith *Luke S. Johnson ==History in The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints== After the 1844 succession crisis, high councils developed differently in the various denominations of the Latter Day Saint movement. In The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, which was composed of those who recognized Brigham Young and the apostles as the rightful successor to Smith, the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles gained ascendancy and the standing high council diminished in authority, eventually disappearing completely. Post- exodus to Utah, the standing high council was established in a limited capacity as part of the central Salt Lake Stake, but it only served as a ratifying body for priesthood quorums in other stakes. An LDS Church Sunday School manual from 1980 states: ‚ÄúThe Salt Lake Stake functioned more or less as a center stake that gave direction and guidance and had jurisdiction over other stakes. When quorum leaders in outlying areas needed new officers they sent a list of nominees to the Salt Lake Stake.‚Äù My Kingdom Shall Roll Forth (Salt Lake City, Utah: LDS Church, 1980) pp. 40‚Äì41. Of this arrangement, the manual states that ‚Äúthe function of stake organizations ‚Ä¶ had not been adequately defined for the maximum strength of the overall Church organization.‚Äù In 1877, the First Presidency, with Brigham Young as President, sent out a letter to the church for the purpose of \\"setting in order the quorums of priesthood\\"; regarding the situation of the Salt Lake Stake having a \\"center place\\" supervisory role, the letter stated that ‚Äúunder the direction of the First Presidency and the Twelve Apostles the presidency of the various Stakes will have the general supervision of all matters pertaining to the church within the limits of their Stakes.\\" With that, any remaining vestiges of a standing presiding high council within the LDS Church disappeared. ==History in the Community of Christ== Community of Christ, formerly known as the Reorganized Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints (RLDS Church), has a functioning standing high council. Composed of twelve members, it retains some (but not all) of the duties detailed in Smith's original priesthood structure. One major difference is that its members are not general officers that are equal to the Council of Twelve Apostles. As such, the standing high council is not part of the World Church Leadership Council. The high council does, however, functions in an advisory role for the First Presidency. Its decisions may be overturned only through action of a World Conference. Major advisory decisions include its 1982 statement on homosexuality. The Church Administrator's Handbook 2005 states: The current members of the Standing High Council are:General Councils, Quorums, and Orders of Community of Christ. *William M.

His dramatic narrative of her exploits is cut short when Anya knocks on the bathroom door. He tries to explain his actions, and Anya is unsatisfied (reminding him of Buffy's irritated reaction the previous night, when he had followed her on patrol). He explains his desire to make a record of the events leading up to the apocalypse, in case humans survive, so that they will know what Buffy and her allies did. Later, Andrew talks to the video camera and uses his big white board to illustrate and explain the array of evil forces in Sunnydale. He interviews various members of the household, blithely re-imagining current and past incidents in an idealized and incorrect way. Buffy arrives at the school to find two boys fighting, a shy girl turning invisible because nobody notices her, and various other disturbances. Buffy finds Robin, who has just been injured by a thrown rock. As she bandages his head, they discuss the bizarre (yet familiar) chaos dominating the school. She explains her suspicions that the activation of the Seal of Danzalthar is behind the morning's chaos. They investigate the newly uncovered seal in the school basement. As Robin gets close to the seal, he is infused with evil. In a demonic voice, he berates Buffy for her involvement with Spike. Buffy pulls Robin away, freeing him; he recalls nothing. At the Summers' home, Andrew continues his interviews. He causes Xander and Anya to re-examine their feelings for each other. Spike uses reshoots to seem more threatening. Wood and Buffy arrive and inform Andrew he is going to help close the Seal; it is now surrounded by five possessed students and glowing with light. A magically forced memory allows Andrew to locate the magically charged knife the First wanted him to use to sacrifice Jonathan. Buffy tells Andrew that she believes that he can help her quiet the seal. They leave for the school, accompanied by Spike and Robin. They arrive to find that the school is being destroyed by ongoing student riots. Andrew tries to film their walk through the halls, but they are attacked by several students who possess enhanced strength. Buffy and Andrew make their way to the basement while Spike and Robin guard the stairway entrance. As they walk, Andrew revisits his memories of killing Jonathan, relating several different versions of the story as if each are true. They enter the basement room carefully and find five students standing around the seal, their eyes freshly cut and sealed (like the Bringers). In the Summers' basement, Xander and Anya revel in the aftermath of having sex again before talking about moving on with their lives (a conversation that fades into an awkward silence). At the school, Spike and Robin are attacked by more students. Spike inadvertently confirms that he killed Robin's mother, and Robin makes a failed attempt to stake Spike from behind; in the chaos of the fight, his actions go unnoticed. Buffy battles the new Bringers while Andrew records the scene with his camera. Once she has killed the Bringers, Buffy pulls out the knife and advances on Andrew, revealing that they must spill his blood to quiet the Seal, since he was the one who initially activated it. Buffy describes the bitter prospects for their future, and chastises his constant attempts to avoid taking responsibility for his actions. Andrew, frightened to tears, admits how willingly he had murdered Jonathan, and how he is sorry. He tells Buffy that he deserves whatever happens to him. Buffy leans Andrew over the Seal so that his tears fall on its surface. The Seal closes and becomes quiet. Buffy reveals to Andrew that tears, not blood, were necessary to close the seal; she has no plans to kill him. The students around the school are released, and the violence stops. Later, a sad Andrew talks to the camera in the bathroom again, confessing that he probably will die, and that he deserves to. Without another word, he shuts the camera off. ==Production== In the DVD commentary for \\"Conversations with Dead People\\", Danny Strong (Jonathan) revealed that the interstitial scenes of Andrew visualizing himself, Jonathan and Warren \\"as Gods\\" were the final scenes he shot for the series. ==External links== * * Category:Buffy the Vampire Slayer (season 7) episodes Category:2003 American television episodes Category:Television episodes written by Jane Espenson ","title":"Storyteller (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)"},{"id":"2222453","text":"Savannah‚ÄìChanelle Vineyards label Savannah‚ÄìChanelle Vineyards, is a vineyard located in the eastern foothills of the Santa Cruz mountains above Saratoga, California and the Silicon Valley.

Ellin also served as executive producer, director, head writer and supporting actor for the series, and wrote, directed and produced its 2015 film adaptation. He attended Tulane University. ==Life and career== Ellin was born in Brooklyn, New York, the son of June and Marvin Ellin.Doug Ellin (I) He grew up in Merrick, New York and graduated from John F. Kennedy High School (Bellmore, New York). Before producing and writing for Entourage, Ellin served as a staff writer for Life with Bonnie, which starred Bonnie Hunt. The series ran from 2003-2004. Ellin has also written screenplays for two films, Kissing a Fool and Phat Beach. He moved to Los Angeles in the early 1990s to be a stand-up comedian and soon got a job in the mail room at New Line Cinema. It was there where he befriended film producer Mike DeLuca who funded Ellin's first short film The Pitch, starring then unknown actor David Schwimmer. That short film got Ellin accepted to the American Film Institute, where he graduated from in 1994. In 1996, he directed the independent comedy film Phat Beach. The film was made on a very low budget, and Ellin has called it \\"Probably the worst movie ever made\\". Two years later, Ellin made another independent comedy film Kissing a Fool, starring David Schwimmer, who was now known due to his role on Friends which was in its fourth season. Kissing a Fool was sold for distribution and Ellin subsequently sold a few screenplays to Miramax. One, The Pledge was never produced although Ellin was paid seven figures for the script and was set to direct. He sold another unproduced screenplay for mid-six figures. Ellin's real success came in 2004 with Entourage. The HBO show ran for eight seasons and Ellin made an eight-figure pact with HBO to continue producing television. Additionally, Ellin serves on the board of the Greenwich International Film Festival. Ellin wrote and directed the 2015 film adaptation of Entourage. ==Awards and nominations== Ellin has been nominated for three Emmy Awards, four Writers Guild of America Awards, three PGA Awards and a BAFTA, and has won a BAFTA and a PGA award.IMDb: Awards for Doug Ellin ==Personal life== Ellin married Melissa Dana Hecht in 1996 and together have two children.https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2007/04/16/rollin-with- dadhttps://www.nytimes.com/1996/08/25/style/melissa-d-hecht-douglas-r- ellin.html The two divorced in 2009.

Over its first three albums, Wire's music had progressed from rapid-fire punk rock to moody, ambitious post-punk. Dome continued the experimentation, often abandoning traditional song structures in favor of found sounds, melodic fragments, and what critics Steven Grand and David Sheridan described as \\"lurching mechanical noises infrequently keeping a vague beat\\". Between 1980 and 1981 Dome released three studio albums: Dome (1980), Dome 2 (1980) and Dome 3 (1981), on its own Dome Records label. As well as releasing Dome band albums, Gilbert and Lewis produced and released records by Desmond Simmons (who played on Wire bandmate Colin Newman's solo albums A-Z and Not To) and A.C. Marias, on the band's label. An album 3R4 was released in 1980 under the name B.C. Gilbert & G. Lewis as well as a single \\"Ends With the Sea\\" in 1981, followed by an EP Like This for Ages released as Cupol, all on the 4AD record label. In 1982 it released MZUI (Waterloo Gallery), an LP of recordings made at the Waterloo Gallery with Russell Mills. In 1983 Gilbert and Lewis worked with Dome collaborator Angela Conway (aka A.C. Marias) to release Whilst Climbing Thieves Vie for Attention, an LP under the name P'O.

Fort Morris was constructed in Sunbury by the authority of the Continental Congress. A contingent of British soldiers attempted to take the fort on November 25, 1778. The American contingent at Fort Morris was led by Colonel John McIntosh (c. 1748‚Äì1826).GlynnGen.com Coastal Georgia Genealogy Page on John McIntosh The Americans numbered only 127 Continental soldiers plus militiamen and local citizens. The fort itself was crudely constructed and could not have withstood any concerted attack. The British commander, Colonel Fuser, demanded Fort Morris' surrender through a written note to the American rebels. Though clearly outnumbered (he had only about 200 men plus artillery), Colonel McIntosh's defiant written response to the British demand included the following line: \\"As to surrendering the fort, receive this laconic reply: COME AND TAKE IT!\\". The British declined to attack, in large part due to their lack of intelligence regarding other forces in the area. Colonel Fuser believed a recent skirmish in the area, combined with Colonel McIntosh's bravado, might have reflected reinforcements and so the British withdrew. The British returned in January 1779 with a larger force. They later conquered and controlled nearly all of Georgia for the next few years.North Georgia History Col. McIntosh's defiance was one successful and heroic event which inspired the patriots as the War moved to the Carolinas and then north. The Fort Morris Historical Marker is on Martin Road, Midway, Georgia. It is located at the visitor center for the Fort Morris Historic Site. The center is located off Fort Morris Road, at the end of the Colonels Island Highway (Georgia Route 38). The marker memorializes the battle and notes the \\"Come and Take It!\\" response.

He served honorably, receiving honors from the City of Savannah for his service. ==Texas Revolution== The Come and Take It flag In early January 1831, Green DeWitt wrote to Ram√≥n M√∫squiz, the top political official of Bexar, and requested armament for defense of the colony of Gonzales. This request was granted by delivery of a small used cannon. The small bronze cannon was received by the colony and signed for on March 10, 1831, by James Tumlinson, Jr. The swivel cannon was mounted to a blockhouse in Gonzales and later was the object of Texas pride. At the minor skirmish known as the Battle of Gonzales‚Äîthe first land battle of the Texas Revolution against Mexico‚Äîa small group of Texans successfully resisted the Mexican forces who had orders from Colonel Domingo de Ugartechea to seize their cannon. As a symbol of defiance, the Texans had fashioned a flag containing the phrase \\"come and take it\\" along with a black star and an image of the cannon that they had received four years earlier from Mexican officials. This was the same message that was sent to the Mexican government when they told the Texans to return the cannon; lack of compliance with the initial demands led to the failed attempt by the Mexican military to forcefully take back the cannon. Replicas of the original flag can be seen in the Texas State Capitol, the Bob Bullock Texas State History Museum, the Sam Houston State University CJ Center, the University of Texas at El Paso Library, the Marine Military Academy headquarters building, the Hockaday School Hoblitzelle Auditorium, and in Perkins Library at Duke University. touch-hole detail Detail from the monument in Gonzales, Texas ==ReferencesGonzales Flag as designed in 1835 Category:American political catchphrases Category:Slogans Category:Quotations from military Category:Texas Revolution Category:Flags of the United States Category:Words and phrases introduced in the 19th century ","title":"Come and take it"},{"id":"2222515","text":"Desmond's Hip City is a 1997 album by Skydiggers.

Some people who research a specific surname may restrict their research geographically and chronologically, perhaps to one country and time period, while others may collect all occurrences world-wide for all time.Guild of One-Name Studies web site A one-name study is not limited to persons who are related biologically. Studies may have a number of family trees which have no link with each other. Findings from a one-name study are useful to genealogists. Onomasticians, who study the etymology, meaning and geographic origin of names, also draw on the macro perspective provided by a one-name study. == Scope == Many people conducting family history, genealogical or onomastic research may conduct a one-name study of a surname in a given period or locality quite informally. A full one-name study can be daunting, particularly if the surname is very common. Conversely, a rare surname can be difficult to trace. Since such studies are usually conducted by individuals as a pastime, they are generally feasible only when a surname is not used by more than a couple of thousand contemporary people, so that the total historical data-set is numbered in the low tens of thousands. Where a surname is used by hundreds of thousands, or millions of people, it would be practically impossible to differentiate these persons using national- index data alone. In some cultures, one-name studies are impossible, since hereditary surnames are not used at all or in the case of names such as Singh may represent religious practice rather than an ancestry. Since a majority of human societies use patronymic surnames, one-name studies generally focus on male succession and ignore family relationships through marriage. Some researchers are satisfied to collect all information and group it geographically, approximately representing the different family groups. Others attempt to reconstruct lineages. In most one-name studies, a united lineage will not be discovered, but broad perspectives can be achieved, giving clues to name origins and migrations. Many researchers are motivated to go beyond the one-name-study stage and to compile fully researched, single-family histories of some of the families they discover. == Methods == Accessibility of the data required for a one-name study varies from country to country. Where civil registration indexes are open to public search, they may not be online or gathered in the national capital, but are scattered through the states, as in Australia, or towns, as in France and the United States. In many countries, such as Germany, civil registration and census data are regarded as a state prerogative: vital data are only available to the persons concerned and 19th-century census returns are not available at all. One-name studies in the United States have become more feasible than they were, thanks to the increased availability of online indexes to 19th-century and early-20th- century censuses. More limited one-name studies can be conducted using other national indexes including: * telephone and address directories * registers of wills or deceased estates * electoral rolls * land possession records * military service indexes One-name studies are generally rounded out with a miscellany of information drawn from national bibliographies, archival catalogues, patent databases, reports of law cases, tax lists, newspaper indexes and web searches. A one-name researcher may also report on the linguistic origins of the surname and its use in place names and corporate names. ===UK surnames=== Civil registration indexes of births, marriages and deaths in England and Wales (for the period from 1837), Scotland (from 1855) and Northern Ireland (from 1865 and Protestant marriages from 1845) are in the public domain, and anyone may apply to see the details of any birth, marriage or death. For the period before civil registration, in principle back to 1538 in England and Wales and 1533 in Scotland, parish registers have recorded birth and/or baptisms, marriages and deaths and/or burials. These are also freely available, although the survival of such registers is less likely as we reach back to the earliest dates of this period. The civil registration index books for England and Wales were scanned and made available online in 2004 by the subscription web site Findmypast (formerly 1837online) and an index has also been created by volunteers for the free web site FreeBMD. Records for Scotland can be searched at the pay-per-view web site ScotlandsPeople, and this means that a one-name study with a British focus can be conducted from anywhere in the world. Civil registration indexes for Northern Ireland can be viewed at the General Register Office (Northern Ireland) (GRONI) on payment of an entrance fee. Censuses have taken place in England, Wales, Scotland and Ireland since the 1800s. The Irish Census returns for the years 1841 to 1891 are not available having been destroyed. Otherwise information from the 10-yearly censuses from 1841 until 1911 is available and facilitates the linking of surname data into family groups. Since it is possible to extract a complete data-set of a given surname from these public records, ancestries of most 20th-century persons with a particular surname in England and Wales can be compiled without needing any contact to the persons concerned. == Tools == While most one-name studies are conducted as a pastime, rather than as an economic activity, the sheer volume of information to be organised may require semi-professional data-processing and publishing skills. To avoid retyping large volumes of data by hand, one-name researchers are often skilled at data scraping and automated reformatting. The data must be carefully structured. An accurate copy of the original indexes must be drawn up, and updated when they are amended. Errors and conflicts in the indexes are noted. Links to those tables appear in the roll of individual persons. Many one-name researchers keep data tables in computer spreadsheets because it is possible to see hundreds of items on a single screen and use thinking power to detect patterns. Genealogy software is used by many researchers to collate and define family trees. Others employ relational database software. Increasingly one- namers are becoming involved in Surname DNA projects, using Y-DNA testing to analyse relationships among different lineages bearing the same surname (or suspected spelling variants). == Motivation and support == One-name researchers often begin a study in the hope that obtaining a massive data set will give them sufficient perspective to break through a barrier in their own family history research. Some are motivated by the belief, only rarely borne out, that kinship can be documented among all persons sharing a surname. The Guild of One-Name Studies was established in the United Kingdom in September 1979, and maintains a register of surnames being researched by members. It is a channel for anyone wishing to contact the person researching a particular registered name. In 2014 the Guild had over 2,000 world-wide members conducting studies of individual surnames and their variants. == Publication == Traditionally, publication of definitive research is undertaken by printing a book or by publishing a one-name periodical. Such publications are often sponsored by formally established one-name groups. The UK-based Federation of Family History Societies includes several One-Name Societies, whilst the Guild of One-Name Studies has many members who are associated with such organisations. Advice on setting up a one-name group appears in a short booklet, \\"One-Name Family History Groups\\" by Derek Palgrave published by the Halsted Trust in 2008. Today many studies are presented online, since the data can be continually updated and made available worldwide. A number of Guild of One-Name Studies members have taken advantage of the member benefit called the Members Website Project (MWP) which enables a members to both share and publish their study as a website whilst continuing to work on their study. ==See also== * Surname DNA project * Extinction of surnames * ==References *Guild of One-Name Studies *The Surname Society Category:Genealogy ","title":"One-name study"},{"id":"2222531","text":"Erneley is a variant of the surname more commonly found as Ernle.

He asked her about it. : \\"This is the Klopman diamond,\\" she said. \\"It is beautiful, but it's like the Hope diamond; there is a terrible curse that goes with it.\\" : \\"What's the curse?\\" the man asked. : \\"Mr. Klopman.\\" Due to the use of the name \\"Klopman\\" and the somewhat dark humor, and the fact that it was one of Myron Cohen's standards, this joke is sometimes characterised as Yiddish in origin. Some commentators maintain that \\"Klopman\\" is an inherently funny word and that names other than Klopman would not be as funny; they note that this joke has survived essentially unaltered for decades. It has been a running gag on Garfield and Friends. ==In popular cultureSpider-Man (1981)=== The Klopman Diamond appears in the 1981 Spider-Man animated series episode ‚ÄúTriangle of Evil,‚Äù owned by Mr. Klopman, proprietor of Klopman‚Äôs Jewelry. ===Garfield and Friends=== The Klopman Diamond was used as a running gag in the animated television show Garfield and Friends. For example, there would be a giant diamond in a museum display case, which Garfield, as the museum tour guide, would casually identify in passing as the Klopman diamond; or Nermal would be required to polish the Klopman Diamond as one of a series of tricks during the obedience event of a cat show. At one point, Garfield even mentioned it as a \\"rare and valuable gem‚Ä¶as well as a pointless running gag on a popular Saturday morning cartoon show.\\" There was a segment devoted to it in the episode \\"The Curse of Klopman\\" (see List of Garfield and Friends episodes). The first episode to mention it (and the second reference to it in a U.S. Acres segment) was in the episode \\"Wanted: Wade\\". The Klopman Diamond was also briefly mentioned in the U.S. Acres episode \\"Secrets of the Animated Cartoon\\" as one of many things that frightened Wade (the others being monsters, bugs, and cheese sandwiches). The Klopman Diamond also appeared in a \\"Screaming with Binky\\" short, in which Binky the Clown inadvertently caused a diamond cutter to shatter the Klopman Diamond into a small pile of dust. Mark Evanier claims credit for adding references to the Klopman diamond to Garfield and Friends. As a nod to the old animated series, the more recent series The Garfield Show (also written by Evanier) has also included references to the Klopman Diamond, and a crystal referred to as the Klopman Crystal is made a plot device in the direct-to- video film Garfield's Pet Force. There is also a reference to the Klopman Diamond in the October 2012 issue of the Garfield comic book. ===Follow-up joke=== A later joke of Myron Cohen, similar in nature, goes as follows: : The very same Mrs. Klopman was told by her doctor that she had a fatal condition and would never outlive her husband. She immediately commissioned a world- famous portrait artist to paint her portrait, which was to be hung above the mantel in the living room. As she posed for the portrait, she asked the artist \\"When you're done...if you have some paints left....I vant you should add some things to the painting..... I vant you should paint on my wrist a three-tiered diamond tennis bracelet,\\" she said. \\"Also, paint on Tahitian black pearl earrings the size of grapes.\\" She continued in this vein, asking him to paint several rings on her fingers and a ruby and diamond tiara for good measure. The artist did as he was told, and turned out a dazzling portrait. : When the job was finished, before he left, the artist said, \\"May I ask you a question, Mrs. Klopman?\\" : \\"Sure, go ahead,\\" she replied. : \\"Well,\\" said the artist, \\"painting the Klopman diamond was easy, but I had a heck of a time dreaming up all the other jewelry you wanted me to add on. Tell me, why did you want it?\\" : A crafty gleam lit Mrs. Klopman's eyes as she explained, \\"Because when I'm dead and my husband brings the next Mrs. Klopman into this house, I want her to look at my portrait and go crazy trying to find all that stuff!\\" ==External links== *Mark Evanier discusses adding references of the Klopman diamond to \\"Garfield and Friends\\" *Klopman diamond joke appearing in The Milwaukee Sentinel - Nov 22, 1979 Category:Jokes Category:Fictional gemstones and jewelry Category:Running gags ","title":"Klopman diamond"},{"id":"2222542","text":"Alex Fergusson (born 16 December 1952) is a Scottish guitarist / record producer.

Mullally grew up in Western Australia, and played for the Australian Under-19 side against their West Indian counterparts in 1987/88. ==Domestic career== That same season he made his first-class debut for Western Australia in their Sheffield Shield final victory over Queensland at Perth. He stayed with Western Australia for another couple of seasons, with variable success. Meanwhile, he had made his Hampshire debut, against Oxford University in May 1988. He did not take a wicket in that match, and he spent the rest of the English summer in Hampshire's second team. A more productive time followed back in Australia in 1988/89 as he took 23 first-class wickets, including seven in an innings victory in an MG Kailis-Kemplast Trophy game against Tamil Nadu at Perth. Mullally did not play in England in 1989, and the 1989/90 Australian season was something of a disappointment as he took just 11 first-class wickets, but in 1990 Mullally returned to county cricket with Leicestershire, doing reasonably well with the highlight a haul of 6‚Äì38 (which remains his best in List A cricket) in a one-day game against the touring New Zealanders in June. That winter he returned to Australia, playing just a single game for Victoria. For several years Mullally performed steadily with Leicestershire, capped in 1993 and taking between 40 and 70 first-class wickets a season while playing in the great majority of the county's games. His most successful year during this period was 1996, when he claimed 70 first-class wickets and, perhaps more startling for a man renowned throughout his career for his incompetence with the bat, made his only two first-class fifties, both at number 11: he scored 68 against Surrey in June, then followed it up in September with 75 against Middlesex. In 2000 he returned to Hampshire, where he had begun his career in England, and he and Shane Warne carried the county's bowling attack almost by themselves in a difficult season for the club; that August he recorded his best bowling figures of 9‚Äì93 against Derbyshire (following up with 5‚Äì95 in the second innings for match figures of 14‚Äì188), although the game was drawn. Mullally continued to be a regular pick in the Hampshire side for the next few years, averaging under 20 with the ball in both 2000 and 2001, and claiming five-wicket hauls on six occasions in the latter season, but from 2003 onwards his performances began to fall away, especially in first-class cricket in which he took only 35 wickets in 2003 and 2004 combined. His county persevered with him for some while, and in 2004 he took 22 List A wickets, but the award of a benefit season in 2005 could not disguise his decline and after a friendly against Kent and three totesport League matches in April and May, he dropped out of the first team entirely. At the end of the 2005 season he announced his retirement.Player Profile, Cricinfo, Retrieved on 17 May 2009 ==International career== In 1996 also, he was selected by England for the first Test against India at Edgbaston. He took five wickets in the match as England won by eight wickets, and played in all six Tests that summer against India and Pakistan, as well as in three One Day Internationals against the latter opponents. It was to be in ODIs where Mullally was to make his mark as an England cricketer, not so much for his penetration as for his accuracy: his economy rate was so good that at one time he was listed as the second-best bowler in the world in that form of the game. Mullally was in and out of the Test side from then on, his best period being 1998/99, when he took 12 Australian wickets in four Ashes Tests at 30.33, including his career-best 5‚Äì105 at Brisbane Cricket Ground, and the following home series against New Zealand, when he claimed 11 wickets at 27.27 from three games. In limited-overs cricket, however, he was still considered a central part of the team, and he took 10 wickets at just 17.60 in the 1999 World Cup, second in England's averages (just behind Darren Gough) and with the best economy rate of any English bowler in the competition. In June 2001 he played his final ODI against Australia at The Oval, and conceded 27 runs from his four overs as England were crushed by eight wickets, and also his last Test against the same opponents at Headingley when recalled for a single time in August, having played his previous Test match against South Africa in January 2000. Mullally was a poor batsman, and more often than not occupied the No. 11 position in the England batting line-up. However, he struck an aggressive 16 off 15 balls, including 3 cross-batted fours off Glenn McGrath, to help England to a 12-run win against Australia at Melbourne in 1998/99.Long live the tail, Cricinfo, Retrieved on 17 May 2009 His highest Test score of 24 against Pakistan featured several airborne boundaries off Wasim Akram.

The name was drawn from Loch Ard, a loch which lies to the west of Aberfoyle, and to the east of Loch Lomond. It means \\"high lake\\" in Scottish Gaelic. Loch Ard belonged to the Loch Line, a major shipping line operating between Great Britain and Australia. It was a three-masted clipper ship, of 263' in length, with a tonnage of 1693 tonnes, and was constructed by Barclay, Curdle & Co. of Glasgow. ==Final voyage and wreck== Loch Ard with Thames tugboat Robert Bruce Loch Ard departed England on 1 March 1878, bound for Melbourne, commanded by Captain Gibb and with a crew of 37 men. It was carrying 17 passengers and assorted cargo (total of 54 people). On 1 June, the ship was approaching Melbourne. The crew expected to sight land but encountered heavy fog. The inquest determined that, unable to see the Cape Otway lighthouse; having faulty chronometers on board; and not having been able to take a reading to establish his exact position due to bad weather conditions over the previous few days, the captain was unaware how close he was running to the coast. The fog lifted around 4am, revealing breakers and cliff faces. Captain Gibb quickly ordered sail to be set to come about and get clear of the coast, but they were unable to do so in time, and ran aground on a reef. The masts and rigging came crashing down, killing some people on deck and preventing the lifeboats from being launched effectively. The ship sank within 10 or 15 minutes of striking the reef. The widespread popular belief that Captain Gibb mistook the opening of the nearby Loch Ard Gorge for Port Phillip Heads has no basis in fact or probability: there is no physical or cartographic resemblance whatsoever; ships are obliged to stop outside the Heads to take on a pilot; and the Loch Ard never entered the Gorge at all. The only two survivors of the wreck were Eva Carmichael, who survived by clinging to a spar for five hours, and Thomas (Tom) R. Pearce, an apprentice who clung to the overturned hull of a lifeboat. Tom Pearce came ashore first, then heard Eva's shouts and went back into the ocean to rescue her. They came ashore at what is now known as Loch Ard Gorge and sheltered there before seeking assistance. Coincidentally, Tom Pearce was the step son of James Pearce, captain of the .Picture Australia (2009). Captain James Pearce. Retrieved on 4 June 2009. The Loch Ard Peacock, from the Loch Ard disaster, now at Flagstaff Hill Maritime Museum Loch Ard's cargo included a range of luxury goods, including a grand piano which washed up in the Gorge, and a large decorative porcelain peacock made by Minton in England, intended to be displayed in the Melbourne International Exhibition in 1880. The peacock was recovered intact and was eventually able to be displayed a century later for the Victoria Pavilion at the Brisbane 1988 World Exposition. It is now on display at the Flagstaff Hill Maritime Museum in Warrnambool, along with a number of other relics of the wreck. == Play == Eva and the Cabin Boy by Sheila Dewey - produced at the Warehouse Theatre in Croydon in 1994 - concerned the Loch Ard shipwreck. ==See also== * List of disasters in Australia by death toll ==Further reading== * * ==NotesReferences== * The Loch Ard disaster / J.K.

The band is known for its original rock novelty songs and often satirical covers of popular songs both foreign and local. The band is adept at playing in various musical genres. Parokya ni Edgar has been referred to by local media outlets and numerous award-giving bodies as \\"Pambansang Banda ng Pilipinas\\" (The National Band of the Philippines). Despite having \\"Edgar\\" in the band's name, none of the members are named Edgar. ==HistoryFormation and early years=== Originally named Comic Relief, the band's initial members were a group of high school students composed of vocalists Chito Miranda, Jeric Estaco, and Vinci Montaner, along with guitarists Mikko Yap and Gab Chee Kee, all hailing from Ateneo de Manila University. They were regulars in after- school jam sessions, before performing an opening number for an Eraserheads concert. This served as their break in the music industry and prompted them to add a drummer and bassist ‚Äì Ateneo schoolmate Dindin Moreno and Miranda's childhood friend Buwi Meneses, respectively. Around the same time they changed the band's name to Parokya ni Edgar. After high school, Mikko and Jeric withdrew from the band to pursue other interests. Soon after, the remaining band members invited Darius Sema√±a, Meneses's former bandmate, to take the role of lead guitar. ===Career=== Name origin The band name's origin had been a subject of debate among fans as the band members had never given full confirmation. It was not until 2013 that Chito Miranda officially addressed it through a post on their Facebook page. The title \\"Parokya Ni Edgar\\" came from a joke a classmate named Bambi Cuna made during one of their high school classes. Sources state that the class subject was Filipino. When the teacher asked Cuna where Jose Rizal's fictional hero, Crisostomo Ibarra (in the novel Noli Me Tangere) was educated, it was said that Cuna made up a daft answer, \\"sa Parokya ni Edgar\\". Then-vocalist Jeric Estaco decided on impromptu to introduce the band as \\"Parokya ni Edgar\\" in their first live performance. From there, the band name just stuck. Mainstream By the late 1990s, PNE became regular performers in Club Dredd, a popular club in Manila at the time. The band slowly gained popularity during the height of the Filipino rock explosion, with the local rock community welcoming the influence of foreign grunge acts such as Nirvana, Pearl Jam and Soundgarden. Eventually, the late managing director of Universal Records, Bella Dy Tan, signed them as contract artists after witnessing one of their Club Dredd performances. Soon, their initial recordings \\"Buloy\\", \\"Trip (Siopao Na Special)\\" and \\"Lutong Bahay (Cooking Ng Ina Mo)\\" gained radio airplay. Their first album, Khangkhungkherrnitz (1996) became a triple platinum hit in the Philippines, having sold 120,000 units. The next albums were equal successes - Buruguduystunstugudunstuy (1997) was awarded triple platinum, Jingle Balls Silent Night Holy Cow (1998) with gold, and Gulong Itlog Gulong (1999) with triple platinum. This included the single \\"Halaga\\", one of the most popular songs in their career. \\"Halaga\\" was such a hit in the country that it further boosted PNE's career, cementing their name into OPM history. In 1999, 2 years after Eraserheads won as Best Southeast Asian Music Video Award Winner for \\"Ang Huling El Bimbo\\" in 1997, Parokya won as Best Southeast Asian Music Video Award Moon Man Winner for the music video, \\"Harana\\" in the MTV Music Video Music Awards 1999 was also held in New York City, Parokya was the 2nd OPM Rock band & last MTV Music Video Awards Winner Moon Man Trophy after Eraserheads and in 2001, Kyla won as the last Filipino OPM Performer to win the MTV Award winner for the entry for the music video \\"Hanggang Ngayon\\". The same year, Parokya is also popular to perform mostly on Television and also on radio shows for upcoming gigs and new albums to come. After a five-year hiatus, they released their junior studio album Edgar Edgar Musikahan in 2002. On July 14, 2003, they released the studio album Bigotilyo, with the main single \\"Mr. Suave\\". \\"Mr. Suave\\" proved to be just as popular as its predecessors and stayed on the music charts for more than a year. The song became so popular in the Philippines that a few commercials and political campaigns borrowed stanzas from it. Same Year in 2003, Parokya celebrated their 10th Year Anniversary with new gigs and concerts in various shows in the Philippines and also around the world like Hong Kong, Canada such as Alberta, British Columbia, Ontario & more Canadian provinces tour were performed for PNE, and the United States such as New York, New Jersey, Hawaii, Arizona, California and among other U.S. States. were performed by PNE. 2004 was the year of release of Inuman Sessions Vol. 1, PNE's first compilation DVD album celebrating their 11th anniversary. The DVD showcased the band's prerecorded live studio performance of their hit songs to a selected audience. The DVD album met success in sales nationwide. They released their 8th studio album, Middle-Aged Juvenile Novelty Pop Rockers in 2010 with the single \\"Paki-usap Lang (Lasingin Nyo Ako)\\". The album was met with moderate success in both charts and sales. In 2011, PNE joined the roster of Tanduay's First Five and RockFest replacing long running Tanduay endorser 6cyclemind. The following year, PNE released their 2nd compilation DVD album Inuman Sessions Vol. 2 - a follow up to their Inuman Sessions Vol. 1. Later that same year, Montaner officially left the band on good terms with both the members and crew. 2013 marked PNE's 20th anniversary in the OPM industry. The band launched their 13th album Bente as commemoration, and as this was a milestone, Vinci Montaner temporarily reunited with the band for the album's cover art and signings. In 2014, PNE was awarded with the MYX Magna Award for their artistic contribution to OPM Rock History & also celebrating their 20th anniversary of their opm rock band of the mid 1990s. They are the 2nd OPM Rock Band to receive this award after Eraserheads in 2009. All throughout 2015, the band toured selected cities in the United States; they headlined at the Landmark Loews Theater in Jersey City, New Jersey on March 21, 2015.EventBrite website, accessed March 10, 2015. That same year, the band began recording for their next album and contained the tracks \\"Sing\\" and \\"Lagi Mong Tatandaan\\", the former featuring Rico Blanco. Their 9th studio album and their 14th overall album is entitled Pogi Years Old. The cover album was revealed on September 2, 2016 through their Facebook page and expected to be released by 2016. Former member Vinci Montaner will appear on the album as a featured artist. On September 9, 2016, the band held a free surprise show at the Bonifacio Shrine in Manila. The album was released on October 17, 2016 nationwide and on digital format. The band would held an album launch at Eastwood Central Plaza on October 16, 2016. This marks the return of Vinci Montaner, who would join permanently days later. On November 22, 2017, Parokya was now named as the newest celebrity music star inductee in the 2017 Eastwood City Walk of Fame in Eastwood City Mall Quezon City for their influence in Pinoy rock music. Parokya was the 3rd related music group and 1st OPM Rock band to be inducted to the Eastwood City Walk Of Fame. Parokya Ni Edgar also recently celebrated their 25th silver anniversary last October 2018 following with more concerts and more new gigs to come. A musical adaptation of Parokya Ni Edgar's discography in cooperation with longest running gag comedy show Bubble Gang entitled Bubble Gang Parokya Na To: A Laugh Story The Musical was recently performed last February 15, 2019 at Waterfront Hotel Cebu City, produced by GMA Kapuso Concerts. This was Parokyas 1st musical stage play and also the 4th OPM music artist overall for musical staging play after Eraserheads \\"Ang Huling El Bimbo\\" in 2015, Apo Hiking Society's \\"Eto Na: Musical nAPO\\" in 2017,and Aegis \\"Rak Of Aegis: The Musical\\" in 2018. The band also performed for their 25th silver anniversary concert in the U.S. & Canada Tour entitled Parokya 25 Live In The U.S. & Canada last March 2019. As of this 2020, Parokya is still active with more concerts and is scheduled to release their new single together with the band Kamikazee. == Activism == Parokya joined PETA's Free Mali campaign in 2013. \\"Mali has been sentenced to a miserable life of solitary confinement with absolutely nothing to do day after day, year after year,' says lead vocalist Chito Miranda. 'Scientists, politicians, religious leaders, and tens of thousands of other concerned people have joined PETA in calling for Mali to be freed. We in Parokya ni Edgar do, too. Even if the elephant exhibit at the Manila Zoo were to be doubled or tripled in size, it would still not be adequate to house one elephant, never mind additional ones. While zoos around the world have spent upwards of 2 billion pesos on attempts at more appropriately sized elephant exhibits, more and more zoos have recognized that the needs of these complex and intelligent animals cannot be met in captivity. ==Band members== ;Current members *Chito Miranda ‚Äì lead vocals (1993‚Äìpresent) *Buwi Meneses ‚Äì bass guitar (1993‚Äìpresent) *Darius Sema√±a ‚Äì lead guitar (1993‚Äìpresent) *Gab Chee Kee ‚Äì rhythm guitar, vocals (1993‚Äìpresent) *Dindin Moreno ‚Äì drums (1993‚Äìpresent) *Vinci Montaner ‚Äì backup vocals, monologue, live vocal ad-libs, occasional percussion (1993‚Äì2012, 2016‚Äìpresent; on hiatus) ;Touring and session members *Paolo Bernaldo (of Moonstar 88) ‚Äì bass guitar (2015‚Äìpresent) ==DiscographyAlbums=== Studio albums * Khangkhungkherrnitz (1996) * Buruguduystunstugudunstuy (1997) * Gulong Itlog Gulong (1999) * Edgar, Edgar Musikahan (2002) * Bigotilyo (2003) * Halina Sa Parokya (2005) * Solid (2007) * Middle-Aged Juvenile Novelty Pop Rockers (2010) * Pogi Years Old (2016) Christmas albums * Jingle Balls Silent Night Holy Cow (1998) Compilation albums * Matira Matibay: PG-13 (Singles 1994-2007) (2007) * Bente (2013) Live albums * Inuman Sessions Vol. 1 (2004) * Inuman Sessions Vol. 2 (2012) ===DVDs=== * Inuman Sessions VOL.1 DVD (2004) * Matira Matibay: PG-13 (\\"Singles 1994-2007\\") DVD (2007) * Inuman Sessions VOL.2 DVD (2012) * Bente: Parokya Ni Edgar 20th Anniversary DVD (2013) ===Collaborative album appearances=== * Akustic Natin (Universal Records, 2004) * Akustic Natin Vol. 2 (Universal Records, 2004) * The Best of OPM Acoustic Hits (Universal Records, 2005) * The Best of OPM Love Ballads (Universal Records, 2005) * Pinoy Ako (Star Music, 2005) * OPM Superstars Christmas (Universal Records, 2005) * Superbands (Universal Records, 2005) * Kami nAPO muna (Universal Records, 2006) * OPM Gold Christmas Album (Universal Records, 2006) * The Biggest OPM Hits of The Year SUPER (Universal Records, 2006) * Bandang Pinoy, Lasang Hotdog (Sony Music Philippines, Repackaged 2006) * Kami nAPO muna ulit (Universal Records, 2007) * Pinoy Biggie Hits Rewind (Star Music, 2007) * Level Up: The Album (Star Music, 2007) * OPM Platinum Christmas (Universal Records, 2007) * Another Biggest OPM Hits of The Year SUPER 2 (Universal Records, 2007) * Pinoy Biggie Hits Vol. 3 (Star Music, 2007) * Astig...The Biggest Band Hits (Universal Records, 2008) * Harana: OPM's Biggest Hits In Guitar (Ivory Music, 2009) * I-Star 15: The Best Of Alternative & Rock Songs (Star Music, 2010) * OPM All Star Christmas (Universal Records, 2010) * A Perfectly Acoustic Experience (PolyEast Records, 2011) * Awit Kapuso: Kay Sarap Maging Kapuso (GMA Music, 2012) * Super Astig Hits (Universal Records, 2016) ===Singles=== * 1996: \\"Buloy\\" * 1996: \\"Lutong Bahay (Cooking ng Ina Mo)\\" * 1996: \\"Tatlong Araw\\" * 1996: \\"Maniwala Ka Sana\\" * 1997: \\"Silvertoes\\" * 1997: \\"Sayang\\" * 1997: \\"Harana\\" (Original composed and song by former Smokey Mountain frontman now Finance Undersecretary Tony Lambino.) * 1999: \\"Picha Pie\\" * 1999: \\"Halaga\\" * 1999: \\"Inuman Na\\" *1999: \\"Oka Tokat\\" * 1999: \\"Wag Mo Na Sana\\" (originally composed and performed by Frasco as \\"Oo Na Mahal Na Kung Mahal Kita\\") * 2002: \\"Swimming Beach\\" * 2002: \\"Sorry Na\\" * 2002: \\"This Guy's in Love with You Pare\\" (a song of Himig Handog 2002) * 2002: \\"Beh!

The show ran from 1988‚Äì1992 in syndication. It was renamed The Adventures of Superboy at the start of the third season. ==Production history== The Superboy series was brought to the screen by executive producers Ilya and Alexander Salkind, the producers of the first three Superman movies and the 1984 Supergirl movie. This series and the release of the 1988 Superman animated series on CBS coincided with the 50th anniversary celebrations of the Superman character that year. Ironically, the series came about a year after DC Comics had \\"erased\\" the character of Superboy from their continuity in the Man of Steel reboot by John Byrne. Nevertheless, the show went on in October 1988 with John Haymes Newton playing the lead role of Superboy/Clark Kent, along with Stacy Haiduk as love interest Lana Lang and Jim Calvert as Clark's college roommate T.J. White. Superboy was the first weekly TV series to be produced at the then new Disney/MGM Studios. For the second season onward, the series moved several miles up Interstate 4 to Universal Studios Florida, the largest motion picture and television-sound facility outside Hollywood, where it was then showcased as that studio's first weekly television product. At first, much of the action centered around stories that Clark and T.J. reported on for the college newspaper, the Shuster Herald. All the exterior scenes shot at \\"Shuster University\\" are actually filmed on the main campus of the University of Central Florida. Siegelville, however, was depicted as a coastal city, as evidenced by imagery of both the new and old Sunshine Skyway Bridges (Interstate 275) in St. Petersburg, Florida in the opening credits. Superboy was scripted by many actual comic- book writers. Superman editors Mike Carlin and Andrew Helfer penned several episodes, such as \\"The Alien Solution\\", its sequel \\"Revenge of the Alien\\" and \\"The Bride of Bizarro\\". Other comic book writers that contributed to the series include Denny O'Neil, Cary Bates, J. M. DeMatteis and Mark Evanier. Clark Kent/Superboy attends the Siegel School of Journalism at Shuster University in Shusterville, Florida ‚Äì names which reference Superman's creators, Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster. ==Season breakdownSeason 1=== The first season of the series, which began airing in October 1988, focused on Superboy/Clark Kent (John Haymes Newton), his childhood friend and love interest Lana Lang (Stacy Haiduk) and his college roommate T.J. White (Jim Calvert), son of Daily Planet editor Perry White. Scott James Wells played Superboy's nemesis Lex Luthor. Clark's adoptive parents, Jonathan and Martha Kent, were portrayed by Stuart Whitman and Salome Jens, respectively. In an interview with Boys' Life prior to the show's debut, Newton spoke of the importance of overall character development and his focus would both be on Superboy and Clark Kent. \\"When Clark is not Superboy; he ought to be a well- rounded individual. I think people have gotten tired of seeing the nerdy Clark after four movies.\\" Thirteen episodes were initially filmed for Season 1, beginning with \\"Countdown to Nowhere\\". This episode featured Superboy's first public appearance as he prevents a group of saboteurs from selling a powerful laser weapon developed by the U.S. government to an arms dealer. \\"Countdown to Nowhere\\" aired in two versions: an \\"uncut\\" version in which the story plays in the present day and a second version in which the main story is introduced as a flashback through two additional scenes with Lana, Clark and T.J. The second version contained some scenes cut from the main story in order to fit the flashback lead-ins into the episode. This episode is the first episode of the series chronologically, but was the fifth one that was aired in most markets. It also appears as the fifth episode on the first season DVD set. The first season's story editor was Fred Freiberger, who also scripted a few episodes. The first thirteen episodes of Superboy were rather crude compared to later episodes. The producers, not sure whether any additional episodes would be ordered, did their best to save money on the first thirteen. As a result, the special effects are a bit rougher and the episodes have a grittier, real-world feel to them. This brought about more character-oriented stories and stories with more ordinary villains like drug dealers and crime bosses. After thirteen additional episodes were ordered for the first season, special effects improved and the show took on a more professional look. More fantastic enemies were introduced, such as an unnamed gaseous alien, who could possess the bodies of others in \\"The Alien Solution\\", a life-force vampire in \\"Succubus\\" and long-time Superman villain Mister Mxyzptlk (guest star Michael J. Pollard) in \\"Meet Mr. Mxyzptlk\\". Superboy's nemesis, Lex Luthor, was introduced in \\"The Jewel of Techechal\\" (the first episode broadcast) as Clark's classmate at Shuster University. This version of Luthor was more interested in fixing basketball games and humiliating Superboy than anything else. But the season one finale, \\"Luthor Unleashed\\", completely changed his character. This episode adapted Lex Luthor's silver age comic book origin, in which Superboy rescues Lex from a lab accident that causes him to lose all of his hair, becoming the familiar bald villain Superman fans have come to recognize. Luthor blames Superboy for his hair loss and gains a new, more intense hatred for the Boy of Steel. From this point on in the series, Luthor is determined to destroy Superboy, rather than just humiliate him. ===Season 2=== In the second season, drastic changes took place. The producers of the show were not enamored of Newton's portrayal of Superboy. He was replaced by Gerard Christopher in the lead role. A new direction was made this season with the second season's stories guided by Executive Story Consultants Mark Jones and Cary Bates. Scott Wells was also replaced as Lex Luthor by Sherman Howard. The change in Luthor's appearance was explained in the second season opener \\"With This Ring, I Thee Kill\\". The two-part episode revealed Luthor had plastic surgery to assume the appearance of Warren Eckworth, the wealthy inventor of the \\"Superboy Gun\\", which Luthor believed could kill Superboy. The character of T.J. White was written out of the series (he went to work for the Daily Planet) and Andy McCalister, portrayed by Ilan Mitchell-Smith, became Clark's new roommate. Andy was very different from T.J. and was constantly looking to make money with his get-rich-quick schemes. He also flirted with Lana frequently and his advances were always refused, though Lana did consider Andy a friend. The villains were amped up in the second season, as additional comic book characters were introduced to the series, many of them appearing for the first time in live-action. Metallo (Michael Callan), Bizarro (Barry Meyers) as well as the Yellow Peri appeared in the second season and Mister Mxyzptlk (Pollard) made a return appearance. Gilbert Gottfried appeared in two episodes as a nasty, wisecracking criminal genius named \\"Nick Knack\\" who used toys to commit crimes (a reference to the Toyman). Another character was a dhampir who found a way through a serum to gain human abilities such as repelling his craving for blood and gaining a tolerance for sunlight. Thus, he became a friend of both Superboy and Lana but would become villainous if doing without the serum for too long. Philip Michael Thomas also made an appearance as a medieval alchemist who survived into modern times in order to battle a sorcerer spreading plague, and aided Superboy when he was infected by said disease. The episode \\"Superboy... Rest in Peace\\" featured guest star Betsy Russell, who was reunited with series star Gerard Christopher for the first time since the two had worked together previously in the 1985 movie Tomboy. Also notable is the guest star appearance of former James Bond actor George Lazenby and Bond girl actress Britt Ekland as aliens disguised as Superboy's Kryptonian father and mother, Jor-El and Lara, in two episodes, \\"Abandon Earth\\" and \\"Escape to Earth\\". ===Season 3=== With the third season, the series saw more changes. The show's title officially became The Adventures of Superboy and the setting shifted from Shuster University to The Bureau for Extra-Normal Matters in Capitol City, Florida, where Clark and Lana were interns. The Bureau is depicted as a government agency which investigates paranormal activities and aliens, including Superboy (this format change pre- dates the concept of the television series The X-Files). Andy McCalister was dropped from the series, though Ilan Mitchell-Smith would make a final guest appearance in the episode \\"Special Effects\\", which explained his disappearance by saying that Andy went to intern at a movie studio. The new supporting cast consisted of Clark and Lana's co-worker at the Bureau, Matt Ritter (Peter Jay Fernandez) and the Bureau chief C. Dennis Jackson (Robert Levine). The tone of the series changed dramatically as darker stories were produced and the overall look of the series took on many characteristics of film noir. A few journalists at the time suggested that this darker look was largely due to the success of Tim Burton's Batman movie from a year prior. Many stories dealt with more mature themes, a change new producers Julia Pistor and Gerard Christopher implemented. In \\"Rebirth\\", Superboy is confronted with the possibility that he may have accidentally taken a human life and gives up his Superboy identity in guilt. \\"Carnival\\" shows a satanic individual named 'Deville' trying to acquire Superboy's eternal soul by tempting him to give in and kill a man who is implied to be a rapist. \\"Mindscape\\" deals with Superboy's deepest fears as an alien life-form brings those fears to life in Superboy's nightmares while simultaneously draining his life energy. \\"Roads Not Taken\\" shows the different paths Superboy's life may have taken, as Superboy travels to alternate earths where his life is very different. He meets a version of himself who killed Luthor in a fit of rage and another who has become a despotic ruler of earth. The alternate version of Superboy who took Luthor's life was shown wearing a black leather jacket and sunglasses which bears some resemblance to the Conner Kent version of Superboy as he first appeared in the \\"Death of Superman\\" storyline. The third season ended with the two-part episode \\"The Road to Hell\\" with former TV Tarzan Ron Ely guest-starring as an adult, retired Man of Steel from an alternate reality. ===Season 4=== The fourth season maintained the darker look and feel of the third one and was the first in which no major cast changes took place. Noel Neill and Jack Larson (who portrayed Lois Lane and Jimmy Olsen on the 1950s TV series Adventures of Superman) made guest appearances in the episode \\"Paranoia\\" as employees of the Bureau for Extra-Normal Matters. The trend of more mature stories also continued in episodes such as \\"To Be Human\\", in which Bizarro becomes human, only to be forced to give up his humanity to save Superboy's life and \\"Into the Mystery\\", in which a mystical, ghostly woman, apparently an angel of death, leads Superboy to his dying aunt's bedside. A memorable Luthor tale, \\"Know Thine Enemy\\", appeared in this season, featuring Superboy re-living Luthor's tortured memories of childhood via \\"psychodisk\\" while Luthor threatened to destroy all life on Earth. == Comic book tie-in == DC Comics published a tie-in comic book series during the TV show's run, launching the comic during the TV series' second season. Superboy (Volume 2) is different from any other Superman or Superboy titles in that it is set in the continuity of the Superboy television series, as opposed to the regular DC Universe. Its intent was to explore some of the unseen tales and events that the TV series could not. The series originally carried the cover title Superboy: The Comic Book with issue #1 having a photo cover with the show's stars Gerard Christopher and Stacy Haiduk (dated Feb. 1990), although the title in the indicia was simply Superboy. After issue #11, the series changed its cover title to The Adventures of Superboy as the TV series itself had changed titles starting with season three, and the change was reflected in the comic book's indicia beginning with #18. The series was published monthly until it went bi-monthly for its final three issues, remained in publication for 22 issues to the end of 1991 (cover dated Feb. 1992), and a concluding one issue special in 1992. ==Series end== Although the Superboy series was still popular, the fourth season was to be its last. The finale was to be titled \\"Obituary For a Superhero\\" and Superboy was supposed to appear to meet his demise at the hands of Lex Luthor in a cliffhanger ending. The intent of the Salkinds was to make a series of television movies, which would resolve the cliffhanger and see Superboy's return. As this was going on, a new Superman television series was in development at Warner Bros. The film company had sold licenses to Alexander and Ilya for various Superman-related properties, most notable of which were the feature film series starring Christopher Reeve as Superman. While the first two films were successful, Superman III was a critical flop that barely made its budget back. The box office bomb Supergirl followed which had no domestic involvement from Warner or the Salkinds. After that, the Salkinds sold their movie license to The Cannon Group. Alexander and Ilya did retain their license for a television adaptation, and it was under that license that Superboy was developed. Utilizing a concept suggested by Peter R. Marino, Alexander produced the series and partnered with Viacom to distribute it. As Superboy was being developed as a television series, a change in the Superman canon was going on at DC Comics. In 1986, as previously mentioned, John Byrne was tasked with revamping the franchise and decided to strip it down to its basics and start fresh. His plan of action was to retcon many parts of the Superman storyline, which included removing Superboy from his history altogether. Byrne completed this task by 1988, but since there was no other Superman-based production active at the time it remained confined to the comics. However, Warner Bros. was about to enter the process of developing plans for a new Superman TV series. In 1991, Jenette Kahn, president of DC Comics, looked to Deborah Joy LeVine and Les Moonves of the parent company's television department to come up with a concept. Using the new characteristics Byrne established, Warner Bros. piqued the interest of ABC for their new series, which was to be titled Lois & Clark: The New Adventures of Superman. Despite this, Warner Bros.' licensing agreement with the Salkinds was still in force, meaning Alexander and Ilya could continue to use any Superman character in their own production. Once ABC decided to buy the new Superman series, the Salkinds were served with notice that Warner Bros. was ending the licensing arrangement and all of the intellectual property rights Alexander and Ilya were still in possession of were to be returned to Warner. Although the program was coming to an end at the end of the 1991-92 season anyway, the action by Warner Bros. put an end to the continuation films that were planned following \\"Obituary for a Superhero\\". The writers thus were forced to write a final episode, a two-parter titled \\"Rites of Passage\\", and turn \\"Obituary for a Superhero\\" into a regular episode which did not feature the cliffhanger ending. The series concluded in May 1992 with the conclusion of \\"Rites of Passage\\". It would be another year before Lois & Clark premiered on ABC. The Salkinds decided to challenge Warner Bros. in court over the rights to their Superboy series; a lengthy period of legal wrangling ended with a settlement. The terms of the settlement, which was still binding as of 2014, gave Warner Bros. full control of the Superman franchise's films and television series (with the exception of television distribution of Superman IV, which was taken over by Paramount Pictures after its acquisition of the Cannon library of films and is now handled on Paramount‚Äôs behalf by Trifecta Entertainment and Media). Control of the Superboy television series is shared with both Ilya Salkind, who took over his father's share of the series when Alexander died in 1997, the Salkinds' corporate successor, StudioCanal, CBS Television Distribution, and Warner Bros.. Viacom retained its television distribution rights in the United States, which are now in the hands of its syndication successor CBS Television Distribution. Warner Bros. holds worldwide home media distribution rights and international television distribution rights for the series, but neither Viacom nor Warner Bros. has taken advantage of these rights and Superboy has yet to be rerun since its 1992 finale. ==CastSeason 1=== * John Haymes Newton ‚Äì Kal-El/Clark Kent/Superboy * Stacy Haiduk - Lana Lang * Jim Calvert ‚Äì Trevor Jenkins \\"T.J.\\" White * Scott James Wells ‚Äì Lex Luthor * Michael Manno ‚Äì Leo * George Chakiris ‚Äì Professor Peterson (Seasons 1‚Äì2) * Roger Pretto ‚Äì Lt.

For a time this prevented any official home video release of the series. Between 1992 and 2006 the only way to see Superboy in the United States was by ordering bootleg VHS and DVD copies of the series sold on eBay and other websites. The audio and video quality of these copies was varied. In 1999, Gerard Christopher began offering three VHS tapes of the series created from his personal master tapes (Christopher has masters of all of the episodes he starred in, Seasons 2‚Äì4). Each video tape featured four episodes (which were selected episodes from Seasons 3 and 4) and was sold on his then former website for a price of $25‚Äì$30 US. A fourth VHS video tape was released by Christopher in 2002. Christopher not only sold these video tapes on his website by mail order, but also sold them at personal appearances when attending various comic book conventions and shows. He had offered other Superboy merchandise for sale, such as autographed photos, and at one time, even episode scripts. All merchandise from Christopher were also personally autographed. In response to overwhelming fan demand, from a private email sent by Christopher (only to the fans who had previously ordered merchandise from his website) , he decided to offer all Superboy episodes on DVD, offering a complete Season 2 set on DVD in early June 2004 and planned to sell complete sets of Seasons 3 and 4 in the future. The Adventures of Superboy: Season 2 Episodes DVD set consisted of three discs (in DVD-R format), was produced by Christopher himself, and sold for a price of $159.00 US (due to their past loyalty fans who had previously ordered merchandise from Christopher's website were able to pre-purchase the Season 2 DVD set at the reduced price of $129.00 US for a limited time before June 30, 2004 as this offer was by invitation only). The latter two seasons were planned to be sold at a reduced cost. Tapes and DVDs sold by Christopher were the best quality copies of the series available, since they were made from master tapes, rather than from off-air recordings like all other bootleg copies. When Warner Home Video announced the official release of Season 1, Christopher announced that his self-produced DVD sets would no longer be available on his website in 2005, with the planned DVD releases for Seasons 3 and 4 cancelled. ===Aftermath of the first legal battle=== In an interview for the webpage supermanhomepage.com, Salkind revealed that the legal battle between the three companies involved in the series' production (Viacom, Warner Bros. and the Salkinds) was the reason the show was not re-run on television or released to home video. This dispute was settled circa 2005, allowing the series to be released on DVD. ===DVD release summary=== The Complete First Season The DVD set includes a behind- the-scenes featurette with new interviews with first-season Clark Kent/Superboy actor John Haymes Newton, actors Stacy Haiduk and James Calvert, creative/executive producer Ilya Salkind as well as director David Nutter. The DVD also features the screen test of John Haymes Newton and audio commentaries by Ilya Salkind and Newton on two key episodes (\\"Revenge of the Alien\\" Part 2 and \\"Meet Mr. Mxyzptlk\\"). The DVD was released in advance of the film Superman Returns. The Complete Second Season On December 5, 2012, after a six- and-a-half years gap, Warner Bros. announced they would release the complete second season of Superboy on DVD via its Warner Archive Collection, which occurred on December 11, 2012. This is a manufacture-on-demand (MOD) release, available exclusively through Warner's online store and only in the US, as well as Amazon.com through their CreateSpace service, which ships globally. The Complete Third Season On July 10, 2013, Warner Bros. stated that they would release the complete third season of Superboy, which occurred on July 16, 2013, via MOD, through the Warner Archive, as well as Amazon.com through their CreateSpace service, which ships globally. The Complete Fourth Season On October 26, 2013, the fourth season was listed at warnerarchive.com for an October 29, 2013 release date. For a limited time, copies of the DVD set were autographed by series star Gerard Christopher; the non-autographed version becomes available upon exhaustion of the autographed inventory. It is also available from Amazon.com through their CreateSpace service, which ships globally. ==Streaming== All four seasons were made available in 2018 for streaming on DC Universe, a paid streaming subscription specializing in DC Comics-related content. As the original series was shot on videotape, these episodes are presented in standard definition at their original 4:3 display ratio. ==ReferencesFurther reading== * Daniels, Les. \\"Superboy On TV\\".

Pope John XXIII named him Cardinal Secretary of State and, in this position the most prominent member of the Roman Curia in Vatican City. ==Early life== He attended the Angelo Braschi School and entered the Pontifical Roman Seminary in 1903 from which he graduated with honours in philosophy and theology.Casula, Nota Biografica IX 21 September 1912 he was ordained a priest. He accepted a call to teach liturgy and theology at the Roman Seminary and the Collegio Urbano of the Propaganda Fide. In 1923, he was nominated by Pope Pius XI to be general assistant of the Catholic Action movement. In 1925, the Pope nominated him to a second organisation, Societa della Gioventu Cattolica Italiana. From 1921 onward, he worked as well in the Congregation of Ordinary Ecclesiastical Affairs where he was named Sustituto in 1929 and Secretary in 1937. With Giovanni Battista Montini, he was the main assistant to Cardinal Secretary of State Eugenio Pacelli until 1939. == Secretariat of State == After his election as Pope Pius XII, Pacelli appointed Luigi Maglione as his successor as Cardinal Secretary of State. Maglione did not exercise the influence of his predecessor, who as Pope continued his close relation with Monsignori Giovanni Battista Montini and Tardini. After the death of Maglione in 1944, Pius left the position vacant and named Tardini head of its foreign section and Montini head of the internal section.Congregation of Extraordinary Ecclesiastical Affairs and Congregation of Ordinary Affairs Tardini and Montini continued serving there until 1952, when Pius XII decided to elevate both of them into the College of CardinalsPio XII,455; an honour which both turned down. When Tardini thanked him for not appointing him, Pius XII replied with a smile: *\\"Monsignore mio, you thank me, for not letting me do what I wanted to do. I replied, \\"Yes Holy Father, I thank you for everything you have done for me, but even more, what you have not done for me. The Pope smiled. Tardini, 157 In November 1952, he was named Pro-Secretary of the State for Extraordinary Ecclesiastical Affairs by Pope Pius XII, essentially co-serving as functional Secretary of State with Giovanni Battista Montini, who became Pro-Secretary of State for Ordinary Ecclesiastical Affairs. In addition they were granted the privilege to wear Episcopal Insignia.Giulio Nicolini, 313 Tardini continued in that position until the death of Pius XII. Tardini loved children and \\"adopted\\" the orphans of Villa Nazareth, for whom he organised recognition and assistance. Televised audiences with Pope Pius XII, and visits of Pope John XXIII and high-ranking foreign dignitaries, all arranged by Tardini, facilitated fundraising for the needy children. ==Papabile and Cardinal Secretary of State== After the death of Pope Pius on 9 October 1958, Tardini, though not a cardinal and not even a bishop, was prominently mentioned as a possible successor because of his familiarity with and closeness to Pius XII.Associated Press (AP) Rome, 9 October 1958 Instead, Tardini was named Secretary of State by the newly elected Pope John XXIII, filling the previous vacancy. Having declined being made Cardinal by Pius XII in 1953, he accepted the red hat in the consistory of 15 December 1958 with the title of Cardinal- Deacon of S. Apollinare alle Terme Neroniane-Alessandrine. He was ordained as a titular archbishop later that month. Tardini did not seek the honour of the appointment. On the very night of the election or as the first papal appointment next morning (biographers differ on this)Hebblethwaite, 289 Tardini was asked to see the new Pope John XXIII, who asked him to become his Secretary of State. He went reluctantly: *He did not give me any choice. I told the Holy Father, that I would not serve under him, because new policies would need new people. I reminded him that I frequently disagreed with him in the past. I reminded him that I was tired and worn out and that my health was getting worse. I told him about my long cherished ambition of at last giving myself entirely to the orphan boys of Villa Nazareth. It made no difference. The Pope listened to me with kindness and interest but to every point he replied, I understand but I want you to be my Secretary of State. Finally I knelt down and offered him my obedience. Nicolini 177-17 As Secretary of State, Tardini broke the taboo on discussing Vatican finances in October 1959, holding a press conference with Vatican-accredited journalists during a pay dispute with Vatican employees.Pollard, 2005, 1‚Äì2. On 20 January 1959, Pope John summoned Cardinal Tardini to float the idea of an Ecumenical Council. It would involve all bishops of every rite. Tardini's response was positive to the point that the Pope was surprised.Zizola, 316 John XXIII later referred to this discussion as the decisive moment for his decision to hold an ecumenical council.Hebblethwaite, 317 He assisted in the preparation of the Council giving at times his own interpretation of the forthcoming epochal event. Reportedly, he tried to resign several times for health reasons but was asked to stay on by the disarmingly witty John XXIII . Tardini died in Rome on 30 July 1961 of a massive heart attack. He was buried in the Carmel at Vetralla. At the first anniversary of his death, Pope John XXIII left the Vatican to pay his respects at his burial site.Hebblethwaite, 414 ==Writings== *Domenico Tardini, Leone XIII, Le glorie de un pontificato, Nel venticinquesimo della morte, Roma 1928 *Domenico Tardini, Diario inedito (1933‚Äì1936) Manoscrito, 1936 *Domenico Tardini, San Tommaso d‚ÄôAquino e la Romanita, 1937 *Domenico Tardini, Gioachino Belli poeta delle plebe di Roma, 1941 *Domenico Cardinale Tardini, Pio XII, Tipografia Poliglotta Vaticana, 1960 == Honours == * 1935: Grand Officer in the Order of Leopold.http://www.odis.be/lnk/AE_6077 ==Literature== *Carlo Felice Casula, Domenico Tardini 1888 ‚Äì 1961, Edizione Studium Roma, Roma, 1988 *Peter Hebblethwaite, John XXIII, Pope of the Council, Revised Edition, HarperCollins, London, 1994 *Pascalina Lehnert, Ich durfte Ihm Dienen, Erinnerungen an Papst Pius XII., Naumann, W√ºrzburg, 1984 *Giulio Nicolini, Il Cardinale Domenico Tardini, Messagero, Padova, *Pio XII, La Allocuzione nel consistorio Segreto del 12 Gennaio 1953 in Pio XII, Discorsi e Radiomessagi di Sua Santita, Vatican City, 1953 *John F.

Typically, lightning discharges 30,000 amperes, at up to 100 million volts, and emits light, radio waves, x-rays and even gamma rays.See Flashes in the Sky: Earth's Gamma-Ray Bursts Triggered by Lightning Plasma temperatures in lightning can approach 28,000 kelvins. Atmospheric electricity is the study of electrical charges in the Earth's atmosphere (or that of another planet). The movement of charge between the Earth's surface, the atmosphere, and the ionosphere is known as the global atmospheric electrical circuit. Atmospheric electricity is an interdisciplinary topic with a long history, involving concepts from electrostatics, atmospheric physics, meteorology and Earth science. Thunderstorms act as a giant battery in the atmosphere, charging up the electrosphere to about 400,000 volts with respect to the surface. This sets up an electric field throughout the atmosphere, which decreases with increase in altitude. Atmospheric ions created by cosmic rays and natural radioactivity move in the electric field, so a very small current flows through the atmosphere, even away from thunderstorms. Near the surface of the earth, the magnitude of the field is on average around 100 V/m. Atmospheric electricity involves both thunderstorms, which create lightning bolts to rapidly discharge huge amounts of atmospheric charge stored in storm clouds, and the continual electrification of the air due to ionization from cosmic rays and natural radioactivity, which ensure that the atmosphere is never quite neutral. ==History== Sparks drawn from electrical machines and from Leyden jars suggested to the early experimenters, Hauksbee, Newton, Wall, Nollet, and Gray, that lightning was caused by electric discharges. In 1708, Dr. William Wall was one of the first to observe that spark discharges resembled miniature lightning, after observing the sparks from a charged piece of amber. Benjamin Franklin's experiments showed that electrical phenomena of the atmosphere were not fundamentally different from those produced in the laboratory, by listing many similarities between electricity and lightning. By 1749, Franklin observed lightning to possess almost all the properties observable in electrical machines. In July 1750, Franklin hypothesized that electricity could be taken from clouds via a tall metal aerial with a sharp point. Before Franklin could carry out his experiment, in 1752 Thomas-Fran√ßois Dalibard erected a iron rod at Marly-la-Ville, near Paris, drawing sparks from a passing cloud. With ground-insulated aerials, an experimenter could bring a grounded lead with an insulated wax handle close to the aerial, and observe a spark discharge from the aerial to the grounding wire. In May 1752, Dalibard affirmed that Franklin's theory was correct. Around June 1752, Franklin reportedly performed his famous kite experiment. The kite experiment was repeated by Romas, who drew from a metallic string sparks long, and by Cavallo, who made many important observations on atmospheric electricity. Lemonnier (1752) also reproduced Franklin's experiment with an aerial, but substituted the ground wire with some dust particles (testing attraction). He went on to document the fair weather condition, the clear-day electrification of the atmosphere, and its diurnal variation. Beccaria (1775) confirmed Lemonnier's diurnal variation data and determined that the atmosphere's charge polarity was positive in fair weather. Saussure (1779) recorded data relating to a conductor's induced charge in the atmosphere. Saussure's instrument (which contained two small spheres suspended in parallel with two thin wires) was a precursor to the electrometer. Saussure found that the atmospheric electrification under clear weather conditions had an annual variation, and that it also varied with height. In 1785, Coulomb discovered the electrical conductivity of air. His discovery was contrary to the prevailing thought at the time, that the atmospheric gases were insulators (which they are to some extent, or at least not very good conductors when not ionized). Erman (1804) theorized that the Earth was negatively charged, and Peltier (1842) tested and confirmed Erman's idea. Several researchers contributed to the growing body of knowledge about atmospheric electrical phenomena. Francis Ronalds began observing the potential gradient and air-earth currents around 1810, including making continuous automated recordings. He resumed his research in the 1840s as the inaugural Honorary Director of the Kew Observatory, where the first extended and comprehensive dataset of electrical and associated meteorological parameters was created. He also supplied his equipment to other facilities around the world with the goal of delineating atmospheric electricity on a global scale. Kelvin's new water dropper collector and divided-ring electrometer were introduced at Kew Observatory in the 1860s, and atmospheric electricity remained a speciality of the observatory until its closure. For high-altitude measurements, kites were once used, and weather balloons or aerostats are still used, to lift experimental equipment into the air. Early experimenters even went aloft themselves in hot-air balloons. Hoffert (1888) identified individual lightning downward strokes using early cameras.Proceedings of the Physical Society: Volumes 9-10.

Elster and Geitel, who also worked on thermionic emission, proposed a theory to explain thunderstorms' electrical structure (1885) and, later, discovered atmospheric radioactivity (1899) from the existence of positive and negative ions in the atmosphere.

Discoveries about the electrification of the atmosphere via sensitive electrical instruments and ideas on how the Earth's negative charge is maintained were developed mainly in the 20th century, with CTR Wilson playing an important part.Encyclopedia of Geomagnetism and Paleomagnetism - Page 359 Current research on atmospheric electricity focuses mainly on lightning, particularly high-energy particles and transient luminous events, and the role of non-thunderstorm electrical processes in weather and climate. ==Description== Atmospheric electricity is always present, and during fine weather away from thunderstorms, the air above the surface of Earth is positively charged, while the Earth's surface charge is negative. It can be understood in terms of a difference of potential between a point of the Earth's surface, and a point somewhere in the air above it. Because the atmospheric electric field is negatively directed in fair weather, the convention is to refer to the potential gradient, which has the opposite sign and is about 100 V/m at the surface. The potential gradient in most locations is much lower than this value because it is an average of the charge built up by every thunderstorm and atmospheric disturbance around the globe. There is a weak conduction current of atmospheric ions moving in the atmospheric electric field, about 2 picoAmperes per square metre, and the air is weakly conductive due to the presence of these atmospheric ions. ===Variations=== Global daily cycles in the atmospheric electric field, with a minimum around 03 UT and peaking roughly 16 hours later, were researched by the Carnegie Institution of Washington in the 20th century. This Carnegie curve variation has been described as \\"the fundamental electrical heartbeat of the planet\\".Atmospheric electricity affects cloud height - physicsworld.com http://physicsworld.com/cws/article/news/2013/mar/06/atmospheric-electricity- affects-cloud-height Even away from thunderstorms, atmospheric electricity can be highly variable, but, generally, the electric field is enhanced in fogs and dust whereas the atmospheric electrical conductivity is diminished. === Links with biology === The atmospheric potential gradient leads to an ion flow from the positively charged atmosphere to the negatively charged earth surface. Over a flat field on a day with clear skies, the atmospheric potential gradient is approximately 120 V/m. Objects protruding these fields, e.g. flowers and trees, can increase the electric field strength to several kilovolts per meter. These near-surface electrostatic forces are detected by organisms such as the bumblebee to navigate to flowers and the spider to initiate dispersal by ballooning. The atmospheric potential gradient is also thought to affect sub-surface electro-chemistry and microbial processes. ===Near space=== The electrosphere layer (from tens of kilometers above the surface of the earth to the ionosphere) has a high electrical conductivity and is essentially at a constant electric potential. The ionosphere is the inner edge of the magnetosphere and is the part of the atmosphere that is ionized by solar radiation. (Photoionization is a physical process in which a photon is incident on an atom, ion or molecule, resulting in the ejection of one or more electrons.) ===Cosmic radiation=== The Earth, and almost all living things on it, are constantly bombarded by radiation from outer space. This radiation primarily consists of positively charged ions from protons to iron and larger nuclei derived sources outside our solar system. This radiation interacts with atoms in the atmosphere to create an air shower of secondary ionising radiation, including X-rays, muons, protons, alpha particles, pions, and electrons. Ionization from this secondary radiation ensures that the atmosphere is weakly conductive, and that the slight current flow from these ions over the Earth's surface balances the current flow from thunderstorms. Ions have characteristic parameters such as mobility, lifetime, and generation rate that vary with altitude. ===Thunderstorms and lightning=== The potential difference between the ionosphere and the Earth is maintained by thunderstorms, with lightning strikes delivering negative charges from the atmosphere to the ground. World map showing frequency of lightning strikes, in flashes per km¬≤ per year (equal-area projection). Lightning strikes most frequently in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Combined 1995‚Äì2003 data from the Optical Transient Detector and 1998‚Äì2003 data from the Lightning Imaging Sensor. Collisions between ice and soft hail (graupel) inside cumulonimbus clouds causes separation of positive and negative charges within the cloud, essential for the generation of lightning. How lightning initially forms is still a matter of debate: Scientists have studied root causes ranging from atmospheric perturbations (wind, humidity, and atmospheric pressure) to the impact of solar wind and energetic particles. An average bolt of lightning carries a negative electric current of 40 kiloamperes (kA) (although some bolts can be up to 120 kA), and transfers a charge of five coulombs and energy of 500 MJ, or enough energy to power a 100-watt lightbulb for just under two months. The voltage depends on the length of the bolt, with the dielectric breakdown of air being three million volts per meter, and lightning bolts often being several hundred meters long. However, lightning leader development is not a simple matter of dielectric breakdown, and the ambient electric fields required for lightning leader propagation can be a few orders of magnitude less than dielectric breakdown strength. Further, the potential gradient inside a well-developed return-stroke channel is on the order of hundreds of volts per meter or less due to intense channel ionization, resulting in a true power output on the order of megawatts per meter for a vigorous return-stroke current of 100 kA . If the quantity of water that is condensed in and subsequently precipitated from a cloud is known, then the total energy of a thunderstorm can be calculated. In an average thunderstorm, the energy released amounts to about 10,000,000 kilowatt-hours (3.6 joule), which is equivalent to a 20-kiloton nuclear warhead. A large, severe thunderstorm might be 10 to 100 times more energetic. Lightning sequence (Duration: 0.32 seconds) ===Corona discharges=== A depiction of atmospheric electricity in a Martian dust storm, which has been suggested as a possible explanation for enigmatic chemistry results from Mars (see also Viking lander biological experiments) St. Elmo's Fire is an electrical phenomenon in which luminous plasma is created by a coronal discharge originating from a grounded object. Ball lightning is often erroneously identified as St. Elmo's Fire, whereas they are separate and distinct phenomena.Barry, J.D. (1980a) Ball Lightning and Bead Lightning: Extreme Forms of Atmospheric Electricity. 8‚Äì9. New York and London: Plenum Press. Although referred to as \\"fire\\", St. Elmo's Fire is, in fact, plasma, and is observed, usually during a thunderstorm, at the tops of trees, spires or other tall objects, or on the heads of animals, as a brush or star of light. Corona is caused by the electric field around the object in question ionizing the air molecules, producing a faint glow easily visible in low-light conditions. Approximately 1,000 ‚Äì 30,000 volts per centimetre is required to induce St. Elmo's Fire; however, this is dependent on the geometry of the object in question. Sharp points tend to require lower voltage levels to produce the same result because electric fields are more concentrated in areas of high curvature, thus discharges are more intense at the end of pointed objects. St. Elmo's Fire and normal sparks both can appear when high electrical voltage affects a gas. St. Elmo's fire is seen during thunderstorms when the ground below the storm is electrically charged, and there is high voltage in the air between the cloud and the ground. The voltage tears apart the air molecules and the gas begins to glow. The nitrogen and oxygen in the Earth's atmosphere causes St. Elmo's Fire to fluoresce with blue or violet light; this is similar to the mechanism that causes neon signs to glow. ===Earth-Ionosphere cavity=== The Schumann resonances are a set of spectrum peaks in the extremely low frequency (ELF) portion of the Earth's electromagnetic field spectrum. Schumann resonance is due to the space between the surface of the Earth and the conductive ionosphere acting as a waveguide. The limited dimensions of the earth cause this waveguide to act as a resonant cavity for electromagnetic waves. The cavity is naturally excited by energy from lightning strikes. === Electrical system grounding === Atmospheric charges can cause undesirable, dangerous, and potentially lethal charge potential buildup in suspended electric wire power distribution systems. Bare wires suspended in the air spanning many kilometers and isolated from the ground can collect very large stored charges at high voltage, even when there is no thunderstorm or lightning occurring. This charge will seek to discharge itself through the path of least insulation, which can occur when a person reaches out to activate a power switch or to use an electric device. To dissipate atmospheric charge buildup, one side of the electrical distribution system is connected to the earth at many points throughout the distribution system, as often as on every support pole. The one earth-connected wire is commonly referred to as the \\"protective earth\\", and provides path for the charge potential to dissipate without causing damage, and provides redundancy in case any one of the ground paths is poor due to corrosion or poor ground conductivity. The additional electric grounding wire that carries no power serves a secondary role, providing a high-current short-circuit path to rapidly blow fuses and render a damaged device safe, rather than have an ungrounded device with damaged insulation become \\"electrically live\\" via the grid power supply, and hazardous to touch. Each transformer in an alternating current distribution grid segments the grounding system into a new separate circuit loop. These separate grids must also be grounded on one side to prevent charge buildup within them relative to the rest of the system, and which could cause damage from charge potentials discharging across the transformer coils to the other grounded side of the distribution network. == See also == ;General: *Atmospheric physics *Ionosphere *Air quality *Lightning rocket ;Electromagnetism: *Earth's magnetic field *Sprites and lightning *Whistler (radio) *Telluric current ;Other: *Electrodynamic tether *Solar radiation ==References and external articlesCitations and notes=Other reading=== * Richard E.

He played for Newcastle United, West Ham United, Sunderland, Chelsea and Carlisle United, and scored 265 goals in 674 league games. He also earned one cap for England under-23s. ==Playing careerEarly career=== Born in Sunderland, County Durham, Robson played for Clara Vale in his youth. His first senior club was Newcastle United, and whilst there he won the Second Division title in 1964‚Äì65 and the 1969 Fairs Cup, forming a productive partnership with Welshman Wyn Davies. ===West Ham United and Sunderland=== In February 1971 he became West Ham United's record purchase when he signed for ¬£120,000. He scored on his debut against Nottingham Forest on 24 February 1971. He was West Ham's leading scorer in two of his three seasons at Upton Park. He made a return to the North-East to join Sunderland in July 1974 for ¬£145,000. He rejoined West Ham in October 1976. During his two spells at West Ham, he made 254 appearances, scoring 104 goals. He returned to Roker Park in June 1979 for ¬£45,000, and was to eventually play for Sunderland in three separate stints, his goals twice helping them to promotion, as Football League Second Division champions 1976 and runners-up in 1980. ===Carlisle and Chelsea=== Robson was employed as a player/coach by Carlisle United and Chelsea, and at Sunderland during his third spell there. He even stepped in as caretaker manager for one game during the 1983‚Äì84 season before the arrival of Len Ashurst. In 1982 Carlisle managed promotion back to the Second Division with a young Peter Beardsley alongside Robson in attack. ===Third spells at Sunderland and Carlisle United=== Robson is remembered by the Sunderland fans for the rescue act on the last day of the 1983‚Äì84 season at Leicester City. Recalled to lead the front line at the age of 38 years and 182 days, he scored his last ever goal for Sunderland in a 2‚Äì0 win that saved the team from relegation. In his three stays at the club he amassed 174 appearances (10 from the bench) and 67 goals. He also managed the club as caretaker for a single game in 1984 following the sacking of Alan Durban. He finished his Football League career with a third spell at Carlisle, and in total he made 674 Football League appearances and scored 265 goals. Robson briefly played for non-league Gateshead after leaving Carlisle, scoring one goal during his stint at the club in 1985‚Äì86. ==Coaching career== After finishing playing with Carlisle he coached at Hartlepool United, Manchester United, Leeds United and finally Sunderland until May 2004. In July 2011, Robson joined his former club Sunderland as the new chief scout. In April 2013, Ellis Short, Sunderland's chairman and owner, sacked Robson along with his entire scouting network. ==References== Category:1945 births Category:Living people Category:Sportspeople from Sunderland, Tyne and Wear Category:English footballers Category:England under-23 international footballers Category:Newcastle United F.C. players Category:West Ham United F.C. players Category:Sunderland A.F.C. players Category:Carlisle United F.C. players Category:Chelsea F.C. players Category:Gateshead F.C. players Category:English Football League players Category:First Division/Premier League top scorers Category:English football managers Category:Sunderland A.F.C. managers Category:Carlisle United F.C. managers Category:English Football League managers Category:Hartlepool United F.C. non-playing staff Category:Manchester United F.C. non-playing staff Category:Sunderland A.F.C. non-playing staff Category:Footballers from Tyne and Wear Category:English Football League representative players Category:Association football forwards ","title":"Pop Robson"},{"id":"2222656","text":"Craighall Park is a suburb of Johannesburg, South Africa.

It is the third installment in the Rush Hour series. Announced on May 7, 2006, filming began on July 4 on location in Paris and Los Angeles. Released on August 10, 2007, the film received mixed reviews from critics, and grossed $258 million worldwide against a $140 million budget. After the commercial success of the first and second films in the franchise, Tucker received a salary of $25 million for his role in the film, as well as 20% of the film's profits. ==Plot== 10 years after the events of Rush Hour 2, Chinese Ambassador Solon Han, with Hong Kong Police Force Chief Inspector Lee as his bodyguard, addresses the importance of fighting the Triads at the World Criminal Court in Los Angeles. There, he starts to announce the whereabouts of Shy Shen, a semi- mythical individual of great importance to the Chinese mob, but an assassin snipes him, causing a panic. Lee corners the shooter, only to learn it is his childhood Japanese foster brother, Kenji. Lee hesitates, inadvertently allowing Kenji to escape just as LAPD Detective James Carter arrives after learning what happened over the police radio. Despite Han surviving the assassination attempt, Lee and Carter promise his daughter Soo Yung to find the person responsible. Upon her insistence, the pair head to the local Kung Fu studio to retrieve an envelope Han left her, but learn from the studio master that the Triads took Soo Yung's belongings. Lee and Carter return to the hospital and intercept a gang of French-speaking assassins before they can kill Han. After defeating them, they interrogate one of them with the help of Sister Agnes, a French-speaking nun. For her protection, they take Soo Yung to the French Embassy and leave her with French ambassador and chairman of the World Criminal Court, Varden Reynard. When Reynard and Soo Yung are nearly killed by a car bomb, Lee and Carter head to Paris to investigate further. After a painful encounter with Parisian Commissaire Revi, Lee and Carter meet anti-American taxi driver, George, and force him to drive them to a Triad hideout. While there, Carter meets stage performer Genevi√®ve while Lee is tricked by mob assassin Jasmine, who claims to have information about Shy Shen, though Carter saves him from being killed. The pair try to escape, but are ultimately captured by Kenji's men. Kenji offers to let them live if they leave Paris, but Lee refuses and following a short struggle, he and Carter successfully escape. The duo recuperate at a hotel, where Lee reveals his relationship with Kenji and decides to continue alone. A disillusioned Carter leaves, but recomposes himself when he spots and follows Genevi√®ve. Meanwhile, Reynard meets Lee and reveals that Shy Shen is not a person, but a list of Triad leaders and that Genevi√®ve is Han's informant with access to the list. After locating Genevi√®ve and saving her from an assassination attempt, the two flee to their hotel. They are attacked by Jasmine, but George rescues them out of a newfound admiration for Americans. Genevi√®ve reveals to Lee and Carter that the Triad leaders' names were tattooed on the back of her head and that she will be beheaded if the Triads capture her. When Lee and Carter bring Genevi√®ve to Reynard, they discover he was working with the Triads the entire time. Kenji calls to inform Lee that he has captured Soo Yung and demands he turn over Genevi√®ve. Lee arrives at the Eiffel Tower to make the exchange, with Carter disguised as Genevi√®ve with a wig. Kenji challenges Lee to a sword fight, during which the two fall into a safety net. After Kenji's sword cuts the net, Lee tries to save him, but Kenji lets go, falling to his death. Meanwhile, Carter saves Soo Yung and defeats Jasmine, who is killed after getting stuck in an elevator wheel. After escaping the remaining Triad members, Carter and Lee are confronted by Reynard, who threatens to kill Genevi√®ve and frame them. However, George shoots Reynard from behind, killing him.

Box Office Mojo noted: The film grossed $258 million worldwide. ===Critical response=== On Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 18% based on 158 reviews, with an average rating of 4.2/10. The site's critical consensus reads, \\"Rush Hour 3 is a tired rehash of earlier films, and a change of scenery can't hide a lack of new ideas.\\" Todd Gilchrist of IGN movies said, \\"A movie that not only depends on but demands you don't think in order to enjoy it.\\"https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/rush_hour_3 On Metacritic, the film has a score of 44 out of 100, based on 32 critics, indicating \\"mixed or average reviews\\". Audiences surveyed by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \\"A-\\" on an A+ to F scale. Desson Thomson of The Washington Post, giving it three and a half stars out of five, said \\"at the risk of eternal damnation on the Internet, I admit to laughing at -- even feeling momentarily touched by -- Rush Hour 3.\\" Christian Toto of The Washington Times said, \\"The Rush job should put the franchise down for good.\\" Christopher Tookey of the Daily Mail said, \\"Infecting this third movie is an extra, deeply unpleasant level of racism that we haven't seen before in the series.\\" Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times was slightly more positive giving the film two stars and saying, \\"...once you realize it's only going to be so good, you settle back and enjoy that modest degree of goodness, which is at least not badness, and besides, if you're watching Rush Hour 3, you obviously didn't have anything better to do, anyway.\\" James Berardinelli of ReelViews gave the film one-and-a-half stars out of four, and said the movie was dull, uninspired and redundant. ===Home media=== The film was released on December 26, 2007,The DVD release date of Rush Hour 3 varies, as it was seen in Wal-Mart stores on December 22, 2007, while in advertisements for other stores it was not scheduled for release until December 26. on DVD and Blu-ray.

As of 2018, the film has grossed in American DVD sales. ==Sequel== Because of the film's box office success, director Brett Ratner and writer Jeff Nathanson are considering the production of a fourth film in the Rush Hour series. In the DVD audio commentary for Rush Hour 3, Brett Ratner jokes that a Rush Hour 4 could be released in the future. Ratner and Nathanson are exploring many concepts, including the use of the motion capture technique for the possible sequel and various film projects with Chan and Tucker. It has been reported that the fourth film may be set in Moscow. In May 2011, in an interview with Vulture, Ratner stated that the high cost of making a sequel is, \\"why another Rush Hour probably won‚Äôt get made, either: It'd be too much to pay me, Chris [Tucker], and Jackie [Chan] to come back.\\" In an interview on May 12, 2012, with The Arizona Republic, Jackie Chan revealed that he was still planning on sequels to both Rush Hour and The Karate Kid. ==See also== * Jackie Chan filmography ==NotesReferences* * * Category:2007 films Category:Films shot in Paris Category:Films set in Paris Category:Paris in fiction Category:Films shot in Los Angeles Category:Films set in Los Angeles Category:Films set in 2007 Category:2007 action comedy films Category:2007 martial arts films Category:American action comedy films Category:American buddy cop films Category:American films Category:American martial arts films Category:American sequel films Category:Police detective films Category:Films directed by Brett Ratner Category:French films Category:2000s martial arts comedy films Category:New Line Cinema films Category:Spyglass Entertainment films Category:Triad films Category:Films scored by Lalo Schifrin Category:Films produced by Roger Birnbaum Category:2000s police comedy films Category:2000s buddy cop films Category:Films with screenplays by Jeff Nathanson Category:Rush Hour (franchise) Category:2007 comedy films ","title":"Rush Hour 3"},{"id":"2222701","text":"Edenburg is a suburb of Johannesburg, South Africa.

Ferndale on Republic is the new name of the old Randburg Waterfront and later known as the Brightwater Commons. Originally opened in 1996, the Randburg Waterfront was a wharf style entertainment venue with a large man-made lake at the centre. One of the biggest attractions at the centre was the musical fountain, with choreographed displays to many different musical favourites. After the decline of the Randburg Waterfront, the centre underwent a major refurbishment and re-opened at The Brightwater Commons in 2008. The man-made lake was replaced with a much smaller pond and a smaller version of the musical fountain. The rest of the inside area was converted to a garden with trees, with a flea market at the centre. This enjoyed mediocre success, and was sold again, now being re-branded as Ferndale on Republic.

BGE earlier had created the holding company Constellation Energy in 1999. Constellation Energy was acquired by Exelon in 2012. Headquartered in Baltimore, BGE provides service to more than 1.2 million electric customers and more than 650,000 natural gas customers in central Maryland. BGE employs 3,100 people in the state of Maryland, making the company one of the 15 largest private employers in the region. ==History== Artist / sculptor /museum operator Rembrandt Peale, (1778-1860), incorporated the \\"Gas Light Company of Baltimore\\" on June 17, 1816, after having exhibited gas lighting at his Holliday Street museum which was designed by famed local architect Robert Cary Long, Jr., built and opened in 1814 (between East Saratoga and East Lexington Streets - after a variety of uses including as Baltimore's City Hall, 1830-1875, later in 1931 to become the Municipal Museum of the City of Baltimore, popularly known once again as the Peale Museum into 1997) ; this was the first gas company in the Americas. The first streetlamp installed by the Gas Light Company of Baltimore stood at the corner of North Holliday and East Baltimore streets and was lit on February 7, 1817. By February 1818, only 28 gas-lit lamps existed. The Belvidere Theatre became the first public building to be lit using gas. Over the next decades the company experimented with piping, meters, and other mechanical technology. Baltimore committed to gas for municipal use, including the installation of gas service in all public markets between by 1851. Private subscription also steadily increased; by 1870, the company had 15,301 customers in Baltimore. In 1955, the company rebranded to become Baltimore Gas and Electric, and began to recognize the acronym BGE sometime during the 1990s. Baltimore Gas and Electric is under common control with Maryland's second and third largest electric utilities after the Maryland Public Service Commission approved the acquisition of Pepco Holdings by Exelon in 2015. The acquisition of Pepco Holdings by Exelon was completed in 2016. == Controversies == BGE has routinely been reported for failing to meet safety standards and service equipment failures. The Public Service Commission released a report stating: \\"Based on the response and evidence submitted by BGE, Staff concludes that BGE failed to provide for safe operation and maintenance of the facilities\\" following a 2019 gas explosion in Columbia, Maryland which destroyed a 57,000 square-foot commercial building. === 2020 gas explosion === On August 10th, 2020 at approximately 9:54 AM (EDT) a major natural gas explosion leveled 3 homes in Reisterstown Station on the 4200 block of Labyrinth Road, trapping multiple people, killing two and injuring seven. Representatives for BGE stated the cause of the explosion is unknown. ==Operations== BGE's electric service territory includes Baltimore City and all part of the Central Maryland counties including: Anne Arundel, Baltimore, Calvert, Carroll, Harford, and Howard counties BGE is a member of two shared- crew networks in the southeast and mid-Atlantic regions, and frequently sends crews to help restore power to customers across those regions after severe weather events. The utility has dealt with major outages following meteorological events in the mid-Atlantic region, including the derecho of June 2012 and Hurricane Sandy in October of the same year. In the aftermath of Hurricane Sandy, BGE restored power to more than 300,000 customers. The utility has proposed the construction and operation of microgrids, capable of generating and distributing electricity during larger outages to the centralized electrical grid; however, in July 2016, the Maryland Public Service Commission rejected BGE's request to construct microgrids. In 2012, the company began replacing analog electric meters with smart meters to create a more cost effective smart grid system. In June 2016, the Maryland Public Service Commission turned down BGE's request for a rate increase to recover the $48 million cost of installing smart meters, granting them instead an increase that was only 50% of what the utility requested. The $2.80 rate increase went into effect in June 2016 and raised BGE customers‚Äô average electric bill to $134.33 per month. In October 2015, BGE filed a lawsuit against the city of Baltimore over the city's attempt to increase the fee it charges the utility for the use of its underground conduit system. In November 2016, BGE and the city settled the suit, with the utility accepting an increase to $24 million a year to use the city's long conduit system. ==Community== Through its Green Grants program, BGE offers grants of up to $10,000 to environmental non-profits in central Maryland. Since 2013, the company has awarded more than $1 million through the program. Past recipients include: * 4-H Chesapeake Bay Stewards Program * Project Clean Stream and Clean Water Communities * Rainscape and Environmental Educational Program * Bio-science Educational Program and Outreach * Fall Free Tree Giveaway * Increasing Tree Canopy Projects * Recycling days * Neighborhood Beautification * A Green Place to Play * Community Wildlife Habitat * Fresh Fruit Farm In 2015, BGE launched a program that allows customers to report osprey nests on or near electrical lines. The company then insulates or moves the nest to platforms. In the program's first year, learned of 23 nests built on electrical equipment. As part of BGE's bicentennial celebration in 2016, the company added large, decorative murals to the three large storage tanks on its Spring Gardens campus in south Baltimore. BGE also partnered with the Cal Ripken, Sr. Foundation in 2016 to construct Eddie Murray Field in west Baltimore. ==References== Category:Companies based in Baltimore Category:American companies established in 1816 Category:Energy companies established in 1816 Category:Natural gas companies of the United States Category:Electric power companies of the United States Category:1816 establishments in Maryland Category:Exelon ","title":"Baltimore Gas and Electric"},{"id":"2222744","text":"Glen Athol is a suburb of Johannesburg, South Africa.

The complex also provided studio space for channel continuity. The site was run by the Pinewood Studios Group. Pinewood Group's lease on Teddington Studios expired in 2014. The studios are being demolished to be turned into housing, with programmes made there having moved to other facilities. The studio buildings will be replaced by three modern apartment blocks and other smaller houses, with the view towards the river from Broom Road opened up. ==History== The studio began in the early 20th century as film studios when stockbroker Henry Chinnery, owner of Weir House, Teddington, allowed filmmakers to use his greenhouse as a studio. Dedicated studio facilities were then built in the 1910s. The studio was greatly expanded by a partnership of filmmaker E. G. Norman and actor Henry Edwards, and renamed Teddington Film Studios Limited in 1931. After only one production, Stranglehold (1931), the studio was acquired by Warner Brothers to turn out so-called \\"quota quickies\\" ‚Äì British-made films which fulfilled a legal quota (created by the Cinematograph Films Act 1927) before American-made films could be shown. Warner Bros.-First National continued to make US/UK coproductions at Teddington until The Dark Tower (1943). One Teddington Studios production Murder at Monte Carlo (1934) with Errol Flynn in his first major film role, is considered a lost film. The studio was seriously damaged in a V-2 attack in July 1944, in which Jack L. Warner's studio manager, and family member, Doc Salomon was killed while recording the attack. By the 1950s the studio's fortunes had declined, but in 1958 it was bought by Associated British Corporation (ABC) for use as a television studio. When ABC was replaced by Thames Television (in which ABC's parent company had a 51% stake), Teddington Studios became the main production centre for Thames's entertainment programming (e.g. gameshows, children's programmes, dramas and comedy), while documentary shows, news and sports programming were made at Thames's Euston Road headquarters. After Thames lost its ITV franchise to Carlton Television, which took over in 1993, the studio became independent. Without a major broadcaster or studio group owning the studios, their future was questioned (as Carlton was going to commission most of its entertainment programming from independent producers), but it survived and stayed independent for 13 years, when in 2005, the Pinewood Studios Group bought the complex for ¬£2.7m. Teddington was also the home of British TV Casino show Smart Live Casino until they moved to Picadilly Studios. The media company Haymarket owned the Teddington Studios site from 2004 and occupied some of it from 2006. Part of the site was leased to Pinewood until 2014. Haymarket announced in June 2013 that it planned to redevelop the site into homes, meaning the end of Teddington Studios. In February 2016 it was reported that the site was being demolished to make way for a 213-flat development, the land having been sold to Singaporean firm City Developers for a reputed ¬£80 million. ==TV studios and facilities== The site consisted of 8 studios in total, as well as post-production editing facilities. ===Studio 1=== Studio 1 was Teddington's largest studio at nearly . It was a fully digital widescreen studio, with audience seating for 500, making it popular for programmes such as Harry Hill's TV Burp for ITV and sitcoms The Green Green Grass, After You've Gone, My Family, My Hero, Reggie Perrin and Not Going Out (all for BBC One). Other notable productions made in Studio 1 included Rainbow (Thames Television for ITV), Pop Idol (ITV), Birds of a Feather (BBC and ITV), one series of Parkinson and Black Books (Channel 4). Historically, many classic series were recorded in Studio 1. These include all of Tommy Cooper's shows produced by Thames Television (1973-1980), The Sooty Show, George and Mildred, Man About the House and long-running light entertainment series such as This is Your Life and Opportunity Knocks. The final four series made by Morecambe and Wise were also produced at Teddington's Studio 1 by Thames Television. ===Studio 2=== Studio 2 measured nearly and has been the home to shows such as the early series of The Sooty Show, Today with Des and Mel for ITV, Kilroy for the BBC and the first series of Trisha after moving to Channel 5. This studio was popular for programmes which required intimate medium-sized space, like Bremner, Bird and Fortune for Channel 4. ===Studio 3=== Studio 3 was a much smaller studio at and was home to many music shows productions and television commercials. It was also the regular studio used for Rainbow. ===Studio 4=== Studio 4 was a small studio at . CBeebies used the studio before moving back to BBC Television Centre in 2010 and then moving to MediaCityUK in 2011. ===Studio 5=== Another small studio, Studio 5 was home to The Chinese Channel. ===Studio 6=== Until early 2008, this was a small studio at . ===Studio 7=== Built on the site of the prop store for Studio 2, this small studio was built within weeks for participation TV channel QuizCall, whose content is produced using widescreen cameras.

Upper Houghton has been declared a National Heritage Area. Upper and Lower Houghton are separated by the East-West section of Houghton Drive and part of Louis Botha Avenue. Small sections of Upper Houghton lie east of Louis Botha Avenue (bordering Observatory), and west of the north‚Äìsouth section of Houghton Drive (bordering Parktown and Hillbrow). Houghton is surrounded by wealthy suburbs in all directions, except south, where Upper Houghton borders less-affluent suburbs like Yeoville and Hillbrow. ===Architecture=== Historically a wealthy area, it contains many mansions on big stands, blocks of flats, as well as office parks (developed on the sites of former homes) on streets close to the M1 and on Louis Botha Avenue. Houghton is architecturally varied. There are good examples of art deco buildings (particularly some of the flats), and many of the large houses in the 1930s are good examples of the Modern style inspired by the work of Le Corbusier (Chipkin 1993), including Stern House (1935) designed by Rex Distin Martienssen and partners. The suburb, particularly Lower Houghton, is currently experiencing rapid redevelopment. Although many plots had already been subdivided in two, there is now a trend towards the development of cluster homes.

It is made up of a number of varieties which developed differently in different parts of Australia. These varieties are generally said to fit along a continuum ranging from light forms, close to Standard Australian English, to heavy forms, closer to Kriol.Eades, Diana. \\"Aboriginal English\\", Atlas of languages of intercultural communication in the Pacific, Asia, and the Americas. Mouton de Gruyter, 1996, p. 133‚Äì141. There are generally distinctive features of accent, grammar, words and meanings, as well as language use. AAE is not to be confused with Kriol, which is a separate language from English spoken by over 30,000 people in Australia.Harris, John. \\"Linguistic responses to contact: Pidgins and creoles,\\" The Habitat of Australia's Aboriginal Languages: Past, Present and Future. Mouton de Gruyter, 2007, p. 131‚Äì151. Speakers have been noted to tend to change between different forms of AAE depending on whom they are speaking to, e.g. striving to speak more like Australian English when speaking to a non-Indigenous English-speaking person. Several features of AAE are shared with creole languages spoken in nearby countries, such as Tok Pisin in Papua New Guinea, Pijin in the Solomon Islands, and Bislama in Vanuatu. AAE terms, or derivative terms, are sometimes used by the broader Australian community. Australian Aboriginal English is spoken among Aboriginal people generally, but is especially evident in what are called \\"discrete communities\\", i.e. ex- government or mission reserves such as the DOGIT communities in Queensland. Because most Aboriginal Australians live in urban and rural areas with strong social interaction across assumed rural and urban and remote divides, many urban people also use Aboriginal English. ==GrammarAuxiliary verbs=== Aboriginal English does not make use of auxiliary verbs, such as to be and to have, or copulas to link things together. For example, the Aboriginal English equivalent of \\"We are working\\" would be \\"We workin'\\". Linguists do not regard this as \\"just dropping words out\\", but as a fundamental change to the way in which English is constructed. ===Pronouns=== Although he and him are masculine pronouns in standard English, in Aboriginal English, particularly in northern Australia, it may also be used for females and inanimate objects. The distinction between he as the nominative form and him as the oblique form is not always observed, and him may be found as the subject of a verb. ===\\"Fellow\\"=== In some forms of Aboriginal English, fellow (also spelt fella, feller, fullah, fulla, balla etc.) is used in combination with adjectives or numerals, e.g. big fella business = \\"important business\\", one-feller girl = \\"one girl\\". This can give it an adverbial meaning, e.g. sing out big fella = \\"call out loudly\\". It is also used with pronouns to indicate the plural, e.g. me fella = \\"we\\" or \\"us\\", you fella = \\"you all\\". ==LexiconBalanda=== Balanda is a word used by the Yol≈ãu people for European people; originally from the Makassar language, via the Malay \\"orang belanda\\" (Dutch person). ===Business=== Many Aboriginal people use the word business in a distinct way, to mean matters. Funeral and mourning practices are commonly known as Sorry Business. Financial matters are referred to as Money Business, and the secret- sacred rituals distinct to each sex are referred to as Women's Business and Men's Business. \\"Secret women's business\\" was at the centre of the Hindmarsh Island Bridge controversy. ===Camp=== Many Aboriginal people refer to their house as their camp, particularly in Central Australia and the Top End of the Northern Territory. ===Cheeky=== \\"Cheeky\\" may be used to describe a dog or other animal that is likely to bite or attack. ===Dardy=== Dardy, meaning \\"cool\\", is used amongst South West Australian Aboriginal peoples. This word has also been adopted by non-Indigenous Australian teens, particularly in the skateboarding subculture. Many Australian teens also use the word to describe something worth buying. ===Deadly=== Deadly is used by many Aboriginal people to mean excellent, or very good, in the same way that wicked is by many young English speakers. The Deadlys were awards for outstanding achievement by Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. This usage is not exclusive to Aboriginal people. It is commonly heard in Ireland. ===Gammon=== Victorian era English word for pretend. Still used by some Australian Aboriginal people to mean joking generally. Gammoning ‚Äì usually pronounced Gam'in'. This word is widely used across the Northern Territory of Australia by both Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australians and is now gaining usage elsewhere in Australia. Australian language expert, Sidney J. Baker, lists \\"gammon\\" used by \\"whitefellas\\" as \\"falsehood\\". ===Gubbah=== Gubbah is a term used by some Aboriginal people to refer to white people. The Macquarie Dictionary has it as \\"n. Colloq. (derog.) an Aboriginal term for a white man.\\" Also, \\"gubba, n. Colloq. (derog.) 1. a white man. 2. a peeping tom. [Aboriginal: white demon].\\" It is also said to be a shortening of the word \\"government man\\", which is itself 19th-century slang for \\"convict\\". Another theory is that it is a contraction of \\"Governor\\". It has also been suggested the word is the \\"diminutive of garbage\\".Wilkes, G.A. A Dictionary of Australian Colloquialisms (Sydney: Fontana/Collins, 1978, p. 167 It is often used pejoratively and even considered unreasonably rude within urban Aboriginal circles. ===Humbug=== Whereas humbug in broader English (see Charles Dickens's Scrooge character) means nonsensical, or unimportant information, humbug in Aboriginal English means to pester with inane or repetitive requests. The Warumpi Band's most recent album is entitled Too Much Humbug. In the Northern Territory, humbug is used by both black and white in this latter, Aboriginal way. The most commonly recognised definition of humbug, refers to an Aboriginal person asking a relative for money. Humbugging can become a serious burden where the traditional culture is one of communal ownership and strong obligations between relatives. ===Mob=== Colloquially used to mean a group of Aboriginal people associated with an extended family group, clan group or wider community group, from a particular place or country. It is used to connect and identify the person and where they are from. \\"My mob\\" means my people, or extended family. Mob is often used to refer to a language group, as in that Warlpiri mob. The term is also found in the name of hip-hop group, The Wilcannia Mob, from the town of Wilcannia in New South Wales . === Rubbish=== While \\"rubbish\\" as an adjective in many dialects of English means wrong, stupid, or useless, in the north of Australia, \\"rubbish\\" is usually used to describe someone who is too old or too young to be active in the local culture. Another use is meaning something is \\"not dangerous\\"; for example, non-venomous snakes are all considered to be \\"rubbish\\", while in contrast, venomous snakes are \\"cheeky\\". In both cases, \\"rubbish\\" approximately means \\"inert\\". ===Yarn=== English word for a long story, often with incredible or unbelievable events. Originally a sailors' expression, \\"to spin a yarn\\", in reference to stories told while performing mundane tasks such as spinning yarn. In Australian English, and particularly among Aboriginal people, has become a verb, to talk. Often, Yarnin. ===Unna=== Often conjoined with the word \\"deadly\\", \\"unna\\" means \\"ain't it?\\" This word is used frequently in the 1998 novel Deadly, Unna? by Phillip Gwynne. ==Phonology== Sutton (1989) documents that some speakers of Aboriginal English in the area around Adelaide have an uncommon degree of rhoticity, relative to both other AAE speakers and Standard Australian English speakers (which are generally non-rhotic). These speakers realise /r/ as […π] in the preconsonantal postvocalic position ‚Äì after a vowel but before another a consonant ‚Äì within stems. For example: [boÀê…πd] \\"board\\", [tÃ† É…ú…πtÃ† É] \\"church\\", [p…ú…πŒ∏] \\"Perth\\"; but [fl√¶Àê] \\"flour\\", [d…íkt…ô] \\"doctor\\", [j…™…ôz] \\"years\\". Sutton speculates that this feature may derive from the fact that many of the first settlers in coastal South Australia ‚Äì including Cornish tin-miners, Scottish missionaries, and American whalers ‚Äì spoke rhotic varieties. Many of his informants grew up in Point Pearce and Point McLeay. ==See also== *Australian Aboriginal Pidgin English *Australian English *Australian Aboriginal languages *Kriol *List of English words of Australian Aboriginal origin *Neo-Nyungar *Torres Strait Creole ==References== * * == Further reading == * Category:Australian English Category:English dialects Category:Australian Aboriginal culture ","title":"Australian Aboriginal English"},{"id":"2222772","text":"BGE may refer to: * Basic Global English (BGE), a concept of global English initiated by German linguist Joachim Grzega * Battleground Europe, a video game * Baltimore Gas and Electric * Beyond Good and Evil, a philosophical text by Friedrich Nietzsche * Beyond Good & Evil (video game), a 2003 video game ** Beyond Good and Evil 2, the unreleased sequel * Blender Game Engine, the built-in Game Engine in Blender * Bord G√°is √âireann, now called Ervia, Irish gas supplier * Bridge Airlines, whose symbol is BGE * Big Green Egg is the brand name of a kamado-style ceramic charcoal cooker * Bread Gang Entertainment, rap label in Memphis including artists like Moneybagg Yo and Finese 2Tymez. * Best Girlfriend Ever * Basic Income Alliance (B√ºndnis Grundeinkommen), a German single-issue political party ","title":"BGE"},{"id":"2222773","text":"Hurlingham is a suburb of Johannesburg, South Africa.

He is best known as the primary vocalist and songwriter for the post-punk band Wire. ==Early life== Newman was born in Salisbury, Wiltshire in 1954 and attended the Watford School of Art. ==Music career== In 1976 Newman formed the band Wire and was its main songwriter, singer and guitarist. Their first performance was on 1 April 1977 at the London nightclub Roxy. At the start, the band was considered a part of London's punk rock scene but later reached critical acclaim for their massive influence on post-punk, new wave and alternative rock. When the band temporarily split in 1980, Newman pursued a solo career. His first solo album, A-Z, was released in 1980 on the Beggar's Banquet record label. The album veered from extremely skewed pop to more mainstream numbers, such as \\"Order for Order\\", which was compared by some to Gary Numan. A track from the demos for this LP (but not included on the original vinyl release), \\"Not Me\\", was covered by This Mortal Coil on their It'll End in Tears LP; This Mortal Coil then covered the A-Z track \\"Alone\\" on their second album Filigree & Shadow. Newman's second LP, the entirely instrumental Provisionally Entitled The Singing Fish, in which all the tracks were titled for numbered fish, was released on the 4AD Records label in 1981. A third LP, Not To, which along with original compositions reworked a number of tracks originally written for Wire, was released in 1982 on 4AD. Following this, Newman travelled to India to collect sound recordings before rejoining Wire in 1984. Colin Newman, 2011 In 1986, another solo LP, Commercial Suicide, was released on the Crammed Discs label. A massive change in style for Newman, the album is reflective and highly orchestrated. His next LP, It Seems, followed a similar path, albeit with far more use of sequencers ‚Äì something Newman would continue to work with for a number of years. Both Crammed albums featured Malka Spigel who has been included in all subsequent solo and collaborative work. Newman's only other de facto solo outing was the mid-1990s release Bastard, an almost entirely instrumental release with tracks largely built from guitar loops and samples. Released on his own label, Swim ~, the first pressing of the album was packaged with a free copy of Newman's four track Voice EP. Despite Newman's name being on the cover, he says these releases, along with several others on Swim ~, are essentially collaborative efforts with his wife and musical partner, Malka Spigel. Colin Newman's song \\"Alone\\" made an appearance in the 1991 film The Silence of the Lambs in a scene in which the character Buffalo Bill is sewing in a basement. This song was also covered by This Mortal Coil on their Filigree & Shadow LP. Newman has produced, arranged and mixed various other artists. These include Virgin Prunes, Parade Ground, Minimal Compact, Alain Bashung, Silo & Lobe on the production and arrangement side and Hawkwind, Dead Man Ray, Fennesz, Polysics and Celebricide on the mix side. He has also mixed all new Wire releases since 2000. Since 2004, Newman has worked with Githead, a quartet composed of Newman and long-time collaborator Malka Spigel, as well as Max Franken and Robin Rimbaud. Newman has run the Pinkflag label for Wire since 2000.

Prior to the discovery of gold on the Witwatersrand in 1886, the suburb lay on land on one of the original farms called Doornfontein. Kensington is laid out over the slopes of several koppies (flat- topped, high-sided hills). The streets were laid out in 1903, with the suburb named by the owner of the land, Max Langermann. All of the streets coming off of Langermann Drive are in alphabetical order and are named after British war ships. The streets were heavily planted with trees, which give the area a distinctive, wooded appearance. Notable features of the suburb include Rhodes Park, named after Cecil Rhodes; Jeppe High School for Boys, Jeppe High School for Girls, Kensington Castle and the Kensington Cross,along with other streets e.g. Emerald Street named on the far end of Kensington. ===The Kensington Cross=== The Kensington Cross is a memorial on Caledonia Hill, made out of granite with the shape of an Iona Cross, a superimposed sword (a 16th Century two-handed true claymore or claidheamhmor), the memorial proudly bears the Scottish shield of lion rampant and royal treasure.

The album was produced by Waldemar Sorychta and released by Century Media records in 1994. Vocalist Johan Edlund and John Hagel were the only two remaining members of Tiamat who were still with the group after their previous album Clouds in 1992. The album was marked a strong change in the style of Tiamat's music with more progressive rock- and psychedelic music-influenced music and a less death metal-oriented style. The music on the album deals with the occult, nature, and LSD. The album was released on September 1, 1994 and was one of the highest-selling records for Century Media on its release. AllMusic praised the album, referring to it as \\"one of the classics of the genre\\". ==Production== Tiamat vocalist Johan Edlund was unhappy with the recording of the album Clouds, stating that it \\"definitely didn't turn out the way I wanted it to\\".Ekeroth, 2008. p.212 After the release of their 1994 tour EP, The Sleeping Beauty (Live in Israel), Edlund fired all members of Tiamat except for John Hagel. In 1994, Tiamat began working on an album that would become Wildhoney with session musicians Magnus Sahlgren, Lars Sk√∂ld and Waldemar Sorychta, who acted as a keyboardist and producer. Edlund later stated that on Wildhoney that he \\"really did what I wanted to do on Clouds\\". The bird songs on the album were from a sound effects album Edlund had. The album was recorded at Woodhouse Studio. ==Style== Wildhoney was a move away from the death metal sound that was previously heard on their last album Clouds. Wildhoney has been described as their first album where the \\"psychedelic/progressive influences were more widespread\\". Edlund looked back on the album later, stating that he was \\"just a very young guy [who] wanted to sound like his favorite band, Pink Floyd\\". In 2007, Edlund described stated the themes of the album revolved around the pentagram (\\"The Ar\\"), nature (\\"Gaia\\"), LSD (\\"A Pocket Size Sun\\") and satanism (\\"Visionaire\\"). ==Release== Wildhoney was released on September 1, 1994 by Century Media Records. Wildhoney was a very successful album for Century Media.Wagner, 2010. p.233 The album sold better than the previous best sellers on the label; Grave and Unleashed. The album was re-released to include the Gaia EP with it in 2001 by Century Media. ==Reception== Online music database AllMusic gave the album a rating of four and a half stars out of five, stating that the album \\"elevated the group's combination of lingering death metal roots and ambient soundscapes to unparalleled heights of invention\\".

After his departure from punk band The Models, Allen asked Asquith to join in a new project, called Rema-Rema. However, the band dissolved when Marco Pirroni joined Adam and the Ants.

His songwriting resume includes \\"Closing Time\\", which he wrote for his band, Semisonic, \\"Not Ready to Make Nice\\" (co-written with the Dixie Chicks) and \\"Someone like You\\" (co-written with Adele). He earned a Grammy nomination for ‚ÄúClosing Time‚Äù (Best Rock Song) and won Grammys for Song of the Year (‚ÄúNot Ready to Make Nice‚Äù in 2007) and Album of the Year (which he won in 2012 as one of the producers of Adele‚Äôs 21). In addition to being the leader of Semisonic, Wilson has released several solo recordings, including the 2017 release Re-Covered. He was also a member of the Minneapolis psychedelic rock band Trip Shakespeare. ==Early life and education== Wilson is a native of St. Louis Park, Minnesota. Wilson attended Harvard University, where he studied visual arts with a focus on printmaking and from which he graduated B.A. summa cum laude in Visual and Environmental Studies in 1983, while he resided in Dunster House. Wilson is an accomplished artist, and won the first Louis Sudler Prize for Outstanding Artistic Talent and Achievement in 1983. While in college, he began collaborating with his brother, singer-songwriter Matt Wilson, who also attended Harvard College. The Wilson brothers played in two bands, Animal Dance and the Love Monsters. After college, Wilson pursued his interest in drawing and painting, first in San Francisco and then in Minneapolis. == Career  Early career === In 1987, Wilson joined the Minneapolis psychedelic band, Trip Shakespeare, which Matt Wilson had founded with bassist John Munson and drummer Elaine Harris. The original three members had already released one record, Applehead Man, and now as a quartet, with Wilson on guitar, piano, sharing lead vocal duties with Matt Wilson‚Äîwith whom Wilson also co-wrote many of the songs‚Äîand Munson, the band released three more albums (Are You Shakespearienced?, 1988, Gark Records; Across the Universe, 1990, A&M; Records; Lulu, 1991, A&M; Records) and one EP (Volt, 1992, Twin Tone). Since Trip Shakespeare's breakup in 1992, Wilson has continued to collaborate with his brother, including the release of two live albums (Minneapolis 2010 and Minneapolis 2013). ===With Semisonic=== Wilson with Semisonic After Trip Shakespeare's breakup in 1992, Wilson and Munson joined with drummer Jacob Slichter to form Pleasure, a trio that was later renamed Semisonic. Semisonic released one EP, three full-length albums, and one live album. The band's first album, Great Divide, received critical acclaim. David Fricke wrote in a year-end Rolling Stone article on the notable albums of 1996, \\"Great Divide is that rare '96 beast, a record of simple but sparkling modern pop, rattling with power-trio vitality.\\" It was their 1998 release, Feeling Strangely Fine, however, that brought the band to widespread national and then international attention and success. Powered by Wilson's songs \\"Closing Time\\", which was a number-one hit on the Modern Rock charts for thirteen weeks in the spring and summer of 1998, the follow-up single \\"Singing in My Sleep\\", and \\"Secret Smile\\", a breakthrough hit for the band internationally, Feeling Strangely Fine attained platinum sales status in the U.S. and U.K. \\"Closing Time\\" received a 1999 Grammy nomination for Best Rock Song and has become an enduring pop-culture reference point for the late 1990s. It was a focal point of the plot and soundtrack of the 2011 film Friends with Benefits. Semisonic's third album, All About Chemistry, was released in 2001, and featured Wilson's song \\"Chemistry\\", the album's first single, and also included \\"One True Love\\", a song Wilson co-wrote with Carole King. Semisonic stopped touring in August 2001 but continued to perform on occasion. Slichter's memoir, So You Wanna Be a Rock & Roll Star, provides a detailed account of the band's adventures and misadventures in the music business. On June 26, 2020, Semisonic released their first new single in nearly 20 years titled \\"You're Not Alone\\", and announced that the release of an EP scheduled for September 18, 2020 ===As a solo artist=== Free Life Wilson's solo debut, Free Life, was released in 2007 by American Recordings. Produced with Rick Rubin, Free Life was recorded in Minneapolis and Los Angeles and includes performances by Tracy Bonham, Sheryl Crow, Jason Lader, Gary Louris, Natalie Maines, Benmont Tench, and a number of Minneapolis-based musicians including multi-instrumentalist and frequent Semisonic sideman Ken Chastain, Eric Fawcett, John Hermanson, Joanna James, Mason Jennings, Steve Rhoem, Joe Savage, as well as Wilson's Semisonic bandmates Munson and Slichter. Free Life helped establish Wilson's reputation as a songwriter, with The A.V. Club writing, \\"the star of the show here is Wilson's remarkable instinct for creating gorgeous songs, and his unabashed, obvious joy in doing so. For anyone worried that songcraft is an endangered species, Free Life should ease those fears.\\" Love Without Fear Wilson's second solo album, Love Without Fear, was released on April 15, 2014 and includes performances by Sara Bareilles, Missy Higgins, Lissie, Natalie Maines, Blake Mills, Sara Watkins, and Sean Watkins. The first recording from Love Without Fear, \\"Disappearing\\" (with a cover of Neil Young's \\"Out on the Weekend\\" included as a b-side) was released on November 7, 2013 and was the debut release of the new singles label, Canvasclub. In describing the album, Wilson said, \\"The songs are about being left alone, not wanting to lose someone, about desperately wishing for connection and togetherness. The sound of the record lives at the intersection of Americana and Beatles- influenced rock and roll. A little bit of twang and a lot of cinematic emotion.\\" The album received largely favourable reviews emphasizing Wilson's reputation as a songwriter. ‚ÄúDan Wilson‚Äôs career is proof positive that smart, elegant songwriting has a place in music‚Ä¶ [Love Without Fear] is a lovely amalgamation of chamber rock, gentle country, gooey '70s pop and snappy soul.\\" Re- Covered Wilson's third solo studio album, Re-Covered, was released on August 4, 2017. The album is a collection of reinterpretations of songs Wilson wrote for other artists, both big hits and ‚Äúsongs that I always wished were big hits, but weren‚Äôt.‚Äù The album includes \\"Someone Like You\\" (written with Adele), \\"Not Ready To Make Nice\\" (written with Dixie Chicks), \\"Home\\" (written with Dierks Bentley and Brett Beavers), and \\"When The Stars Come Out\\" (written with Chris Stapleton). Singles In September 2018 Wilson announced that he would begin releasing new music that Fall. Rather than organizing the new songs into an album, he would instead release them over time as monthly singles. According to Wilson, ‚ÄúI fell in love with the idea of just letting songs out into the world when they happen.\\" \\"I don't have anything against making an album. If I do 15 or 20 of these I would love the idea of packaging them together and calling it an album. I think that'd be fantastic, but I don't really have that in my mind. I'm just trying to be free.\\" Words and Music by Dan Wilson Wilson‚Äôs discoveries as a solo artist and collaborator with other artists are the subject of ‚ÄúWords and Music by Dan Wilson‚Äù, solo concerts in which he performs some of his songs and describes the songs‚Äô various inspirations or the insights that occasioned their composition. ‚ÄúWords and Music by Dan Wilson‚Äù has come to Hotel Cafe, Room 5 and Largo in Los Angeles, Joe's Pub and City Winery in New York, World Cafe Live in Philadelphia, Jammin' Java in DC, Rams Head in Annapolis, The Cedar Cultural Center in Minneapolis, the Fitzgerald Theater in Saint Paul, Schubas Tavern in Chicago, Berklee College of Music's Red Room at Cafe 939 in Boston, and the Red Barn concert series in Northfield, MN. Wilson has also presented Words & Music workshops at the 2012 ASCAP expo, UCLA's Herb Alpert School of Music, and USC's Thornton School of Music. Wilson‚Äôs thoughts about songwriting and the creative process are also captured in his series, Words & Music in Six Seconds, which was originally launched on Vine and is now regularly posted on Instagram, Twitter, and Facebook. From American Songwriter, \\"In his short videos, Wilson provides insightful quips about common songwriting insecurities, methodology, personal writing quirks, and various other tips for writing your best.\\" ===As a songwriter and producer=== As a songwriter and producer, Wilson has collaborated with a number of artists. Two of these collaborations have earned him Grammy Awards. A number of artists have described Wilson's ability to help put their feelings and ideas into song. Speaking of her experience of working with him, Pink said, in an online interview, \\"He is brilliant, and he's a thoughtful songwriter. And he's a song crafter . . . like old-school. He crafts songs and he thinks about them. And I learned a lot from working with him.‚Äù In describing her co-writing with Wilson, Adele said, \\"Dan had me on my hands and knees, crying my eyes out - there's just something about him that made me completely open up as a composer.\\" Taking the Long Way ‚Äì The Dixie Chicks Wilson co-wrote six of the songs on the Dixie Chicks multiple-Grammy-winning album Taking the Long Way, including the title song and \\"Not Ready to Make Nice\\", which earned Wilson and the Dixie Chicks the 2007 Grammy for Song of the Year. In the 2006 film Dixie Chicks: Shut Up and Sing, Wilson speaks on camera about his experience as a co-writer on this album, especially in regard to helping the Dixie Chicks make an artistic response to their rejection by radio and a large swath of their fans in the wake of the band's statements about President Bush and the Iraq War. One of the songs he co-wrote for this album, \\"Easy Silence\\", appears on Free Life, with Dixie Chicks singer Natalie Maines singing harmonies. 21 ‚Äì Adele Wilson co-wrote three of the songs on Adele's multiple-Grammy-winning 21, \\"Don't You Remember\\", ‚ÄúOne and Only\\", and, most notably, \\"Someone Like You\\", which became a number one hit in the US, UK, Ireland, Australia, and New Zealand was a top ten hit around the globe. As a producer of this track, on which he also played piano, Wilson shared in the 2012 Grammy Award for Album of the Year. In an interview with American Songwriter, Wilson recounted the writing and recording of \\"Someone Like You\\": :::The recording on the album was intended as a demo. I was thinking, \\"Oh, they're going to make a big version of this, strings and angelic choirs, like a big Chrissie Hynde power-ballad.\\" But by the end of the first day, the demo was sounding lovely, and very affecting, but it was only half-written, there were no words on the second verse or the bridge as I remember. Adele came to the studio the next day and said, \\"I played it for my manager and me Mum.\\" I was a little nervous about this because I don't like people to hear works-in- progress. I asked her what they thought of the song. \\"My manager loves it and me Mum cried.\\" \\"Someone Like You\\" won the 2012 Grammy for Best Pop Solo Performance, and as she accepted the award, Adele said, \\"I want to thank Dan Wilson, who wrote this song with me. My life changed when I wrote this song and I felt it before anyone even heard it.\\" \\"Someone Like You\\" was the most downloaded single of all time in the UK and was voted third most favourite single of the last 60 years in the UK. ===As a visual artist=== Wilson's career as a painter, illustrator, and calligrapher is less widely known, but his artwork has often intersected with his music career. He was represented by Thomas Barry Fine Arts in Minneapolis, and his works are included in numerous private and corporate collections. Wilson's paintings are featured on the artwork for two of Trip Shakespeare's albums, Are You Shakespearienced? and Lulu, as well as on the cover of his first solo album, Free Life. Wilson created all of the artwork for his 2014 album Love Without Fear. Most notably, a hand illustrated 24-page hardcover Deluxe Album Book/CD. The package includes Wilson's own calligraphy, sketches, and handwritten lyrics for each song on the album. The official lyric videos for his singles from the album, ‚ÄúDisappearing‚Äù and \\"A Song Can Be About Anything\\" are also made entirely from his own illustrations. At his \\"Words and Music by Dan Wilson\\" shows, audience members receive illuminated set lists that are hand illustrated by Wilson. One of these set lists was featured on NPR's blog All Songs Considered. Wilson's calligraphy and illustrations are featured in his Tumblr series, ‚ÄúDW‚Äôs Sketchbook‚Äù and his musical cartoons have been featured in the Wall Street Journal's Speakeasy Blog. ==Personal life== Wilson is married to Diane Espaldon. Wilson and his wife were contemporaries at Harvard University, where he studied visual arts and she studied government. Wilson's wife subsequently earned a M.A. from School of International and Public Affairs, Columbia University. Together, they have one biological daughter, Corazon (\\"Coco\\") (b. 1997), who was born prematurely and has disabilities and for whom \\"Closing Time\\" was written before her birth, and Lily (b. 2007), who was adopted at age two from the Philippines. ==Discography Singles === * 2020 ‚ÄúTry Love‚Äù * 2020 \\"The Real Question‚Äù * 2020 \\"Red Light\\" * 2020 \\"Superfan\\" * 2020 \\"Eventually\\" * 2019 \\"Last December\\" * 2019 \\"Sunshine\\" * 2019 \\"Too Much ii\\" * 2019 \\"A Modest Proposal\\" * 2019 \\"The Rules\\" * 2019 \\"Fly Safe\\" * 2018 \\"Christmassy\\" * 2018 \\"Uncanny Valley\\" * 2018 \\"We Ain't Telling\\" * 2016 \\"Yoko\\" * 2013 \\"Disappearing\\" === Studio albums === * 2017 Re-Covered * 2014 Love Without Fear * 2008 Be Free EP digital release *2007 Free Life ===Live albums=== *2009 Dan Wilson Live at the Pantages ‚Äì A 2-CD document of Dan Wilson's concert at Minneapolis' Pantages Theater on December 13, 2008. *2008 Live at the Electric Fetus *2001 DW Live @ the CCC *1998 Dan Wilson Live @ Bryant Lake Bowl ===with Semisonic=== *2020 You're Not Alone (EP) *2018 Feeling Strangely Fine (20th Anniversary Reissue) *2003 One Night at First Avenue (live) *2001 All About Chemistry *1998 Feeling Strangely Fine *1996 Great Divide *1995 Pleasure EP (EP) *1993 Pleasure ===Dan and Matt Wilson=== *2013 Dan & Matt Wilson Minneapolis 2013 *2010 Dan & Matt Wilson Minneapolis 2010 ===Trip Shakespeare=== *1992 Volt (EP) *1991 Lulu *1990 Across the Universe *1989 Are You Shakespearienced? ===The Love Monsters=== *1983 Kiss Away The Tears (7\\") ===Film, TV, and Soundtracks (as a performer)=== *2013 Absolutely Cuckoo: Minnesota covers the 69 Love Songs ‚Äì \\"The Things We Did and Didn't Do\\" *2011 Minnesota Remembers Vic Chesnutt ‚Äì \\"Soft Picasso\\" *2010 Dear John Soundtrack ‚Äì \\"You Take My Troubles Away\\" (with Rachael Yamagata) *2009 All About Steve Soundtrack ‚Äì \\"Sugar\\" *2006 For New Orleans ‚Äì \\"I Can't Hold You\\" *2002 For the Kids ‚Äì \\"Willie The King\\" *2002 Maybe This Christmas ‚Äì \\"What A Year for a New Year\\" *2001 Summer Catch Soundtrack ‚Äì Semisonic's \\"Over My Head\\" *1999 American Pie Soundtrack - \\"Good Morning Baby\\" *1999 Together in Concert: Live, Bic Runga Featuring Dan Wilson *1999 Friends Again Soundtrack ‚Äì Semisonic's \\"Delicious\\" *1999 10 Things I Hate About You Soundtrack ‚Äì Semisonic's \\"FNT\\" *1999 Never Been Kissed Soundtrack ‚Äì Semisonic's \\"Never You Mind\\" *1999 For The Love of the Game Soundtrack ‚Äì Semisonic's \\"For The Love of the Game\\" *1996 The Long Kiss Goodnight Soundtrack ‚Äì Semisonic's \\"FNT\\" ===Film and Soundtracks (as a writer and producer)=== *2019 Big Little Lies (TV series) Season 2 Soundtrack ‚Äì \\"That Was Yesterday\\" (Leon Bridges) *2014 The Fault In Our Stars Soundtrack ‚Äì \\"Tee Shirt\\" and \\"Best Shot\\" (Birdy) *2013 Spark: A Burning Man Story Soundtrack ‚Äì \\"We Ride\\" (Missy Higgins) *2013 Safe Haven Soundtrack ‚Äì \\"We Both Know\\" (Colbie Caillat & Gavin DeGraw) *2010 The Twilight Saga: Eclipse Soundtrack ‚Äì \\"Ours\\" (The Bravery) *2010 The Kid Soundtrack ‚Äì \\"Boy\\" (KT Tunstall) ===Writing and producing credits=== { - ccc;\\" !Year !Artist !Credit !Title -  rowspan=\\"13\\"  2020  rowspan=\\"1\\"  Andrea Russett  rowspan=\\"1\\"  Writer  \\"Darkest Hour\\" -  rowspan=\\"1\\"  LANY  rowspan=\\"1\\"  Writer  \\"Nobody Else\\" -  rowspan=\\"1\\"  Joshua Speers  rowspan=\\"1\\"  Writer  \\"Thunder Blanket\\" -  rowspan=\\"1\\"  JoJo  rowspan=\\"1\\"  Writer  \\"In Your Room\\" -  rowspan=\\"1\\"  Briston Maroney  rowspan=\\"1\\"  Writer  \\"Deep Sea Diver\\" -  rowspan=\\"1\\"  Ricky Reed  rowspan=\\"1\\"  Writer  \\"Better\\" feat.

(Composite 15-day image showing the extension of the Leeuwin Current around Tasmania) The East Australian Current (EAC) is the southward western boundary current that is formed from the South Equatorial Current (SEC) crossing the Coral Sea and reaching the eastern coast of Australia. At around 15¬∞ S near the Australian coast the SEC divides forming the southward flow of the EAC. It is the largest ocean current close to the shores of Australia. The EAC reaches a maximum velocity at 30¬∞ S where its flow can reach 90 cm/s. As it flows southward it splits from the coast at around 31¬∞ to 32¬∞ S. By the time it reaches 33¬∞ S it begins to undergo a southward meander while another portion of the transport turns back northward in a tight recirculation. At this location the EAC reaches its maximum transport of nearly 35 Sv (35 billion liters per second). The majority of the EAC flow that does not recirculate will move eastward into the Tasman Front crossing the Tasman Sea just north of the cape of New Zealand. The remaining will flow south on the EAC Extension until it reaches the Antarctic Circumpolar Current. The Tasman Front transport is estimated at 13 Sv. The eastward movement of the EAC through the Tasman Front and reattaching to the coastline of New Zealand forms the East Auckland Current. The EAC also acts to transport tropical marine fauna to habitats in sub-tropical regions along the south east Australian coast. == Physical Oceanography == Heat flux in the East Australian Current from the equator toward the South Pole. The EAC is a surface current driven by winds over the South Pacific. During different parts of the year these winds control how the current behaves. The EAC starts on the west edge of the South Pacific gyre where it collects warm, nutrient poor water. As it skirts along the East Coast of Australia it carries a large amount of warm tropical water from the equator southward. This process is part of what allows the Great Barrier Reef to thrive, it keeps the east coast of Australia around 18 ¬∞C year round instead of dropping to 12 ¬∞C in the winter. The current is very low in nutrients, however, it remains important for the marine ecosystem. The EAC removes heat from the tropics and releases it to the mid-latitude water and atmosphere. It does this by producing warm core eddies, which allow the Tasman Seas to have a large biodiversity. The most southern tip of the EAC can produce these Eddies by wind currents. As instabilities in the current develop due to a westward Tasman Front, the meander pinches off to form eddies at a rate of once or twice per year. The EAC has nutrient poor water, however it does cause upwelling in places along the coast line. The Eddies produced cause an increase in vertical mixing within the Tasman Sea. The process of producing, moving, and destroying eddies causes the thermocline layer to mix with the surface layer, bringing some nutrients up to the surface. The EAC and its eddies frequently flow onto the continental shelf and inshore, influencing circulation patterns and increasing mixing. Eddies aren't the only way the EAC brings nutrients to the surface. Features along the coast push the current further off shore and if there is a strong northerly wind, it will push the current even further off shore, allowing deep water to rise up the coast, bringing nutrients up to the surface. The EAC experiences seasonal variations. It tends to be strongest in the summer, with an amplitude flow around 36.3 Sv. It is its weakest during the winter months flowing at a rate around 27.4 Sv. Over the past 50‚Äì60 years the EAC has shifted. The south Tasman Sea has become warmer and saltier from 1944‚Äì2002. This has resulted in the current strengthening and extending southward. This shift in the EAC flow past Tasmania is controlled the Southern Hemisphere subtropical ocean circulation. This trend is thought to be caused by changes in wind patterns due to ozone depletion over Australia. There is a strong consensus with climate models that this trend will continue to intensify and accelerate over the next 100 years. The current is predicted to increase greater than 20%, thanks to the increase in South Pacific winds. ==In popular culture== In the 2003 Disney/Pixar animated film Finding Nemo, the EAC is portrayed as a superhighway that fish and sea turtles use to travel down the east coast of Australia. The characters Marlin (Albert Brooks) and Dory (Ellen DeGeneres) join Crush (Andrew Stanton), Squirt (Nicholas Bird) and a group of baby and adult sea turtles in using the EAC to help them travel to Sydney Harbour. The basic premise of the storyline is actually correct. Every summer, thousands of fish are swept from the Great Barrier Reef to Sydney Harbour and further south,Looking For Nemo, 2004-06-03, Catalyst, ABC however, the Current is not nearly as rapid as depicted in the film. ==See also== * Ocean current * Oceanic gyres * Physical oceanography ==References * Image of the East Australian Current. * Sea surface temperature and currents, New South Wales.

Donald finished his with 72 fights, completing a record of 67 wins, 5 losses.Larry Donald Record at BoxingRecords.com ==Professional career== Larry \\"The Legend\\" Donald turned pro on January 3, 1993, earning a technical knockout against Craig Brinson. In 1994 he beat fellow undefeated prospect Jeremy Williams, and Bert Cooper, but suffered his first defeat when losing widely to ex-champ Riddick Bowe, who had infamously sucker punched Donald twice at the pre-fight press conference. He resurfaced in late 1997 outpointing ex-champ Tim Witherspoon, but spent many years fighting low profile on Don King under cards, unpopular with fans and the press for his negative, ultra-defensive and extremely unentertaining style. In July 2001 he had a high-profile world title eliminator with Kirk Johnson, 31‚Äì0‚Äì1, but lost a close decision. In 2002 he traveled to Germany to face Vitali Klitschko. Even at the age of 35, Donald was considered one of the most durable fighters in the world, but the heavy hitting Klitschko surprisingly stopped the veteran, decking him three times in the 10th round. Although things looked over, Donald seemingly reinvented himself in November 2004 with an upset win over the legendary Evander Holyfield, winning nearly every round against the Hall of Famer ex-champ for the NABC World Champion Title. In 2005, Donald controversially lost a title eliminator bout to giant-sized Russian Nicolay Valuev which would have earned him the right to fight John Ruiz for the WBA belt. On July 30, 2007, Donald returned to ring to face Alexander Povetkin, and lost a lopsided decision. ==Professional boxing record== { style=\\"text-align:center; font-size:95%\\" - ! !Result !Record !Opponent !Type !Round, time !Date !Location !Notes -

She is best known to English-language audiences for her roles in Rain Man, Big Top Pee-wee and the two Hot Shots! films. In addition to David di Donatello, Silver Ribbon, Golden Ciak and Italian Golden Globe awards, she is one of three actresses to have twice won the Best Actress award at the Venice Film Festival. ==Early life== Golino was born in Naples, Italy, the daughter of an Italian father who was a Germanist scholar, and a Greek mother, Lalla, who was a painter. One of her grandmothers was Egyptian-French. \\\\- She grew up in an \\"artistic household\\", and after her parents split up, was raised alternating between Athens and Sorrento (near Naples). Golino is the niece of the journalist Enzo Golino at L'Espresso, and her brother is a musician. When she was a girl, her mother frequently took her to the cinema, and she quickly became interested in films. In spite of this, though, she never thought about pursuing a film career until she made her first movie. Instead, she wanted to be a cardiologist. Valeria was diagnosed with scoliosis at age 11, and she had to have a steel rod implanted in her back for five years. She remained in the care of a surgeon in Chicago for six months, where she learned to speak English. At age 14, she started to work as a fashion model in Athens, Milan, London, and Los Angeles. She was in TV commercials for beer, perfume, and cosmetics, and she modeled swimsuits and blue jeans. Being an unfocused student, she dropped out of high school after acting in her first movie. ==Career1983‚Äì1987=== Golino never formally studied acting. Her career started by chance when her uncle Enzo received a phone call from the director Lina Wertm√ºller, who was searching for a young girl for her movie, and encouraged Golino to go to Wertmuller's house to meet her. The two met and Valeria was eventually cast in her first film, A Joke of Destiny (1983), alongside Ugo Tognazzi after an audition where she performed Shakespeare. Despite her parents' reservations and Wertmuller's demanding on-set behavior, she liked the experience so much that she decided to pursue an acting career. She gave up modeling, which she had never found fulfilling or interesting, and started to study diction and elocution. Among her early auditions were Una spina nel cuore (an audition that she called \\"distasteful\\") and The Name of the Rose but was passed over for both films. She was offered roles in Giochi d'estate (1984) and other similarly themed romantic films about teenagers, but she turned them down to focus on smaller and more challenging projects. She followed her first with a string of independent films, including roles in My Dearest Son and Little Flames (both 1985), her first leading role, both of which won her a Golden Globe award for Best Breakthrough Actress. Later that year, she was involved in a car accident\\"Valeria Golino\\" which displaced the metal bar in her back and had to have surgery in order to fix it: she was bedridden for five months. Her star-making role came the following year, when she played the life-loving cleaning lady who romances two different men in Storia d'amore (A Tale of Love) by Francesco Maselli. Her performance received rave reviews and earned her two prizes at the 1986 Venice Film Festival, the official Best Actress award (now called Volpi Cup) and the Golden Ciak award. The same film also won her the oldest and most prestigious critics' prize of the Italian cinema, the Silver Ribbon award for Best Actress. Her following projects were once again independent, auteur-driven films, The Gold Rimmed Glasses and Three Sisters. She was supposed to reunite with Maselli for his following film L'uomo della casa di fronte, co-starring Marcello Mastroianni, but the project never happened. The same director then moved on to another film, Codice privato, and Golino turned down the role that was eventually played by Ornella Muti. ===1988‚Äìpresent=== She moved to Los Angeles and began to work in Hollywood, with the movie Big Top Pee-Wee (1988). She was cast in Rain Man (also 1988) as Susanna, the girlfriend of Tom Cruise's character, and in the comedy films Hot Shots! (1991) and Hot Shots! Part Deux (1993), as the girlfriend of the hero (\\"Hot Shots\\" was a direct spoof of \\"Top Gun\\"). Her character's nationality in Rain Man was changed from American to Italian- American to accommodate her accent. Even though she was known as a dramatic actress in Italy, most of the offers she received in Hollywood were for comedies. Golino auditioned for lead roles in Pretty Woman and Flatliners, but both times she lost the part to Julia Roberts during the final audition. She was first runner-up for both roles and, in the case of Pretty Woman, she revealed many years later: \\"I was in the running until the final audition: it came to down to Julia Roberts and me. The director asked us to walk in the same corridor, wearing the same clothes and makeup. As soon as I saw her [Roberts], I knew that she would have been chosen. And since she knew that, she told me: 'Go and get them, big mama!' I wouldn't have dared to say that to my rival. I would have been good in that film but she was perfect\\". She also turned down the leading role in the Ken Loach film Hidden Agenda, which she called \\"an offer that I still regret having declined\\". In 1993, she was heavily involved in producing and starring in an independent feature film, Cat in the Box, which was never made, and because of that project, she was forced to turn down a role in a movie directed by Carlo Verdone. During the following year, she was offered the leading role in True Lies, but she had to turn that down because of conflicts in scheduling with I Sfagi tou kokora (1996), an independent film made in Cyprus. She had joined this film project in 1992, while it was still in preproduction, and she fervently wanted to be a part of it. Later on that year, she was supposed to act with Gian Maria Volont√© in the film Treni sull'acqua. This project would have marked her third collaboration with the director Peter Del Monte, but it was canceled after the death of Volont√©. In early 1996, she was supposed to play a journalist in the film Bravo Randy, directed by Alessandro D'Alatri and also starring Jovanotti in the titular role of a tramp who falls into a coma after an accident. However, the project fell apart just a few months before shooting was slated to begin: fearing a lack of influence, the Italian production company blocked the funds as the film would have been shot in California. In January 2001, she was supposed to star with Claudio Amendola in a TV mini-series called Cuore di ghiaccio, directed by Luciano Casciani, produced by Mediaset and set in Cefal√π, but the project never took off the ground. She had a supporting role in the successful French thriller 36, Quai des Orf√®vres (2004) and a leading role in Cash (2008), although the producers of the film had wanted Kristin Scott Thomas instead. Her role as Irene in Sacred Heart (2004) had been written specifically for her by director Ferzan Ozpetek, but she was forced to abandon the project for personal reasons. She was replaced by Barbora Bobuƒæov√°. In 2005, she was offered the leading role in Fine pena mai (2008) but she turned it down, considering herself to be too old for the part. The role was eventually played by Valentina Cervi. In 2006, Theodoros Angelopoulos cast her in The Dust of Time (2008) after being impressed by Golino's work in Respiro. However the many delays in the shooting forced her to drop out of the project in late 2007 for scheduling conflicts. She was replaced by Ir√®ne Jacob. In 2009, she was the subject of the monograph Valeria Golino: Respiro d'attrice by Massimo Causo. The following year she was offered the chance to direct a short film by the company Pasta Garofalo, Armandino e il Madre, for which she also wrote the script. Her first feature film as director, Honey (2013), was screened in the Un Certain Regard section at the 2013 Cannes Film Festival and won a commendation from the Ecumenical Jury. She played Armida Miserere, high security warden in Like the Wind (2013) directed by Marco Simon Puccioni a difficult leading role praised by the critics and awarded in festival. Despite her self-deprecating reluctance, she also sang in several films, most notably her English-language films Hot Shots! and Big Top Pee-Wee and in Italian in Like the Wind. She recorded two LPs in 1987, the song \\"Maybe Once More\\" for L'inverno and 'Piangi Roma' for Giulia Doesn't Date at Night (featuring Baustelle), the latter of which won her a Silver Ribbon award for Best Song. She is a member of AMPAS thanks to the invitation of Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau. In 2016, she was a member of the main competition jury of the 2016 Cannes Film Festival. ==FilmographyActing=== *A Joke of Destiny (1983) *Blind Date (1984) ‚Äì Girl in bikini *My Dearest Son (1985) ‚Äì Francesca *Little Flames (1985) ‚Äì Mara *A Tale of Love (1986) ‚Äì Bruna Assecondati *Detective School Dropouts (1986) ‚Äì Caterina *Dernier √©t√© √† Tanger (1987) ‚Äì Claudia Marchetti *The Gold Rimmed Glasses (1987) ‚Äì Nora Treves *Three Sisters (1988) ‚Äì Sandra Parini *Big Top Pee-wee (1988) ‚Äì Gina Piccolapupula *Rain Man (1988) ‚Äì Susanna *Torrents of Spring (1989) ‚Äì Gemma Rosselli *Traces of an Amorous Life (1990) *The King's Whore (1990) ‚Äì Jeanne de Luynes *Hot Shots!

SilverStar's snow season runs from late November to mid-April weather permitting. SilverStar provides summer lift access for mountain biking and hiking from the end of June through to September. ==Alpine Skiing Terrain== SilverStar has an annual snowfall of 700 cm or There are a total of 132 marked trails, with a vertical drop of 760 m (2,500 ft). The elevation of the village is 1,609 m (5,280 ft) whilst the summit is 1,915 m (6,280 ft) above sea level. With access to nearby Sovereign Lake Nordic Centre, SilverStar offers extensive Cross Country skiing with more than 105 kilometres (60 miles) of daily groomed trails. SilverStar has a total of 12 lifts: One eight-seater gondola (summit express), one Six- Pack Express chairlift (Comet Six-Pack Express), two detachable high-speed quads (Silverwoods Express, Powder Gulch Express), two fixed-grip quads (Silver Queen Chair, Alpine Meadows Chair) one T-bar (Home Run T-bar), three beginner magic carpets, and two tube lifts, on of skiable terrain.http://www.skisilverstar.com/my-mountain-info/about-silver-star/fast- facts The resort spans over four mountain faces, giving it four distinct areas : Vance Creek offers most of the beginner and intermediate runs on the mountain. Therefore it is usually the busiest face of the mountain and has mostly groomed runs along with intermediate and expert runs. Vance Creek is serviced by the \\"Comet Six-pack Express\\" which ferries skiers from below the Village base and Silver Woods areas to the summit at 1,915 m. The \\"Summit Express‚Äùis a gondola that takes skiers directly from the Village to the summit as well. Attridge is a small area beside Vance Creek which offers a wide variety of glade and groomed runs. The \\"Alpine Meadows\\" chair is a fixed grip quad and offers ski-in/ski-out access to the mountain from the developed area called Alpine Meadows. Silver Woods is a recent expansion of the resort which is part of a catchment below the Comet Express and is serviced by the \\"Silver Woods Express\\" which is a detachable high-speed quad. Silver Woods offers many intermediate treed and glade runs and is an access point to the hill from the \\"Knoll Residential Area\\". Putnam Creek is an area which introduces skiers to more difficult terrain than the rest of the mountain. Most of the runs in the Putnam Creek area are black diamond and double black diamond runs consisting of steep lines with moguls and tree skiing. The \\"Powder Gulch Express\\", a Detachable high-speed quad gives lift access to the many runs and a way out with the \\"Home Run T-bar\\" back to the village. ==History== The Early Days Vernon resident Bert Thorburn became the first person to ski in the Silver Star area in 1930. He rode his bike up to the end of a logging road in the area and then walked a distance following forestry trails to a forest fire lookout. He camped there for the night and skied down the next day. In 1946 the first rope tow was built on Burney Ridge, south of Vernon above the lookout overlooking Kalamalka Lake long. It was powered by an old four cylinder engine. The cooling system was a 40-gallon water drum hooked up to the radiator. For $.50, you could ski all day. A few years later the ski hill was moved to Lavington on Michael Freeman's farm on the north slope above Highway 6. This had one or two rope tows and a shack for warming up with an oil barrel wood fired stove. You walked across the pasture to get to the shed. But skiing was limited to a few months of the year. The Ski Club had their eyes on Silver Star Mountain where they could ski 6 months of the year. But Silver Star was part of a Class A provincial park with no development allowed. Silver Star Sports was started by Russ Postill, Mike Lattey, Bill Attridge, Joe Peters, John Cassa, Joyce Balestra and maybe John Hindle in 1956 or 1957. They got approval from the Province to build a ski hill in the Class A park in the summer of 1957 to go ahead but it was too late to build anything substantial so they brought in a trailer and small portable rope tow near Sovereign Lake where the snowmobile station is now. In 1958 the final three kilometers of the Silver Star road was pushed through by local contractor Russ Postill to the current day village area. Construction of two rope-tow lifts and an A-frame day lodge were built in 1958. In 1959 a poma lift was installed from the level at the parking lot to the top of SilverStar Mountain, replacing the rope tow. In 1964 new t-bars were installed to replace the slower rope tows and in 1965 a second A-frame structure was added to the day lodge. In 1967 and 1968 the Summit and Yellow Chairs (6,000 feet) built by GMD Mueller were installed, making Silver Star Mountain one of the largest ski areas in Canada. One of the challenges of the early rope tows was that the rope stretched as it was used and had to be cut, shortened and spliced at regular intervals. This was the job of Mike Lattey who would sit out in the snow undoing and splicing the cold wet rope under a tarp while everyone else stayed inside drinking hot chocolate. He was also the official photographer. Some of his photos can be seen in Paradise Camp and the pub in the village. SilverStar Mountain Resort Era In 1981 Silver Star Sports purchased by Norm Crerar, Charlie Locke, John Hindle, Rob Marshall and John Gow and becomes Silver Star Mountain Resorts Ltd. The first Nordic trails were also cleared. In 1983 the Putnam Station Hotel is built by Russell Haubrich and Shella Ledingham, it is Silver Star's first on hill hotel. From 1984-1990 many new hotels and amenities are built on the hill. In 1990 the Silver Queen chair was built by Yan and replaced by a doppelmayr quad chair and serves as the bunny hill.http://www.doppelmayr.com/upload/prj1/Inserate- Broschueren/annual2008_englisch_web.pdf In 1991 the original Putnam Creek and Vance Creek express quads were built and opened up extensive amounts of terrain. In 2001 the Schumann family, owners of Big White Ski Resort since 1985, reached an agreement in principle with the Honourable Judd Buchanan, (Order of Canada),the majority shareholder of Silver Star Mountain Resort on the purchase of the majority assets of Silver Star Mountain Resort. In 2002 Silver Star Mountain Resort invested heavily in new chair lifts and opening up new terrain followed by further expansion in 2005/06 to open up the Silver Woods ski area. 2005 was also the expansion of the Silver Star Bike Park to start using the Comet Six-Pack chairlift for biking. New trails were cut and all of the existing trails were extended all the way down to the bottom of the Comet chair. ==Nordic Skiing== SilverStar is renowned for its Cross-Country Skiing facilities. With access to nearby Sovereign Lake Nordic Centre, SilverStar offers extensive cross-country skiing with more than 105 kilometres (60 miles) of daily groomed trails. The extensive trail system allows for an array of abilities to take in the sport. ==Terrain park== SilverStar's terrain park consists of an extensive rail garden and also has an assortment of table- top and step-up jumps for all abilities. Silver Star also has an Aerial Training Site, a Dual Moguls Race Course, and a race center which hosted the 2005 Canadian Masters Slalom Championships. ==Silver StarBike Park== Expanded in 2005 to start using the Comet Six-Pack the bike park features more than 50 km of downhill bike trails and more than 30 km of XC trail.http://www.trailforks.com/region/silver-star-mountain-resort/ The bike park features a 4 bike carrier lift system that uses a bike carrier on every second chair so you hardly ever wait in line. Biking terrain (XC and DH combined) consists of roughly 23% beginner green trails, 43% intermediate blue trails and 34% advanced and expert trails. ==On-mountain activities== Apart from skiing and snowboarding, there are several other on-mountain activities. These are: *Tube Town *Outdoor Skating * Snowmobiling *Mini Z Snowmobile Park *Sleigh Rides *Snowshoeing * Day spa *Indoor Rock Climbing *Fitness Centre *Bike Park *Hiking trails SilverStar‚Äôs My1Pass; is an all-inclusive seasons pass offering seven activities including downhill and cross-country skiing, snowboarding, tubing, skating, Fat Biking and snowshoeing. ==See also== *List of ski areas and resorts in Canada * Skiing * Snowboarding *Mountain biking ==References== Category:Ski areas and resorts in the Okanagan Category:Populated places in the Regional District of North Okanagan Category:Monashee Mountains Category:Populated places in the Okanagan Country ","title":"Silver Star Mountain Resort"},{"id":"2222872","text":"Craig Brinson (born August 24, 1965) is a former professional heavyweight boxer.

The core of the band was Michael Allen (vocals, bass), Mark Cox (keyboards), and Andrew Gray (guitar). The group is best known for its 1992 international hit single \\"A Girl Like You (Born To Be Kissed)\\". ==Style and influences== The official 4AD band profile describes them as \\"post-punk\\", transforming to \\"avant-dance groovers\\" with Queer. The band was frequently labeled \\"goth,\\" though they denied the charge. Allen's list of \\"important records\\" as of 1995 included De La Soul's 3 Feet High and Rising, Massive Attack's Blue Lines and \\"anything from Nick Cave and The Fall.\\" He recalled that the record that \\"maybe started it all\\" for him was Public Image Ltd's Metal Box. ==HistoryRema-Rema, Mass (1978‚Äì1981)=== Allen started in The Models in 1977. Allen and Cox had both been members of Rema-Rema and Mass, while Gray had been a member of In Camera. All of these bands had also recorded for 4AD.4AD band profile, p. 1, 4ad.com Rema-Rema was formed in 1978The Worriers (Marina Merosi, ZigZag March 1984, p12-13) by schoolmatesRiding Mikes Bikes With Gary Asquith Of The Lavender Pill Mob (Todd E. Jones, April 2006) Allen and Gary Asquith, with Cox, Marco Pirroni (also a school friend of Allen'sThe Mud Black Geniuser Of Michael Allen (Todd C. Allen, MVRemix, February 2006, p4) and a fellow member of The ModelsThe Models (punk77.co.uk)) and Max Prior (who later recorded as Dorothy with Psychic TVThe Story Of \\"I Confess\\" (Kid Shirt blog, 2006-01-14)). 4AD founder Ivo Watts-Russell said that hearing Rema-Rema's demo tape \\"was the first point I knew that we were actually doing something serious [with 4AD].\\"Rema-Rema (4AD official profile) Their sole recording was the Wheel in the Roses 12\\"EP (4AD BAD-5, 1 Apr 1980).Rema-Rema ‚Äì Wheel In The Roses (discogs.com) The band split when Pirroni left to join Adam and the Ants (although Pirroni says he had already leftInterview with Marco Pirroni & Chris Constantinou ‚Äì The Wolfmen (Terry Lane, Buzzin Music, 2010-12-15) ‚Äî \\"Adam didn‚Äôt headhunt me ‚Äî I was already out of Rema Rema when he called me.\\"), and reformed as Mass. Mass consisted of Allen and Cox with Asquith and Danny Briottet. Mass recorded a single, \\"You And I\\"/\\"Cabbage\\" (4AD AD-14, Oct 1980),Mass (4) ‚Äì You And I / Cabbage (discogs.com) and an album, Labour Of Love (4AD CAD-107, May 1981).Mass (4) ‚Äì Labour Of Love (discogs.com) Mass split in 1981. Asquith and Briottet later (1986) formed Renegade Soundwave. (Asquith remained a friend and contributed to Queer.) ===The Burden Of Mules (1983)=== After Mass split, Allen and Cox continued working together. The influence of Metal Box was apparent in their live shows of the timeWolfgang Press ‚Äì 4AD Records ‚Äì 1983 (Kill Your Pet Puppy, 2008-09-17) and in their first recording as the Wolfgang Press, the 1983 album The Burden Of Mules. Trouser Press describes it as \\"dark and cacophonous, an angry, intense slab of post-punk gloom that is best left to its own (de)vices\\"; the AllMusic Guide to Electronica describes some tracks as \\"so morose and vehement as to verge on self-parody.\\" ZigZag was more positive, regarding the album as an artistic success and an \\"emphatic statement.\\" The band's career retrospective compilation, Everything Is Beautiful, contains no tracks from the album. Guest musicians included Richard Thomas (Dif Juz), David Steiner (In Camera) and guitarist and percussionist Andrew Gray, who soon joined the band. ===Early EPs=== The EPs Scarecrow, Water and Sweatbox followed, produced by Robin Guthrie. These were later compiled (with some remixed versions) as The Legendary Wolfgang Press And Other Tall Stories. The AllMusic Guide to Electronica describes Scarecrow as \\"a lighter, more streamlined affair\\", Water as spotlighting \\"ominously sparse torch songs\\", and Sweatbox as \\"deconstructionist pop\\". ===Standing Up Straight (1986)=== The 4AD band profile describes Standing Up Straight as \\"an intense blend of industrial and classical tropes\\". Trouser Press describes it as \\"as challenging and inventive as the band's other work, adding industrial and classical instrumentation to the creative arsenal\\", \\"dark and thoroughly uncompromising\\" and \\"not for the easily intimidated.\\" The AllMusic Guide to Electronica describes it as \\"a challenging, even punishing album, but a rewarding one as well.\\" ===Bird Wood Cage (1988)=== The AllMusic Guide to Electronica notes Bird Wood Cage as \\"one of the most pivotal records in the Wolfgang Press catalog; here, the trio begins to incorporate the dance and funk elements which would ultimately emerge as the dominant facet of their work.\\" Trouser Press describes Bird Wood Cage as \\"inserting fascinating bits of business into superficially forbidding songs\\", including female backing vocals, funky wah-wah guitar and elements of dub reggae. The album was preceded by the EP Big Sex, which presages Bird Wood Cage's musical themes. \\"King Of Soul\\", \\"Kansas\\" and \\"Raintime\\"/\\"Bottom Drawer\\" were singles from the album. Allen later said that Bird Wood Cage was the Wolfgang Press album he was most proud of. ===Queer (1991), \\"A Girl Like You\\" (1992)=== The genesis of the 1991 album Queer was listening to De La Soul's 1989 debut album 3 Feet High and Rising. As Allen put it, this was when they \\"rediscovered that music could indeed be fun.\\"The Wolfgang Press: Going South with Tom Jones (Yellow Peril [Sebastian Chan], Snarl, 1995) \\"It seemed such a joyous record. There was a freshness and ease about the way it was made that inspired us to reassess our working process.\\"Jeremy Simmonds. \\"The Wolfgang Press.\\" The Rough Guide to Rock, 3rd ed., Peter Buckley (ed.), p1182. Rough Guides Ltd, October 2003. . The album's sound includes many samples and funkier, poppier beats than previous albums. The AllMusic Guide to Electronica describes it as \\"alien funk, a collection of idiosyncratic rhythms, dark textures, and ominous grooves.\\"Jason Ankeny. \\"Wolfgang Press.\\" AllMusic Guide to Electronica: the definitive guide to electronic music, p560. Vladimir Bogdanov, ed., 2001. Backbeat Books. . The band members each play multiple instruments, making the sound fuller than previous work.Wolfgang Press (Altricia Gethers/Megan Frampton, Trouser Press) Bassist Leslie Langston of Throwing Muses guests on most tracks. The singles from the album were \\"Time\\" (the album version being titled \\"Question Of Time\\"), which included a sample from Pink Floyd's \\"Time\\" (from The Dark Side of the Moon),Wolfgang Press, The - Time (discogs.com) followed by a cover of Randy Newman's \\"Mama Told Me Not to Come.\\" The single \\"A Girl Like You\\" was released in May 1992The Wolfgang Press - \\"A Girl Like You / Angel\\" (erasure.ru) and became an international hit, scoring No. 2 on the Billboard US Modern Rock (Alternative Songs) chart on 15 August 1992.The Wolfgang Press - A Girl Like You (billboard.com) The song was later covered by Tom Jones, who then asked the band to write \\"Show Me (Some Devotion)\\" for him, both recordings appearing on The Lead and How to Swing It (1994). Jones also joined them on-stage for All Virgos Are Mad, a 4AD anniversary concert in Los Angeles in January 1995.\\"He's With The Band.\\" (Billboard, 28 January 1995, p12) Due to sample clearance issues, the 1992 US release of Queer (which includes \\"A Girl Like You\\") needed considerable rerecording and remixing.4AD band profile, p. 2, 4ad.com ===Funky Little Demons (1995)=== After \\"A Girl Like You\\", the band bought their own studio, removing the financial pressure of traditional studio rental. The band spent two years recording Funky Little Demons. Trouser Press describes the album as \\"straight-ahead dance music with the correct materials\\", though \\"no longer enigmatic risk-takers, the Wolfgang Press have become just another white post-new wave soul band.\\" The single \\"Going South\\" reached No. 117 on the UK singles chart and No. 33 on the US alternative chart.The Wolfgang Press Songs (MusicVF charts database) A promotional CD of \\"Christianity\\" was also distributed in the USWolfgang Press, The ‚Äì Christianity (discogs.com) and a video released, directed by Mark Neale,Production Notes: Other Cities (Billboard, 20 May 1995, p36) but the band was dropped by 4AD before the single could be released. The album spent one week in the UK Albums Chart at No. 75 in February 1995. Cox left the band in February 1995, shortly before the release of the album. Allen and Gray aimed to continue,The Wolfgang Press (Chaos Control Digizine, 1995) and toured the US without Cox to promote the album,World View News (Keyboard 21, 1995, p11) but later conceded the band had run its course. ===Post-Wolfgang Press and Unremembered Remembered=== A compilation album, Everything Is Beautiful (A Retrospective 1983‚Äì1995), was released in 2001. (Despite the name, it contains nothing from before 1984.) Allen records and plays live periodically with his band Geniuser with Giuseppe De Bellis, whom Allen regards as the driving force. Geniuser released the album Mud Black on the Phisteria label in 2005 and an EP called Press/Delete in 2010 on the same label. Gray played on the album. Allen also played with Gary Asquith's Lavender Pill Mob. Gray recorded under the name Limehouse Outlaw, and released an album Homegrown on his own label on 27 May 2002, with some songs co-written by Allen. Gray also recorded with the Lavender Pill Mob. Cox has contributed writing and production to a project entitled U:guru. In 1995 and 1996, after Cox had left the band and Funky Little Demons had been released, the duo of Allen and Gray had planned a follow-up album. Six songs from these sessions would be finally released on Record Store Day 2020, under the title Unremembered Remembered. The album is billed as a Mini-LP and as the band's final studio album. Although there was a seventh track recorded, the band opted not to include it on the release. ==Name== Although some sources indicate that they named themselves after German actor Wolfgang Preiss, Spin said the band claimed to have named themselves after a device that Mozart tried (unsuccessfully) to invent to type out his music.Press Conference: The Wolfgang Press squeezes the soul out of laid-back English pop. (Amy Talkington, Spin, October 1992, p30) No such device is known. Allen has stated elsewhere that the name was chosen to be \\"meaningless and open to interpretation.\\"The Mud Black Geniuser Of Michael Allen (Todd C.

He fought Evander Holyfield, George Foreman, Riddick Bowe, Michael Moorer, Chris Byrd, Ray Mercer, and Corrie Sanders, among others. Cooper challenged three times for a world title, and was known for being in several wild fights in the 1990s, including his world title bouts with Holyfield and Moorer. ==Professional career== Cooper came out of Philadelphia and was trained in his early years by ex-champ Joe Frazier, and rose in the rankings with a series of explosive knockouts in the Cruiserweight division. Unable to get a world title shot despite winning the NABF belt and defeating Olympic gold medallist Henry Tillman and future world champion Tyrone Booze, he began boxing in the heavyweight division, knocking out Willie DeWitt in 2 rounds but being stopped in 8 rounds by No. 1 ranked heavyweight contender Carl \\"The Truth\\" Williams and in 2 rounds by George Foreman. In 1990, having failed to secure a cruiserweight world title fight, Cooper moved to heavyweight permanently, knocking out top 5-ranked Orlin Norris and claiming his NABF title. He lost the title in his first defense, outpointed over 12 by undefeated Olympic gold medallist Ray Mercer in an explosive brawl. Later the same year he was KO'd in 2 rounds by fast-rising Riddick Bowe and his career looked over. However Cooper bounced back in 1991, stopping Joe Hipp in 5 rounds then being matched on short notice with Evander Holyfield for the undisputed heavyweight championship after two opponents dropped out. Cooper came off the floor in the first round to stun Holyfield in the 3rd round, the two exchanging big blows before the referee Mills Lane stopped the fight in the 7th. The fight made Cooper a big name and he would be matched in many high-profile fights over the years. In June 1992 he boxed undefeated Michael Moorer for the vacant WBO title, knocking Moorer down twice but also going down twice himself before being stopped in the 5th. Cooper's career went downhill from this point, being outpointed by veteran Mike Weaver for an obscure title in China then losing to prospects like Corrie Sanders, Chris Byrd, Fres Oquendo, and Joe Mesi. On June 18, 2010, Cooper, aged 44, made a successful comeback after eight years out of the ring, a sixth-round knockout of Corey Winfield in Winston-Salem, North Carolina. ==Personal== His hometown was Sharon Hill, Pennsylvania, United States. He was 5'11\\" (180 cm) tall. He died on May 10, 2019 from pancreatic cancer at the age of 53.https://www.boxingscene.com/heavyweight-bert-cooper- dead-53-from-pancreatic-cancer-- 138884https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/15/obituaries/bert-cooper-dead.html ==Professional boxing record== { style=\\"text-align:center; font-size:95%\\" -

The Federal Rules of Evidence contain the rules governing impeachment in US federal courts. ==Parties that may impeach== Under the common law of England, a party could not impeach its own witness unless one of four special circumstances was met. The Voucher Rule required the proponent of the witness to \\"vouch\\" for the truthfulness of the witness. Here are the special circumstances: #If the witness were an adverse party (such as the plaintiff calling the defendant to the stand, or vice versa). #If the witness were hostile (such as the witness refusing to co-operate). #If the witness were one that the party was required by law to call as a witness. #If the witness surprised the party who called him by giving damaging testimony against that party. The rule has been eliminated in many jurisdictions. Under the US Federal Rules of Evidence, Rule 607 permits any party to attack the credibility of any witness.F.R.E. 607, Cornell University Law School, Legal Information Institute ==Methods== In the US, a party has the option of discrediting a witness through impeachment by cross-examining the witness about facts that reflect poorly on the witness's credibility or, in some cases, by introducing extrinsic evidence that reflects negatively on the witness's truthfulness or knowledge. In Pennsylvania, the procedure for determining whether a testifying defendant may be impeached is known as a Bighum hearing. ==Categories== A party may impeach a witness in the US by introducing evidence of any of the following (remembered via the mnemonic BICCC) ===Bias=== Courts permit parties to cross-examine a witness in order to impeach that witness based on demonstration of bias. Witness bias may be catalyzed by any number of circumstances, ranging from the witness's blood relationship to a party to his financial stake in the outcome of the litigation. Most US jurisdictions require a cross-examiner to lay a foundation before extrinsic evidence can be used to demonstrate bias for impeachment purposes. Although Rule 610 provides that evidence of a witness's \\"religious beliefs or opinions is not admissible to attack or support the witness's credibility,\\" an inquiry into the witness's religious beliefs or opinions for the purpose of showing interest or bias because of them is not within the rule's prohibition.F.R.E. 610, Cornell University Law School, Legal Information Institute If a witness is accused of bias, and there is an opportunity to cross-examine during the current trial, any statements made at a previous trial/hearing and which are consistent with the testimony at the present trial are admissible, not hearsay. ===Inconsistent statement=== A party may impeach a witness by introducing those of his prior statements that are inconsistent with his current testimony at trial. In a minority of jurisdictions that follow FRE 801, the prior inconsistent statement may be used not only to impeach but also as substantive evidence. A prior inconsistent statement is admissible as substantive evidence if # the statement was given under penalty of perjury at a trial, hearing, or other proceeding or in a deposition; # the witness testifies at the present trial; and # the witness is subject to cross-examination about the prior statement. (801(d)(1), 2014, Federal Rules of Evidence by Muller and Kirkpatrick) A prior inconsistent statement offered solely for impeachment purposes is admissible regardless of whether it satisfies those requirements. The cross-examining attorney need not disclose or show the contents of a prior inconsistent statement to a witness prior to the moment he is questioned. If the witness's attorney asks to see the prior inconsistent statement, however, the questioning attorney must show or disclose its contents.Federal Rules of Evidence, Rule 613 ===Character=== The majority of US jurisdictions permit parties to impeach witnesses by demonstrating their \\"bad\\" character regarding truthfulness. Under the Federal Rules a party may demonstrate that by reputation or opinion testimony.F.R.E. 405(a), Cornell University Law School, Legal Information Institute That is, a witness's credibility cannot be bolstered, only impeached. Prior conviction Additionally, a party may impeach a witness for \\"bad\\" character by introducing evidence of the witness's prior conviction of a crime, subject to a series of rules laid out in 609(a).F.R.E. 609(a), Cornell University Law School, Legal Information Institute If the witness's prior conviction was for a crime involving dishonesty or false statement, evidence of that crime is admissible for impeachment purposes regardless of whether the crime was a misdemeanor or a felony. If the witness's prior conviction was for a crime not involving dishonesty or false statement, evidence of the conviction is admissible for impeachment only for felonies; misdemeanors are inadmissible. Furthermore, if the cross-examining party seeks to introduce evidence of a felony not involving dishonesty or false statement, its success in impeaching the witness will depend on whether the witness is the defendant or not. If the witness is defendant, the burden is on the prosecution to show that the probative value of the impeachment (demonstrating the defendant witness's propensity to lie) outweighs the danger of unfair prejudice to the defendant.FRE 609(a)(1)(B), Cornell University Law School, Legal Information Institute The probative value must merely outweigh unfair prejudice. If the witness is a person other than the defendant, the evidence of the prior felony conviction for a crime not involving dishonesty or false statement is admissible unless the party objecting to the evidence succeeds in the more difficult task of proving that the probative value of the felony conviction is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice to the defendant. The probative value must substantially outweigh unfair prejudice. Finally, if a conviction is more than 10 years old, the probative value of admitting the conviction must substantially outweigh the danger of unfair prejudice under FRE 609(b)F.R.E. 609(b), Cornell University Law School, Legal Information Institute No extrinsic evidence A party may impeach a witness for character by cross- examining the witness but not by introducing extrinsic evidence, about specific instances of prior misconduct, often called \\"prior bad acts,\\" as long as the questions relate to the witness's own character for truthfulness (or untruthfulness) or to the character for untruthfulness of a previous witness that the current witness has testified about before.FRE 608(b), Cornell University Law School, Legal Information Institute Under California Evidence Code Section 787,California Evidence Code ¬ß787 a party may not use either cross-examination or extrinsic evidence to impeach a witness by showing specific instances of prior misconduct. In civil cases. Proposition 8, the Victims Bill of Rights passed by in 1982, permits parties to use both cross- examination and extrinsic evidence about specific instances of prior misconduct in criminal cases to impeach a witness.Victim's Bill of Rights ¬ß28(f), as Incorporated into the California Constitution at Art. 1 ¬ß28(f)(4): \\"Any prior felony conviction of any person in any criminal proceeding, whether adult or juvenile, shall subsequently be used without limitation for purposes of impeachment or enhancement of sentence in any criminal proceeding. When a prior felony conviction is an element of any felony offense, it shall be proven to the trier of fact in open court.\\" ===Competency=== The witness was unable to sense what he claimed to have (such as he could not see from where he was), or he lacked the requisite mental capacity. Older common law would exclude an incompetent witness from testifying. Modern rules, such as the Federal Rules of Evidence, allow the witness on the stand (in most cases) to consider competence as one of many factors that juries are to consider to determine credibility of the witness. ===Contradiction=== The witness is induced to contradict their own testimony during the present proceeding. That differs from inconsistent statements above. Inconsistent statements involve statements made out-of-court (hearsay) or in prior proceedings. Contradiction involves the witness saying two different things in the same testimony. An attorney impeaching a witness during a mock trial competition. Another form of impeachment by contradiction has a subtle effect on the order in which the attorneys present their evidence. When a defense attorney calls a witness who testifies about what happened, or plaintiff's attorney or a prosecutor calls a witness in rebuttal, that gives the opposing attorney the opportunity to present evidence contradicting that witness. Had impeachment by contradiction not been allowed by the rules of evidence, the second attorney would have been barred from presenting the contradicting evidence because the second attorney already had only one chance to prove the facts of the case as claimed. Since his opponent put on a witness, that \\"opens the door\\" to strengthen the case by going again with more proof of what happened: the only legal excuse for the rehash of the claim is impeaching by contradiction his opponent's witness. Another use of impeachment by contradiction can be explained negatively. An attorney cannot contradict an opponent's witness on a trivial (\\"collateral\\") fact like the color of the hat worn on the day she witnessed the accident, but on more important matters normally excluded by the rules of relevance, contradiction may be allowed. Thus, a witness might not normally be permitted to testify being a safe driver and the opponent cannot normally prove that the driver is unsafe, but if the witness nonetheless happens to testify being a safe driver (no objection was made to the question), the opponent can now contradict by eliciting on cross-examination that the driver was involved in several accidents. Had contradiction impeachment not been permitted, the unsafe character of the witness would have been barred by the rules of evidence. Another example is more extreme. Suppose the defendant is on trial for possession of heroin. The defendant's testimony will naturally deny possessing the particular drug. Suppose the defendant foolishly testifies on direct examination, \\"In fact, I've never possessed heroin in my life.\\" The prosecutor can then, on cross-examination, impeach him with an exhibit of heroin seized on an unrelated occasion even if it was seized in violation of his Fourth Amendment rights.Walder v. United States, 347 U.S. 62 (1954) The Walder decision led to a ruling that a defendant can be impeached by his confession even if the confession was obtained in violation of his Miranda rights.Harris v. New York, 401 U.S. 222 (1971) Harris, in turn, led to a decision allowing similar impeachment by physical evidence that had been suppressed in the same case as having been seized from defendant in violation of his Fourth Amendment rights.United States v. Havens, 446 U.S. 620 (1980) Impeachment by contradiction evidence is admitted solely to impeach: it cannot be used to prove anything about the events being litigated but only to discredit the witness's credibility. The theory is that when a witness can be contradicted, it should be taken into account in determining the reliability of the witness so the jury is instructed by the judge not to use the impeachment evidence as proof of any facts but only to consider whether the witness in question should be believed. All experienced courtroom observers, however, agree that jurors will have great difficulty understanding that distinction, known as \\"limited admissibility\\" or \\"admissibility for a limited purpose\\". Even more unlikely is the prospect that a juror who understands the instruction will be psychologically capable of obeying it. The only practical impact of this limited admissibility is that the evidence cannot be used to prop up a weak case that would otherwise be dismissed by the court for insufficient evidence, as it was admitted only for the impeachment of a witness. ==Bolstering and rehabilitating== The general rule is that the proponent of a witness may not attempt to build up the witness's credibility prior to being impeached. The rationale is that the witness is presumed trustworthy. It also speeds proceedings by not spending time bolstering when the other side may not even impeach the witness. To rehabilitate a witness, the proponent is confined to using the same techniques used by the opponent to impeach the witness. That is, if the opponent impeached via bias, rehabilitation is limited to negating the claim of bias. If the opponent brought in a rebuttal witness who testified to the character of principal witness as that of a liar, rehabilitation is limited to a character witness who testifies principal witness is a truthful person. That is a different consideration from the ever-present right to cross-examine any witness, including character witnesses which in Trump's case include the likes of John Bolton. If the opponent shows that the witness made a prior inconsistent statement and implies that after that statement and prior to trial the witness was \\"gotten to\\" or otherwise developed a motive to lie in court, rehabilitation can be attempted by showing that the witness made a prior consistent statement (consistent with the testimony) before the alleged events that gave rise to the alleged motive to lie. The jury is left with two pretrial statements that are inconsistent with each other, but only one is inconsistent with the testimony, and both were made before the witness was allegedly gotten to. Thus, there might be softening of the accusation that the testimony flows from such as a bribe. Also, there is always a case for allowing a prior consistent statement made at any time before trial to help explain away what is arguably only a seemingly inconsistent statement that is subject to interpretation, such as if it was lifted out of the context that would explain the statement. ==See also== * ==References Category:Evidence law ","title":"Witness impeachment"},{"id":"2222930","text":"Morningside Manor is a suburb of Johannesburg, South Africa.

However, the series is set sometime after the destruction of the original Green Lantern Corps. In 2001, the series was collected into a single volume with a new cover by artist Eric Kohler. ==Plot== The story opens in flashback, ten years before the (at the time) current continuity of the Green Lantern comic books, showing an extraterrestrial Barin Char, the Green Lantern of Sector 1522, dying when a chestburster bursts from his chest. Hal Jordan (who, at the time of the series‚Äô publication, had long been dead) is then summoned by the Guardians of the Universe to rendezvous with fellow Green Lanterns Kilowog, Katma Tui, Tomar-Re, The Green Man and Salaak on the planet Tirama in Sector 1522. The six Green Lanterns are informed of the disappearance of Barin Char and proceed to the border world where he is believed to have disappeared. Tracing the signal from Char's displaced power ring, they enter a cavern inside a mountainous butte where they discover Char's corpse before being attacked by a swarm of Xenomorphs. Jordan decides that rather than exterminate an alien species‚Äîparticularly since the Xenomorphs appear to be only the interstellar equivalent of sharks, the perfect killing machine without actually being evil‚Äîthey would transport the Xenomorphs to the sentient Green Lantern planet Mogo, where they can not harm anyone. A decade later, the Signet Dawn, a Coluan long-range ore transport vessel, crashes onto the planet. Five extraterrestrials‚Äîthe Xudarian Tomar-Dar, Brik, Ash, M‚ÄôHdahna and the aforementioned Salaak‚Äîappear on Earth in the apartment of Kyle Rayner, who at the time, is the Green Lantern of Earth and the only Green Lantern in existence. These five are either former Green Lanterns or were intended to become Green Lanterns at the time of Parallax‚Äôs destruction of the Green Lantern Corps, and they inform Rayner of the Signet Dawn‚Äôs crash on Mogo. The six then journey to Mogo to rescue the ship's crew. Inside the hull of the ship, they encounter Crowe, the ship's first officer, who tells Rayner that after the crash, the aliens carried off the other 37 crew members but left her for some reason. Crowe leads Rayner and the others deeper into the ship, where the Xenomorphs attack them, taking Rayner's companions captive, leaving only him, Crowe, and Salaak. When Rayner tries to grab Tomar as he is pulled down a shaft, his power ring slips off his finger and falls down the shaft. The trio then climbs down the shaft‚ÄîKyle and Salaak subsequently settling any remaining tension between them when Salaak apologizes for judging Kyle by what he was not rather than what he was‚Äîand discover five of Crowe's crewmates cocooned by the Xenomorphs, four of whom have been killed by chestbursters. The Xenomorphs then attack the trio, and Crowe and Rayner flee through a passageway, separated from Salaak. They then come across a chamber where they discover a Xenomorph queen with the remainder of Crowe's crew and Rayner's companions cocooned around the walls and Rayner's power ring on the floor. After exchanging a brief kiss for luck, Crowe jumps into the chamber firing at the aliens to distract them while Rayner goes for his ring. During this attempt, the skin on the right half of Crowe's face is ripped away, revealing that she is a gynoid. Rayner reacquires his ring. Crowe, fatally damaged during the melee, tells Rayner that he shouldn't leave the Xenomorphs alive to endanger someone else in the future as Jordan did, so Rayner destroys the Xenomorphs, rescuing the surviving Signet Dawn crew and his companions. Ash, Brik and Salaak do not survive. Rayner is left with the thought that sometimes the past comes back to haunt you no matter what one does, another reminder of the legacy of Hal Jordan that looms over him. ==Collected editions== The series has been collected into a trade paperback: * Green Lantern versus Aliens (96 pages, September, Titan Books, , August 2001, Dark Horse, ) ==NotesReferences== * Category:Alien (franchise) comics Category:Green Lantern titles Category:Intercompany crossovers Category:2000 comics debuts ","title":"Green Lantern Versus Aliens"},{"id":"2222945","text":"is a Japanese voice actor affiliated with Vozator Voice Production.

In the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans, it extends across the equator to about 5 degrees north. Within the southern hemisphere, the South Equatorial Current is the westward limb of the very large-scale subtropical gyres. These gyres are driven by the combination of trade winds in the tropics and westerly winds that are found south of about 30 degrees south, through a rather complicated process that includes western boundary current intensification. On the equator, the South Equatorial Current is driven directly by the trade winds which blow from east to west. In the Indian Ocean, the westward-flowing South Equatorial Current is well-developed only south of the equator. Directly on the equator, the winds reverse twice a year due to the monsoons, and so the surface current can be either eastward or westward. == See also == * Brazil-Malvinas Confluence * Ocean current * Oceanic gyres * Physical oceanography Category:Currents of the Atlantic Ocean Category:Currents of the Indian Ocean Category:Currents of the Pacific Ocean ","title":"South Equatorial Current"},{"id":"2222957","text":"Daeboreum (ÎåÄÎ≥¥Î¶Ñ; literally \\"Great Full Moon\\") is a Korean holiday that celebrates the first full moon of the new year of the lunar Korean calendar which is the Korean version of the First Full Moon Festival. This holiday is accompanied by many traditions. == Origins == The record about the origin of Daeboreum is recorded in the book Samguk-yusa (in Korean: ÏÇºÍµ≠Ïú†ÏÇ¨), where it says that a crow led the 21st King of Silla, Soji to shoot the geomungo (a Korean instrument) case, which was actually where a monk and the royal concubine were committing adultery. After this happening, on the first day of the pig, rat and horse years, people had behaved prudently, and also the 15th of January was called 'Ohgiil' (in Korean: Ïò§Í∏∞Ïùº) and offered sacrifice to heaven this day. Also the origins of Daeboreum can be recognized by some customs listed in books, such as Samguk-sagi (in Korean: ÏÇºÍµ≠ÏÇ¨Í∏∞) and Silla-bongi (in Korean: Ïã†ÎùºÎ≥∏Í∏∞), describing of lantern lighting. The lantern lighting custom in Daeboreum was inherited constantly- Annals of the Joseon Dynasty, the book of Taejong, 13th year has the record about the same custom clearly. ==Traditions== * Bureom (Korean: Î∂ÄÎüºÍπ®Í∏∞): People crack nuts with one's teeth, believing that this will keep one's teeth healthy for the year. * Dalmaji (Korean: Îã¨ÎßûÏù¥): In the countryside, people climb mountains, braving cold weather, trying to catch the first rise of the moon. It is said that the first person to see the moon rise will have good luck all year or a wish will be granted. * Jwibulnori (Korean: Ï•êÎ∂àÎÜÄÏù¥): A traditional game that is played the night before Daeboreum. They burn the dry grass on ridges between rice fields while children whirl around cans full of holes, through which charcoal fire blaze. These cans fertilize the fields and get rid of harmful worms that destroy the new crops. * Gisaebae (Korean: Í∏∞ÏÉàÎ∞∞): It is a ceremony that farmer's bands in each towns gather together and greet each other in pecking order. Also a competition is held between the bands. * Bangsaeng (Korean: Î∞©ÏÉù): On the night before Daeboreum, the ladies bought jellyfish and put them on the river and wished good luck for the year. * Stealing Bokto (Korean: Î≥µÌÜ†ÌõîÏπòÍ∏∞): People took some mud from the houses of the rich and covered it on their walls on the night before Daeboreum, wishing they would be wealthy, too. * Yongaltteugi (Korean: Ïö©ÏïåÎú®Í∏∞): The night before Daeboreum, people wait until a rooster cries and then draw water from a well. It is believed that the one who fetched water first, there will have a good rice harvest that year. * Daribalgi (Korean: Îã§Î¶¨Î∞üÍ∏∞): It is told that people walked on the bridges all night long, believing that if the step on a bridge, their legs will be strong. It is believed they would be healthy during all twelve months if they step on twelve bridges. * Deowipalgi (Korean: ÎçîÏúÑÌåîÍ∏∞): When Someone see a person in the morning, he or she hurries to call his or her name to say \\"Buy my heat\\". It is believed that one would escape the scorching heat that summer. * Gaeboreumsoegi (Korean: Í∞úÎ≥¥Î¶ÑÏá†Í∏∞): People do not feed their dogs believing that dogs will crock up and be infested with flies if they are fed during the coming summer. * Mogitbul (Korean: Î™®ÍπÉÎ∂à): At the dawn of Daeboreum, people put a straw fire on their yard to eliminate mosquitos and other insects. ==Food== ogokbap and boreum namul The traditional foods of Daeboreum have a lot of connections with superstition. * People drink cold 'Guibargi Wine' in the morning, believing one will only hear good news all year round and will hear better. * The nutcracking that is described in the book, has been widely spread not only in Korea but also in China and Japan, and it is being performed on New Year's Day, too. * There is also a custom of eating ogokbap (Ïò§Í≥°Î∞• or chalbap, Ï∞∞Î∞•) and yakbap (ÏïΩÎ∞•) around Daeboreum. Yakbap is made by steaming glutinous rice and mixing jujube, chestnut, pine nuts, oil, honey, and soy sauce together. In South Jeolla Province (Ï†ÑÎùºÎÇ®ÎèÑ), people steamed it with a 'siru' (ÏãúÎ£®) steamer and gave it to the castellan, so it is called 'castellan rice' or 'siru rice'. * People eat a lot of dinner early on the 14th and early on the morning of the 15th, which means to be diligent throughout the year. Also it is said that it is better to eat the food of the neighbors. This is called hometown rice (ÏÑ∏ÏÑ±Î∞õÏù¥Î∞•). If you make dinner late, you may lose a dinner to the invited neighbors, so people made an early dinner and invite the neighbors from 2 pm. Also in , it is described about a similar tradition of 'Baekgaban' in Jeollanam-do ‚Äì children go to get rice in the morning from the neighbors in Daeboreum. Gyeongnam has the same tradition. They believe it is good for their health. * There is a tradition of eating a selection of certain seasoned vegetables referred to as boreum namul (Î≥¥Î¶Ñ ÎÇòÎ¨º, or mugeun namul Î¨µÏùÄ ÎÇòÎ¨º) as well as bokssam (Î≥µÏåà): Dishes made from dried vegetables, left over from the previous year (e.g. pumpkin leaves, radish greens, eggplant, mushrooms, ferns) are believed to enable one to cope with the heat in the next summer, when eaten on Daeboreum. Eating bokssam, which is rice wrapped in leafy vegetables, is supposed to bring luck (bok, Î≥µ, Á¶è). * In Jeollanam-do, the barley rice is put into a bowl with herbs and placed on a straw or a wall to give to the crow. There is a similar report in Jeonbuk and Chungbuk. The crow is now an ominous bird, but in the past, it was a sacred bird, also a symbol of the sun. 'crow's sacrifice' and 'crow's rice' are described in Samguk Yusa. ==Gallery== Image:Korea-Daeboreumnal-Full Moon Festival-03.jpg Image:Korea-Daeboreumnal-Full Moon Festival-09.jpg Image:Korea-Daeboreumnal-Full Moon Festival-23.jpg Image:Korea-Daeboreumnal- Full Moon Festival-12.jpg == See also == *First Full Moon Festival **Lantern Festival, in China **Kosh≈çgatsu, in Japan *Chotrul Duchen, a festival celebrated in Tibet as an Uposatha day and falls on or around the same day as Daeboreum *Magha Puja, a festival celebrated in Thailand, Sri Lanka, Myanmar, Cambodia and Laos on or around the same day as Daeboreum *List of Korea- related topics *Public holidays in North Korea *Public holidays in South Korea ==References * First full moon festivals attract sightseers nationwide at Ministry of Culture and Tourism of South Korea * 2008 Jeongwol Daeboreum Fire Festival at Korea Tourism Organization Category:Buddhist holidays Category:Cultural festivals in South Korea Category:Folk festivals in South Korea Category:Food and drink festivals in South Korea Category:January observances Category:February observances Category:March observances Category:Observances held on the full moon Category:Observances set by the Korean calendar Category:Public holidays in Korea Category:Winter events in South Korea ","title":"Daeboreum"},{"id":"2222971","text":"Stewart Park is a municipal park operated by the city of Ithaca, New York on the southern end of Cayuga Lake, the largest of New York's Finger Lakes. ==Park description== The park offers space and facilities for outdoor recreation such as frisbee, tennis, baseball, softball, and fishing. The park has a carousel that operates throughout the summer. In addition, there is a playground with slides and a fountain, along with sheltered areas for picnics and large gatherings. The park is also equipped with grills dispersed around the grounds for barbecuing. The Cayuga Waterfront Trail runs through the park. Fall Creek empties into Cayuga Lake through Stewart Park. Stewart Park is also the location of the Cascadilla Boat Club's boathouse. The Fuertes Bird Sanctuary sits at the southern end of the park, and it is bordered on the west by the City of Ithaca's municipal golf course. ==History== Stewart Park was originally part of Military Lot 88, a tract of land granted to Andrew Moody after the end of the Revolutionary War. Moody sold the land to James Renwick on December 12, 1790. It remained in his family for 104 years as an undeveloped parcel of land. In the early 1890s, of Renwick land was purchased by the Cascadilla School to build athletic facilities. At the same time, a trolley line leading to Cayuga Lake was constructed by the Cayuga Lake Electric Railway Company, who also set about developing an amusement park near the lake. The group of properties became known as Renwick Park, and opened to the public in 1894. Upon opening, the park contained a zoo, a merry-go-round and a renovated dance pavilion for use as Ithaca's first vaudeville theater. However, in 1908, a decrease in the public's use of the railway system led to the dissolution of the Cayuga Lake Electric Railway Company; the company was replaced by the Renwick Park and Traffic Association. Trolley access to the park was completely discontinued in 1915. While this occurred, adjacent to the park were set aside as a bird sanctuary, maintained by the Cayuga Bird Club. Now known as the Fuertes Bird Sanctuary, it was named after a former club president upon his death in 1927. The park officially closed in 1915, after which the land was leased to The Whartons film studio during Ithaca's brief heyday as a silent film production center from 1915 to 1919. In 1920, Mayor Edwin C. Stewart declared during his inauguration speech that it was a \\"travesty\\" that Ithaca residents couldn't enjoy the lake without trespassing on private property. In 1921, the City of Ithaca purchased the former Renwick Park land and opened it to the public. Mayor Stewart died before the official opening of the park on July 4, and it was renamed in his honor. In 1934, the park's land was raised by several feet to reduce flooding. Bridge in Stewart Park Although swimming had previously been allowed at the park, since 1964 a prohibition against swimming has been strongly enforced. The ban came about after a boy drowned when turbid, sediment-laden water prevented lifeguards from seeing him. Conditions particular to the lake, including the quantity of sediment at the lake's bottom and the prevailing currents at the lake's southern end, cause such murky and turbid conditions to be common, necessitating the ban on swimming. A section of the Cayuga Waterfront Trail was completed in 2010, linking the Farmers Market at Steamboat Landing to the Visitors Center. This portion of the trail winds through Stewart Park and the Fuertes Bird Sanctuary. In 2011, the Friends of Stewart Park began a wide- ranging rehabilitation and restoration project for Stewart Park.Ithaca Journal, \\"Wide-Ranging Makeover Pitched for Stewart Park\\", May 17 2011 This effort began with the renovation of the Mayor Stewart Memorial Flagpole garden.Ithaca Journal, \\"Event to Mark Work at Stewart Park\\", Nov 1 2011 Since that time, Friends of Stewart Park in partnership with the City of Ithaca, have lead a major revitalizaiton effort including reconstruction of the small Tea Pavilion, restoration of the large Picnic Pavilion, restoration of the swan pond overlook, roof replacements on the Wharton Building and Cascadilla Boathouse, and many smaller improvements throughout the park. Further planned improvements include an accessible playground and splash pad, full exterior restoration on the Cascadilla Boathouse and creation of the Wharton Studio Museum and Park Visitor Center in the Wharton Building that housed the film studio. ==Historic Buildings and Landmarks of Stewart Park== *Cacadilla Boathouse in Stewart Park circa 1895Cacadilla Boathouse - Built starting in 1894, this building is still used today by the Cascadilla Boat Club rowing organization. The building was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1991. * Large Picnic Pavilion - Designed by architects Clarence Vivian and Arthur Gibb, apprentices to prominent Ithaca architect William Henry Miller, the Picnic Pavilion was constructed around 1895 as part of an Italianate-inspired architectural theme, with peristyle columned porch and semi-circular door and window features. The Picnic Pavilion was most recently restored in 2019. It is available for rent through the City of Ithaca. * Small Tea Pavilion - Designed by Clarence Vivian and Arthur Gibb and originally built in 1895, the Tea Pavilion once served as the welcoming point for visitors to the park, and was the last stop on the trolley ride to Renwick Park from downtown Ithaca. The open-air pavilion was moved several times within the park, but landed in its current location in the 1950s when the playground and Carousel were installed. By 2011 the building had fallen into disrepair. The origninal structure was torn down, but was rebuilt to its original design. It is available for rent through the City of Ithaca. Large Picnic Pavilion in Stewart Park circa 1900 * Fuertes Overlook - the \\"Swan Pond\\" overlook was built by the Cayuga Bird Club in 1934 for ease of pond observation and restored in 2017 by Friends of Stewart Park. * Renwick Wildwood Arch - Designed by Louis Agassiz Fuertes and constructed by the Cayuga Bird Club in 1917, this arch was made to mark the approach to the Renwick Wildwood. *Carousel -Designed by the Allan Herschell Company and installed in 1951, the Stewart Park Carousel has been in continuous seasonal operation since. Carousel horses were repainted in 1986 by Trumansburg artist Annie Campbell and again in 2014 by Ithaca artists Christi Sobel and Julia John. A new black metal fence was installing in 2016 and an accessible wheelchair ramp and chariot were added in 2018. == References  *City of Ithaca: Stewart Park *Friends of Stewart Park Category:Ithaca, New York Category:Parks in Tompkins County, New York Category:Tourist attractions in Ithaca, New York ","title":"Stewart Park (Ithaca, New York)"},{"id":"2222972","text":"Lah may refer to: *Lah (surname) * Lithium aluminium hydride * Lah, Victoria, a locality in Australia * Lah, Kona, a village in Kona Department, Mouhoun Province, Burkina Faso * Lah, Yaba, a village in Yaba Department, Nayala Province, Burkina Faso * A Singlish/Manglish term used for emphasis or reassurance ","title":"Lah"},{"id":"2222975","text":"Northern Acres is a suburb of Johannesburg, South Africa.

[1956] p. 20f; 3rd ed. [1978] p. 13 Sir Thomas Innes of Learney, Lord Lyon King of Arm, also states, \\"Technically, a grant of arms from the Lord Lyon is a patent of nobility (also referred to a 'Diploma of Nobility'); the Grantee is thereby 'enrolled with all nobles in the noblesse of Scotland.\\"Burnett, Charles J and Dennis, Mark D. Scotland's Heraldic Heritage; The Lion Rejoicing The Stationery Office, Edinburgh, 1997 In 2018 the Lord Lyon quietly dropped the so called nobility clause from newly issued Letters Patent. According to the 2nd edition of Scots Heraldry at p. 198, Sir Thomas Innes of Learney, Lord Lyon writes: :: ‚ÄúThe name in which a person is granted arms is, however, a ‚Äòname of dignity‚Äô (i.e., of the dignity of Gentleman) and in the nature of a 'title' if it comprehends a feudal designation.‚Äù As such, a Scottish armiger is recognized under Scottish heraldic law as within the non-peerage rank of Gentleman, which is so recognized under Scots law as a social dignity. Given this court decision, the term \\"nobility\\" should be avoided, as it has long been confined in Britain to the peerage, or someone of official social rank (Dukes, Marquises, Earls, Viscounts, Barons, etc.). Instead, it is more appropriate to use the term Noblesse in the context of the French definition, which includes the non- peerage rank of Gentlemen. A Gentleman is the lowest rank of gentry, standing below an esquire and above a yeoman. It includes the untitled and minor nobility - the noblesse, to whom rightly belong lairds (those with territorial designations), Esquires and Gentlemen, \\"known\\" through the grant or matriculation of armorial bearings. The dignity of Esquire (post-nominal Esq.) is an official title in Scotland, unlike other parts of the world. For example, attorneys in the United States use \\"Esquire\\" as a courtesy title, and it is used by both men and women. In Scotland, the title is exclusively used by men, never women. Scottish armigers who are not peers, feudal barons, or lairds with territorial designations are addressed in correspondence as a post nominal Esq. by the Court of the Lord Lyon. If associated with a particular Scottish clan, armigers are the noblesse gentry of their clan, with a duty and responsibility for the management of their clan in our time; and thereby bound to the principles of noblesse oblige. ==See also== * British Catholic noble families ==References== Category:Medieval Scottish nobility Category:Scottish culture ","title":"Noblesse"},{"id":"2222981","text":"Norwood is a rapidly gentrifying suburb of Johannesburg, South Africa.

This was in part because the majority of residents in Orange Grove were primarily Italians who had immigrated from Italy in search of work during the early 1950s. Portuguese, Jewish and Afrikaans cultures were also present albeit in smaller concentrations. Despite the fact that Orange Grove was colloquially known as 'Little Italy', the mixture of these cultures provided a truly cosmopolitan, European, feel on its main thoroughfare, Louis Botha Avenue, during any day of the week. The Italian Club, an important center for the ethnic community, relocated to Bedfordview in the 1980s, marking the beginning of the decline of Orange Grove as an ethnic enclave. ==Parks and greenspace== Orange Grove boasts a park which is frequented by residents from surrounding suburbs and in the past most of its residents would utilise Hoy Park Public Pools for recreation, in Sydenham. It is rare for a home to possess a pool in Orange Grove, but many more prominent dwellings in the area do have. A popular place for children of the area to meet was Patterson Park, in front of the Norwood Police Flats. The area was previously a recreational hub, with pools, tennis courts, athletic lawns, and sporting fields. Today however all that remains is the derelict bowls club house. ==Law and governmentCrime=== Post 1994, the 90's saw a decline in the area as safety and security became a problem. Most of the previously manicured lawns and neat facades which were visible from the streets over low walls were replaced by high walls with electric fences, barbed wire and alarm systems. The Norwood Police Station, services the area. Most of the night clubs, cafes, restaurants and bioscopes (movie theaters) subsequently shut down. ==Education== Orange Grove possesses a library and two Primary Schools, Orange Grove Primary School and Linksfield Primary School. Traditionally, residents attended one of the two Primary Schools then moved to Highlands North High School for boys and Waverly Girls' High School for girls respectively. These four schools have serviced Orange Grove for over three generations and have withstood the rigours of political and social upheaval. ==References== Category:Ethnic enclaves in South Africa Category:Italian-South African culture Category:Johannesburg Region E Category:Little Italys ","title":"Orange Grove, Gauteng"},{"id":"2223005","text":"Orchards is a suburb of Pretoria in Gauteng, South Africa.

The phrase was coined in 1844 by American poet and author Nathaniel Parker Willis.Allen, Irving Lewis. The City in Slang: New York Life and Popular Speech. New York: Oxford University Press, 1993: 222. Soon, the term came to be used to describe the upper circles not only of New York, but also those of other major cities. ==Usages== In 1852, Charles Astor Bristed published a collection of sketches on New York Society entitled \\"The Upper Ten Thousand\\" in Fraser Magazine. In 1854, George Lippard serialized his book New York: Its Upper Ten and Lower Million. The phrase also appeared in British fiction in The Adventures of Philip (1861‚Äì62) by William Thackeray, whose eponymous hero contributed weekly to a fashionable New York journal entitled The Gazette of the Upper Ten Thousand. The general acceptance of the term seems to be attested by its use in the title of Edward Abbott's 1864 cookery book, The English and Australian Cookery Book: Cookery for the Many as Well as the \\"Upper Ten Thousand\\". In 1875, both Adam Bissett Thom and Kelly's Directory published books entitled The Upper Ten Thousand, which listed members of the aristocracy, the gentry, officers in the British Army and Navy, members of Parliament, colonial administrators, and members of the Church of England. The usage of this term was a response to the broadening of the British ruling class which had been caused by the Industrial Revolution. Most of the people listed in Kelly's Handbook to the Upper Ten Thousand were among the 30,000 descendants of Edward III, King of England, tabulated in the Marquis of Ruvigny and Raineval's Plantagenet Roll of the Blood Royal.Marquis of Ruvigny and Raineval (1903).

It is located in Region E of the City of Johannesburg Metropolitan Municipality. Rivonia is one of the most affluent residential and business suburbs of Johannesburg, and regarded as the hub of upstart and established I.T. companies. The main retail thoroughfare in the area, Rivonia Boulevard, is the location of several shopping complexes as well as many other shops and restaurants. The area known as Rivonia includes the original township of Edenburg, Edenburg Extension 1, and 19 smaller extensions designated 'Rivonia Extension ...', numbered from 0 to 25. There is no designated township (in the legal sense) called Rivonia. The post code for Rivonia is 2128. ==History == Rivonia lies between the Braamfontein Spruit and the Sandspruit, and was the location of Liliesleaf Farm (), where in 1963 many of the accused in the Rivonia Treason Trial were arrested. The earliest public transport into Johannesburg was by donkey cart, later by bus. A Carmelite Convent, accommodating Discalced Carmelite Nuns, sat in the centre of the village until displaced by commercial pressures. (They moved to Benoni.) In a commemorative move, the large shopping centre first built on the site was named The Cloisters. The earlier village lay on the direct path of access along Rivonia Road to the south to the new 'concrete' highway, with a nasty dogleg in the road at 12th Avenue. When it was decided to redesign and improve Rivonia Road through to the highway, the bowling greens and tennis courts of the Rivonia Recreation Club were in the way, and the Club relocated to a handsome new site in Achter Road in Paulshof, leaving only the Rivonia Hall and Library on the original site. Rivonia Produce, a landmark and long established family business, supplying inter alia hay to the many local horse owners, was also forced to move from the dogleg on 12th Avenue to a new building on 11th Avenue. It has since been swallowed into a national hardware chain and disappeared. ==Economy== Hewlett-Packard's main Southern Africa and South Africa office and the registered office of Fujitsu in South Africa are in Rivonia.\\"Office Locations.\\" Hewlett-Packard South Africa.

The station was opened on 1 May 1957 as the first stage of the extension of the Frunzenskiy radius. As the radius follows the bend of the Moskva river, the whole segment had to be built very deep (42 metres/138 ft for Frunzenskaya). The station closed on 2 January 2016 for renovation, which was expected to last 14 months. The renovations were completed ahead of schedule with the station reopening on December 29, 2016. The renovations included the installation of four new escalators to replace the three that had been in place. Metro authorities projected that the new escalators would reduce energy consumption by 40% and increase the capacity by one-third. == Architecture == The station is also symbolic as being one of the last in Moscow to be fully built in Stalinist style which dominated the Metro Architecture since the mid-1940s, afterwards the station designs show evidence of more vivid decorations that were meant to be installed yet designs were simplified (examples include the station VDNKh and Alexeyevskaya). Frunzenskaya still stands out and architects Robert Pogrebnoi and Yuriy Zenkivich applied a pylon design with cream marbled vaults and tops of pylons, decorated with metallic shields containing a five-sided star. The bottom of Pylons are a form of a thicker red marble base. Suspended from the ceiling are massive eight-horned chandeliers. The floor is covered with black and red granite on floors and the walls are faced with white ceramic tiles. In the far end of the station, in front of a red-marbled semicircle is a bust to Mikhail Frunze (work of sculptor Yevgeny Vuchetich), a famous military commander in the Russian Civil War for whom the station is named. The station's massive vestibule (architects Nadia Bykova, Ivan Taranov, I.G.

No longer able to play football, he dropped out of school and returned home, taking a job with a theater group, People's Light and Theatre Company. There he worked on sound and lighting as part of the stage crew responsible for set construction. He had a painful accident on the set, cutting off the end of his left thumb. His resulting medical compensation paid for attendance at the Lee Strasberg Theater Institute in New York City. Pasdar was also selected to play a bit part as a police officer in the Dixie Chicks video for their song, \\"Goodbye Earl\\". The music video won both the Academy of Country Music and the Country Music Association's Video of the Year Awards in 2000. === Film === At the age of 19, he auditioned for a role in Top Gun. Director Tony Scott was so impressed that he wrote the part of \\"Chipper\\" just for him. This led to bigger roles in Solarbabies (1986), Streets of Gold (1986), and Kathryn Bigelow's cult vampire movie Near Dark (1987), with Pasdar in the lead role of Caleb Colton. Other major roles include Vital Signs (1990). Pasdar got his biggest break in movies, when he starred as a beautiful woman opposite Julie Walters in the British movie Just Like a Woman. In 1992, he left Hollywood and returned to New York, working as a cashier for room and board, while taking the occasional small part, such as Frankie in Brian De Palma's Carlito's Way (1993). Adrian Pasdar wrote and directed the short film Beyond Belief and directed his first feature film, the art-house neo-noir Cement, a contemporary re-telling of Othello, in 1999.

In 2006, he had a high- profile guest role as Gabrielle Solis's sleazy lawyer in Desperate Housewives. He starred as Nathan Petrelli in the NBC superhero drama Heroes. Pasdar based his mysterious character on \\"the most morally liquid characters\\" that he's encountered in his life. The character is not based on one particular political figure, but on a melange of different ones, both good and bad. Pasdar's character was killed off in an episode that aired November 30, 2009. Pasdar voices Hawkeye in the animated series The Super Hero Squad Show and voiced Captain America in the Black Panther animated series. Having also voiced Iron Man in the English dub of the Iron Man anime series, Pasdar reprised the role in Marvel's Avengers Assemble (seasons 1‚Äì3), Ultimate Spider-Man, and Hulk and the Agents of S.M.A.S.H..

On July 5, 2017, Maines announced that she and Pasdar were divorcing after 17 years of marriage. The divorce was finalized on December 19, 2019. The divorce took over 2 years as Pasdar was contesting the validity of the pre-nuptial agreement and attempted to plead poverty to the court to obtain spousal support, despite reporting over $400,000 in income in 2018, according to court documents. Maines said that The Chicks' 2020 album Gaslighter includes songs with deeply personal themes, written during the divorce. The album surrounds the topic of a husband gaslighting and cheating on his wife, ending with the dissolution of the marriage. Pasdar is a guitarist for charity rock band Band from TV. Part of the proceeds from the band's concerts go to his nominated charity, the Rush Epilepsy Center. ==Awards and nominations== Award Wins for Acting *2009: Academy of Science Fiction, Fantasy & Horror Films: Saturn Award for Best Supporting Actor in Television, Heroes Award Wins for Directing *2000: AngelCiti film festival: Audience Award, Cement Other Award Wins *2009 (ensemble): Hollywood Note Foundation's Change the World Awards, Humanitarian Award of Inspiration: Band From TV ==Filmography== {  - ccc; text- align:center;\\"  Year  Title  Role  Other notes -  rowspan=\\"3\\" 1986  Top Gun  Lieutenant (navy)Lieutenant Charles \\"Chipper\\" Piper  Film Debut -  Solarbabies  Darstar  -  Streets of Gold  Timmy Boyle  -  rowspan=\\"2\\" 1987  Made in U.S.A.

Retrieved: May 9, 2012. After making his first solo flight, he was accepted into the Army Air Service with an under-age waiver. The day that he was to report to the recruiting station, the armistice was signed, ending his prospects for a military flying career. Instead, Ryan went to Oregon State College and studied Engineering for less than a year, then was accepted into the Aeronautical Division of the U.S. Army (later known as the United States Army Air Corps). With the Army, Ryan learned to fly at March Field, California, where he graduated in 1921\\"T. Claude Ryan.\\" allstar. Retrieved: May 9, 2012. with a pursuit pilot rating. Ryan flew forestry patrol duty until his enlistment ended in 1922. Ryan then went to San Diego and sold barnstorming rides to pay for a military surplus Curtiss JN-4 Jenny. ==Business careerBeginnings=== Ryan's first employee was William Hawley Bowlus, who had been the mechanic at the first flying school Ryan attended. One of his students was a wealthy young stock broker and real-estate developer named Benjamin Franklin Mahoney. Ryan sold half of the Ryan Flying Company to B. F. Mahoney on April 25, 1925. With Mahoney's funding, they bought Donald Douglas's first complete aircraft, the Douglas Cloudster, which Douglas had built to attempt the first non-stop transcontinental flight. A broken engine part grounded that flight in El Paso, Texas and by the time they had made the necessary repairs, a pair of military pilots accomplished the feat in a Fokker. Bowlus modified the Cloudster to carry 10 passengers. With the modified Cloudster and three Standards that Bowlus had modified to carry four passengers each, they founded \\"The San Diego - Los Angeles Airlines,\\" the first all-year airplane passenger service in the United States. It began operation on March 1, 1925 ferrying passengers on a regular schedule between San Diego, California and Los Angeles, California. ===Ryan Airlines=== Waterhouse Cruzair photo from L'Air November 15, 1926 The company's next venture was to build aircraft to fit the requirements of the new Airmail service. The first aircraft this company, Ryan Airlines, produced was called the Ryan M-1 mail plane developed in 1926. It was the first production monoplane in the country. The so-called Ryan M-1 of the 1920s is in actuality a monoplane designed and engineered by William J. Waterhouse of Glendale, California's Grand Central Airport in 1924 (Waterhouse and Royer Airplane Company). In 1925, Ryan purchased construction blueprints of the Waterhouse/Royer Monoplane \\"Cruzair.\\" William Hawley Bowlus built the craft in a San Diego waterfront cannery building. Ryan painted his logo on the plane's rudder and immediately marketed it as the Ryan M-1. In an effort to disclaim plagiary, Ryan displayed his copy of the monoplane on an elevated platform at the airfield (Dutch Flat in San Diego), sporting a large banner saying \\"Built in San Diego\\" (photo on file at San Diego Air and Space Museum, 2001 Pan American Plaza, Balboa Park, San Diego, CA 92101). Compounding and confusing the historical origins of the M-1, Ryan submitted Waterhouse's Cruzair design to the U.S. Patent Office as his own, and in 1929 Ryan was awarded \\"inventor\\" status for Waterhouse's monoplane design. Ryan sold his half interest in their three companies: the 'Ryan Flying Company'; 'The San Diego - Los Angeles Airlines'; and 'Ryan Airlines' to his business partner, B. F. \\"Frank\\" Mahoney on November 23, 1926, and was kept on the payroll until the end of that year. Ryan often made claims to have remained to manage it long after that, though this fact is in contention by various sources.Cassagneres 2002, p. 44. What is known is that Ryan was not present when Donald A. Hall was hired and was never present when Charles Lindbergh arrived or during the production of the famous aircraft, this according to personal letters between Charles Lindbergh and the designer Donald A. Hall.\\"Letter 01.\\" charleslindbergh.com. Retrieved: May 9, 2012.\\"Letter 02.\\" charleslindbergh.com. Retrieved: May 9, 2012.\\"Letter 03.\\" charleslindbergh.com.

Ryan thus was probably not approached by a group of St. Louis, Missouri, businessmen to build an aircraft to cross the Atlantic non-stop (to be flown by Charles A. Lindbergh). It is unclear where the source of the previous reports originated. Ryan had no financial interest in the company and made no financial gain from the NYP project. ===The Ryan Aeronautical Corporation=== Ryan used the funds from the sale of Ryan Airlines to buy the US distribution rights to the German Siemens & Halske radial engines, and began that enterprise as soon as the deal was final. He took delivery of his first two engines in December 1926 and mounted the first on the new Ryan M-2 airframe he received from Mahoney as a part of their dissolution agreement. That M-2 with the Siemens & Halske engine became Ryan's sales tool. In late January 1927, he toured the country attempting to sell these engines. Returning to San Diego that summer, he formed the T. C. Ryan Flying School. In October of that year, formed the first Ryan Aeronautical Corporation to sell those engines. Soon after, he became embroiled in a lawsuit with the Mahoney-Ryan Aircraft Corporation, now based in Anglum, Missouri over his use of the \\"Ryan\\" name (the dissolution agreement with Mahoney forbade him from doing so without the letters \\"T. C.\\" attached to the front. That lawsuit coupled with his failure to make good on his agreement to begin manufacturing the Siemens & Halske engines stateside (which he renamed 'Ryan-Seimens') caused his relationship with the engine manufacturer to sour. The German-based Siemens & Halske company bought him out in 1928. Ryan then took a hiatus. Little is known of Ryan's dealings during that hiatus. It has been inferred that Ryan was instrumental in getting newly- formed land created when dredged material was deposited between the factory where the Spirit of St. Louis was built and Dutch Flats, the airfield it flew from. This resulted from San Diego city fathers enacting a bond measure to deepen San Diego Harbor so that merchant ships and the Navy's newest aircraft carriers could safely navigate the harbor. ===The \\"new\\" Ryan Aeronautical Corporation=== In 1931, Ryan opened a flying school in San Diego, which he named the 'Ryan School of Aeronautics'.\\"Ryan.\\" New Zealand Warbirds. Retrieved: May 9, 2012. This company was one of many around the country (including, among others, the Parks College with campuses in Tulsa, OK, and St. Louis, MO) that served the government's need for trained pilots through the Civilian Pilot Training Program as they were increasing their readiness for what would become World War II. Dissatisfied with the trainer aircraft available at the time, Ryan decided to produce his own, and returned to manufacturing. Thus, in 1932, he formed the 'new' Ryan Aeronautical Corporation, the second incarnation of the Ryan Aeronautical Company, which became known as \\"Ryan Aircraft\\". It was the fourth new company to bear his name, and the last one he would form. The plane it was to manufacture took two years to complete, and in 1934 the Ryan ST flew for the first time. The ST was a very successful design, and many believe it to be one of the most beautiful aircraft ever built. Over the years, it was developed into a series of aircraft that were widely used by civilian organizations and military worldwide. Ryan Aeronautical Corporation is also famous for producing the Q-2 Firebee and related aircraft, some of the most famous and common UAVs in the 20th century, with extensive use in the Vietnam War. Ryan Aeronautical Corporation produced many aircraft over the years, most of them trainers. Ryan again sold out his entire interest in a company he had founded, when in 1969, he sold Ryan Aeronautical Corp. to the Teledyne Corporation. That company, renamed Teledyne-Ryan, has always claimed to be the successor of the company that built the Spirit of St. Louis, but they had no connection to the Ryan Airlines other than the fact that Ryan founded them both. They produced a series of pilotless drones and airframes for the Apache helicopter. Teledyne later sold that latter company to Northrop Grumman. ==Later years== After his retirement Ryan formed a new company with his son Jerome to develop and market the Ryan ST-100 Cloudster, a motor glider the elder Ryan had designed. The aircraft was type certified as both a light aircraft and powered glider, but Ryan died before production was commenced and only one was completed.Said, Bob. \\"1983 Sailplane Directory.\\" Soaring Magazine, Soaring Society of America, November 1983, p. 126.\\"Type Certificate Data Sheet No. A7NM.\\" Federal Aviation Administration, July 1983.

Neither the standard model of particle physics, nor the theory of general relativity provides a known explanation for why this should be so, and it is a natural assumption that the universe is neutral with all conserved charges. The Big Bang should have produced equal amounts of matter and antimatter. Since this does not seem to have been the case, it is likely some physical laws must have acted differently or did not exist for matter and antimatter. Several competing hypotheses exist to explain the imbalance of matter and antimatter that resulted in baryogenesis. However, there is as of yet no consensus theory to explain the phenomenon. As remarked in a 2012 research paper, \\"The origin of matter remains one of the great mysteries in physics.\\" ==Sakharov conditions== In 1967, Andrei Sakharov proposed and in Russian, republished as a set of three necessary conditions that a baryon-generating interaction must satisfy to produce matter and antimatter at different rates. These conditions were inspired by the recent discoveries of the cosmic background radiation and CP violation in the neutral kaon system. The three necessary \\"Sakharov conditions\\" are: * Baryon number B violation. * C-symmetry and CP-symmetry violation. * Interactions out of thermal equilibrium. ===Baryon number violation=== Baryon number violation is obviously a necessary condition to produce an excess of baryons over anti-baryons. But C-symmetry violation is also needed so that the interactions which produce more baryons than anti- baryons will not be counterbalanced by interactions which produce more anti- baryons than baryons. CP-symmetry violation is similarly required because otherwise equal numbers of left-handed baryons and right-handed anti-baryons would be produced, as well as equal numbers of left-handed anti-baryons and right-handed baryons. Finally, the interactions must be out of thermal equilibrium, since otherwise CPT symmetry would assure compensation between processes increasing and decreasing the baryon number. Currently, there is no experimental evidence of particle interactions where the conservation of baryon number is broken perturbatively: this would appear to suggest that all observed particle reactions have equal baryon number before and after. Mathematically, the commutator of the baryon number quantum operator with the (perturbative) Standard Model hamiltonian is zero: [B,H] = BH - HB = 0. However, the Standard Model is known to violate the conservation of baryon number only non-perturbatively: a global U(1) anomaly. To account for baryon violation in baryogenesis, such events (including proton decay) can occur in Grand Unification Theories (GUTs) and supersymmetric (SUSY) models via hypothetical massive bosons such as the X boson. ===CP-symmetry violation=== The second condition for generating baryon asymmetry‚Äîviolation of charge- parity symmetry‚Äîis that a process is able to happen at a different rate to its antimatter counterpart. In the Standard Model, CP violation appears as a complex phase in the quark mixing matrix of the weak interaction. There may also be a non-zero CP-violating phase in the neutrino mixing matrix, but this is currently unmeasured. CP violation was first observed in the 1964 Fitch- Cronin experiment with neutral kaons, which resulted in the 1980 Nobel Prize in physics (direct CP violation, that is violation of CP symmetry in a decay process, was discovered later, in 1999). Due to CPT symmetry, violation of CP symmetry demands violation of time inversion symmetry, or T-symmetry. Despite the allowance for CP violation in the Standard Model, it is insufficient to account for the observed baryon asymmetry of the universe given the limits on baryon number violation, meaning that beyond-Standard Model sources are needed. A possible new source of CP violation was found at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) by the LHCb collaboration during the first three years of LHC operations (beginning March 2010). The experiment analyzed the decays of two particles, the bottom Lambda (Œõb0) and its antiparticle, and compared the distributions of decay products. The data showed an asymmetry of up to 20% of CP-violation sensitive quantities, implying a breaking of CP-symmetry. This analysis will need to be confirmed by more data from subsequent runs of the LHC. ===Interactions out of thermal equilibrium=== In the out-of-equilibrium decay scenario, the last condition states that the rate of a reaction which generates baryon-asymmetry must be less than the rate of expansion of the universe. In this situation the particles and their corresponding antiparticles do not achieve thermal equilibrium due to rapid expansion decreasing the occurrence of pair-annihilation. ==Other explanationsRegions of the universe where antimatter dominates=== Another possible explanation of the apparent baryon asymmetry is that matter and antimatter are essentially separated into different, widely distant regions of the universe. The formation of antimatter galaxies was originally thought to explain the baryon asymmetry, as from a distance, antimatter atoms are indistinguishable from matter atoms; both produce light (photons) in the same way. Along the boundary between matter and antimatter regions, however, annihilation (and the subsequent production of gamma radiation) would be detectable, depending on its distance and the density of matter and antimatter. Such boundaries, if they exist, would likely lie in deep intergalactic space. The density of matter in intergalactic space is reasonably well established at about one atom per cubic meter. Assuming this is a typical density near a boundary, the gamma ray luminosity of the boundary interaction zone can be calculated. No such zones have been detected, but 30 years of research have placed bounds on how far they might be. On the basis of such analyses, it is now deemed unlikely that any region within the observable universe is dominated by antimatter. One attempt to explain the lack of observable interfaces between matter and antimatter dominated regions is that they are separated by a Leidenfrost layer of very hot matter created by the energy released from annihilation. This is similar to the manner in which water may be separated from a hot plate by a layer of evaporated vapor, delaying the evaporation of more water. ===Electric dipole moment=== The presence of an electric dipole moment (EDM) in any fundamental particle would violate both parity (P) and time (T) symmetries. As such, an EDM would allow matter and antimatter to decay at different rates leading to a possible matter‚Äìantimatter asymmetry as observed today. Many experiments are currently being conducted to measure the EDM of various physical particles. All measurements are currently consistent with no dipole moment. However, the results do place rigorous constraints on the amount of symmetry violation that a physical model can permit. The most recent EDM limit, published in 2014, was that of the ACME Collaboration, which measured the EDM of the electron using a pulsed beam of thorium monoxide (ThO) molecules. ===Mirror anti-universe=== The Big Bang generated a universe- antiuniverse pair, our universe flows forward in time, while our mirror counterpart flows backward. The state of universe, as it is, does not violate the CPT symmetry, because the Big Bang could be considered as a double sided event, both classically and quantum mechanically, consisting of a universe- antiuniverse pair. Meaning that this universe is the charge (C), parity (P) and time (T) image of the anti-universe. This pair emerged from the big bang epochs not directly into a hot, radiation-dominated era. The antiuniverse would flow back in time from the Big Bang, becoming bigger as it does so, it would be also dominated by antimatter. Its spatial properties are inverted if compared to those in our universe, this situation could be analogous to creating electron-positron pairs in a vacuum. This model, devised by physicists from the Perimeter Institute for Theoretical Physics in Canada, proposes that temperature fluctuations in the cosmic microwave background (CMB) are due to the quantum-mechanical nature of space-time near the Big Bang singularity. Meaning that a point in the future of our universe and a point in the distant past of the antiuniverse would provide fixed classical points, while all possible quantum-based permutations would exist in-between. Quantum uncertainty causes the universe and antiuniverse to not be exact mirror images of each other. This model has not shown if it can reproduce certain observations regarding the inflation scenario, such as explaining the uniformity of the cosmos on large scales. However, it provides a natural and straightforward explanation for dark matter. Such universe-antiuniverse pair would produce large numbers of superheavy neutrinos, also known as sterile neutrinos. These neutrinos might also be the source of recently observed bursts of high-energy cosmic rays. ==Baryon asymmetry parameter== The challenges to the physics theories are then to explain how to produce the predominance of matter over antimatter, and also the magnitude of this asymmetry. An important quantifier is the asymmetry parameter, :\\\\eta = \\\\frac{n_B - n_{\\\\bar B}}{n_\\\\gamma}. This quantity relates the overall number density difference between baryons and antibaryons (nB and n, respectively) and the number density of cosmic background radiation photons nŒ≥. According to the Big Bang model, matter decoupled from the cosmic background radiation (CBR) at a temperature of roughly kelvin, corresponding to an average kinetic energy of / () = . After the decoupling, the total number of CBR photons remains constant. Therefore, due to space-time expansion, the photon density decreases. The photon density at equilibrium temperature T per cubic centimeter, is given by :n_\\\\gamma = \\\\frac{1}{\\\\pi^2} \\\\left(\\\\frac{k_B T}{\\\\hbar c}\\\\right)^3 \\\\int_0^\\\\infty \\\\frac{x^2}{e^x - 1} \\\\, dx = \\\\frac{2\\\\zeta(3)}{\\\\pi^2} \\\\left(\\\\frac{k_B T}{\\\\hbar c}\\\\right)^3 \\\\approx 20.3 \\\\left(\\\\frac{T}{1\\\\text{K}}\\\\right)^3 \\\\text{cm}^{-3}, with kB as the Boltzmann constant, ƒß as the Planck constant divided by 2 and c as the speed of light in vacuum, and Œ∂(3) as Ap√©ry's constant. At the current CBR photon temperature of , this corresponds to a photon density nŒ≥ of around 411 CBR photons per cubic centimeter. Therefore, the asymmetry parameter Œ∑, as defined above, is not the \\"good\\" parameter. Instead, the preferred asymmetry parameter uses the entropy density s, :\\\\eta_s = \\\\frac{n_B - n_{\\\\bar B}}{s} because the entropy density of the universe remained reasonably constant throughout most of its evolution. The entropy density is :s \\\\ \\\\stackrel{\\\\mathrm{def}}{=}\\\\ \\\\frac{\\\\mathrm{entropy}}{\\\\mathrm{volume}} = \\\\frac{p + \\\\rho}{T} = \\\\frac{2\\\\pi^2}{45}g_{*}(T) T^3 with p and œÅ as the pressure and density from the energy density tensor TŒºŒΩ, and g* as the effective number of degrees of freedom for \\"massless\\" particles (inasmuch as mc2 ‚â™ kBT holds) at temperature T, :g_*(T) = \\\\sum_{i=\\\\mathrm{bosons}} g_i \\\\left(\\\\frac{T_i}{T}\\\\right)^3 + \\\\frac{7}{8}\\\\sum_{j=\\\\mathrm{fermions}} g_j{\\\\left(\\\\frac{T_j}{T}\\\\right)}^3, for bosons and fermions with gi and gj degrees of freedom at temperatures Ti and Tj respectively.

The wording of the Scout Promise (or Oath) and Scout Law have varied slightly over time and from country to country. Some national organization promises are given below. Although most Scouting and Guiding organizations use the word \\"promise\\", a few such as the Boy Scouts of America tend to use \\"oath\\" instead. Typically, Scouts and Guides will make the three-fingered Scout Sign when reciting the promise. ==Original 1908 text== In his original book on Boy Scouting, Baden- Powell introduced the Scout Promise, as follows: ==World Organization of the Scout Movement requirements== The form of the promise has varied slightly from country to country and over time, but must fulfill the requirements of the World Organization of the Scout Movement (WOSM) to qualify a National Scout Organization for membership. Together with clarifying its Scout Law, the Constitution of WOSM states: In order to accommodate many different religions within Scouting, \\"God\\" may refer to a higher power, and is not specifically restricted to the God of the monotheistic religions. The WOSM Constitution explains \\"Duty to God\\" as \\"Adherence to spiritual principles, loyalty to the religion that expresses them and acceptance of the duties resulting therefrom.\\" The World Association of Girl Guides and Girl Scouts (WAGGGS), which is a sister organization to WOSM, has the very same wording in their constitution (Part 4, Paragraph 2: Original Promise), and follows similar policies. In 2014, the WOSM passed a resolution, \\"Spirituality in Scouting\\", recognizing the importance of spirituality, but without defining it with the word \\"God\\". The WOSM then convened a 2015 \\"Duty to God\\" task force, which in turn produced another draft resolution to be considered at the WOSM 2017 conference. The final 2017 resolution passed indicated a need for further investigation, and for WOSM to take into consideration a member organization's \\"culture and civilization\\" if asked to approve changes to their Promise or Law. Conversely, a member organization was asked to consider the global movement and its goals if it requested alternative wording. Implicit to both resolution statements was the possibility of introducing an alternative Promise or Law within a member organization. ===Alternative promises=== Although the Constitution of WOSM states that the Promise should include a reference to Duty to God, Scouting founder Lord Baden-Powell approved the use of promises with reference to a higher ideal, higher truth, an optional reference to God, or without a reference to God, for Belgium, Czechoslovakia, France, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, and Finland. Three of these countries still offer this alternative promise (France, the Netherlands and Czech Republic). WOSM stated in 1932 that no new exceptions would be made and expressed the hope that the few remaining countries would stop using a promise without any reference to Duty to God. The Israeli Scouts, though founded in 1919/1920, and joining WOSM in 1951 and WAGGGS in 1963, also have no \\"duty to God\\" or apparent equivalent in their promise. In 1969, the Eclaireuses et Eclaireurs isra√©lites de France decided to discontinue using the reference to God due to its inconsistency with religious beliefs and practices from a Jewish perspective. Use of the word God (Dieu), derived from Zeus, can be seen as an inappropriate pagan reference in Jewish texts or education. In the late 20th and early 21st centuries, some WOSM and WAGGGS affiliated organizations have introduced alternative promises for their programs, giving adherents a choice. Examples include Scouterna (Sweden), Scouts Australia, and Scouts Canada. ==Non-WOSM Scouting== Scout sections that follow traditional Scouting, such as Baden-Powell Scouts within the World Federation of Independent Scouts, use several promises including the original Scout promise above that includes the reference to God. Some, however, for example the 1st Tarrant Scout Group in Fort Worth, Texas use a blend of the original promise and the \\"Outlander Promise\\" which, \\"according to tradition\\", B-P wrote for Scouts that had to omit the reference to God or a monarch for reasons of conscience. ==See also== * Religion in Scouting * Scouting ==References== Category:Oaths Promise Category:1908 documents ","title":"Scout Promise"},{"id":"2223170","text":"Woodlands is a suburb of Johannesburg, South Africa.

The usual flatbreads are wheat tortillas, lavash, or pita; the filling usually consists of cold sliced meat, poultry, or fish accompanied by shredded lettuce, diced tomato or pico de gallo, guacamole, sauteed mushrooms, bacon, grilled onions, cheese, and a sauce, such as ranch or honey mustard. ==History== Preparing wraps in a kitchen People in Mexico, Mediterranean, and South Asia have been eating wraps since before and around the 1900s. Mexicans refer to them as burritos, and they come in different ingredient varieties, primarily wheat flour or corn, typically filled with meat, beans, rice, cheese, and other ingredients. The wrap in its Western form probably comes from California, as a generalization of the Mexican and Tex-Mex burrito, and became popular in the 1990s.Becky Mercouri, \\"Wraps\\", in Andrew F.

Moreover, Valentine's own story dates his use of the name 'wrap' to the mid-1990s, after it is documented in California.Ken Hoffman, \\"Watching Little Leaguers make Valentine's day\\", Houston Chronicle, 24 August 2010 article San Francisco-based chain World Wrapps, which opened its first location in February 1995, is credited with popularizing the wrap nationwide.India Mandelkern, \\"The Bros Who Disrupted The Sandwich\\" Eater, 4 December 2017 ==Wraps in public eating places== In the 1900s, Kati roll became a popular street-food in Kolkata, India, with kebab wrapped in paratha bread; although over the years many variants have evolved all of which now go under the generic name of kati roll.

On the right or northeast is Isthmus Cove (or Banning Harbor), and on the left or southwest is Catalina (or Cat) Harbor. Aerial view of Naval-Coast Guard base at the Isthmus, probably taken in WW2 era. This is the future site of Two Harbors village. Two Harbors, colloquially known as \\"The Isthmus\\", is a small unincorporated community island village on Santa Catalina Island, California, with a population of 298 (Census of 2000). It is the second center of population on the island, besides the city of Avalon. It is mainly a resort village. It has only one restaurant, one hotel and one general store. The village has about 150 permanent residents who live on the isthmus year-round. One notable feature was the one-room schoolhouse which closed in 2014. ==Geography== Two Harbors is a small island village located approximately from San Pedro Harbor on Santa Catalina Island. On the island's narrow isthmus, it is located about 18 miles from the only city on the island, Avalon. It is named for the two harbors separated by the 770 m section of land separating the leeward (northern) Isthmus Cove (aka Banning Harbor) and Catalina (or Cat) Harbor on the windward (southern) side, which together almost cut off the northwestern sixth (31.7 km¬≤) from the main part of the island. White Rock Island, commonly known as Bird Rock, is a small privately owned island only 6312 m¬≤ in size. It is approximately northeast of Two Harbors, offshore from Isthmus Cove, and northwest of the closest coastal point. ==History== The area where Two Harbors is located was originally referred to simply as the Isthmus of Catalina Island. By the 1860s, mining operations for silver, lead and zinc took place in the area. In 1864, during the Civil War, the Union Army sent 83 soldiers to the island to establish Camp Santa Catalina Island, both to protect the area from Confederate privateers and survey the isthmus and adjacent Catalina Harbor for the Bureau of Indian Affairs as a location for a future Indian reservation for \\"militant\\" tribes captured in the Bald Hills War. However, the reservation idea was abandoned and so was the camp. The barracks that the Army built on the isthmus were later used to house visiting film crews in the 1920s and 1930s, a contingent of the U.S. Coast Guard during World War II, and in 1951 became the home of the Isthmus Yacht Club. The Ning Po, a Chinese merchant ship built in 1753 and involved in over a century of war, rebellion, and piracy, eventually found its way to Catalina and was converted into a tourist attraction in 1913. The Ning Po burned off the western shore of the isthmus in 1938. The fire which destroyed her also claimed several wooden sailing vessels that had been used in filming motion-picture \\"spectaculars\\", including the famous old down-Easter \\"Llewellyn J. Morse\\" which stood in for the ‚Äî with accurate re-rigging ‚Äî in the silent film \\"Old Ironsides (film)\\". ==EducationPrimary and secondary schools=== Two Harbors is part of the Long Beach Unified School District. The one-room school closed in 2014 due to sharply declining enrollment. School age children now attend Avalon Schools K-12. ===Colleges and universities=== The USC Wrigley Institute for Environmental Studies is an environmental research and education facility run by the University of Southern California in Two Harbors. The campus consists of a 2,800 square-meter (30,000 square-foot) laboratory building, a dormitory housing, a cafeteria, a hyperbaric chamber, and a large waterfront staging area complete with dock, pier, helipad, and diving lockers. The facility was made possible by a donation from the Wrigley family and was named for Philip K. Wrigley. ==Transportation== Two Harbors is served by ferry lines with regular daily service to San Pedro. A helicopter can also be chartered to the village. The Catalina Airport-In-The-Sky is away to the east. Alternatively, various charter boats offer private service to the island. Most people generally walk, but shuttles are available, as are full- sized motor vehicles. To get around the island from Two Harbors, one can get a bus that can take them anywhere on the island, or one can hike. Taxi service is also available between Avalon and Two Harbors. ==See also== *Camp Cherry Valley *Camp Emerald Bay ==ReferencesThe Catalina Island Conservancy * The Santa Catalina Island Company * Two Harbors * Catalina Express * Catalina Ferries Category:Santa Catalina Island, California Category:Unincorporated communities in Los Angeles County, California Category:Campgrounds in California Category:Populated coastal places in California Category:Unincorporated communities in California ","title":"Two Harbors, California"},{"id":"2223208","text":"This is a list National Collegiate Athletic Association (Philippines) track and field champions.

It served as a guide or handbook to the British upper classes and landed gentry (in this case referred to in the title under the term, county families, for which see county family). The title of the annual volumes making up the series varied, and they are sometimes referred to simply as Walford or Walford's.

The work's coverage encompassed many of the most important rich, aristocratic or politically powerful of the people of the period.

He is referred to as \\"the Younger\\" to distinguish him from Aaron the Elder. Even though Aaron lived for much of his life in Constantinople, he is sometimes distinguished from another Aaron Ben Elijah (also a theologian from Constantinople, which was then the center of Karaite learning) by the title \\"of Nicomedia,\\" signifying another place he lived. == Background == He was born in Nicomedia. While little is known about his personal life, he is considered by Karaites to be the equivalent of his contemporary, Maimonides, the most distinguished Jewish scholar of the time and an outspoken critic of the Karaites. In fact, it seems likely that Aaron made it his ambition to rival Maimonides by defending the Karaites from his attacks. To achieve this, he studied the extensive religious literature of both rabbinical Judaism and Islam, as well as that of the Karaites. The result of his studies was Etz HaChayyim (Tree of Life; 1346), a philosophical work modeled after Maimonides' own Moreh Nevuchim (Guide to the Perplexed). In fact, one of the chief criticisms of the work is that it attempts to imitate Maimonides' Guide far too slavishly, in terms of both structure and style. In 1354, while living in Constantinople, he composed his second major work, Gan Eden (The Garden of Eden), about the commandments of the Bible and an attempt to defend the Karaite legal code and in 1362 he wrote Keter Torah (Crown of the Torah), a comprehensive commentary on the Pentateuch using a literal interpretation of the writings. He died in Constantinople, Byzantine Empire. Aaron was neither as profound or independent-minded as Maimonides, for whom he maintained great esteem even when opposing him. Nevertheless, he was a versatile compiler and eclectic, if not always original, philosopher, who succeeded in restoring some prestige to the Karaite community, which have been in decline ever since it was forced to fend off the attacks of Saadia Gaon. Furthermore, some of his critiques of the Maimonidean worldview can be considered reasonable and sound. ==Aaron's philosophy== Aaron ben Elijah was heavily influenced by the works of Aristotle. Unlike Maimonides, however, Aaron accepted the Muslim Motazilite philosophical system of Kalam, combining atomism with Aristotelean views to reconcile revelation with philosophy ‚Äî in this, he differed not only from Maimonides but also from Aaron Ben Joseph, the Elder, who sided with Maimonides in this debate. According to the younger Aaron, in the first chapters of Etz HaChayyim, the theology of the Kalam is the natural religion arrived at by Abraham through meditation and systematized by the Mosaic Law; while Greek philosophy, adopted by Christianity because of its hostility to Judaism, is a heterogeneous foreign product, harmful to the development of the Torah in its purity. He then declares that the object of his work is to restore the theology of the Kalam by presenting it in a clear manner. ===Etz HaChayyim=== The book Etz HaChayyim (Tree of Life) was written in 1346 and consists of 114 chapters: * Chapters 1‚Äì15 discuss the doctrine of God's existence, God's incorporeality, and the creation of the world. Like Maimonides' Guide, he considers the heavenly spheres to be governed by separate intelligences, or angels. By showing that his conclusions are nothing more than logical deductions, Aaron argues that they precede his own work, which is nothing more than the confirmation of established truths. * Chapters 16‚Äì62 discuss biblical anthropomorphism, explaining them as figurative expressions of Divine energy and activity. In these chapters, he often cites Maimonides verbatim, but claims that Maimonides himself was simply following an even earlier work, Ha-Eshkol, by Judah Hadassi. Aaron follows Maimonides' example in stating that Ezekiel's theophany of the Divine Chariot, like the descriptions of the Tabernacle and its symbolism, has a physical meaning. * Chapters 63‚Äì77 discuss the unity of God. Here Aaron opposes the approach of both Maimonides and Hadassi, who reject all but God's negative attributes (God is not...). According to Aaron, however, power, knowledge, life, will, and existence are all positive attributes inseparable from the very essence of God and in no way infringing upon His unity. This leads him to an explanation of the usual names of God denoting God's activity, as distinguished from the Tetragrammaton, which denotes the essence of God as the author of all existence. * Chapters 78‚Äì94 discuss the concept of Divine Providence. Special emphasis is placed on the fourfold nature of evil: physical, psychical, moral, and non-moral. This was a favorite topic of older Karaite philosophers such as Joseph al-Bazir (and of Maimonides), that evil is only a defect inherent in matter, and therefore not to be ascribed to God, unless God makes it the means of man's moral improvement. While Maimonides assumes that God's providence extends only to rational human beings, Aaron extends Divine providence to all beings, since God's universal knowledge embraces all. Whereas Maimonides sees Divine action as guides by God's wisdom, according to Aaron, it is guided by God's justice. :Accentuating the superiority of moral over intellectual power, Aaron takes a higher view of the question of why the righteous suffer than either Maimonides or some of his own Karaite predecessors. He rejects the concept of temurah, or compensation for grief, postulating instead that all trials imposed on people are for their spiritual benefit (citing Abraham and Job as examples of this). Humanity is incapable of comprehending the purpose of Creation, being limited to conceiving of its own role in the world as God's servant. * Chapters 95‚Äì114 discuss revelation, the Divine Law of the Torah, the perfection of the soul, and its immortality. The two trees in the Garden of Eden are seen as metaphors for the higher and the lower spheres of human existence. After the Fall, the commandments of the Torah become necessary means of restoring humanity to its true, twofold nature. This leads to a discussion of the nature of prophecy in general and its highest degree, as attained by Moses. It continues by explaining the objectives of the Torah and its commandments as means of achieving the perfection of both the individual and of humanity as a whole. :According to an ancient tradition of both Karaite and Rabbinic Jews and cited by Aaron, the Torah was intended for and offered to all nations. It can never be changed, improved, or (in contrast to Rabbinic Judaism) augmented by an Oral Law. Essentially different from the attitude of Maimonides, and in fact from that of all Aristotelian thinkers, is Aaron's attitude toward immortality, which he bases chiefly upon moral grounds, citing the idea of retribution. For this reason, however, his eschatology is rather obscure, being a semi-rational, semi-mystical blend of many different beliefs. He concludes his work with a call to repentance. ===Gan Eden=== Gan Eden, by Aaron ben Elijah. Manuscript on paper, dating around the 14th or 15th century. Oriental semi-cursive script. Aaron's work on the Commandments, entitled Gan Eden (The Garden of Eden), consists of twenty-five sections and 194 chapters, as well as nine smaller juridical articles, which became of paramount importance to the Karaites. It was written in 1354. He follows a rational approach to the commandments, similar to the one espoused by Maimonides. He opens with the principle that instilling the belief in God's unity, and especially in His government of the world, is the ultimate purpose of every commandment, so that it is the duty of humanity to seek the underlying objective of each commandment. For example, the goal of the Sabbath is inculcating a belief in the Divine creation and guidance of the world; other festivals are intended to counteract the influences of paganism and fatalism. Two parts of Gan Eden have appeared as separate books: * One, consisting of five sections and twenty-two chapters on shechita (the laws of slaughtering animals for food) * Tzafnat Paneach (\\"Discloser of Secrets\\") consists of eight chapters on incestuous marriages. In its entirety, Gan Eden is probably the best and most comprehensive exposition of the Karaite system of the Law, presenting the opinions of all Aaron's predecessors with impartial and frank criticism. It is mainly because of this work that Aaron continues to wield such a great influence upon the Karaites. ===Keter Torah=== His third book was titled Keter Torah (Crown of Law) and was written in 1362. This is a commentary on the Torah, styled after Abraham Ibn Ezra's earlier work. Like all of Aaron's earlier writings, it also contains a review of the philosophical and exegetical interpretations given by his predecessors, with critiques of their views where necessary. Particularly interesting is his \\"Preface,\\" in which he states the main differences between the approach to biblical exegesis of Rabbinic and Karaite Judaism. ==Editions of Aaron's works== The 'Etz ha-·∏§ayyim, of which many manuscripts exist in Leiden, Munich, Vienna, and Leipzig, was first published, with a large commentary (Or ha- ·∏§ayyim) by Luzki, in Koslov, 1835. A critical edition, with valuable information and a summary of the one hundred and fourteen chapters in Hebrew by Caleb Afendopulo, and one in German by the editor, Franz Delitzsch, appeared in Leipzig, 1841. Of the Keter Torah there is extant a Eupatoria edition (1866), besides manuscripts in the Bodleian Library, Oxford, in Vienna, and in Leipzig; while the Gan Eden exists, in manuscript only, in Leiden and Leipzig. Portions of the latter have been published by Schupart, Trigland, Danz, and Langhausen. ==NotesFootnotesReferences== * * * Category:Karaite rabbis Category:1320s births Category:1369 deaths Category:People from ƒ∞zmit Category:Byzantine Jews Category:14th-century rabbis Category:14th-century Byzantine people Category:14th-century Byzantine writers Category:14th-century Jewish theologians ","title":"Aaron ben Elijah"},{"id":"2223246","text":"thumb El Vacil√≥n de la Ma√±ana is a Spanish language weekday morning radio show. The show originates from WSKQ-FM in New York City, a Spanish radio station branded as \\"Mega 97.9\\", and it is syndicated live to a number of different markets in the US such as Providence, Rhode Island; Miami and Orlando, Florida; Atlanta, Georgia; Hartford, Connecticut; and Puerto Rico.7 The word \\"vacil√≥n\\" is not directly translatable into English; it derives from the Spanish verb vacilar (to vacillate), but in colloquial Spanish can also mean to \\"check someone out\\" or to \\"have fun.\\" Thus, the show's name roughly translates in English to \\"The Morning Tease.\\" ==History== During the first two weeks of January 2007, new airings of this program were discontinued, and only pre-recorded programs were aired, coinciding with Luis Jim√©nez's departure from the program. He has signed a contract with the Univision Radio network, but is prevented by previous non-competitive agreements to air any new program in New York City during El Vacil√≥n's allotted time slot until 2008. Most of the program's crew has chosen to remain contracted to La Mega.and contract DJ CASTRO from Texas and Sonido Promax #1 in California, thanks to him is now the number one in USA. As of mid January 2007, Spanish Broadcasting System (SBS) owned WSKQ (La Mega 97.9 FM) brought two new hosts to the show, Dominican-born Juan Carlos Alonso (who sounds just like Luis Jim√©nez), and Puerto Rican Frankie Jay (who also sounds like Moonshadow) which are now replacing Luis Jim√©nez and Moonshadow. Juan Carlos Alonso was relocated from another SBS station in Orlando, Florida and Frankie Jay was relocated from another SBS station in Puerto Rico. Juan Carlos and Frankie Jay voice resemblance to the former hosts have sparked a number of accusations of trying to imitate the former Vacil√≥n hosts Luis Jim√©nez and Moonshadow (the main reason SBS brought them to NY). During 2007 Luis Jim√©nez and SBS were involved in a legal fight because SBS claims Luis Jim√©nez was cashing in on the name of the morning show through the release of his DVD movie El Vacil√≥n the Movie which was released on January 30, 2007. Luis Jim√©nez filed a counter-lawsuit accusing SBS of trying to fool the audience by having Juan Carlos and Frankie Jay imitate the voices and style of Luis Jim√©nez and Moonshadow, and also accuses his former team members of betrayal and stealing his intellectual property by using characters such as Dr. Hector Tilla and Madam Melo. In early January 2008 Spanish Broadcasting System officially won the legal fight.http://www.newsday.com/news/local/wire/newyork/ny-bc-ny-- spanishradio0116jan16,0,766009.story Since February 21, 2007, Luis Jim√©nez started producing his own show The Luis Jim√©nez Show and it is being broadcast in several cities in the US, such as Dallas, Chicago, Los Angeles, among others through different Univision Radio stations. It is expected to expand into more cities during this year as Univision Radio introduces the show to new markets, but it is not expected to make it into NYC until 2008. Only two of the members of the old \\"Vacil√≥n de la Ma√±ana\\" have followed Luis Jim√©nez to his new show. These are \\"Yun Yun\\" and \\"Sonny Flow\\", the latter one being \\"DJ Chucky\\" who just became part of \\"The Luis Jim√©nez Show\\" crew. Alma, who is Luis's producer, is also part of the new show in Univision Radio. Moonshadow has come back to El Vacil√≥n de la Ma√±ana and together with Juan Carlos and Franky Jay had been able to stay ahead of the Luis Jim√©nez Show (3.9 to 2.0 in the ratings). Although when The Luis Jim√©nez Show made it to NYC early in 2008. Upon his departure from El Vacil√≥n de la Ma√±ana Luis Jim√©nez also took the morning show's website with him. For the entire year of 2007 the domain name \\"www.elvacilon.com\\" belonged to his producer Maria Alma and therefore SBS and WSKQ La Mega 97.9 FM were unable to use the website address for the show. A new website for El Vacil√≥n was created www.elvacilon.org.In early 2008, after the lawsuit the domain name \\"elvacilon dot com\\" was returned to SBS and is run on the web servers of Spanish Broadcasting System(SBS)El Vacil√≥n De La Ma√±ana ==The Miami Vacil√≥n== An equally named program was broadcast by another SBS affiliate station in Miami: WXDJ-FM (El Zol 95.7), a fact that raised confusion among some listeners in both markets until March 2003. The hosts of El Vacil√≥n Miami were Enrique Santos (a former police officer turned funny man) and \\"The Professor\\" Joe Ferrero, both of Cuban-American descent. Early producer of the show Alberto Sardinas also joined the team at the time. The two jokesters achieved national and international notoriety when on June 18, 2003 they prank-called Venezuelan president Hugo Ch√°vez, which brought them plenty of press. They later used the same technique to prank-call Cuba's then- President Fidel Castro, the more notorious and more better known of the pranks. The team was fined by the FCC when an anonymous source filed a complaint with said government agency (as a result of the latter prank). The duo took to the streets of Miami and collected in pennies the entire amount of the fee and then some. Luckily, the radio station's legal eagles resolved the issue regarding the fine and all of the money collected was then donated to a local charity. They later used the same technique to crank call. In the history of radio broadcast this was the first time that a morning show had prank-called the leaders of two countries. Despite of the huge success of El Vacil√≥n Miami, hosted by Enrique and Joe, it all came to a halt on March 5, 2007 when the hosts, fed up with the string of unfulfilled promises by Spanish Broadcasting Systems (SBS) and other issues, decided to walk out on air. They trashed the company for four hours of broadcast until they were eventually pulled off the air by management. The morning show was replaced with pre- recorded bits soon after. One week later, the only one of the show's main producers, Miguel Reyes alias Mikey Machete, was let go by the company. Reyes hosted the Saturday morning \\"Best Of\\" show which he also produced and achieved the number one spot in ratings for a Saturday morning show in the Tropical market. While SBS refused to give details on Mr. Reyes‚Äô firing, it appeared to be the result of the fall out following the early departure of the show's two hosts. Enrique Santos and Joe Ferrero were signed to Univision's WRTO, Miami, La Kalle 98.3 FM for the time being. Luis Jim√©nez's and his morning show were being syndicated in various markets. Univision Radio returned both shows to their respective cities to take on SBS directly on early 2008. Mike Reyes, former producer for Enrique Santos & Joe Ferrero, return to radio also in early 2008 at the end of his non compete From March 22, 2007 to March 1, 2008, \\"El Zol 95 FM\\" was broadcasting New York's El Vacil√≥n de la Ma√±ana which was also being syndicated in Puerto Rico. Since March 3, 2008, El Zol started El Vacil√≥n de Miami with Neo Encendido and Los Pichy Boys (Alejandro Gonz√°lez and Maikel Rodriguez) from 6 to 10 pm. The latter show was replaced in less than a year by Al Fuentes, former P.D. of various radio stations and Pio Ferro, V.P of Programming of SBS. Soon after that, Pio Ferro's employment was terminated and that morning show had become a one-man show. The Enrique and Joe Show (with sidekick and producer Mikey Machete) on Miami's La Kalle 98.3 FM, in less than a years time, once again became the #1 rated Tropical (bi-lingual) morning show in South Florida with ratings numbers reaching double digits. In May 2009, the dynamic duo of Miami radio split up and two shows were created. In the morning The Enrique Santos Show, followed by Joe Ferrero y La Animalada (originally hosted for 5 months by Mikey Machete and Albertico Rodriguez) on La Kalle 98.3FM. In early spring 2010, changes started to take place in both radio stations and by mid-year, Enrique Santos was the only one from the original morning crew to be retained on 98.3's morning show as Univision restructured the station to fit Arbitron's new ratings methodology. The station, now re-branded as MIX 98.3, assumed a more bilingual style programing. Joe Ferrero was let go by Univision Radio on June 4, 2010 along with (Mike Reyes) Mikey Machete. In October 2010 Joe Ferrero consequently took over El Vacil√≥n de la Ma√±ana on Spanish Broadcasting System's (WXDJ) El Zol 95.7 FM with new co-host Albertito Rodriguez as his sidekick and female co- host Betzy Vazquez. Mikey (Mike Reyes) Machete is currently the Promotions & Marketing director for ESPN Deportes Radio in Miami. As of August 22, 2012, Joe Ferrero is no longer at SBS Miami. He was let go for no apparent reason and is currently the Operations Manager and morning show host at the all new 105.5 FM stations out of the Florida Keys. Some of the infamous duo's classic crank calls can still be heard on www.Marikonson.com In 2015, Ferrero became a morning host on WMGE (Mega 94.9) in the Miami/Frt Lauderdale market until 2016, when Joe Ferrero was let go from the station \\"for no apparent reason\\" as per the statement he released via his Instagram account. ==Overview== El Vacil√≥n de la Ma√±ana (roughly translated as the \\"Morning Party\\") has various key elements: prank calls, musical parodies, comedy sketches, humorous commentary about straight and odd news, and open telephone lines. The program's key player is Luis Jim√©nez (born on March 26, 1970 in San Juan, Puerto Rico), who has been its main host for more than twelve years. Jim√©nez co-hosts the broadcast with Raymond Broussard (born in San Juan, Puerto Rico, on December 20, 1953, of Cajun and Puerto Rican descent) and who uses the stage name Moonshadow. Luis Jim√©nez started his radio career in his hometown of Caguas, Puerto Rico as a teenager, working as a part-time disc-jockey in various local radio stations. He later moved to Orlando, Florida, achieving some recognition there as a morning radio host after holding various odd jobs. He was referred to La Mega's management as a suitable candidate for hosting a Spanish-language radio show in New York City and moved there in 1993. The program's first airing occurred on August 9. Jim√©nez modeled his show after El Bufeo Matutino (The Morning Goof), a successful radio program in Puerto Rico that lasted twenty-two years in its various inceptions, and always had Moonshadow as its main producer and host. Luis Jim√©nez co-hosted the show with longtime friend Junior Hernandez. Hernandez suffered from asthma, and died of a heart attack. Fans streamed to the station to pay tribute to Hernandez the Thursday night after his death; the popular radio personality was only 34 years old. After Broussard's move to New York City in 1997, and after the death of Hernandez's in 1998, the program had a succession of co-hosts, with Moonshadow joining the show for good in 2000. Moonshadow can claim poetic justice about the fact that WZNT-FM, also known as Z-93, (Puerto Rico's main salsa radio station), which was the same radio station who fired him for being too controversial, now airs El Vacil√≥n de la Ma√±ana to Puerto Rico in direct Internet audio feed from La Mega every morning after a management change (SBS currently owns both stations). The first audio feed to Puerto Rico occurred on February 9, 2004. The program has since gone into syndication by ABC Networks in a few Latino markets within the United States; the first syndicated airing to Orlando, Florida and other Latino markets occurred on January 9, 2006. Moonshadow (right) and Yun Yun Echevarr√≠a (center)at \\"El Gufeo Matutino at Z-93 (1980s) While Moonshadow has gone on record in numerous times about modeling his original show after Howard Stern's (with a very strong dose of Puerto Rican cultural elements), Jim√©nez's numerous original contributions give the show a unique pan-Latino flavor (its largest audience appears to be the Dominican and Puerto Rican community in New York City). The result \\"out- Sterned\\" Stern's show, and El Vacil√≥n's audienceship ratings surpassed Stern's for three years, until Stern's departure to satellite radio in 2005. Jim√©nez and Moonshadow do not act alone: besides a sizeable audience participation, the show's announcers and assistant producers (called the Mequetrefes, or Whippersnappers) are key to the success of the show. This ragtag group feature a female traffic announcer (Carolina Cadillo, born in Newark, New Jersey, of Peruvian and Nicaraguan descent), a rather peculiar news announcer (Francis M√©ndez, born in Jarabacoa, Dominican Republic), the show's main audio producer (DJ Chucky), its call screeners and production assistants (Tony S√°nchez, Bocachula, El Papichulo, etc.), and the like. The show's executive producer, Mar√≠a Eugenia Alma, appears sporadically in the show, particularly as female singer and occasional phone call prankster. Each member of the team is known for a perceived self-avowed defect or particularity: Luis Jim√©nez claims to have undersized genitalia and hypospadias, Moonshadow has an inguinal hernia but reportedly has the fastest tongue in American radio history; Francis M√©ndez is allegedly a former cocaine addict who now suffers from erectile dysfunction as a result, Carolina Cadillo is a proud nymphomaniac who speaks Spanish with a noticeable English accent (Spanish is her second language) and who has virtually no buttocks, and so on. ==Prank calls== Prank calls are usually presented in a section called ¬°Ca√≠ste! (You Fell for It!), in which unwitting people are called to their homes or job places and are provoked with touchy subjects for the prank victims (generally, they are taunted with intimate subjects). These prank calls are made by request from friends or family of the victims. The most famous prank call victim on the show's history was a Dominican building superintendent given the moniker Manolo Cabeza 'e Huevo by Jim√©nez, who played the part of a viciously irate jealous husband. Manolo's enraged, expletive-laden response has become the most copied and broadcast anecdote in the show's history. Manolo's son Israel, who coordinated the phone call, was in turn pranked in another memorable call. After the deportation of the section's producer, Rub√©n Ithier, also known as Rub√©n El Moreno, back to his country of origin, the Dominican Republic in late 2004, this section went into limbo for close to a year and a half. Prank reruns were (and are still) played on the section's regularly slotted time. During the hiatus, the current cast tried to pull some pranks of their own with mixed success, including repeated Manolo Cabeza 'e Huevo pranks, perhaps the most successful after Ithier's departure. The cast resumed production of regularly scheduled ¬°Ca√≠ste! pranks in early 2006. In a similar sidenote, the Miami programme is also known for its share of pranks. Its notoriety came with the ¬°Caiste! jokes made to Hugo Ch√°vez and Fidel Castro (The former being pranked before the latter) while using pre-existing tape conversations (for the former, it was with a conversation between Castro and then-Mexican President Vicente Fox, while for the latter, the snippets of the prank which was done on Ch√°vez was used). Both pranks had Joe Ferrero pretending to be a sergeant in some army. Needless to say, while the reaction of the former victim was absolute silence, Castro replied after Ferrero tripped up his (Castro's) words (\\"¬øEst√°s conforme con toda la mierda que has hecho en la isla, asesino?\\" [\\"Are you conformed with all the shit that you did on the island, murderer?\\"]) with a slightly peeved response: \\"¬øEn qu√© ca√≠, comemierda? ¬øEn qu√© ca√≠, maric√≥n? ¬øEn qu√© ca√≠, mari-c√≥n-s√≥n?\\" (\\"What did I fall in, shiteater? What did I fall in, queer? What did I fall in, you gay-fer?\\"). However, the FCC complained and slapped a fine to the two disc jockeys (Enrique Santos and Joe Ferrero); both chose not to pay, relying instead on a penny-drive. Its (the programme's) second-funniest joke is one that is called ¬°P√≠ntame! (Paint me!), in which the two prank call a painter by asking him \\"¬øUsted es el pintor?\\" (\\"Are you the Painter?\\"), whereupon by using his response (which was always \\"¬°S√≠, yo soy el pintor!\\" (\\"Yes, I'm the painter!\\") they played a sample of Elvis Crespo's song \\"P√≠ntame\\" (the first line of the song, to be exact: \\"'P√≠ntame', le dije yo al pintor\\"; \\"'Paint me', I told the painter\\"), thus aggravating the man and angering him even further, thus launching a tirade of Dominican insults. Another famous prank made by the 2 DJs was their \\"Gonzalo Cr√©o\\" saga; the first joke of which, \\"La vieja puta\\" (\\"The Old Bitch\\"), revolved around Santos prank calling a Cuban man by making said Cuban believe that he was in a telephoned confession booth, whereupon the Cuban said that he was being stalked by the grandmother of a friend of his. When one of Santos's associates is heard, the Cuban is outraged, and hangs up on him, whereupon, we hear Santos saying that he didn't get a chance to ask for the Cuban's money; the rest of the prank (although it is funny) revolves around then trying to get the Cuban's money. More of the \\"Gonzalo Cr√©o\\" jokes occurred, including \\"El Dolor del Vecino\\" (The Neighbor's Pain), using the same premise of pretense of a telephoned confession booth, which involves a man struggling with his apparent bisexuality and \\"Domingo Y Pancho\\" which involves them prank calling a man who is sexually aroused by a woman who is helping him with physical therapy for an illness of the nerves. A lot of the prank calls made by Enrique Santos and Joe Ferrero (During and after El Vacil√≥n including the Enrique & Joe Show) have now been made available at www.Marikonson.com The Federal Communications Commission considers the use of prank calls to be a violation of FCC policy, which prohibits recording unsolicited phone calls for broadcast, and fined WSKQ a penalty of $16,000 for a 2007 prank call, unless all parties agree with the recording being made public.Friday, August 24, 2012. RadioInfo.com. Retrieved August 27, 2012. ==Comedic characters== Luis Jim√©nez (and occasionally Moonshadow, who used to play all the comedic characters in his previous shows but has a more laid-back role on this one) play various characters in fifteen-minute segments on the show (usually three a day). Among them: Cornelio Toro, a naive store-owner whose wife has made a habit of being unfaithful to him with every man she comes in contact with while Toro fails to recognize it every time, even though he immediately knows when someone else is being cheated on (the name is a play on Spanish words: Cornelio sounds very much like \\"cuernudo\\", a cuckold, while Toro, or bull, evokes the bull's cuernos, or horns, the sign of the deceived man in Latin American culture); Jonathan Buford Rodriguez, better known as El Chulo, a gigolo who preys on geriatric women; El Chef Pip√≠, a parody on Cuban chef and Univision television personality Jos√© Hern√°ndez, better known as Chef Pepin, being Chef Pip√≠'s main trait his questionable masculinity; Rebeca Larica, a hyperventilating, gum-chewing woman who craves for male attention (played by Moonshadow); Dr. H√©ctor Tilla, a self-proclaimed medical doctor with very rude manners and a long history of malpractice lawsuits; Paca Garment√≠ and Silvia Penacho Chafr√≠as; two civic-minded single women (they are set apart, in the movie at least, by their hairstyle: Paca, played by Luis, has short black hair in braids, while Silvia, played by Moonshadow, has red hair styled similarly to the Wendy's girl), both over 60 years old, who love to bicker with each other (both names are plays on Spanish words: \\"Pa' cagarme en t√≠\\" is the informal way of saying \\"En t√≠ me' cago\\", which means \\"I shit on you\\", while Silvia's name, whilst parts of it are normal, The clang comes with the word \\"chocha fr√≠a\\", which means something to the effect of \\"cold pussy\\"); Madam Melo (originally called Mam√° Melo), a hyperkinetic Dominican santer√≠a practitioner (both names are plays on sexual references: \\"Madam Melo\\" is a play on \\"mandamelo\\", which means \\"Fuck me\\", whilst \\"Mam√° Melo\\" is a play on the insult \\"mamamelo\\", which means \\"Suck it (my dick) for me\\"); Goyito and Memin, two schoolkids (Memin being a straight arrow, while Goyito is a perennial foul-mouthed prankster) and Federico \\"Pedrito\\" Rivera Rodriguez, better known as Findingo, a chronic marijuana smoker with a strong speech impairment. Some of the ideas behind these characters are not entirely original: Cornelio Toro is the updated version of Toribio Tauro, a similar television character played by Puerto Rican comedic actor Adri√°n Garc√≠a on Puerto Rican television (and provided with an accent closely resembling that of Don Pulula, one of Jos√© Miguel Agrelot's characters); El Chulo evolved from a real human being who was a production assistant for one of Puerto Rico's radio morning shows who had a liking for geriatric women (and became famously made fun of by being called El Chupaviejas by the show's hosts), and Dr. Hector Tilla was another one of Moonshadow's creations while in the toilet. Goyito and Memin were originally created by Moonshadow after Pell√≠n and Pill√≠n, two animated characters from a Puerto Rican public service announcement, while Findingo's name was taken from a similarly named (although completely different) comedic character played by the Puerto Rican actor, Ren√© Rubiella; the original character shared a low intelligence quotient with the newer one, besides the name. The parody on Chef Pepin was rumored to be hated by the parodied celebrity because of its homoerotic undertones, but this was dispelled recently when Chef Pep√≠n himself was invited to participate in a racy sketch along its comedic counterpart, the result being a hilarious interaction between the two characters which Chef Pep√≠n clearly enjoyed. Special mention has to be made about a real \\"character\\" who happens to be a regular caller to the show, and as of October 2005 has joined the cast on a part-time basis. Metadona is a real-life reformed robber, born in Ponce, Puerto Rico, who had a chronic drug addiction before rehabilitation. There are strong doubts about him being completely drug-free, but he vows to have abandoned his criminal past for good. His slow delivery (evoking a chronically drug-induced state) and daring stories about botched robberies and juvenile pranks entitled him to the alias, which is the Spanish word for methadone. He has a habit of loudly opening a beer can for breakfast every time he calls. ==Musical parodies== El Vacil√≥n's musical parodies have recently become the show's bread and butter. Popular Latino songs are typically parodied in the show, generally changing the lyrics to sexually suggestive, humorous lyrics. Some original compositions are featured as well, and generally along the same subject matter. A few program guests, mainly reggaeton artists, have parodied their own regular songs in the show (and therefore have contributed with their own material). A few English-language songs are also parodied, but mostly fragments of them. Newer songs are introduced in a weekly section called El Joy√≥n Musical (joy√≥n can be an augmentative for either the word joya (jewel), or joyo (an alternate spelling for hole, and Puerto Rican vulgar slang for anus)). The songs are then placed in heavy rotation as filler between sections (and, in the Puerto Rico broadcast of the show, to cover local New York radio spots that are irrelevant to the Puerto Rican market). Some listeners have complained these musical parodies take more show time than warranted. The authors of most of these parodies, DJ Chucky who is now part of The Luis Jim√©nez Show and Gerpis Correa, also known as Shino/Aguakate. The Miami Vacil√≥n did their share of musical parodies, until the hosts Enrique and Joe left to Univision Radio. None of the new hosts capitalized on that aspect of the show, mostly for lack of production and talent. Both Enrique Santos and Joe Ferrero continued to produce phenomenal parodies which dealt with political satire, current events, making fun of people, and even the City of Hialeah (Second largest city in South Florida, mostly Cuban). The parody sung, written and performed by Enrique Santos, \\"Sweet Home Hialeah\\", has been one of their most famous, locally. The video was shot on location in the City of Hialeah and has almost become its emblem. The lyrics were sung to \\"Sweet Home Alabama\\" but with a twist. (See YouTube) ==News, straight and odd== Straight news are read and humorously discussed in the section called \\"Hablando Plepla\\" (\\"Talking Crap\\"; \\"Plepla\\" is a euphemism for feces, with less of a profane connotation than the more commonly used caca, or \\"shit\\"). The same is done for odd news in the section called Noticias Locas (Crazy News). Most are taken from the Odd News segment of Yahoo! News. Francis M√©ndez reads regular news at the top of the hour (not the same as Hablando Plepla), but injecting humorous slang phrases to the headlines. This goes in sharp contrast to the serious, almost dead-panned delivery of the show's sports announcer, Cuban-born Renato Murphy, as well as that of Cadillo's traffic report. The result is almost as odd as the Noticias Locas segment itself. ==Open Lines== Lines are opened in a segment of the show for listeners to call in and tell their anecdotes, which are generally mishaps or sexual situations. Although many subject names are suggested, all calls wind up discussing the aforementioned situations. From Monday to Thursday, subjects are rotated, but the last two hours of Friday's show are devoted to randomly take calls on previous subjects, in the section called Lo Que Sobr√≥ de la Semana (What's Left of This Week). Listeners' calls tend to have a somewhat stringent quality control: *Tony S√°nchez, the program's call screener, has to judge the story as funny enough to be put on air. Then the call is broadcast on air, so the hosts can talk to the caller. Usually each call is given approximately three minutes of air time. If the story isn't funny enough (e.g., a weak punchline), or runs too long, the call is hung up to the tune of two different songs: A bolero parody which starts with the line Ay, Qu√© Historia M√°s Pendeja (Ugh, What a Stupid Story) for unfunny calls, and a \\"Charge\\" tune instrumentalized with the syllable \\"blah\\" for long calls. *If callers start giving too much praise to Juan and Moonshadow, the cast will start singing a Puerto Rican bomba which starts Es Un Lamb√≥n (He's A Kiss-up) *If the hosts judge a story as over-the-top, or an outright fabrication, the cast will start chanting Embustero, Embustero... (Liar, Liar...) *If Tony S√°nchez's judgement about a call produces a flat or otherwise uninteresting call, Jim√©nez chastises him on the air and physically strikes him (or so it seems). Many callers complain that S√°nchez's judgement depends on his mood, on how well the anecdote is explained to him, or on the caller's gender. Tony S√°nchez is considered a traitor by most of the audience since he and the rest of the \\"mequetrefes\\" betrayed Luis Jim√©nez and stole his show. ==Discography== *2001- Tortilla Party *2002- Vacil√≥n 69 *2003- Chant for Neta *2005- Sin√±ematogr√°fico (Soundtrack) *2007- El Vacil√≥n The Movie (DVD) == References  * El Vacilon SBS Official website * Luis Jimenez Radio Show Category:American music radio programs Category:American radio sketch shows Category:Prank calling Category:1993 radio programme debuts Category:Spanish-language radio in the United States ","title":"El Vacil√≥n de la Ma√±ana"},{"id":"2223254","text":"The Ridda Wars (), or Wars of Apostasy, were a series of military campaigns launched by the Caliph Abu Bakr against rebel Arabian tribes during 632 and 633, just after the death of the Islamic Prophet Muhammad.Laura V. Vaglieri in The Cambridge History of Islam, p.58 The rebels' position was that they had submitted to Muhammad as the prophet of Allah, but owed nothing to Abu Bakr. Some rebels followed either Tulayha, Musaylima or Sajjah, all of whom claimed prophethood. Most of the tribes were defeated and reintegrated into the Caliphate. The peoples surrounding Mecca did not revolt. A detailed reconstruction of the events is complicated by the frequently contradictory and tendentious accounts found in primary sources. ==Prelude== In about the middle of May 632, Muhammad, now ailing, ordered a large expedition to be prepared against the Byzantine Empire in order to avenge the martyrs of the battle of Mu'tah. 3000 Muslims were to join it. Usama ibn Zaid, a young man and son of Zayd ibn Harithah who was killed in the battle at Mu'tah, was appointed as commander of this force so he could avenge the death of his father.Ibn Sad: p. 707 However, Muhammad died in June 632 and Abu Bakr was made the Caliph by a shura council in Saqifah. On the first day of his caliphate, Abu Bakr ordered the army of Usama to prepare for march. Abu Bakr was under great pressure regarding this expedition due to rising rebellion and apostasy across Arabia, but he was determined.Tabari: Vol. 2, p. 461. Before his march, Usama sent Umar to Abu Bakr and is reported to have said:However, Abu Bakr refused. He was moved to this decision at least partially by his desire to carry out the unfulfilled military plan of Muhammad. On June 26, 632, the army of Usama broke camp and moved out. After leaving Medina, Usama had marched to Tabuk. Most of the tribes in this region opposed him fiercely, but he defeated them. Usama raided far and wide in the region of Northern Arabia, starting with the Quza'a, and then made his way to Dawmatu l-Jandal (modern Al Jawf, Saudi Arabia). As a direct result of his operations, several rebel tribes resubmitted to Medinian rule and claimed that they re-accepted Islam. The Quza'a remained rebellious and unrepentant, but 'Amr ibn al-'As later attacked them and forced them to surrender again. Usama next marched to Mu'tah, attacked the Christian Arabs of the tribes of Banu Kalb and the Ghassanids in a small battle. Then he returned to Medina, bringing with him a large number of captives and a considerable amount of wealth, part of which comprised the spoils of war and part taxation of the re-conquered tribes. The Islamic army remained out of Medina for 40 days. ===Defence of Medina=== The concentrations of rebels nearest Medina were located in two areas: Abraq, 72 miles to the north-east, and Dhu Qissa, 24 miles to the east. These concentrations consisted of the tribes of Banu Ghatafan, the Hawazin, and the Tayy. Abu Bakr sent envoys to all the enemy tribes, calling upon them to remain loyal to Islam and continue to pay their Zakat. A week or two after the departure of Usama's army, the rebel tribes surrounded Medina, knowing that there were few fighting forces in the city. Meanwhile, Tulayha, a self- proclaimed prophet, reinforced the rebels at Dhu Qissa. In the third week of July 632, the apostate army moved from Dhu Qissa to Dhu Hussa, from where they prepared to launch an attack on Medina. Abu Bakr received intelligence of the rebel movements, and immediately prepared for the defense of Medina. As Usama's army was elsewhere, Abu Bakr scraped together a fighting force mainly from the clan of Mohammad, the Banu Hashim. The army had stalwarts like Talha ibn Ubaidullah and Zubair ibn al-Awam, who would later (in the 640s) conquer Egypt. Each of them was appointed commander of one-third of the newly organised force. Before the apostates could do anything, Abu Bakr launched his army against their outposts and drove them back to Dhu Hussa. The following day, Abu Bakr marched from Medina with the main army and moved towards Dhu Hussa. As the riding camels were all with Usama's army, he could only muster inferior pack camels as mounts. These pack camels, being untrained for battle, bolted when Hibal, the apostate commander at Zhu Hussa, made a surprise attack from the hills; as a result, the Muslims retreated to Medina, and the apostates recaptured the outposts that they lost a few days earlier. At Medina, Abu Bakr reorganised the army for battle and attacked the apostates during the night, taking them by surprise. The apostates retreated from Dhu Hussa to Dhu Qissa. The following morning, Abu Bakr led his forces to Dhu Qissa, and defeated the rebel tribes, capturing Dhu Qissa on 1 August 632. The defeated apostate tribes retreated to Abraq, where more clansmen of the Ghatfan, the Hawazin, and the Tayy were gathered. Abu Bakr left a residual force under the command of An-Numan ibn Muqarrin at Dhu Qissa and returned with his main army to Medina. On 4 August 632, Usama's army returned to Medina. Abu Bakr ordered Usama to rest and resupply his men there for future operations. Meanwhile, in the second week of August 632, Abu Bakr moved his army to Zhu Qissa. Merging An-Numan ibn Muqarrin's remaining forces with his own, Abu Bakr then moved to Abraq, where the retreated rebels had gathered, and defeated them. The remaining rebels retreated to Buzakha, where Tulayha had moved with his army from Samira. ==Abu Bakr's strategy== In the fourth week of August 632, Abu Bakr moved to Zhu Qissa with all available fighting forces. There he planned his strategy, in what would later be called the Campaign of Apostasy, to deal with the various enemies who occupied the rest of Arabia. The battles which he had fought recently against the apostate concentrations at Zhu Qissa and Abraq were in the nature of defensive actions to protect Medina and discourage further offensives by the enemy. These actions enabled Abu Bakr to secure a base from which he could fight the major campaign that lay ahead, thus gaining time for the preparation and launching of his main forces. Abu Bakr had to fight not one but several enemies: Tulayha at Buzakha, Malik bin Nuwaira at Butah, and Musaylima at Yamamah. He had to deal with widespread apostasy on the eastern and southern coasts of Arabia: in Bahrain, in Oman, in Mahra, in Hadhramaut and in Yemen. There was apostasy in the region south and east of Mecca and by the Quza'a in northern Arabia. Abu Bakr formed the army into several corps, the strongest of which was commanded by Khalid ibn Walid and assigned to fight the most powerful of the rebel forces. Other corps were given areas of secondary importance in which to subdue the less dangerous apostate tribes, and were dispatched after Khalid, according to the outcome of his operations. Abu Bakr's plan was first to clear west-central Arabia (the area nearest to Medina), then tackle Malik bin Nuwaira, and finally concentrate against the most dangerous and powerful enemy: the self-proclaimed prophet Musaylima. ==Military organization== The caliph distributed the available manpower among 11 main corps, each under its own commander, and bearing its own standard. The available manpower was distributed among these corps, and while some commanders were given immediate missions, others were given missions to be launched later. The commanders and their assigned objectives were: * Khalid Ibn Walid: Move against Tulaiha bin Khuwailad Al-Asdee (ÿ∑ŸèŸÑ€åÿ≠€Å ÿ®ŸÜ ÿÆŸà€åŸÑÿØ ÿßŸÑÿßÿ≥ÿØ€å) from the Asad Tribe (ÿ®ŸÜŸà ÿßÿ≥ÿØ) at Buzaakhah (ÿ®ÿ≤ÿßÿÆ€Å), then Malik bin Nuwaira, at Butah. * Ikrimah ibn Abi-Jahl: Confront Musaylima at Yamamah but not to engage until more forces were built up. * Amr ibn al-As: The apostate tribes of Quza'a and Wadi'a in the area of Tabuk and Daumat-ul-Jandal. * Shurahbil ibn Hasana: Follow Ikrimah and await the Caliph's instructions. * Khalid bin Saeed: Certain apostate tribes on the Syrian frontier. * Turaifa bin Hajiz: The apostate tribes of Hawazin and Bani Sulaim in the area east of Medina and Mecca. * Ala bin Al Hadhrami: The apostates in Bahrain. * Hudhaifa bin Mihsan: The apostates in Oman. * Arfaja bin Harthama.: The apostates in Mahra. * Muhajir bin Abi Umayyah: The apostates in the Yemen, then the Kinda in Hadhramaut. * Suwaid bin Muqaran: The apostates in the coastal area north of the Yemen. As soon as the organisation of the corps was complete, Khalid marched off, to be followed a little later by Ikrimah and 'Amr ibn al-'As. The other corps were held back by the caliph and dispatched weeks and even months later, according to the progress of Khalid's operations against the hard core of enemy opposition. Before the various corps left Zhu Qissa, however, envoys were sent by Abu Bakr to all apostate tribes in a final attempt to induce them to submit. ==CampaignsCentral Arabia=== Apostasy and rebellion in central Arabia was led by Musaylima, a self-proclaimed prophet, in the fertile region of Yamamah. He was mainly supported by the powerful tribe of Banu Hanifa. At Buzakha in north central Arabia, another self-proclaimed prophet, Tulayha, a tribal chief of Banu Asad, led the rebellion against Medina aided by the allied tribes of Banu Ghatafan, the Hawazin, and the Tayy. At Najd, Malik ibn Nuweira led the tribes of Banu Tamim against the authority of Medina. Buzakha On receiving intelligence of the Muslim preparations, Tulayha too prepared for battle, and was further reinforced by the contingents of the allied tribes. Before dispatching Khalid against Tulayha, Abu Bakr sought to reduce the latter's strength. Nothing could be done about the tribes of Bani Assad and Banu Ghatafan, which stood solidly behind Tulayha, but the Tayy were not so staunch in their support of Tulayha, and their chief, Adi ibn Hatim, was a devout Muslim. Adi was appointed by Abu Bakr to negotiate with the tribal elders to withdraw their contingent from Tulayha's army. The negotiations were a success, and Adi brought with him 500 horsemen of his tribe to reinforce Khalid's army. Khalid next marched against another apostate tribe, Jadila. Here again Adi ibn Hatim offered his services to persuade the tribe to submit without bloodshed. Bani Jadila submitted, and their 1000 warriors joined Khalid's army. Khalid, now much stronger than when he had left Zhu Qissa, marched for Buzakha. There, in mid-September 632 CE, he defeated Tulayha in the Battle of Buzakha. The remnants of Tulayha's army retreated to Ghamra, 20 miles from Buzakha, and were defeated in the Battle of Ghamra in the third week of September. Several tribes submitted to the Caliph after Khalid's decisive victories. Moving south from Buzakha, Khalid reached Naqra in October, with an army now 6000 strong, and defeated the rebel tribe of Banu Saleem in the Battle of Naqra. In the third week of October, Khalid defeated a tribal chieftess, Salma, in the battle of Zafar. Afterwards he moved to Najd against the rebel tribe of Banu Tamim and their Sheikh Malik ibn Nuwayrah. Najd At Najd, on learning of Khalid's decisive victories against apostates in Buzakha, many clans of Banu Tamim hastened to visit Khalid, but the Bani Yarbu', a branch of Bani Tamim, under their chief, Malik ibn Nuwayrah, hung back. Malik was a chief of some distinction: a warrior, noted for his generosity, and a famous poet. Bravery, generosity, and poetry were the three qualities most admired among the Arabs. Map detailing the route of Khalid ibn Walid's conquest of Arabia. At the time of Muhammad, he had been appointed as a tax collector for the tribe of Banu Tamim. As soon as Malik heard of the death of Muhammad, he gave back all the tax to his tribespeople, saying, \\"Now you are the owner of your wealth.\\"al-Balazuri: book no: 1, page no:107. Most scholars agreed that he was adhering to the normal beliefs of the Arabs of his time in which they could cease to pledge their allegiance to a tribe upon the death of its Sheikh. His riders were stopped by Khalid's army at the town of Buttah. Khalid asked them about the pact they signed with the self-proclaimed prophetess Sajjah; they responded it was merely for revenge against their enemies.Tabari: Vol 9 p. 501-2. When Khalid reached Najd he found no opposing army. He sent his cavalry to nearby villages and ordered them to call the Azaan (call to prayer) to each party they met. Zirrar bin Azwar, a squadron leader, arrested the family of Malik, claiming they did not answer the call to prayer. Malik avoided direct contact with Khalid's army and ordered his followers to scatter, and he and his family apparently moved away across the desert. He refused to give zakat, differentiating between prayer and zakat. Nevertheless, Malik was accused of rebellion against the state of Medina. He was also to be charged for his entering into the alliance with Sajjah against the Caliphate. Malik was arrested along with those of his clan. Malik was asked by Khalid about his crimes, and responded, \\"your master said this, your master said that\\", referring to Abu Bakr. Khalid declared Malik a rebel apostate and ordered his execution.Tabari: Vol. 2, p. 5 Yamamah Ikrimah ibn Abi-Jahl, one of the corps commanders, was instructed to make contact with Musaylima at Yamamah, but not to engage until Khalid joined him. Abu Bakr's intention in giving Ikrimah this mission was to tie Musaylima down at Yamamah, thereby freeing Khalid to deal with the apostate tribes of north- central Arabia without interference. Meanwhile, Abu Bakr sent Shurhabil's corps to reinforce Ikrimah at Yamamah. Ikrimah, however, in early September 632, attacked Musaylima's forces before the reinforcements arrived, and was defeated. He reported his actions to Abu Bakr, who, both pained and angered by the rashness of Ikrimah and his disobedience, ordered him to proceed with his force to Oman to assist Hudaifa; once Hudaifa had completed his task, he was to march to Mahra to help Arfaja, and thereafter go to Yemen to help Muhajir. Meanwhile, Abu Bakr sent orders to Khalid to march against Musaylima. Shurhabil's corps, stationed at Yamamah, was to reinforce Khalid's corps. In addition to this Abu Bakr assembled a fresh army of Ansar and Muhajireen in Medina that joined Khalid's corps at Butah before the combined force set out for Yamamah. Though Abu Bakr had instructed Shurhabil not to engage Musaylima's forces until Khalid's arrival, Shurhabil engaged Musaylima's forces anyway and was defeated, too. Khalid linked up with the remnants of Shurhabil's corps early in December 632. The combined force of Muslims, now 13,000 strong, finally defeated Musaylima's army in the Battle of Yamama, which was fought in the third week of December. The fortified city of Yamamah surrendered peacefully later that week. Khalid established his headquarters at Yamamah, from which he despatched columns throughout the plain of Aqraba to subdue the region around Yamamah. Thereafter, all of central Arabia submitted to Medina. What remained of the apostasy in the less vital areas of Arabia was rooted out by the Muslims in a series of well-planned campaigns within five months. ===Oman=== In mid-September 632, Abu Bakr dispatched Hudaifa bin Mihsan's corps to tackle the apostasy in Oman, where the dominant tribe of Azd had revolted under their chief Laqeet bin Malik, known more commonly as \\"Dhu'l-Taj\\" (\\"the Crowned One\\"). According to some reports, he also claimed prophethood. Hudaifa entered Oman, but not having sufficient strength to fight Dhu'l-Taj, he requested reinforcements from the Caliph, who sent Ikrimah from Yamamah to aid him in late September. The combined forces then defeated Dhu'l-Taj at a battle at Dibba, one of Dhu'l-Taj's strongholds, in November. Dhu'l-Taj himself was killed in the battle.Muhammad Rajih Jad'an, Abu Bakr As- Siddiq. Retrieved August 26, 2006. Hudaifa was appointed governor of Oman, and set about the re-establishment of law and order. Ikrimah, having no local administrative responsibility, used his corps to subdue the area around Daba, and, in a number of small actions, succeeded in breaking the resistance of those Azd who had continued to defy the authority of Medina. ===Northern Arabia=== Some time in October 632, Amr's corps was dispatched to the Syrian border to subdue the apostate tribes‚Äîmost importantly, the Quza'a and the Wadi'a (a part of the Bani Kalb)--in the region around Tabuk and Daumat-ul- Jandal (Al-Jawf). Amr was not able to beat the tribes into submission until Shurhabil joined him in January after the Battle of Yamamah. ===Yemen=== The Yemen had been the first province to rebel against the authority of Islam when the tribe of Ans rose in arms under the leadership of its chief and self- proclaimed prophet Al-Aswad Al-Ansi, the Black One. Yemen was controlled then by Al-Abna', a group descended from the Sasanian Persian garrison in Sanaa. When Badhan died, his son Shahr partially became governor of Yemen but was killed by Al-Aswad. Al-Aswad was later killed by Fayruz al-Daylami, also an abna' member, who was sent by Muhammad, and thereafter Fairoz acted as governor of Yemen at San'a. When word arrived that Mohammad had died, the people of the Yemen again revolted, this time under the leadership of a man named Ghayth ibn Abd Yaghuth. The avowed aim of the apostates was to drive the Muslims out of the Yemen by assassinating Fairoz and other important Muslim leaders. Fairoz somehow escaped and took shelter in the mountains in June or July 632. For the next six months Fairoz remained in his stronghold, during which time he was joined by thousands of Yemeni Muslims. When he felt strong enough, Fairoz marched to San'a and defeated Qais, who retreated with his remaining men northeast to Abyan, where they all surrendered and were subsequently pardoned by the caliph. ===Mahra=== From Oman, following the orders of Abu Bakr, Ikrimah marched to Mahra to join Arfaja bin Harthama. As Arfaja had not yet arrived, Ikrimah, instead of waiting for him, tackled the local rebels on his own. At Jairut, Ikrimah met two rebel armies preparing for battle. Here he persuaded the weaker to embrace Islam and then joined up with them to defeat their opponents. Having re-established Islam in Mahra, Ikrimah moved his corps to Abyan, where he rested his men and awaited further developments. ===Bahrain=== After the Battle of Yamamah, Abu Bakr sent Ala bin Al Hadhrami's corps against the rebels of Bahrain. Ala arrived in Bahrain to find the apostate forces gathered at Hajr and entrenched in a strong position. Ala mounted a surprise attack one night and captured the city. The rebels retreated to the coastal regions, where they made one more stand but were decisively defeated. Most of them surrendered and reverted to Islam. This operation was completed at about the end of January 633. ===Hadhramaut=== The last of the great revolts of the apostasy was that of the powerful tribe of Kindah, which inhabited the region of Najran, Hadhramaut, and eastern Yemen. They did not break into revolt until January 633. Ziyad bin Lubaid, Muslim governor of Hadhramaut, operated against them and raided Riyaz, after which the whole of the Kindah broke into revolt under al-Ash'ath ibn Qays and prepared for war. However, the strength of the two forces, i.e. apostate and Muslim, was so well balanced that neither side felt able to start serious hostilities. Ziyad waited for reinforcements before attacking the rebels. Reinforcements were on the way. al-Muhajir ibn Abi Umayya, the last of the corps commanders to be despatched by Abu Bakr, defeated some rebel tribes in Najran, south-eastern Arabia, and was directed by Abu Bakr to march to Hadhramaut and join Ziyad against the Kindah. The Caliph also instructed Ikrimah, who was at Abyan, to join Ziyad and Muhajir's forces. In late January 633 the forces of Muhajir and Ziyad combined at Zafar, capital of Hadhramaut, under the overall command of the former, and defeated al-Ash'ath, who retreated to the fortified town of Nujair. Just after this battle the corps of Ikrimah also arrived. The three Muslim corps, under the overall command of Muhajir, advanced on Nujair and laid siege to the fortified city. Nujair was captured some time in mid-February 633. With the defeat of the Kindah at Nujair the last of the great apostate movements collapsed. Arabia was safe for Islam. The Campaign of the Apostasy was fought and completed during the 11th year of the Hijra. The year 12 Hijri dawned on March 18, 633, with Arabia united under the central authority of the Caliph at Medina. This campaign was Abu Bakr's greatest political and military triumph, and was a complete success. ==Aftermath== With the collapse of the rebellions, Abu Bakr now decided to expand the empire. It is unclear whether his intention was to mount a full-scale expansion, or preemptive attacks to secure a buffer zone between the Islamic state and the powerful Sassanid and Byzantine empires. This set the stage for the Islamic conquest of Persia. Khalid was sent to the Persian Empire with an army consisting of 18,000 volunteers, and conquered the richest province of the Persian empire: Iraq. Thereafter, Abu Bakr sent his armies to invade Roman Syria, an important province of the Byzantine Empire. ==Consequences== The events were later regarded as primarily a religious movement by Arabic historians. However, the early sources indicate that in reality it was also an attempt to restore political control over the Arabian tribes.Laura V. Vaglieri in The Cambridge History of Islam, p.58 After all, the rebelling Arabs only refused to pay Zakat (charity), but they did not refuse to perform the salah. This, however, is disputed and explained by Sunni scholars such that the dictation of Zakat was one of the Five Pillars of Islam and its denial or withholding is an act of denial of a cornerstone of the faith, and is therefore an act of apostasy. Bernard Lewis states that the fact that Islamic historians have regarded this as a primarily religious movement was due to a later interpretation of events in terms of a theological world- view. The opponents of the Muslim armies were not only apostates, but also tribes which were largely or even completely independent from the Muslim community. However, these revolts also had a religious aspect: Medina had become the centre of a new Arabian social and political system of which religion was an integral part; consequently it was inevitable that any reaction against this system should have a religious aspect.The Encyclopaedia of Islam.

His work tended to be very decorative, much of it centered on depiction of young women set among flowers. He later became known for his murals and designs in stained glass. ==Life and work== Robert Reid was born in Stockbridge, Massachusetts and attended the School of the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston under Otto Grundmann, where he was later an instructor. In 1884 he moved to New York City, studying at the Art Students League, and in 1885 he went to Paris to study at the Acad√©mie Julian under Gustave Boulanger and Jules Joseph Lefebvre. His early pictures were figures of French peasants, painted at √âtaples. Upon returning to New York in 1889, he worked as a portraitist and later became an instructor at the Art Students League and Cooper Union. ===Paintings=== He painted three murals for the Manufactures Building at the 1893 World's Columbian Exposition in Chicago, and exhibited four paintings in its Fine Arts Building. His work, including the tragic Her First Born (1888), was awarded a medal for excellence.John J. Flinn, Official Guide to the World's Columbian Exposition (Chicago: The Columbian Guide Company, 1893), pp. 102-03. Reid was a member of the Ten American Painters, who seceded from the Society of American Artists in 1897. His painting Dawn was awarded the 1898 First Hallgarten Prize by the National Academy of Design. Reid worked on several mural projects around the turn of the century. When he returned to paintings, around 1905, his work was more naturalistic, and his palette tended toward soft pastels.

The Rotunda of the Massachusetts State House in Boston contains his three large mural panels--James Otis Delivering his Speech against the Writs of Assistance, Paul Revere's Ride, and The Boston Tea Party. He executed a mural panel for the American Pavilion at the 1900 Exposition Universelle in Paris. His murals for the Palace of Fine Arts building at the Panama‚ÄìPacific International Exposition (San Francisco, 1915) were an extraordinary tribute to the Arts. Eight huge panels graced the ceiling of the rotunda: The Four Golds of California (Golden Metal, Wheat, Citrus Fruits, and Poppies); plus Ideals in Art, Inspirations of All Arts, the Birth of European Art and Birth of Oriental Art These paintings no longer exist in San Francisco's Palace of Fine Arts, which was re-built in the 1960s, and their current whereabouts are unknown.

Trespass to land is actionable per se. Thus, the party whose land is entered upon may sue even if no actual harm is done. In some jurisdictions, this rule may also apply to entry upon public land having restricted access. A court may order payment of damages or an injunction to remedy the tort. By law, trespass for mesne profits is a suit against someone who has been ejected from property that did not belong to them. The suit is for recovery of damages the trespasser caused to the property and for any profits he or she may have made while in possession of that property. For a trespass to be actionable, the tortfeasor must voluntarily go to a specific location, but need not be aware that he entered the property of a particular person. If A forces B unwillingly onto C's land, C will not have action in trespass against B, because B's actions were involuntary. C may instead claim against A. Furthermore, if B is deceived by A as to the ownership or boundaries of C's land, A may be jointly liable with B for B's trespass. In most jurisdictions, if a person were to accidentally enter onto private property, there would be no trespass, because the person did not intend any violation. However, in Australia, negligence may substitute the requirement for intent. If a trespass is actionable and no action is taken within reasonable or prescribed time limits, the land owner may forever lose the right to seek a remedy, and may even forfeit certain property rights. See Adverse possession and Easement by prescription. Trespass may also arise upon the easement of one person upon the land of another. For example, if A grants B a right to pass freely across A's land, then A would trespass upon B's easement by erecting a locked gate or otherwise blocking B's rightful access. In some jurisdictions trespass while in possession of a firearm, which may include a low-power air weapon without ammunition, constitutes a more grave crime of armed trespass.Marple Rifle & Pistol Club, Gun Law in the UK The maxim \\"cuius est solum, eius est usque ad coelum et ad infernos\\" (whoever owns the land owns it all the way to heaven and to hell) is said to apply, however that has been limited by practical considerations. For example, aerial trespass is limited to airspace which might be used (therefore aeroplanes cannot be sued). Landowners may not put up structures to prevent this.TWA v Hickel (California 1940) The courts have been more lenient with underground trespass. The Kentucky Court of Appeal in Edwards v Sims (1929) 24 SW 2d 619 seems to affirm the maxim without qualification, whereas the New South Wales Supreme Court in Australia seemed more reluctant to do so in Di Napoli v New Beach Apartments (2004) Aust Torts Reports 81-728. There is therefore an asymmetry between aerial and underground trespass, which may be resolved by the fact the ground is almost always used (to support buildings and other structures) whereas airspace loses its practical use above the height of skyscrapers. There may be regulations that hold a trespasser to a higher duty of care, such as strict liability for timber trespass (removing trees beyond a permitted boundary), which is a type of trespass to chattels as a result of a trespass to land. Some cases also provide remedies for trespass not amounting to personal presence, as where an object is intentionally deposited, or farm animals are permitted to wander upon the land of another. Furthermore, if a new use of nearby land interferes with a land owner's quiet enjoyment of his rights, there may be an action for nuisance, as where a disagreeable aroma or noise from A drifts across the land of B. Trespass ab initio is when a person is granted access to land but then abuses that access. The entry to the land is considered to have been a trespass from the beginning. This only applies to access given by law, not to access given by a person (as established by the Six Carpenters' Case). ==United KingdomEngland=== In English law, trespass to land involves the \\"unjustifiable interference with land which is in the immediate and exclusive possession of another\\". Land is defined as the surface, subsoil, airspace and anything permanently attached to the land, such as houses. It is not necessary to prove that harm was suffered to bring a claim, and is instead actionable per se. While most trespasses to land are intentional, it can also be committed negligently. Accidental trespass also incurs liability, with an exception for entering land adjoining a road unintentionally (such as in a car accident). Although previously a pure tort, the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994 created some circumstances in which trespass to land can also be a crime. ===Scotland=== Trespass is an offence under Scots Law; however, the legislation was amended under the Land Reform (Scotland) Act 2003 which established universal access rights to most land and inland water. These reforms do not apply (hence trespass remains an offence) to: :*Houses and gardens, and non-residential buildings and associated land; :*Land in which crops are growing; :*Land next to a school and used by the school; :*Sports or playing fields when these are in use and where the exercise of access rights would interfere with such use; :*Land developed and in use for recreation and where the exercise of access rights would interfere with such use; :*Golf courses (but you can cross a golf course provided you don‚Äôt interfere with any games of golf); :*Places like airfields, railways, telecommunication sites, military bases and installations, working quarries and construction sites; and :*Visitor attractions or other places which charge for entry. ==United States== In most states, a criminal trespass to land is defined by statute and constitutes a misdemeanor.E.g. \\"criminal trespass\\" in Indiana Code 35-43-2-2. In some states, it may be a felony under certain circumstances (e.g., trespassing on a research facility or school property). Remedies between private parties for trespass may include an injunction or money damages. ==See also== * Intrusion * Invasion * Trespass * Right of way * Adverse possession * Public nuisance * Freedom to roam ==References== Category:Tort law Category:Real property law ","title":"Trespass to land"},{"id":"2223279","text":"Richard Murphy (6 August 1927 ‚Äì 30 January 2018) was an Anglo-Irish poet. ==BiographyEarly years=== Murphy was born to an Anglo-Irish family at Milford House, near the Mayo-Galway border, in 1927. He spent much of his early childhood in Ceylon (now Sri Lanka) where his father William Lindsay Murphy served in the Colonial Service and was active as mayor of Colombo, later becoming Governor General of the Bahamas (in succession to the Duke of Windsor). Murphy received his education at the King's School, Canterbury and Wellington College. He won a scholarship to Magdalen College, Oxford at the age of 17, where he studied English under C.S. Lewis. He was later educated at the Sorbonne, and ran a school in Crete between 1953 and 1954. In his Archaeology of Love (1955), Murphy reflects on his experiences in England and Continental Europe. His childhood in Ireland was documented in the film The Other Irish Travellers, made by his niece Fiona Murphy. ===Return to Ireland=== In 1954, he settled at Cleggan, on the coast of Galway. Several years later, in 1959, he purchased and renovated the Ave Maria, a traditional hooker-type boat, from Inishbofin fisherman, Michael Schofield, which he used to ferry visitors to the island. He purchased Ardoile√°n (High Island), a small island in the vicinity of Inishbofin, in 1969. ==Personal life== Murphy married Patsy Strang. From 1971, he was a poet-in-residence at nine American universities, in Princeton turning his office also into his bedroom, Joyce Carol Oates writing a short story about this. In later years he lived in Sri Lanka, having previously divided his time between Durban, South Africa, where his daughter and her family reside, and Dublin. He was the maternal grandfather of YouTuber Caspar Lee.Richard Murphy, The Kick: A Life among Writers (Granta: 2002), pg. 346. A memoir of his life and times, The Kick, was published by Granta in 2002, constructed from detailed diaries kept over the course of five decades.

The airport was located five kilometers northwest of downtown Iloilo City in the district of Mandurriao. It was the fourth-busiest airport overall and the busiest domestic airport in the Philippines, accommodating over 700,000 passengers and over 5,000 tons of cargo in 2005.Iloilo Airport Traffic Report , Air Transportation Office statistics posted on ExploreIloilo.com, retrieved April 28, 2007 During the construction of the new Iloilo International Airport, it was also known as Iloilo-Mandurriao Airport. Having been in service since the 1930s, Mandurriao Airport has since been replaced by the Iloilo-Cabatuan/Santa Barbara International Airport, and subsequently decommissioned on June 14, 2007. A sprawling business district, known as Iloilo Business Park occupies the airport site. ==HistoryOperational years (1937-2007)=== Mandurriao Airport was built in 1937 and also served as a World War II airfield. The year 1981 saw the arrival of Pope John Paul II to the province of Iloilo as one of his stops during his 1981 Philippines visit, with the airport being used to facilitate his landing. The new passenger terminal was built in 1982. However, in the 1990s, problems in Mandurriao Airport began to rise due to the liberalization of the Philippine aviation industry and the rise of air travel in the country. The increasing incidents of terrorism in the Philippines forced aviation officials to restrict airport access only to passengers, the sealing of doors and windows at airport terminals being an essential component thereof. The terminal's architecture had posed problems for passengers, causing six to thirty three air-conditioning units to be installed but another barrage of problems hit the airport, which included outdated facilities, more poor passenger comfort, and others. Passenger complaints also focused on having their baggage manually checked due to the updated machines being for the sole use of Philippine Airlines. The airport complex likewise was located directly alongside major city thoroughfares, in particular the city's main highway, the Tom√°s Confesor Highway, which complicated the flow of traffic in and around the area. By 1995, Iloilo's provincial government and the Philippine National Government have agreed to a proposal of building a new airport outside of the city, selecting Cabatuan as the new airport site. The last flights served by the airport happened on June 13, 2007, prior to the opening of the current Iloilo International Airport. ===Future development=== Under Executive Order 282, an Asset Disposition Program was created to study the method of privatization of the property. Executive Order 360 devolved the chairmanship of this program to the Department of Finance. The Old Iloilo Airport property in Manduriao was scheduled for privatization by the first half of 2007. The city government views the successful privatization of this property as key to the revitalization of Iloilo City. As of 3 April 2007, 5 large Philippine real estate developers pre-qualified as bidders of the airport. These are Ayala Land, Empire East, Robinsons Land, Rockwell Land, and SM Prime. The Privatization Council set the minimum price for the 54 hectare property at P1.2 billion (P2,200 per square meter). The bidding for the Manduriao Airport was conducted on 9 May 2007. Among the pre-qualified bidders, only Robinsons Land, Empire East, and SM Prime Participated. The following table shows their respective bids: {  !Developer !Bid - Robinsons Land P1,089 million - Empire East P701 million - SM Prime P436 million } The Old Iloilo Airport Bids and Awards Committee (BAC) declared a failed bidding because no bid went above the minimum price. Thereafter, the BAC decided to enter into a Negotiated Sale process. The 5 pre-qualified bidders were then invited to participate. However, a member of the Privatization Council was adamant in keeping the P1.2 billion minimum price. Only Robinsons Land submitted a bid on the last day of the Negotiated Sale, 14 June 2007. It bid P908 million for the property. The BAC had no choice but to declare a failure on the Negotiated Sale. Unfortunately for the people of Iloilo and the local city government, some BAC members have no private sector experience and they do not see the logic behind RLC's lower bid. The BAC worked on lowering the minimum price of the property. However, some agencies have not consulted their principals on the minimum price that these principals are comfortable with. Months after battling technicalities, the bidding pushed through. Megaworld acquired the 54-hectare old Iloilo Airport site for Php 1.2 billion (roughly $2.5 million) to be developed into a mixed-use residential and commercial complex. As of 2016, the airport grounds have become Iloilo City's central business district, named as Iloilo Business Park and is now home to several luxury hotels, condominiums, and various call center companies. The APEC Finance meetings in 2015 was hosted in the Iloilo Convention Center, which occupies the former site of the airport terminal. The former control tower of Mandurriao Airport is the airport's only surviving remnant and it serves as a monument to Iloilo's aviation history and Philippine aviation history. The structure also pays homage to Pope John Paul II, who used the airport on his Iloilo stop during his 1981 visit to the Philippines. ==Airlines and destinations== The destinations of Mandurriao Airport before its closure. ==See also== *Iloilo International Airport ==References *Profile of Mandurriao Airport *World Aero Data - Mandurriao Airport (ILO) Details *Executive Order 282 details *Executive Order 360 details Category:Defunct airports in the Philippines Category:Buildings and structures in Iloilo City Category:Transportation in Iloilo ","title":"Mandurriao Airport"},{"id":"2223287","text":"CKTG-FM is a Canadian radio station, broadcasting at 105.3 FM in Thunder Bay, Ontario, owned by Acadia Broadcasting. The station broadcasts a country music format using the on-air brand name as Country 105. ==History== The station was launched in 1944 as CFPA at 1230 kHz, an AM Canadian Broadcasting Corporation's Dominion Network station owned by local businessman Ralph Parker. When the Dominion Network dissolved in 1962, CFPA transferred its affiliation to the main CBC Radio network. It ceased airing CBC programming in 1972, adopting a country music format. In 1980, the station was purchased by Leader Broadcasting and adopted the call sign CJLB. In 1988, the station was acquired by Newcap Broadcasting. In 1986, CJLB received CRTC approval to add a low-power FM transmitter in Nipigon/Red Rock, Ontario on 96.3 MHz to rebroadcast the programs of CJLB Thunder Bay. CJLB applied to move Nipigon's frequency to 96.1 MHz, and it is uncertain if this was ever implemented.Decision CRTC 86-1137 In 1995, Newcap entered a local marketing agreement with Dougall Media, giving Dougall the right to manage the station. On November 2, 1994, CJLB was given approval by the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) to convert to FM.CRTC Decision 94-842. In 1996, the station moved to 105.3 MHz. In 2002, CJLB-FM dropped its KIXX 105 country music format and adopted a hot adult contemporary/CHR format as Hot 105. In 2004, Dougall terminated the LMA when Newcap applied to purchase CJUK. Newcap changed CJLB's callsign to its current CKTG calls and adopted its current classic rock format as 105.3 The Giant in early 2005. In mid-2005, CFQK-FM in Kaministiquia, Ontario, located near Thunder Bay which had no affiliation with CKTG dropped their \\"Larry FM\\" variety hits format to Hot AC/CHR as HOT FM. On March 16, 2009, CKTG became the first radio station in Canada to carry The Bob & Tom Show, a syndicated radio show from the United States.Milkman Unlimited, March 11, 2009. On July 14, 2009, Newcap announced it would be selling CKTG and sister station CJUK-FM to Acadia Broadcasting for $4.5 million CAD plus working capital.

The college created a new Department of Biomedical Engineering and a Center for Response and Security Engineering and Technology, doubled the number of faculty, and increased its research funding tenfold to $7 million in active grants. Pantiƒá also secured $2.5 million in federal funding to establish a Material Science and Engineering Laboratory at the former Kelly Air Force Base. Through strategic partnerships with various state and national agencies, national companies and small businesses, she raised more than $5 million in various donations and equipment grants. She revived relationships with engineering alumni and was instrumental in securing a $250,000 endowment donation, the single largest alumni gift to the college and UTSA. In her last four years, the college increased its enrollment by 75%, being especially effective in attracting female students (83% enrollment increase) and minorities (50% of students are Hispanic). ===At San Francisco State University=== While at SFSU, Pantiƒá improved the engineering programs in quality, size and visibility, and, as a result‚Äîfor the first time in SFSU history ‚Äì the programs were ranked among the top 50 undergraduate programs by U.S. News & World Report. She established a Partnership for Engineering Education that resulted in a 30 percent enrollment increase and played a crucial role in shaping and bringing to life a partnership with a neighboring community college to offer upper-division engineering courses there. This project serves as a blueprint for cooperation between the 23-campus California State University (CSU) system, of which San Francisco State is a member, and California's community colleges. Through a partnership with the local chapter of the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) and a major grant from the National Science Foundation, she established a Center for Applied Electromagnetics that supports undergraduate and graduate research. Pantiƒá was active in state-level fundraising for engineering programs. She worked with fellow CSU Engineering deans on the successful $10-million California Workforce Initiative to support strategic disciplines such as agriculture, biotechnology, computer science, engineering, and nursing. She also served on the Executive Committee of the Texas Engineering and Technology Consortium, a private-public partnership that raised $8 million to increase the number of engineering and computer science graduates in the state of Texas. ===President of Wentworth Institute=== Pantiƒá's appointment as Wentworth Institute of Technology's fourth president was announced on June 8, 2005. She took office August 1, 2005 and was the first female engineer to head an institute of technology in the United States. She was formally installed as president of Wentworth on April 5, 2006. (webcast) Pantiƒá retired as President of Wentworth on May 31, 2019, after 14 years at its helm.https://wit.edu/presidential-transition/2-20-18 During her tenure as its President, she has shaped Wentworth into the university it is known as today, as well as dramatically increased its position in the region and its national standings. ==References * Wentworth announcements: 1 and 2 *UTSA Today *San Antonio Express-News Category:Heads of universities and colleges in the United States Category:Living people Category:American people of Serbian descent Category:1951 births Category:Senior Members of the IEEE Category:Electrical engineers Category:American women engineers Category:Serbian women engineers Category:Wentworth Institute of Technology Category:University of Ni≈° alumni Category:21st-century women engineers Category:Women heads of universities and colleges ","title":"Zorica Pantiƒá"},{"id":"2223309","text":"The Bagley-Keene Act of 1967, officially known as the Bagley-Keene Open Meeting Act, implements a provision of the California Constitution which declares that \\"the meetings of public bodies and the writings of public officials and agencies shall be open to public scrutiny\\", and explicitly mandates open meetings for California State agencies, boards, and commissions. The act facilitates accountability and transparency of government activities and protects the rights of citizens to participate in State government deliberations. Similarly, California's Brown Act of 1953 protects citizen rights with regard to open meetings at the county and local government level. The act also reaffirms, \\"The people of this state do not yield their sovereignty to the agencies which serve them. The people, in delegating authority, do not give their public servants the right to decide what is good for the people to know and what is not good for them to know. The people insist on remaining informed so that they may retain control over the instruments they have created.\\" ==Select provisions of Act== Except as otherwise provided, State bodies shall provide an opportunity for members of the public to directly address the State body on each agenda item before or during the state body's discussion or consideration of an item. However, the Act allows a great many exceptions to this provision. Notice of State body meetings shall be provided to any person who makes such a request in writing at least 10 days in advance. Notices shall include a specific agenda for meetings, including the items of business to be transacted or discussed, and no item shall be added to the agenda subsequent to the notice. Agendas of public meetings and other writings, when distributed to the members of a state body for discussion or consideration at a public meeting of such body, are public records under the California Public Records Act. State bodies may, however, take action on non-agendized items of business under certain circumstances, most notably upon a determination by a majority vote of the State body that an emergency situation exists. Any person attending an open and public meeting of a State body shall have the right to record the proceedings on a tape recorder. Each member of the state body shall be provided a copy of the Act upon his or her appointment to membership or assumption of office. No State agency shall conduct any meeting or function in any facility prohibiting admittance to any person on the basis of race, religious creed, color, national origin, ancestry, or sex. ==Act's preamble== Section 11120: It is the public policy of this state that public agencies exist to aid in the conduct of the people's business and the proceedings of public agencies be conducted openly so that the public may remain informed. In enacting this article the Legislature finds and declares that it is the intent of the law that actions of state agencies be taken openly and that their deliberation be conducted openly. The people of this state do not yield their sovereignty to the agencies which serve them. The people, in delegating authority, do not give their public servants the right to decide what is good for the people to know and what is not good for them to know. The people insist on remaining informed so that they may retain control over the instruments they have created.

It comprised four leading English churchmen, and one Scottish minister (Thomas Young). They went on to provide leadership for the anti- episcopal forces in the Church of England, continuing into the Westminster Assembly, where they also opposed the Independent movement. The name is an acronym derived from the initials of the five authors: Stephen Marshall, Edmund Calamy, Thomas Young, Matthew Newcomen, and William Spurstow. Their first pamphlet, An Answer to a booke entituled, An Humble Remonstrance. In Which, the Original of Liturgy and Episcopacy is Discussed, appeared in March, 1641. The pamphlet was written in response to Joseph Hall's An Humble Remonstrance to the High Court of Parliament. It is thought that John Milton wrote the postscript for Smectymnuus's reply. This response provoked Hall to write another reply: A Defence of the Humble Remonstrance, against the Frivolous and false Expectations of Smectymnuus. Smectymnuus answered Hall again with their A Vindication of the Answer to the Humble Remonstrance, from the Unjust Imputations of Frivolousnesse and Falsehood. Milton also published two tracts defending the Smectymnuus group from Hall: Animadversions upon The Remonstrants Defence Against Smectymnvvs (1641) and Apology for Smectymnuus (1642).Lewalski, Barbara K.

It is run by Canadian Centre for Civic Media and Arts Development Inc. broadcasting over FM on 105.5 MHz in Toronto, Ontario and has also served as a community radio station for the residents of the Jane and Finch corridor in North Toronto. CHRY's studios are located at York University's Student Centre, while its transmitter is located on top of the Vanier College residence building. ==History== CHRY was founded as a closed-circuit cable radio service, called Radio York, in 1965, and was located on the top floor of Vanier College and served campus residences and the cafeteria located at Central Square. On June 1, 1986, upon successful application to the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) for a broadcasting licence, began to broadcast as CHRY at 50W, with a transmitting antenna located on the top of Vanier College's residence building. As well, on this day, it became incorporated as CHRY Community Radio, Inc. In 1997, it moved from its old Vanier College studios to the fourth floor of York University's Student Centre, where it is today. This move was financed by a $40,000 loan from the undergraduate student association, which was forgiven four years later. 120px A limitation to CHRY was that its licence was Class B, which effectively meant that it was \\"unprotected\\" legally from claims of signal interference, effectively requiring it to cease operations if another broadcasting interest was affected in some way by CHRY's operation. However, in 2006, the CRTC accepted CHRY's application to reclassify its licence from \\"Class B\\" to \\"Class A\\", thus effecting \\"protected status\\" for the radio station. CHRY serves the north western part of Toronto. Prior to its relaunch in 2015, more than one- third of its schedule is devoted to the music and culture of the Caribbean. It employs two full-time staff, several other part-time staff, and is supported by the work of over one hundred volunteers from both York's student body and the surrounding community. On May 1, 2015, CHRY cancelled all of its existing programs, dismissed all of its volunteers and rebranded itself as \\"VIBE 105\\", adopting an \\"urban alternative\\" format which it describes as \\"a diverse and metropolitan blend of Cultural, Electronic and Remix programming\\" which includes Electronic, Remix, Reggae, Soca, Afrobeat, Hip Hop and R&B.; The station will also air talk programming. Volunteers are to be in supportive roles while on air talent will be professionalized in a departure from the station's long time commitment to community radio.http://74.213.160.39/about- us/backgrounder-2/ The dismissed programmers organized community meetings and campaigning under the name #SAVECHRY in an unsuccessful effort to overturn the station's decision. In 2016, the station applied for a license to add a nested FM repeater on 105.3 (with an average power of 92 watts, maximum of 155), with a transmitter located at 100 Wingarden Court in Scarborough (co-located with CJRK- FM).https://services.crtc.gc.ca/pub/DocWebBroker/OpenDocument.aspx?AppNo=201607962 This was denied on June 16, 2017. CRTC Decision 204-2017 ==Financial support== CHRY is supported in part by student levy (contributions via the York University Graduate Students Association and York Federation of Students (YFS)), through occasional grants for which the station is eligible due to its charitable status, by York University through occasional workstudy grants, and by its listenership through pledges. The rest of its funding is from advertising revenue. ===Alumni=== *Matt Galloway CBC Radio host, former CHRY music directorhttps://yfile.news.yorku.ca/2017/06/20/honorary-degree- recipient-matt-galloway-urges-new-grads-to-listen-to-life/ *Danko Jones - musician, former CHRY DJ *Dallas Good - lead singer of the Sadie's, former CHRY DJ. ==References * VIBE 1055 * CHRY-FM * Another One Bites the Dust?

It is Vol. 1 of The Last Roundup series. The second installment of the series, Oh, Play That Thing, was published in 2004. The third, The Dead Republic, was published in 2010. The book follows the early life of Henry Smart, from his childhood in the slums of early 20th century Dublin to his involvement in the Easter Rising and the Irish War of Independence. ==Plot summary== The novel is set in Ireland in the era of political upheaval between the 1916 Easter Rising and the eventual truce signed with the United Kingdom in 1921, seen through the eyes of young Henry Smart, from his childhood to early twenties. Henry, as a member of the Irish Citizen Army, becomes personally acquainted with several historical characters, including Patrick Pearse, James Connolly and Michael Collins. Energized by Sinn F√©in's victory in the General Election of 1918 and the party's establishment of the independent Irish Republic, Henry participates in the Soloheadbeg Ambush, the first engagement of the Irish War of Independence, as a lookout. Later, he becomes a gunman in the ensuing guerilla war against the British, setting barracks on fire, shooting G-men and training others to do the same. At the end of the novel, Henry comes to think that the endless violence and killing of innocent people has little to do with the concept of a free Ireland, or the prospect of a better life in Ireland and more about personal gain. ==Cover== One cover to \\"A Star Called Henry\\" features a young member of the Irish Republican Army on patrol.

He served for a brief period as the fourth Prime Ministers of Saint Lucia following the resignation of John Compton. Lewis, a former director of the Organisation of Eastern Caribbean States, assumed the office of Prime Minister on April 2, 1996. He also served as Minister of Finance, Planning and Development, and Minister of External Affairs. In elections that followed on May 23, 1997, Lewis and the UWP suffered a huge setback, losing all but one of their seats in Parliament, forcing him to resign in favor of the leader of the Saint Lucia Labour Party, Dr. Kenny Anthony. Compton defeated Lewis for the UWP leadership in a party conference in Soufri√®re on March 13, 2005. Compton received 260 votes against 135 for Lewis.\\"Ex-prime minister regains leadership of St Lucian opposition\\", Caribbean Media Corporation (nl.newsbank.com), March 14, 2005. Following this defeat, Lewis resigned from the United Workers Party and joined the Saint Lucia Labour Party. On 7 September 2006, the executive of the Saint Lucia Labour Party endorsed Dr. Vaughan Lewis as its candidate for the Castries Central constituency in the December 2006 general election. Lewis' defection to Labour was controversial. After losing two general elections in a row, Lewis had the opportunity to win the Castries Central seat in a February 2006 by-election. He then told UWP supporters first that he was the endorsed candidate. He then told them that he was taking time to make up his mind. Finally, he quit the UWP all together and said that he was no longer interested in electoral politics. However, Lewis had been in talks with high- ranking members of the Saint Lucia Labour Party about his defection since he was defeated by Compton in the leadership contest. More troubling for Labour's top strategists was the fact that Lewis had brought Desmond Brathwaite into the party with him. Brathwaite is best known as the Women's Affairs Minister who was charged with kicking his wife down a flight of stairs in 1994. He was terribly unpopular but became so close to Lewis in 1996 that when asked why he didn't drop Brathwaite for political reasons, Lewis replied, \\"I'd rather lose with Brathwaite than win without him.\\" It led to the most crushing defeat in St Lucian political history. There were two other candidates, one of whom, then Senator Petra Nelson, subsequently left the Saint Lucia Labour Party to campaign for the United Workers Party in the 2006 General Elections. On the face of it, Labour put up a good front, hailing Lewis as a great Caribbean citizen and intellectual who was betrayed by Sir John Compton. Lewis failed in his bid to win the Castries Central parliamentary seat from the UWP candidate Richard Frederick in the 2006 general elections held on December 11. Lewis returned to academia and was a Professor at the University of the West Indies, St Augustine Campus in Trinidad and Tobago. He has returned to St. Lucia occasionally to appear on the platform of the St Lucia Labour Party. He was chosen as part of a task force to explore the possibility of a union between Trinidad and Tobago and The Organisation of Eastern Caribbean States. After the St Lucia Labour Party government returned to office in 2011, Lewis became a special advisor in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs He is married to lawyer Shirley Lewis, a Barbadian native and former Mayor of Castries. He is part of the prominent Lewis clan, son of St. Lucia's first Governor General, Sir Allen Lewis, and nephew of Sir Arthur Lewis, Nobel prize winner in economics. In February 2016, to mark St Lucia Independence Day, he became one of the first knights of the Order of Saint Lucia, granting him the title of 'Sir'. == See also == * List of Prime Ministers of Saint Lucia * United Workers' Party (Saint Lucia) * Politics of Saint Lucia * Organisation of Eastern Caribbean States ==References *Office of the Prime Minister of Saint Lucia *Biography available in Prime Ministers of Saint Lucia Category:1940 births Category:Living people Category:Prime Ministers of Saint Lucia Category:Place of birth missing (living people) Category:United Workers Party (Saint Lucia) politicians Category:Children of national leaders ","title":"Vaughan Lewis"},{"id":"2223358","text":"Bryan Michael Pilgrim (born 3 January 1947)Profile of Michael Pilgrim is a Saint Lucian politician.

It is eaten for breakfast or as a snack or light meal. It is usually served with a savory curry or bhaji, as in puri bhaji, but may also be eaten with sweet dishes. Puris are most commonly served as breakfast and snacks. It is also served at special or ceremonial functions as part of ceremonial rituals along with other vegetarian food offered in prayer as prasadam. == Name == The name puri derives from the Sanskrit word ‡§™‡•Ç‡§∞‡§ø‡§ï‡§æ (p≈´rikƒÅ), from ‡§™‡•Å‡§∞ (pura) \\"filled\\". It has a similar name in many Asian languages including: Gujarati: ‡™™‡´Ç‡™∞‡´Ä, (puri), (Purƒ´), (p≈´·∏çƒ´), (p≈´rƒ´), (p≈´ri), , (p≈´rƒ´), (puri), (puri), (p≈´·∏çƒ´), (p≈´ri), (p≈´ri), (puri) == Ingredients == Puris are prepared with wheat flour, either atta (whole wheat flour) or sooji (coarse wheat flour) . In some recipes, ajwain, cumin seed, spinach, or fenugreek seeds are added to the dough. The dough is either rolled out in a small circle or rolled out and cut out in small circles, then deep fried in ghee or vegetable oil. While deep frying, puris puff up like a round ball because moisture in the dough changes into steam which expands in all directions. When they are golden-brown in color, they are removed and either served hot or saved for later use (as with the snack food pani puri). Rolled puris may be pricked with a fork before deep frying to make flat puris for chaat like bhel puri. A punctured puri does not puff when cooked because the steam escapes as it cooks. == Accompaniments == Indian puri with accompaniments Puri can be eaten with many savory accompaniments, including korma, chana masala, dal, potato-based curries (for example, saagu, bhaji, bhujia, Aloo ki tarkari, shaak, and sambharo), shrikhand and basundi. In some parts of India, puri is also served with a mixed vegetable dish that is prepared during Puja. Puri is also eaten with sweet accompaniments, such as kheer (a dessert prepared with rice, milk and sugar) or halwa (in Hindi-speaking regions of India, the expression \\"Halwa puri khana\\", \\"to eat puri with halwa\\", signifies a celebration ‚Äì of possibly modest means). Puri is often the bread of choice for festivals and special occasions. In the South of India, puri is almost always made for tiffin, and on the east coast (Andhra, Tamil Nadu) it's rarely eaten with non-vegetarian dishes. Often, they will be served with pickles, chutneys, dal masalas, potato masala, or gourd curry (either ivy, ridge, or bottle varieties). == Types, variants == A variant of puri is bhatoora, which is three times the size of a puri and served with chholey (spicy chick peas). It often constitutes a full meal. (See chole bhature). Bhatoora bread is with yeast and puri bread made from unleavened dough. In the Indian state of Odisha a large size puri is made during Bali Yatra which is called thunka puri ().Fanfare & spectacle mark the opening of Bali Yatra , 10 November 2011Orissa CM Naveen Patnaik inaugurates historic Baliyatra festival in Cuttack, 22 November 2010Bali Yatra Fever grips Cuttack, 12 November 2011 Binita Jaiswal, Fanfare & spectacle mark the opening of Bali Yatra, 10 November 2011 Another variant, largely popular in the Northern Indian state of Uttar Pradesh is bedvi. It is a saltier and stiffer version of the regular puri, and is often stuffed with lentils. Another variant of the puri popular in the eastern states of West Bengal and Odisha is the luchi. In Assam, it is pronounced as lusi. Luchis in Bengal are served with typical side dishes like aloor dum (potato preparation), begun bhaja (fried brinjal) and others The puris used for panipuri are smaller, and are usually made crisper by the addition of rava/sooji (semolina) to the dough. Sev puri is an Indian snack offered by street vendors who serve chaat. Street vendors in Mumbai serve bhel in a throw-away folded leaf with a flat puri to scoop it.

He then worked for WBLS-FM as program director, taking that station to the top of the ratings during the late 1970s and pioneering the radio format now known as urban contemporary. He sometimes called himself the \\"Chief Rocker\\", and he was as well known for his boastful on-air patter as for his off-air flamboyance.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOmut8lehqE ==\\"Moody's Mood for Love\\"== When Studio 54 was at the height of its popularity, Crocker rode in through the front entrance on a white stallion.The New York Times In the studio, before he left for the day, Crocker would light a candle and invite female listeners to enjoy a candlelight bath with him. He signed off the air each night to the tune \\"Moody's Mood For Love\\" by vocalese crooner King Pleasure. Crocker, a native of Buffalo, coined the phrase \\"urban contemporary\\" in the 1970s, a label for the eclectic mix of songs that he played. He'd been the program director at WWRL-AM and felt held back by what he considered to be the narrow perspective of the station. He quit and was twice re-hired by the station management; \\"He knew how to attract attention,\\" the chairman of Inner City Broadcasting, Hal Jackson was the owner of WBLS and once said, \\"We called him Hollywood.\\" By 1979 he was shuttling between the west and east coast, with programming duties at KUTE in L.A. which featured R&B; before a format change instituted there and on the east coast at WBLS which he called \\"Disco and More\\", relying on his expertise at \\"finding the music\\".

He gave America exposure to an obscure genre called \\"Reggae\\" and a little known Jamaican rocker named Bob Marley. Fatback Band frontman Bill Curtis credited Crocker with breaking the group in New York. ==TV and film career== Crocker was the master of ceremonies of shows at the Apollo Theater in Harlem and was one of the first VJs on VH-1, the cable music video channel, in addition to hosting the TV series Solid Gold and NBC's Friday Night Videos.

Frankie Crocker was inducted into the Buffalo Broadcasting Hall of Fame in 2000 and the New York State Broadcasters Association Hall of Fame in 2005. ==Controversies== ;Career Crocker was indicted in a 1976 payola investigation which was later overturned. After being charged, the radio station dropped him, and Crocker moved to L.A. and returned to school. After the payola charges were overturned, he returned to New York radio in 1979 as DJ and Program Director on WBLS-FM, at the end of the disco era. Crocker's career in radio ended by 1985. He moved to MTV as a VJ on the VH-1 cable channel. ;Relationships He was charged in 1983 with hitting Penthouse Pet Carmela Pope; the charges were later dropped. He also was mentioned as a paramour of, and suspect in the February 12, 1977 murder of, the young Hollywood starlet Christa Helm. ==Death== In October 2000, Crocker went into a Miami area hospital for several weeks. He was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer, and kept the illness a secret from his friends and even from his mother. He died on October 21, 2000. His friend and former boss Bob Law, a onetime program director of WWRL, said of Crocker, \\"He encompassed all of the urban sophistication. He appreciated the culture, the whole urban experience, and he wove it together. That's missing now, even in black radio\\". ==Discography as a leader of The Heart & Soul Orchestra== *Presents The Disco Suite Symphony No. 1 In Rhythm And Excellence (1976) *Frankie Crocker & The Heart And Soul Orchestra (1977) ==See also== * * *Imhotep Gary Byrd *Contemporary R&B; *Vaughn Harper *Hal Jackson *Melvin Lindsey *Tommy Smalls *WEPN-FM ‚Äì Market rival ==References * Category:American radio DJs Category:Radio personalities from Buffalo, New York Category:Deaths from pancreatic cancer Category:Deaths from cancer in Florida Category:1937 births Category:2000 deaths Category:African-American journalists Category:African- American radio personalities Category:Radio personalities from New York City Category:Radio and television announcers Category:Journalists from New York (state) Category:VH1 people ","title":"Frankie Crocker"},{"id":"2223388","text":"Baron Giacomo de Martino was the Envoy of Italy to the United States during the regime of Benito Mussolini.

Veneration of the Holy Family was formally begun in the 17th century by Saint Fran√ßois de Laval, the first bishop of New France, who founded a Confraternity.

The primary purpose of this feast is to present the Holy Family as a model for Christian families. From the 17th century, the feast has been celebrated at a local and regional level and at that level was promoted by Pope Leo XIII. In 1921, Pope Benedict XV made it part of the General Roman Calendar and set on the Sunday within the Octave of the Epiphany; that is to say, on the Sunday between January 7 through January 13, all inclusive (see General Roman Calendar of 1954).Encyclop√¶dia Britannica: Feast of the Holy FamilySs. Cosmas and Damian Roman Catholic Parish: Feast of the Holy Family of Jesus, Mary and Joseph The 1962 Roman Missal, whose use is still authorized in the circumstances indicated in the 2007 motu proprio Summorum Pontificum, follows the General Roman Calendar of 1960, which has the celebration on that date. The 1969 revision of the General Roman Calendar moved the celebration to Christmastide, assigning it to the Sunday within the Octave of Christmas, that is, the Sunday between Christmas Day and New Year's Day (both exclusive), or if both Christmas Day and the Solemnity of Mary, Mother of God are Sundays, on 30 December (always a Friday in such years). When not celebrated on a Sunday, it is not a holy day of obligation.It is not among the ten feasts listed in canon 1247 of the 1917 Code of Canon Law and canon 1246 of the 1983 Code as holy days of obligation. Formerly, the Sunday within the Octave of Christmas was in fact celebrated only if it fell on 29, 30 or 31 December, since it gave way to the higher ranked feasts of Saint Stephen, Saint John the Apostle and the Holy Innocents. The Feast of the Holy Family that has replaced it outranks these three feasts. == Cultural references  In art === The Holy Family is a popular theme in Christian art. An oil painting by the Dutch Joos van Cleve, dated to about 1512, is on display at the New York Metropolitan Museum of Art.

He was an important figure of the Italian Wars: in the Battle of Ravenna in 1512 he was taken prisoner by the French, but was released at the conclusion of the War of the League of Cambrai. He was the chief commander of the Habsburg armies of Charles V in Italy during the Habsburg-Valois Wars and defeated the French at Bicocca and Pavia. ==Biography== Fernando was born at Naples, but his family was of Aragonese origin, having arrived in southern Italy with Alfonso V's general I√±igo d'Avalos, his grandfather. Fernando's father was Alfonso d'√Åvalos d'Aquino, 4th marquis of Pescara (not to be confused with Alfonso d'√Åvalos, 6th marquess of Pescara and a cousin of Fernando). At the age of six the boy was betrothed to Vittoria Colonna, daughter of the general Fabrizio Colonna, and the marriage was celebrated in 1509 on the island of Ischia. His position as a noble of the Aragonese party in Naples made it incumbent on him to support Ferdinand the Catholic in his Italian wars. In 1512, he commanded a body of light cavalry at the battle of Ravenna, where he was wounded and taken prisoner by the French. Thanks to the intervention of one of the foremost of the French generals, the Italian G. G. Trivulzio, who was his connection by marriage, he was allowed to ransom himself for 6,000 ducats. He commanded the Spanish infantry at the Battle of La Motta, or Vicenza, on October 7, 1513. It was on this occasion that he called his men before the charge to take care to step on him before the enemy did if he fell. From the battle of Vicenza in 1513, down to the Battle of Bicocca on April 29, 1522, he continued to serve in command of the Spaniards and as the colleague rather than the subordinate of Prospero Colonna. After the battle of Bicocca Charles V appointed Colonna commander-in-chief. D'√Åvalos, who considered himself aggrieved, made a journey to Valladolid in Spain, where the emperor then was, to state his own claims. Charles V, with whom he had long and confidential interviews, persuaded him to submit for the time to the superiority of Colonna. But in these meetings he gained the confidence of Charles V. His Spanish descent and sympathies marked him out as a safer commander of the imperial troops in Italy than a \\"full\\" Italian could have been. When Francis I invaded Italy in 1524 d'√Åvalos was appointed as lieutenant of the emperor to repel the invasion. The difficulties of his position were very great, for there was much discontent in the army, which was very ill-paid. The tenacity, patience and tact of d'√Åvalos triumphed over all obstacles. His influence over the veteran Spanish troops and the German mercenaries kept them loyal during the long siege of Pavia. On February 24, 1525 he defeated and took prisoner Francis I by a brilliant attack. D'√Åvalos' plan was remarkable for its audacity and for the skill he showed in destroying the superior French heavy cavalry by assailing them in flank with a mixed force of harquebusiers and light horse. It was believed that he was dissatisfied with the treatment he had received from the emperor, and Girolamo Morone, secretary to Francesco II Sforza, duke of Milan, approached him with a scheme for expelling French, Spaniards and Germans alike from Italy, and for gaining a throne for himself. D'√Åvalos may have listened to the tempter, but in act he was loyal. He reported the offer to Charles V and put Morone into prison. His health, however, had begun to give way under the strain of wounds and exposure, during late November, and he died at Milan on December 3, 1525. ==Family== D'√Åvalos had no children; his title descended to his cousin Alfonso d'√Åvalos, Marquis del Vasto, also a distinguished imperial general (who in fact led the Imperial musketeers at Pavia). ==In literature== The Italian historiographer Paolo Giovio published a contemporary biography in Latin of Fernando Francesco which was included in his Vitae (illustrium virorum). It was subsequently translated by Lodovico Domenichi and published in Florence in 1551. Giovio's biography was also translated into Spanish by Pedro de Vall√©s in 1553 as Historia del fortissimo y prudentissimo capitan Don Hernando de √Åvalos. The novel Die Versuchung des Pescara by Conrad Ferdinand Meyer is about him.

It originally aired in the United States on April 14, 1999. In the episode, Kenny and many other townsfolk start dying from spontaneous combustion. Mayor McDaniels puts Randy Marsh in charge of finding out why people are dying from it. ==Plot== Kyle discovers that his dad and his mom are having marital difficulties caused by his dad's erectile dysfunction, and he and the others (Kenny, Stan, and Cartman) try to give him \\"a ne-rection\\" (which the boys confuse with \\"a resurrection\\"), unaware of what it actually is. Meanwhile, various members of the town, beginning with Kenny, start to spontaneously combust, which causes the townspeople to attend church more, and compels Mayor McDaniels to order Randy Marsh to discern the cause for the explosions. The boys get drawn into presenting the Stations of the Cross in church, with Cartman tied to the cross in the role of Jesus, after repeated pleading that he could not play any other role. Afterwards, the boys take the cross and put it up outside the church, with Cartman still attached, so that he will die and get a \\"res-erection\\" to give to Kyle's dad. Meanwhile, Randy manages to find out that the combustions are caused by people refusing to fart in front of their partners (Kenny was spending some time with Kelly, his girlfriend from the previous episode) and so he encourages everyone in town to fart every few seconds. For this, he wins the Nobel Prize and a statue is made for him, much to the ire of South Park's only other scientist, Dr. Mephesto, who wanted to win the prize for creating a Galapagos turtle with seven asses; he then plots revenge. Meanwhile, Cartman (still on the cross), is getting upset and tired that Stan and Kyle will not take him down, even going as far as claiming his mom is worried and \\"calling\\" for him. He is later taken down by Chef until he tells him it was all \\"just a dream\\" and he is still on the cross, angering him even more. Another crisis then comes up, when a heat wave hits the town, and again Randy is hired to figure out the cause. However, Mephesto beats him to it. He discovers that it is the methane gas from all the farting that led to the global warming. Randy, blamed for the crisis, is stripped of his Nobel Prize, and stoned and forced to walk through the town with his own statue on his back, being denied by his friends (as Jesus was in the Stations of the Cross). Meanwhile, Kyle's dad manages to get an erection, after seeing some attractive, young female clients undress in his office (to show him the skin cancer for which they claim Randy is responsible); after telling Kyle everything is going to be alright, Kyle is so glad for his father that he forgets about Cartman on the cross. Randy does not want to try to find a solution for his problem, since all the people in town would still hate him, even if he managed to solve the combustion/global warming conundrum. However, Stan tells him that he learned something from the Stations of the Cross: Even though Jesus was hated by all the people he knew and denied by his friends, he still did what he had to do and as he was dying, raised his right hand and stated, \\"The needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few\\" (which Kyle later points out is a quote from Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan). After going through extensive researching, Randy finds out that people need to fart only in moderation in order to fight against the global warming. This works well, and he ends up winning the town's accolades again, and gets his Nobel Prize back three weeks later, at which point the boys suddenly remember they had left Cartman out on the cross that long. They run to get him, and find him still alive but emaciated, having survived for three weeks on his accumulated body fat. Angered, Cartman then says (in a high pitched voice) that once he is taken down, he will kick both of them in the nuts. The song in Randy's daydream montage plays during the end credits. ==Production== \\"Spontaneous Combustion\\" was written by South Park creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone, and writer David Goodman. The episode was inspired in part by Stations of the Cross events Parker witnessed as a child. Parker said he thought it was funny to watch young children participate in the events, particularly in seeing the crucifixion of Jesus. Stone, an agnostic Jew and fellow South Park co-creator, had never heard of Stations of the Cross until Parker explained it to him during a meeting, to which Stone said, \\"I just thought it was the funniest thing\\". While making the episode, Parker and Stone were simultaneously making their South Park film, South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut. The duo would work on \\"Spontaneous Combustion\\" in one studio, then travel a mile away to a larger studio to work on the film. Paramount Pictures executives were not happy with the arrangement and preferred for Parker and Stone to stop working on the television series to focus on the film. In writing the episode, Parker and Stone regularly consulted Anne Garefino, the South Park executive producer and a practicing Catholic; Stone said Garefino was a \\"good sport about it\\" and did not get offended by the show's jokes about Catholicism. Parker also said the show's elements about flatulence causing spontaneous combustion stemmed from his own serious belief that holding in farts can indeed cause humans to spontaneously combust. Parker said, \\"I honestly think it could be what spontaneous combustion is because I've seen some dudes light their farts, and the fireballs were big. And that was just one fart. I'm serious, I think it's totally possible.\\" ==Theme== The episode satirizes religion in more ways than its reenactment of the Stations of the Cross. A church prayer, in which the priest prays for the success of the Denver Broncos, an NFL football team, has also been described as a satire on the way sports can take on a religious status due to the seriousness with which fans regard it. The priest also suggests Kenny might not have been killed if the South Park residents had attended church more regularly, which satirizes the use of guilt to encourage participation in religion; this is further demonstrated by Mr. Garrison's comment, \\"Oh, here comes the guilt trip again!\\" Religious writer Michel Clasquin said the episode also demonstrates the way in which people \\"go through the right motions\\" in practicing religion by attending church, but disregard religion in their everyday lives; he cites the example that when Stan asks his father where their copy of the Bible is, he says it's in the attic \\"with the old LPs\\". Clasquin said \\"Spontaneous Combustion\\" also demonstrates the ease with which people blend their religious convictions with lessons from pop culture, particularly with Stan's confusion of a biblical verse and a Star Trek quote. Nevertheless, Clasquin said Stan does ultimately learn lessons of sacrifice and selflessness from the story of Jesus' crucifixion, so the episode ultimately upholds some of the more positive aspects of religion and Christianity. The episode also satirizes adult pretentiousness, a common theme in South Park episodes, by portraying the children as wiser and more reasonable in seeking a solution to the spontaneous combustion problem. Although the adults follow trends and solutions that contradict common sense, namely avoiding spontaneous combustion by passing gas at all times, only the children are able to find a reasonable solution in the middle of two extremes: only passing gas when absolutely necessary or when it is \\"really, really funny\\". ==Cultural references== Cartman and the other South Park children reenact the Stations of the Cross, the depiction of the Passion (final hours) of Jesus, which end with his crucifixion. The line Stan quotes, which he mistakes for a Bible verse, is a line spoken by Spock in Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan: \\"The needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few.\\" During a church service, the priest refers to two players who left the Denver Broncos: Neil Smith, who left the team in 1999 after becoming a free agent, and Steve Atwater, who joined the New York Jets in 1999. When Officer Barbrady passes by Cartman and says \\"T, T is for turtle\\", he is impersonating the typewriter from Sesame Street. Randy's daydream, which depicts a mummy chasing Stan, Kyle and himself through a series of doors, is a reference to Scooby- Doo. Kyle's dad hears a Bob Dole commercial for an erectile dysfunction medicine when listening to the radio in his office. ==Reception== The episode was condemned by Graham Capill, the New Zealand conservative politician heading the Christian Heritage Party of New Zealand, now defunct. Capill, who was campaigning against the film South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut, which was released around the same time \\"Spontaneous Combustion\\" was broadcast, took exception to the episode's portrayal of the Stations of the Cross reenactment. Many reviewers recommended the episode while simultaneously commenting on its offensive material. Peter Lalor of The Daily Telegraph described it as \\"another highly-recommended episode, although if you have sensitive Christian values perhaps you would be better off missing this episode\\". Paul Thompson, of the Waikato Times, praised the episode and said it \\"had all the show's ingredients: obnoxious kids, hypocritical adults and barbed humour.\\" Robert Bianco of USA Today recommended the episode, but said it was \\"almost certain to offend large segments of the population\\", particularly for its take on the Stations of the Cross. Although the Daily Breeze recommended the episode, they said it proved, \\"silliness and outrageousness continue to be this cartoon's calling card\\". Doug Pratt, a DVD reviewer and Rolling Stone contributor, gave \\"Spontaneous Combustion\\" a negative review; he called it \\"pretty dopey\\" and said \\"Sure, it's funny if you like passing gas jokes, but its aspirations are limited.\\" The Chicago Tribune included \\"Spontaneous Combustion\\" in a list of seven South Park episodes illustrating the show's tendency to tackle controversial subjects, particularly with regard to religion. ==References * Spontaneous Combustion Full episode at South Park Studios * Spontaneous Combustion Episode Guide at South Park studios * * Category:1999 American television episodes Category:Television episodes about Christianity Category:Flatulence in popular culture Category:South Park (season 3) episodes Category:Stations of the Cross ","title":"Spontaneous Combustion (South Park)"},{"id":"2223425","text":"Cleopatra Jones is a 1973 American blaxploitation action comedy film directed by Jack Starrett and starring Tamara Dobson, Bernie Casey, Shelley Winters and Antonio Fargas. ==Plot== Cleopatra \\"Cleo\\" Jones (Dobson) is an undercover special agent for the United States Government. Overseas modeling is only a cover for her real job. Cleo is a Bond-like heroine with power and influence, her silver and black '73 Corvette Stingray (equipped with automatic weapons), and her martial arts ability. While she evokes the glory of a funk goddess, she remains loyal to her drug-ravaged community and her lover, Reuben Masters (Bernie Casey), who runs B&S; House (a community home for recovering drug addicts). The film opens with Cleo overseeing the destruction of a poppy field in Turkey belonging to the evil drug lord, Mommy (Shelley Winters). Mommy employs an all-male crew and a bevy of beautiful young women catering to her many wants. When she hears about her poppies' demise, she plots revenge, ordering a corrupt policeman to raid the B&S; House. When Cleo returns to LA to arrest the police responsible for the raid, she continues to take apart Mommy's underworld drug business, thwarting her minions along the way. Cleo and Mommy face off in a showdown, in which she is trapped by Mommy in a car crusher but is saved by her friends from the B&S; House. In the final showdown, Cleo chases Mommy to the top of a magnetic crane where the two women fight. Mommy proves to be no match for Cleo, who hurls Mommy over the side of the crane to her death, while Cleo's friends defeat her henchmen. At the end of the film, as Reuben and the members of the community celebrate victory, Cleo departs the scene. She sets off to complete her mission of stemming the tide of drugs that flow into her community. ==Cast== *Tamara Dobson as Cleopatra Jones *Shelley Winters as Mommy *Bernie Casey as Reuben Masters *Antonio Fargas as Doodlebug Simpkins *Brenda Sykes as Tiffany *Don Cornelius as himself *Frankie Crocker as himself *Bill McKinney as Officer Purdy *Esther Rolle as Mrs Johnson *Michael Warren as Miller Anderson *Dan Frazer as Capt.

It opened at a time when the Black Power Movement, Black Arts Movement, second-wave feminism, and an increasingly growing black feminism were all prevalent. From this social context emerged the desire for a black heroine who appealed to women through a combination of alluring femininity, female strength, and combat skill. The film depicts the harsh reality of the black ghetto, but also portrays a united community whose members help and support one another. The film's final scene, where Jones, Reuben, and the other B&S; members join together to defeat Mommy, reflects the Black Arts Movement's emphasis upon the need for the black community to work together to defeat white supremacy. Although Cleopatra Jones contains themes relating specifically to the Black Power and feminist movements, it appeals to the general public and is said to be the ‚Äúfirst blaxploitation film to use martial arts as part of its promotion.‚Äù It appeals to audiences who enjoy action movies (such as the James Bond series) and has invited comparisons between Jones and Bond. One critic noted ‚ÄúOn the surface, Cleopatra Jones is about a black distaff James Bond who drives a fancy car equipped with a submachine gun in the door, wears smart clothes, is a karate expert, and travels all over the world as a United States secret agent, destroying the poppy wherever it is found.‚Äù Another critic, Chris Norton, even suggested, ‚ÄúLike Bond, Cleo is not a stealthy character who tries to infiltrate the underworld by losing her identity‚Ä¶ Bond seldom tried to hide his identity, often using his real name during introductions, and all Bond films rely on his being recognized as 007.‚Äù Likewise, Jones is rarely undercover, and is flashy and flamboyant on the job. Norton continues by saying ‚ÄúCleo‚Äôs outrageous outfits are also analogous with Bond‚Äôs dinner jackets and playboy wardrobe. Her three-foot hat brims and flowing fur robes are treated with respect and awe within the film, just as Bond‚Äôs refinements are looked upon as the height of good taste‚Ä¶ [However,] Cleo is not simply a black James Bond. While the Cleopatra Jones films have co-opted Bond, they avoid a total fusion of her character of Bond.‚Äù However, the film is also extremely‚Äîand deliberately‚Äîfunny, with over-the-top villains and crackling one-liners. These were presumably the work of co-writer Sheldon Keller, a veteran TV comedy specialist whose numerous credits include The Dick Van Dyke Show and Caesar's Hour. Max Julien originally wrote the part of Jones for his then-girlfriend Vonetta McGee, but the part was eventually given to Dobson, a fashion model whose height inspired the film's tag line: ‚Äú6 feet 2 inches of dynamite.‚Äù Although blaxploitation films generally used sex to attract an audience, Cleopatra Jones was comparatively modest, containing no nudity or explicit sex. Just as her character Cleopatra Jones came from a poor, high- crime neighborhood, Dobson came from humble, working-class roots. She grew up in Baltimore's inner city; her mother owned a beauty salon and her father worked at a railroad station. After earning a degree from the Baltimore Institute of Art, Dobson moved to New York City to become a model. Her race proved an obstacle until she caught the attention of movie producers searching for a black heroine. ==Feminism and sexuality== Cleopatra Jones has been analyzed by academics, particularly its attitudes towards race, sex and feminism. It is argued the film illustrates the film industry's progress toward gender equality. While Jones is both feminine and fashionable, at the same time she is talented in combat and driving, even more so than the men in the film. She is seen as a strong, assertive and combative woman who is able to both appeal to men and defeat them physically. On one hand, Jones competitively combats with Mommy's male henchmen but on the other, she maintains a loving relationship with Reuben. Cleopatra and Reuben's relationship can be considered a more progressive look at black male and black female relations at the time. Reuben is a strong black man who also cares for recovering kids at the B&S; House. However he is also willing to fight as he comes to Jones's aid and they fight alongside one another. Their relationship emphasizes the equality and mutual respect in a relationship that has both strong female and male counterparts. Although Jones‚Äô character and relationships are in keeping with feminist principles, the portrayal of Mommy is perceived as less groundbreaking. She is presented as a hypersexual lesbian; her character displays many negative traits, such as her constant lust and obsession with sex. Mommy exerts tyrannical control over her henchmen and physically and verbally abuses her young female attendants. Thus, it is proposed the film's homophobic treatment of Mommy hints at the film's anti- feminism in the white feminist sense. During this period, feminism was ‚Äúoften seen as a white woman‚Äôs movement; some have seen it as anti-black.‚Äù Even Dobson stated that a message she would have liked the film to portray would have been a more centered approach towards racial equality rather than gender. She stated in an interview, ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre trying to free our men. I believe in equal pay‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt want to talk about it, because I don‚Äôt think of Cleopatra Jones as being a women‚Äôs libber. I see her as a very positive, strong lady who knows what she has to do.‚Äù Therefore, this film indicates a clear distinction between what is seen as white feminism and black feminism. While white feminism is shunned by the community and is mocked through the character Mommy, black feminism is seen as more approachable and harmless, seen in the loving yet equal relationship between Jones and Reuben, as well as Jones‚Äô heroine status. Contrasted together, Mommy's whiteness, lesbianism, and phallic power highlight Cleopatra Jones‚Äô heterosexual appeal, blackness, and phallic power. Jones‚Äô sophistication emphasizes Mommy's low-class corruption while Jones‚Äô feminine masculinity highlights Mommy's ‚Äúbutch‚Äù lesbianism. Cleopatra Jones differs from other blaxploitation films which depict what scholars have described as a ‚Äúphallic heroine.\\" Dobson herself refused to do nude scenes, striving to separate herself from the hypersexuality of many other black heroines of the time. Her opinion that ‚Äúsex is more interesting when you don‚Äôt show everything at once‚Äù is clearly indicated by her modesty throughout the film. During a love scene between Jones and Reuben, the two share a long, intimate kiss rather than passionately making love. The scene illustrates love and intimacy rather than the lust often depicted in other popular blaxploitation films. Jones flaunts her sexuality through her appearance, managing to remain an autonomous and strong female protagonist. ==Race== Dobson's role was an example of the potential of a new black female presence in popular action cinema. In the earlier 1970s, the Hollywood- supported black urban ghetto action films followed one of a few plot lines: the black pimp or drug hustler on a mission for material wealth and autonomy from ‚Äúthe Man,‚Äù the lone hero from the ghetto with white institutional power, or the legitimate hero whose mission is to stop drug activity within the black community. The last narrative, albeit more rare than the others, can be seen in Cleopatra Jones. While Jones works for ‚Äúthe Man‚Äù, a white, all-powerful leader (the American government), the film also indicates a move toward racial equality. Jones works for an unnamed agency and wears a badge that reads ‚ÄúSpecial Agent to the President.‚Äù Ironically, though she works for the white government, Jones is clearly better at policing black neighborhoods than are white cops. Cleopatra Jones replaces the traditional white male action hero with a powerful and assertive black heroine. Also, her mission is directly related to improving the black community. Some symbolism of the racist movement is contained with the bigoted police officer Purdy (Bill McKinney). His disdain for blacks is shown at the raid on the B&S; house where he attempts to shoot a recovering addict in the back. Another instance displaying the stereotypical white police officer racism is seen when Jones asks him who was responsible for raid on B&S; house and Purdy replies, ‚ÄúI never planted no dope on nobody! And if I did, I wouldn‚Äôt lift a finger to help you or any of your kind.‚Äù Another theme within the film is the Black Power generated ‚ÄúBlack is Beautiful‚Äù consciousness seen in Jones's appearance. Although she is seen as a center of attraction and sexuality, she still wears an Afro which signified black affirmation. Jones's obscured hair underscores racial difference and departure from the traditional long hair as a sign of white, feminine sexual beauty. Also, her colorful and flashy outfits were a departure from the more modest, classy appeal of the James Bond hero. These emphasized a departure from the traditional white male hero. Dobson herself believed that her role enabled black beauty to be more visible in mainstream media. She stated, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs true there are very few black models. You won‚Äôt see them smiling out at you from the covers of major magazines. Editors blame this on the market‚Ä¶ but I say forget the market- we‚Äôre talking about a pretty girl. I‚Äôve seen oooogly white girls on magazine covers. But black girls must be safe. They must have straight hair, or hair that can be pressed, and they must have Caucasian features.‚Äù Dobson's role created an entertaining, ‚Äúsafe‚Äù ground for black women to retain their ethnic appearances while still being portrayed as strikingly beautiful and powerful. Critic Francesca T. Royster states, ‚ÄúTamara Dobson is a lost African queen, dripping in furs and silk robes. She is a hybrid of an exotic queen from the past, a homegirl who knows her way around her old neighborhood of Watts and a special agent for the CIA. In the film, we see a double act of appropriation made possible by the ambiguity of the Cleopatra icon.‚Äù Shots of Dobson emphasize her exotic beauty especially when imaged through the male gaze. As Cleopatra strolls down the street, men of every race and age are dazzled by her black beauty. Jones indicates at every turn that the unique, exotic beauty of the African culture is even more striking than traditionally white signifiers of beauty. Even her wardrobe signifies departure from standard, classy apparel yet remains aesthetically pleasing. She appears in rich reds and yellows, tailored pantsuits, clinging silk shirts, voluptuous fur jackets, turbans, silk headdresses, and hooded capes. These outfits create the glamorous identity that is beautiful, black, female, and endowed with unusual social empowerment. Critic Annette Kuhn explains that ‚Äúa glamorous/glamourised image then is one manipulated, falsified perhaps, in order to heighten or even to idealize. A glamorous image of a woman (or an image of a glamorous woman) is peculiarly powerful in that it plays on the desire of the spectator in a particularly pristine way: beauty or sexuality is desirable exactly to the extent that it is idealized and unattainable.‚Äù On the other hand, critics may view the emphasis on Jones's exoticism to be racially stereotypical rather than glorifying black beauty. Parts of Dobson's physicality reverbate with notions of black animalistic imagery. Jones appears in elaborate fur coverings and dramatic makeup, especially around the eyes. Lisa Anderson describes such imagery: ‚ÄúThe animal metaphors resurface; the jezebel is represented as a tiger, a puma, a panther, or other large, sleek cat who slinks up and pounces on her prey. She is a frightening apparition in the white imagination.‚Äù ==Soundtrack== Cleopatra Jones is accompanied by a rhythm-and-blues soundtrack featuring Joe Simon singing ‚ÄúTheme from Cleopatra Jones‚Äù and Millie Jackson singing ‚ÄúLove Doctor‚Äù and ‚ÄúIt Hurts So Good.‚Äù Instrumentals on the soundtrack include ‚ÄúGoin‚Äô to the Chase,‚Äù \\"Wrecking Yard\\" and ‚ÄúGo Chase Cleo.‚Äù \\"Oriental-style\\" music combined with jazz, bass and strings creates an exotic tone. At the same time, the bluesy rhythm alludes to black jazz culture, appropriate for an action-hero movie taking place in the African-American community. The song ‚ÄúTheme from Cleopatra Jones‚Äù emphasizes the fantasy of erotic pleasure for men: ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre so sweet and strong‚Ä¶/Touch me like the desert wind.‚Äù In the theme song, the lyrics depict the threat and thrill of her exotic beauty: ‚ÄúYou take my pride and you throw it up against the wall/You take me in your arms, baby, and bounce me like a rubber ball‚Ä¶/ Dontcha know that it hurts so good.‚Äù The soundtrack was a popular success, selling well over 500,000 copies. ==Reception== The film opened to a favorable critical reception. Says Los Angeles film critic Kevin Thomas, Cleopatra Jones is ‚Äúan exceptionally well- made black action picture‚Ä¶From start to finish this fast-moving Warner‚Äôs release is shrewdly calculated and affirms the gifts of its director Jack in bringing style and meaning to the exploitation picture. In her first starring role Miss Dobson more than makes up for her lack of acting experience by her dazzling looks, sultry personality, and unwavering poise.‚Äù Tapping into the Black Pride movement, the irony of using the name Cleopatra to convey a character who was strong physically, but equally feminine and independent, appealed to the urban public. As the queen of Egypt, Cleopatra's role as a leader allowed African American women to identify with Dobson's character and finally call a heroine their own. On the other hand, critics of the blaxploitation industry complained that they were ‚Äúdismayed by Tamara‚Äôs image as a karate-chopping, pistol popping terror.‚Äù In response Dobson replied ‚ÄúYou go through phases until you find the right situation where a character works for you. A lot of tits and ass movies were made, ballbuster films, exploitation pictures. But I don‚Äôt care what anybody calls it. Doing Cleopatra Jones gave me a chance to work. I loved Cleo. She was not only gracious, but strong, clever, intelligent and sexy.‚ÄùQuoted in Yvonne D. Sims, Women of Blaxploitation: How the Black Action Film Heroine Changed American Popular Culture, McFarland, 1976. p. 100 The film was a box office success, grossing more than $100,000 in its first week of release, climbing to $400,000 by the fifth week. ==Sequel== A sequel, Cleopatra Jones and the Casino of Gold appeared in 1975, with Dobson reprising the title role. Jones travels to Hong Kong to free government agents Matthew and Melvin Johnson who have been captured by the Dragon Lady (Stella Stevens). Jones pairs up with Tanny (Ni Tien) and ends up in the Dragon Lady's casino, headquarters for her underground drug empire. Jones and Tanny use their combat skills to battle the Dragon Lady's henchmen and defeat the Dragon Lady herself. The sequel's lack of popularity was due not only to its poor reviews but also to the decline of blaxploitation films in general. ==See also== * List of American films of 1973 ==References*Top 30 Blaxploitation Films Category:1973 films Category:American LGBT-related films Category:Blaxploitation films Category:Kung fu films Category:American films Category:English-language films Jones, Cleopatra Category:Films directed by Jack Starrett Category:Warner Bros. films Category:1973 LGBT-related films Jones, Cleopatra Category:African-American films ","title":"Cleopatra Jones"},{"id":"2223432","text":"The Adoration of the Magi by Edward Burne-Jones (1904) The Epiphany season, also known as Epiphanytide, is in some churches recognized as a liturgical period following the Christmas season (Christmastide). It begins on the day of Epiphany, and ends at various points as defined by those churches. == Anglicanism == In Advent 2000, the Church of England introduced into its liturgy an optional Epiphany season by approving the Common Worship series of services as an alternative to those in the Book of Common Prayer, defining Epiphanytide as lasting from the feast of the Epiphany to Candlemas. An official publication of the Church of England states: \\"The Christmas season is often celebrated for twelve days, ending with the Epiphany. Contemporary use has sought to express an alternative tradition, in which Christmas lasts for a full forty days, ending with the Feast of the Presentation on February 2.\\"Common Worship Texts: Times and Seasons (Church House Publishing 2006), p. 64 It presents the latter part of this period as the Epiphany season, comprising the Sundays of Epiphany and ending \\"only with the Feast of the Presentation (Candlemas)\\".Common Worship Texts: Times and Seasons (Church House Publishing 2006), p. 120 The Church of England's optional Epiphany season thus begins at Evening Prayer on the Eve of the Epiphany (which may be celebrated on January 6 or the Sunday between January 2 and 8) and ends at Evening Prayer (or Night Prayer) on the Feast of the Presentation (which may be celebrated on 2 February or on the Sunday between January 28 and February 3). The Epiphany season is seen as in some sense a continuation of the Christmas season, and together they last forty days. The three main events focused on during the Epiphany season are the visit of the Magi, the baptism of Jesus, and Jesus' miracle at the marriage at Cana. The visit of the Magi is traditionally interpreted as symbolic of God's revelation of himself to the Gentiles, and so one of the themes of the season is mission. The Week of Prayer for Christian Unity also falls within the season, allowing another seasonal theme to be that of unity. The season culminates at the Feast of the Presentation, after which the liturgy stops looking back to Christmas and begins looking forward to the Passion. The colour for the season is white. == Methodism and Lutheranism == The Epiphanytide tradition of chalking the door involves writing C+M+B (representing the names of the Three Wise Men as well as the Christian prayer Christus mansionem benedicat) on one's door, as seen here on the gate of Villa Reepschl√§gerbahn in Germany. Several Protestant churches celebrate an Epiphany season that lasts until the day before Ash Wednesday, which marks the beginning of the season of Lent.BBC: Epiphany (Last updated 2011-10-07; accessed 2014-12-19) As such, in some adaptations of the Revised Common Lectionary, such as those used by Methodists and Lutherans, the Epiphanytide begins on 6 January, and continues until the day before Ash Wednesday (which begins Lent). The last Sunday of Epiphany is Transfiguration Sunday. Methodists in the United States follow this practice, as do Methodists in Singapore. In one interpretation the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America celebrates on the day of Epiphany, 6 January, the revelation of Christ to all nations as represented by the magi who come to worship Jesus. The church calendar recognizes the season of Epiphany from January 6 until the last Sunday before Ash Wednesday which is celebrated as the Transfiguration of our Lord. The length of the season of Epiphany varies and is determined by working backwards through the season of Lent from the moveable date for the celebration of Easter. Among the principal themes are: the revelation of Christ to all nations, Jesus' baptism in the River Jordan, and Christ as the light of the world. The colours of the season are white (a colour associated with the festivals of Christ and suggesting gladness, joy and light for the day of Epiphany), used the first week after the Epiphany when the Baptism of our Lord is celebrated, and the last week of the season of Epiphany when the Transfiguration of our Lord is celebrated; and green, reminiscent of living plants and suggests spiritual growth. Green is used in the season of Epiphany beginning with the second week after the Epiphany until the week before the Transfiguration of our Lord is celebrated.Evangelical Lutheran Church in America The Evangelical Lutheran Church in America used the terms \\"Time after Epiphany\\" to describe this period.Evangelical Lutheran Church in America: Worship Resources (accessed 2014-12-19) The expression with \\"after\\" has been interpreted as making the period in question correspond to that of Ordinary Time.Calvin Institute of Christian Worship, \\"Ordinary Time Resource Guide\\" (accessed 2014-12-19)Imago Dei Anglican church, \\"Ordinary Time (After Epiphany)\\" (accessed 1014-12-19) == Presbyterianism == The Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.) states that neither Epiphany nor Pentecost are seasons, and that it is a misunderstanding to imagine that expressions such as \\"Fifth Sunday after Epiphany\\" indicate the existence of such a time as \\"Epiphany season\\". These expression merely indicate the passing of time, not the character of the period, for neither the period after Epiphany nor that after Pentecost focus on a dominant event or theme. The correct term, it says, is therefore \\"Ordinary Time\\".Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.), Liturgical Year (Westminster John Knox Press 1992 ), p. 49 == Roman Catholicism == The calendar of the Personal Ordinariate of the Chair of Saint Peter and the Personal Ordinariate of Our Lady of Walsingham within the Roman Catholic Church (which uses Ordinariate Use liturgy) celebrates Epiphanytide or the Time After Epiphany from \\"Monday of Week 1 on the day following the [Feast of the] Baptism of the Lord\\" until the liturgical start of Ash Wednesday; during Epiphanytide, Candlemas is highlighted as a \\"Feast of the Lord\\". Within the Latin Rite of the Roman Catholic Church, until 1955, the feast of the Epiphany had an octave, and was thus celebrated from 6 until 13 January. After Pope Pius XII removed this octave, the liturgy of those days continued to use the same texts as previously, thus giving to the period until the Feast of the Baptism of the Lord, which replaced the Octave Day of the Epiphany, a special character that was still recognized by the 1960 Code of Rubrics. This defined the season of Christmas as extending from First Vespers of Christmas to 13 January inclusive, and divided this season into Christmastide, ending just before First Vespers of the Epiphany, and Epiphany (not Epiphanytide and, as is obvious, no longer the Octave of the Epiphany) from then until 13 January inclusive (one week).The New Rubrics of the Roman Breviary and Missal (1960), pp. 12‚Äì13 The 1969 revision preserved the arrangement by which the Epiphany is part of the Christmas season, during which the liturgical colour is white, and which now lasts only until the feast of the Baptism of the Lord. This latter feast is now usually celebrated on the Sunday after 6 January, and not later than 13 January. The season immediately following the Octave Day of the Epiphany (until 1954), or the Feast of the Baptism of the Lord (since 1955), and in which the liturgical colour is green, was for the first time given a name in the 1960 Code of Rubrics, which in Latin called it the season per annum. The official English translation of the Roman Missal calls it Ordinary Time.See, for instance, General Instruction of the Roman Missal, 346, 355, 365, etc. This season begins on 14 January. Until 1969, it ran from that date to just before First Vespers of Septuagesima Sunday, but since 1970 to just before Ash Wednesday. However, the Encyclopedia of Catholic Devotions and Practices, which has received the imprimatur of John Michael D'Arcy, refers to this period as Epiphanytide, stating that \\"The Epiphany season extends from January 6 to Septuagesima Sunday, and has from one to six Sundays, according to the date of Easter. White is the color for the octave; green is the liturgical color for the season.\\" ==References== Season Category:January observances ","title":"Epiphany season"},{"id":"2223442","text":"The Little Hungarian Plain or Little Alf√∂ld (Hungarian: Kisalf√∂ld, Slovak: Mal√° dunajsk√° kotlina, German: Kleine Ungarische Tiefebene) is a plain (tectonic basin) of approximately 8,000 km¬≤ in northwestern Hungary, south- western Slovakia (Podunajsk√° n√≠≈æina ‚Äì Danubian Lowland), and eastern Austria.

Such buildings are typical in the area Its borders are the Carpathians on the north, the Bakony-V√©rtes Hills in the south, the Gerecse Hills in the east, and the Leitha Mountains and the foothills of the Alps in the west. In Hungary, it includes most of Gy≈ër-Moson-Sopron and Vas counties, and the western part of Kom√°rom-Esztergom and Veszpr√©m. The plain is roughly cut in half by the Danube which is split up into many arms between Bratislava and Kom√°rno, forming large islands. Its main tributaries are the V√°h, the R√°ba, the R√°bca and the Marcal rivers. Smaller microregions of the Little Alf√∂ld are Hans√°g, Seewinkel, Neusiedl Basin, R√°bak√∂z, Szigetk√∂z, Marcali Basin, Moson Plain, Kom√°rom-Esztergom Plain and ≈Ωitn√Ω ostrov. The neighbouring regions of Kemenesh√°t, Sopron-Vas Plain and Steirisches H√ºgelland are sometimes classified as belonging to the Little Alf√∂ld, but Hungarian and Austrian geographers use the term in a more narrow meaning. ==History== The plain has been an important area of agriculture since the Neolithic Age. The southern part of it belonged to the Roman province of Pannonia between the 1st and 5th centuries and later was inhabited by Germanic and Slavic peoples and since about 900 also by Hungarians. Since about 1000, the region became part of the Kingdom of Hungary. After World War I the Little Alf√∂ld was divided between Hungary, Czechoslovakia and Austria. In the 1990s Slovakia built a large dam and power plant at Gabƒç√≠kovo. ==Population== Country borders don't closely follow linguistic boundaries, especially in the case of the northern part of the plain where Hungarians are a majority in the two southernmost districts Dunajsk√° Streda and Kom√°rno and a minority in the remaining districts.

They are related to the class I MHC molecules, and are involved in the presentation of lipid antigens to T cells. However their precise function is unknown. ==Types== CD1 glycoproteins can be classified primarily into two groups which differ in their lipid anchoring. * CD1a, CD1b and CD1c (group 1 CD1 molecules) are expressed on cells specialized for antigen presentation. * CD1d (group 2 CD1) is expressed in a wider variety of cells. CD1e is an intermediate form, expressed intracellularly, the role of which is currently unclear. ==In humansGroup 1=== Group 1 CD1 molecules have been shown to present foreign lipid antigens, and specifically a number of mycobacterial cell wall components, to CD1-specific T cells. ===Group 2=== The natural antigens of group 2 CD1 are not well characterized, but a synthetic glycolipid, alpha- galactosylceramide, originally isolated from a compound found in a marine sponge, has strong biologic activity. Group 2 CD1 molecules activate a group of T cells, known as Natural killer T cells because of their expression of NK surface markers such as CD161. Natural Killer T (NKT) cells are activated by CD1d-presented antigens, and rapidly produce Th1 and Th2 cytokines, typically represented by interferon-gamma and IL-4 production. The group 2 (CD1d) ligand alpha-galactosylceramide is currently in phase I clinical trials for the treatment of advanced non-hematologic cancers. ===Diagnostic relevance=== CD1 antigens are expressed on cortical thymocytes, but not on mature T cells. This often remains true in neoplastic cells from these populations, so that the presence of CD1 antigens can be used in diagnostic immunohistochemistry to identify some thymomas and malignancies arising from T cell precursors. CD1a, in particular, is a specific marker for Langerhans cells, and can therefore also be used in the diagnosis of Langerhans cell histiocytosis. Other conditions that may show CD1 positivity include myeloid leukaemia and some B cell lymphomas. ==In cows and mice== Mice lack the group 1 CD1 molecules, and instead have 2 copies of CD1d. Thus, mice have been used extensively to characterize the role of CD1d and CD1d-dependent NKT cells in a variety of disease models. It has recently been shown that cows lack the group 2 CD1 molecules, and have an expanded set of group 1 CD1 molecules. Because of this and the fact that cows are a natural host of Mycobacterium bovis, a pathogen in humans as well, it is hoped that studying cows will yield insights into the group 1 CD1 antigen-presenting system. ==ReferencesMouse CD Antigen Chart * Human CD Antigen Chart Category:Clusters of differentiation ","title":"CD1"},{"id":"2223457","text":"A carcinoid (also carcinoid tumor) is a slow-growing type of neuroendocrine tumor originating in the cells of the neuroendocrine system. In some cases, metastasis may occur. Carcinoid tumors of the midgut (jejunum, ileum, appendix, and cecum) are associated with carcinoid syndrome. Carcinoid tumors are the most common malignant tumor of the appendix, but they are most commonly associated with the small intestine, and they can also be found in the rectum and stomach. They are known to grow in the liver, but this finding is usually a manifestation of metastatic disease from a primary carcinoid occurring elsewhere in the body. They have a very slow growth rate compared to most malignant tumors. The median age at diagnosis for all patients with neuroendocrine tumors is 63 years. ==Signs and symptoms== Primary site of a carcinoid cancer of gut While most carcinoids are asymptomatic through the natural lifetime and are discovered only upon surgery for unrelated reasons (so-called coincidental carcinoids), all carcinoids are considered to have malignant potential. About 10% of carcinoids secrete excessive levels of a range of hormones, most notably serotonin (5-HT), causing: * Flushing (serotonin itself does not cause flushing). Potential causes of flushing in carcinoid syndrome include bradykinins, prostaglandins, tachykinins, substance P, and/or histamine, diarrhea, and heart problems. Because of serotonin's growth-promoting effect on cardiac myocytes, a serotonin-secreting carcinoid tumour may cause a tricuspid valve disease syndrome, due to the proliferation of myocytes onto the valve. * Diarrhea * Wheezing * Abdominal cramping * Peripheral edema The outflow of serotonin can cause a depletion of tryptophan leading to niacin deficiency. Niacin deficiency, also known as pellagra, is associated with dermatitis, dementia, and diarrhea. This constellation of symptoms is called carcinoid syndrome or (if acute) carcinoid crisis. Occasionally, haemorrhage or the effects of tumor bulk are the presenting symptoms. The most common originating sites of carcinoid is the small bowel, particularly the ileum; carcinoid tumors are the most common malignancy of the appendix. Carcinoid tumors may rarely arise from the ovary or thymus. They are most commonly found in the midgut at the level of the ileum or in the appendix. The next most common affected area is the respiratory tract, with 28% of all cases--per PAN-SEER data (1973-1999). The rectum is also a common site. ===Gastrointestinal=== Carcinoid tumors are apudomas that arise from the enterochromaffin cells throughout the gut. Over two-thirds of carcinoid tumors are found in the gastrointestinal tract. ===Lung=== Histopathology of a typical carcinoid tumor of the lung, with prominent rosettes. Carcinoid tumors are also found in the lungs. ===Other sites and metastases=== Metastasis of carcinoid can lead to carcinoid syndrome. This is due to the over-production of many substances, including serotonin, which are released into the systemic circulation, and which can lead to symptoms of cutaneous flushing, diarrhea, bronchoconstriction, and right-sided cardiac valve disease. It is estimated that less than 6% of carcinoid patients will develop carcinoid syndrome, and of these, 50% will have cardiac involvement. === Goblet cell carcinoid === This is considered to be a hybrid between an exocrine and endocrine tumor derived from crypt cells of the appendix. Histologically, it forms clusters of goblet cells containing mucin with a minor admixture of Paneth cells and endocrine cells. The growth pattern is distinctive: typically producing a concentric band of tumor nests interspersed among the muscle and stroma of the appendiceal wall extending up the shaft of the appendix. This makes the lesion difficult to suspect grossly and difficult to measure. Small tumor nests may be camouflaged amongst the muscle or in periappendiceal fat; cytokeratin preparations best demonstrate the tumor cells; mucin stains are also helpful in identifying them. They behave in a more aggressive manner than do classical appendiceal carcinoids. Spread is usually to regional lymph nodes, peritoneum, and particularly the ovary. They do not produce sufficient hormonal substances to cause the carcinoid or other endocrine syndromes. In fact, they more closely resemble exocrine than endocrine tumors. The term 'crypt cell carcinoma' has been used for them, and though perhaps more accurate than considering them carcinoids, has not been a successful competitor. ==Cause== Carcinoid syndrome involves multiple tumors in one out of five of cases. The incidence of gastric carcinoids is increased in achlorhydria, Hashimoto's thyroiditis, and pernicious anemia. ==Treatment== Surgery, if feasible, is the only curative therapy. If the tumor has metastasized (most commonly, to the liver) and is considered incurable, there are some promising treatment modalities, such as radiolabeled octreotide (e.g. Lutetium (177Lu) DOTA- octreotate) or the radiopharmaceutical 131I-mIBG (meta iodo benzyl guanidine) for arresting the growth of the tumors and prolonging survival in patients with liver metastases, though these are currently experimental. Chemotherapy is of little benefit and is generally not indicated. Octreotide or lanreotide (somatostatin analogues) may decrease the secretory activity of the carcinoid, and may also have an anti-proliferative effect. Interferon treatment is also effective, and usually combined with somatostatin analogues. As the metastatic potential of a coincidental carcinoid is probably low, the current recommendation is for follow up in 3 months with CT or MRI, labs for tumor markers such as serotonin, and a history and physical, with annual physicals thereafter. ==History== They were first characterized in 1907 by Siegfried Oberndorfer, a German pathologist at the University of Munich, who coined the term karzinoide, or \\"carcinoma-like\\", to describe the unique feature of behaving like a benign tumor despite having a malignant appearance microscopically. The recognition of their endocrine-related properties were later described by Gosset and Masson in 1914, and these tumors are now known to arise from the enterochromaffin (EC) and enterochromaffin-like (ECL) cells of the gut. Some sources credit Otto Lubarsch with the discovery. In 2000, the World Health Organization redefined \\"carcinoid\\", but this new definition has not been accepted by all practitioners. This has led to some complexity in distinguishing between carcinoid and other neuroendocrine tumors in the literature. According to the American Cancer Society, the 2000 WHO definition states: > The WHO now divides these growths into neuroendocrine tumors and > neuroendocrine cancers. Neuroendocrine tumors are growths that look benign > but that might possibly be able to spread to other parts of the body. > Neuroendocrine cancers are abnormal growths of neuroendocrine cells which > can spread to other parts of the body. ==See also== * Carcinoid syndrome * Don Meyer, head coach emeritus of the Northern State University men's basketball team. Meyer was found to have carcinoid cancer following an automobile accident in September 2009. * Derrick Bell, Professor and legal scholar, died of carcinoid cancer on October 5, 2011. ==References External links == Category:Gastrointestinal cancer Category:Lung cancer Category:Dermal and subcutaneous growths Category:Pediatric cancers ","title":"Carcinoid"},{"id":"2223459","text":"Run Hit Wonder is a 5K and 10K run series sponsored by Nike.

Reference to Kitezh appears for the first time in Kitezh Chronicle, an anonymous book from the late 18th century, believed to have originated among the Old Believers. ==The legend== The Invisible Town of Kitezh (1913) by Konstantin Gorbatov Legend has it that Georgy II, Grand Prince of Vladimir in the early 13th century, first built the town of Maly Kitezh (Little Kitezh) on the Volga River (today's Krasny Kholm). It is sometimes erroneously identified with Gorodets, which was actually founded some 30 years before Georgy's birth in 1189. Later on, the prince crossed the rivers of Uzola, Sanda, and Kerzhenets, and found a beautiful spot on the shores of Lake Svetloyar, where he decided to build the town of Bolshoy Kitezh (Big Kitezh). According to folk etymology, the name of the town came from the royal residence of Kideksha (near Suzdal), ransacked by the Mongols in 1237, while Max Vasmer labels the place-name as \\"obscure\\". After having conquered some of the Russian lands, Batu Khan heard of Kitezh and ordered his army to advance towards it. The Mongols soon captured Maly Kitezh, forcing Georgy to retreat into the woods towards Bolshoy Kitezh. One of the prisoners told the Mongols about some secret paths to Lake Svetloyar. The army of the Golden Horde followed Georgy and soon reached the walls of the town. To the surprise of the Mongols, the town had no fortifications whatsoever. Its citizens didn't even intend to defend themselves and were engaged in fervent praying, asking God for their salvation. On seeing this, the Mongols rushed to the attack, but then stopped. Suddenly, they saw countless fountains of water bursting from under the ground all around them. The attackers fell back and watched the town submerge into the lake. The last thing they saw was a glaring dome of a cathedral with a cross on top of it. Soon only waves remained. This legend gave birth to numerous incredible rumors, which have survived to this day. It is said that only those who are pure in their heart and soul will find their way to Kitezh (the road to the lake is still called \\"–ë–∞—Ç—ã–µ–≤–∞ —Ç—Ä–æ–ø–∞\\", or the Path of Batu). It is also said that in calm weather one can sometimes hear the sound of chiming bells and people singing from under the waters of Lake Svetloyar. Some people say that the most pious individuals may actually see the lights of religious processions (called \\"–∫—Ä–µ—Å—Ç–Ω—ã–π —Ö–æ–¥\\") and even buildings on the bottom of the lake. For this reason Lake Svetloyar is sometimes called the \\"Russian Atlantis\\". ==Kitezh in arts== * Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov's opera The Legend of the Invisible City of Kitezh and the Maiden Fevroniya (1907) is based on the legend of Kitezh. * The town is also mentioned, among many other references to Russian folklore, in Monday Begins on Saturday, a novel by Boris and Arkady Strugatsky and Charodey film and film script. * The acclaimed German filmmaker Werner Herzog went in search of Kitezh in his short documentary Bells from the Deep (1993). * Kitezh is the childhood nickname of Tilda Swinton's character Emma Recchi in the film I Am Love (2009, Luca Guadagnino).http://www.ecognoscente.com/months/july10/08.html * Kitezh is mentioned in Kraken by China Mi√©ville. \\"Marge read of their utopias, sunk not in ruination but reward: Kitezh, Atlantis, Tyno Helig.\\" * Tunturia's album Invisible City (2012) is an instrumental concept album that follows six stages of the rise and fall of Kitezh. * A theme in Anna Akhmatova's poem \\"The Way of All the Earth\\" or \\"Woman of Kitezh\\" (Kitezhanka or –ö–∏—Ç–µ–∂–∞–Ω–∫–∞). * A fictionalized version of Kitezh is rediscovered by the protagonist in the 2015 video game Rise of the Tomb Raider. ==References== Category:Fictional populated places in Russia Category:Locations in Slavic mythology Category:Russian folklore Category:Fictional sunken cities Category:Nizhny Novgorod Oblast Category:Mythical lost cities and towns ","title":"Kitezh"},{"id":"2223479","text":"Jamul may refer to: * Rancho Jamul, Mexican land grant in present-day San Diego County, California * Jamul Mountains, located in San Diego County, California * Jamul, California, an unincorporated community in San Diego County, California * Jamul, Durg, a nagar panchayat in Durg district in the Indian State of Chhattisgarh ","title":"Jamul"},{"id":"2223482","text":"The \\"Leopard Blow,\\" \\"leopard punch,\\" or \\"leopard fist\\" is a common term for a specific type of striking blow, associated primarily with the Leopard Kung Fu substyle of the Five Animals in Chinese martial arts, though it is also used in styles such as Krav Maga, Choy Li Fut and Karate (in which case, it is known as \\"Hiraken Tsuki\\" or \\"Ryotoken Tsuki\\"). The maneuver involves folding the first two joints of the fingers inward and striking with the fore- knuckles. It is used most often to strike at soft, vulnerable targets, such as the ribs, throat, inner arms and temples. ==Forming the fist== The fist is formed by folding the first two joints of the fingers. There are two variations of the maneuver; the first involves folding only the first four fingers of the hand. The second involves compressing the fist further by folding in the thumb as well to the side of the hand. The advantage of using the first is that it has a slightly longer reach and can be formed faster. The second variation's advantage is that it is more firm, reducing the risk of injury to a user's hand. ==Usage== The nature of this strike allows for greater penetration against weak spots on an opponent's body, but presents a very real risk of self-injury should a user be careless while using it. The strike is, therefore, best used at close range, where it is easier to reach soft targets and where there doesn't need to be too much force behind the blow to deal significant damage. It is also recommended that users strike from angles when attacking with this fist, as this decreases the impact to one's hand whilst still maintaining the impact delivered to an opponent. This strike is also a useful tool in self-defense where long fingernails may impede other strikes. With the leopard fist, fingernails do not usually get in the way when forming the fist. It also amplifies the damage done to an opponent by focusing the force of a punch over a much smaller surface area. Aside from striking with the metacarpals, the palm heel and the side of the hand may also be used against an opponent. The strike is most prominently used in Leopard Kung Fu, but can also be found in certain styles of Karate, such as Kyokushin, Shotokan and Uechi-ry≈´ (though they are rarely used), Kempo and in rare cases, Wing Chun. It is also sometimes used as the primary weapon of Choy Li Fut practitioners. ==Possible uses== This form of strike can be used against any target, but is most commonly demonstrated as a strike to the throat, ribs, solar plexus, side of the stomach, kidneys, groin, bladder, back muscles, inner arms, jugular vein, side of the face, eyes, cheekbones, bridge of the nose, upper lip, jaw and temples. ==In the media== The Leopard Blow is also the name of a special Dim Mak maneuver used by Lady Shiva, a comic book supervillain published by DC Comics. In Detective Comics #443 published by DC Comics, a villain called the Enforcer uses \\"an off-beat variation on the Leopard's Paw knuckle strike\\" against Batman. Later, his \\"overuse [of] that knuckle strike variation\\" allows Batman to guess the Enforcer's true identity. The Marvel Comics superhero known as Iron Fist uses this punch in the Netflix TV series of the same name. == References  *An Example Of Hiraken Tsuki in Karate *A Second Example Of Hiraken Tsuki in Karate (Wayback Machine copy) *First variation *Second variation Category:Chinese martial arts terminology Category:Punches (combat) ","title":"Leopard Blow"},{"id":"2223483","text":"ExamDiff Pro is a commercial software utility for visual file and directory comparison, for Microsoft Windows.

A combined French and Venetian force under Odet of Foix, Viscount of Lautrec, was decisively defeated by an Imperial‚ÄìSpanish and Papal army under the overall command of Prospero Colonna. Lautrec then withdrew from Lombardy, leaving the Duchy of Milan in Imperial hands. Having been driven from Milan by an Imperial advance in late 1521, Lautrec had regrouped, attempting to strike at Colonna's lines of communication. When the Swiss mercenaries in French service did not receive their pay, however, they demanded an immediate battle, and Lautrec was forced to attack Colonna's fortified position in the park of the Arcimboldi Villa Bicocca, north of Milan. The Swiss pikemen advanced over open fields under heavy artillery fire to assault the Imperial positions, but were halted at a sunken road backed by earthworks. Having suffered massive casualties from the fire of Spanish arquebusiers, the Swiss retreated. Meanwhile, an attempt by French cavalry to flank Colonna's position proved equally ineffective. The Swiss, unwilling to fight further, marched off to their cantons a few days later, and Lautrec retreated into Venetian territory with the remnants of his army. The battle is noted chiefly for marking the end of the Swiss dominance among the infantry of the Italian Wars, and of the Swiss method of assaults by massed columns of pikemen without support from other troops. It was also one of the first engagements in which firearms played a decisive role on the battlefield. == Prelude == At the start of the war in 1521, Holy Roman Emperor Charles V and Pope Leo X moved jointly against the Duchy of Milan, the principal French possession in Lombardy. A large Papal force under Federico II Gonzaga, Duke of Mantua, together with Spanish troops from Naples and some smaller Italian contingents, concentrated near Mantua.Oman, Art of War, 174. The German forces which Charles sent south to aid this venture passed through Venetian territory near Valeggio unmolested; the combined Papal, Spanish, and Imperial army then proceeded into French territory under the command of Prospero Colonna.Oman, Art of War, 174‚Äì175. The apparent inability of the Venetians to prevent enemy passage through their territory prompted a number of complaints from the French. For the next several months, Colonna fought an evasive war of maneuver against Odet of Foix, Viscount of Lautrec, the French commander, besieging cities but refusing to give battle.Oman, Art of War, 175. Oman writes that \\"[Colonna] refused battle several times, raised the siege of Parma when it was almost in his hands, rather than risk anything, and wearied out Lautrec by retreats and flank movements\\". By the autumn of 1521, Lautrec, who was holding a line along the Adda river to Cremona, began to suffer massive losses from desertion, particularly among his Swiss mercenaries.Oman, Art of War, 175. Oman cites contemporary reports of 4,000 Swiss remaining out of an initial 20,000. Colonna took the opportunity this offered and, advancing close to the Alps, crossed the Adda at Vaprio; Lautrec, lacking infantry and assuming the year's campaign to be over, withdrew to Milan.Oman, Art of War, 175‚Äì176. Colonna had no intention of stopping his advance, however. On the night of November 23, he launched a surprise attack on the city, overwhelming the Venetian troops defending one of the walls. Following some abortive street- fighting, Lautrec withdrew to Cremona with about 12,000 men.Oman, Art of War, 176. Lautrec's remaining forces consisted of 5,500 French and 6,400 Venetian troops. By January 1522, the French had lost Alessandria, Pavia, and Como; and Francesco II Sforza, bringing further German reinforcements, had slipped past a Venetian force at Bergamo to join Colonna in Milan.Oman, Art of War, 176. Only Como was actually besieged by Imperial troops; the other two cities rose up against the French and drove them out. Lautrec had meanwhile been reinforced by the arrival of 16,000 fresh Swiss pikemen and some further Venetian forces, as well as additional companies of French troops under the command of Thomas de Foix-Lescun and Pedro Navarro; he had also secured the services of the condottiere Giovanni de' Medici, who brought his Black Bands into the French service.Oman, Art of War, 176. Giovanni had been in the Papal service, but reneged on his contract, claiming that it had been made with the recently dead Pope Leo X and not with his successor, Pope Adrian VI. The French proceeded to attack Novara and Pavia, hoping to draw Colonna into a decisive battle.Oman, Art of War, 176‚Äì177. Colonna, leaving Milan, fortified himself in the monastery of Certosa south of the city. Considering this position to be too strong to be easily assaulted, Lautrec attempted instead to threaten Colonna's lines of communication by sweeping around Milan to Monza, cutting the roads from the city into the Alps.Oman, Art of War, 176‚Äì177. Lautrec was suddenly confronted, however, with the intransigence of the Swiss, who formed the largest contingent of the French army. They complained that they had not received any of the pay promised them since their arrival in Lombardy. The Swiss captains, led by Albert von Stein, demanded that Lautrec attack the Imperial army immediately‚Äîelse the mercenaries would abandon the French and return to their cantons. Lautrec reluctantly acquiesced and marched south towards Milan.Arfaioli, Black Bands, 10; Oman, Art of War, 177‚Äì178. == Battle == A diagram of the battle. Lautrec's movements are indicated in blue; Colonna's, in red. === Dispositions === Colonna had meanwhile relocated to a formidable new position: the manor park of Bicocca, about four miles (6 km) north of Milan. The park was situated between a large expanse of marshy ground to the west and the main road into Milan to the east; along this road ran a deep wet ditch, which was crossed by a narrow stone bridge some distance south of the park. The north side of the park was bordered by a sunken road; Colonna deepened this and constructed an earthen rampart on the southern bank. The Imperial artillery, placed on several platforms jutting forward from the earthworks, was able to sweep the fields north of the park as well as parts of the sunken road itself.Hall, Weapons and Warfare, 175; Oman, Art of War, 178‚Äì179. Oman notes that descriptions of the ground on the north side of the park in contemporary sources vary, with some referring to a sunken road while others refer to a ditch. The entire length of the north side of the park was less than , which permitted Colonna to place his troops quite densely. Immediately behind the rampart were four ranks of Spanish arquebusiers, commanded by Fernando d'Avalos, Marquess of Pescara; they were backed by Spanish pikemen and German landsknechts under Georg Frundsberg.Oman, Art of War, 178‚Äì179; Taylor, Art of War, 51‚Äì52. Most of the Imperial cavalry was placed at the south end of the park, far behind the infantry; a separate force of cavalry was positioned to the south, guarding the bridge.Oman, Art of War, 179; Taylor, Art of War, 125. Oman suggests that d'Avalos and other Spanish commanders remembered the result of the precipitous advance made by the Spanish cavalry at the Battle of Ravenna ten years prior, and positioned the cavalry further back to avoid a repeat. On the evening of 26 April, Lautrec sent a force of about 400 cavalry under the Sieur de Pontdormy to reconnoiter the Imperial positions. The patrol reported that the ground was cut by irrigation ditches and ill-suited for maneuvering, but this failed to dissuade the Swiss.Oman, Art of War, 179. Colonna, having observed the French presence, sent messengers to Milan to request reinforcements; Francesco Sforza arrived the next morning with 6,400 additional troops, joining the cavalry near the bridge to the south of Colonna's camp.Oman, Art of War, 179. The Milanese force included 400 cavalry and 6,000 infantry. Oman describes the latter as \\"indifferent\\", and suggests that they were primarily city militia. At dawn on 27 April, Lautrec began his attack. The Black Bands brushed aside the Spanish pickets, clearing the ground before the Imperial positions. The French advance was headed by two columns of Swiss, each comprising about 4,000 to 7,000 men, accompanied by some artillery; this party was to assault the entrenched front of the Imperial camp directly.Arfaioli, Black Bands, 11; Hall, Weapons and Warfare, 175; Oman, Art of War, 179‚Äì180. Arfaioli gves the higher number for the size of the Swiss columns and Oman the lower one. Hall and Oman also mention that Pedro Navarro's sappers accompanied the Swiss, intending to assist the movement of the artillery. Lescun, meanwhile, led a body of cavalry south along the Milan road, intending to flank the camp and strike at the bridge to the rear.Oman, Art of War, 180. Pontdormy trailed Lescun with a separate cavalry force to ensure that he was not attacked from the flank. The remainder of the French army, including the French infantry, the bulk of the heavy cavalry, and the remnants of the Swiss, formed up in a broad line some distance behind the two Swiss columns; behind this was a third line, composed of the Venetian forces under Francesco Maria della Rovere, the Duke of Urbino.Oman, Art of War, 180‚Äì181. The Venetian line was shifted somewhat to the French right, and faced the Imperial camp on the side protected by the marshes. === The Swiss attack === The overall command of the Swiss assault was given to Anne de Montmorency. As the Swiss columns advanced towards the park, he ordered them to pause and wait for the French artillery to bombard the Imperial defences, but the Swiss refused to obey.Oman, Art of War, 180; Taylor, Art of War, 126. Perhaps the Swiss captains doubted that the artillery would have any effect on the earthworks; historian Charles Oman suggests that it is more likely they were \\"inspired by blind pugnacity and self- confidence\\".Oman, Art of War, 180. Oman notes that this theory was popular among the French observers of the battle. In any case, the Swiss moved rapidly towards Colonna's position, leaving the artillery behind. There was apparently some rivalry between the two columns, as one, commanded by Arnold Winkelried of Unterwalden, was composed of men from the rural cantons, while the other, under Albert von Stein, consisted of the contingents from Bern and the urban cantons.Oman, Art of War, 180. The advancing Swiss quickly came into range of the Imperial artillery. Unable to take cover on the level fields, they began to take substantial casualties; as many as a thousand Swiss may have been killed by the time the columns reached the Imperial lines.Oman, Art of War, 180‚Äì181. Anne de Montmorency, painted by Jean Clouet (c. 1530). Montmorency commanded the Swiss assault, and was the only survivor among the French nobles who accompanied it. The Swiss came to a sudden halt as the columns reached the sunken road in front of the park; the depth of the road and the height of the rampart behind it‚Äîtogether higher than the length of the Swiss pikes‚Äîeffectively blocked their advance. Moving down into the road, the Swiss suffered massive casualties from the fire of d'Avalos's arquebusiers.Hall, Weapons and Warfare, 175; Oman, Art of War, 181. Oman relates \\"that all the standards went down, and that the three or four first ranks perished wholesale.\\" Nevertheless, the Swiss made a series of desperate attempts to breach the Imperial line. Some parties managed to reach the top of the rampart, only to be met by the landsknechts, who had come up from behind the arquebusiers. One of the Swiss captains was apparently killed by Frundsberg in single combat; and the Swiss, unable to form up atop the earthworks, were pushed back down into the sunken road.Hall, Weapons and Warfare, 175; Oman, Art of War, 182. Arnold Winkelried and Albert von Stein are each named as Frundsberg's opponent in contemporary sources. Oman suggests that Winkelried's actions here may have caused his name to appear in the legend of Arnold Winkelried of Sempach. After attempting to move forward for about half an hour, the remnants of the Swiss columns retreated back towards the main French line. In the fields which they had crossed and before the rampart, they left more than 3,000 dead; among these were twenty-two captains, including both Winkelried and Albert von Stein.Oman, Art of War, 182. Of the French nobles who had accompanied the Swiss assault, only Montmorency survived.Oman, Art of War, 182. Montmorency was badly wounded and had to be carried out of the sunken road. === Denouement === Lescun, with about 400 heavy cavalry under his command, had meanwhile reached the bridge south of the park and fought his way across it and into the Imperial camp beyond.Oman, Art of War, 182. Colonna responded by detaching some cavalry under Antonio de Leyva to halt the French advance, while Francesco Sforza came up the road towards the bridge, aiming to surround Lescun. Pontdormy held off the Milanese, allowing Lescun to extricate himself from the camp; the French cavalry then retraced its path and rejoined the main body of the army.Oman, Art of War, 182‚Äì183. Oman notes that the engagement between Pontdormy and Sforza is only mentioned in a single contemporary account. Despite the urging of d'Avalos and several other Imperial commanders, Colonna refused to order a general attack on the French, pointing out that much of Lautrec's army‚Äîincluding the bulk of his cavalry‚Äîwas still intact. Colonna suggested that the French were already beaten, and would soon withdraw; this assessment was shared by Frundsberg.Oman, Art of War, 183. Oman notes that some contemporary chroniclers suggested that Frundsberg's reticence was due to the landsknechts' demands for double pay if they engaged in a second fight, but considers the story improbable. Nevertheless, some small groups of Spanish arquebusiers and light cavalry attempted to pursue the withdrawing Swiss, only to be beaten back by the Black Bands, which were covering the removal of the French artillery from the field.Oman, Art of War, 183. Colonna's judgement proved to be accurate. The Swiss were unwilling to make another assault, and marched for home on 30 April. Lautrec, believing that his resulting weakness in infantry made a further campaign impossible, retreated to the east, crossing the Adda into Venetian territory at Trezzo.Oman, Art of War, 183‚Äì184. Having reached Cremona, Lautrec left Lescun in command of the remnants of the French army and rode unescorted to Lyon, to make his report to Francis I.Oman, Art of War, 184. == Aftermath == Lautrec's departure heralded a complete collapse of the French position in northern Italy. No longer menaced by the French army, Colonna and d'Avalos marched on Genoa, capturing it after a brief siege.Oman, Art of War, 186. Pedro Navarro, taken prisoner at Genoa, spent the next three years imprisoned in Naples as a punishment for transferring his allegiance to the French. Lescun, learning of the loss of Genoa, arranged an agreement with Francesco Sforza by which the Castello Sforzesco in Milan, which still remained in French hands, surrendered, and the remainder of the French forces withdrew over the Alps.Oman, Art of War, 186. The Venetians, under the newly elected Doge Andrea Gritti, were no longer interested in continuing the war; in July 1523, Gritti concluded the Treaty of Worms with Charles V, removing the Republic from the fighting.Guicciardini, History of Italy, 335; Norwich, History of Venice, 439; Oman, Art of War, 186. The French would make two further attempts to regain Lombardy before the end of the war, but neither would be successful; the terms of the Treaty of Madrid, which Francis was forced to sign after his defeat at the Battle of Pavia, would leave Italy in Imperial hands. Another effect of the battle was the changed attitude of the Swiss. Francesco Guicciardini wrote of the aftermath of Bicocca: > They went back to their mountains diminished in numbers, but much more > diminished in audacity; for it is certain that the losses which they > suffered at Bicocca so affected them that in the coming years they no longer > displayed their wonted vigour.Oman, Art of War, 184. While Swiss mercenaries would continue to take part in the Italian Wars, they no longer possessed the willingness to make headlong attacks that they had at Novara in 1513 or Marignano in 1515; their performance at the Battle of Pavia in 1525 would surprise observers by its lack of initiative.Hall, Weapons and Warfare, 175; Oman, Art of War, 184‚Äì185. More generally, the battle made apparent the decisive role of small arms on the battlefield.Arfaioli, Black Bands, 10‚Äì11; Oman, Art of War, 185; Taylor, Art of War, 51. Although the full capabilities of the arquebus would not be demonstrated until the Battle of the Sesia (where arquebusiers would prevail against heavy cavalry on open ground) two years later, the weapon nevertheless became a sine qua non for any army which did not wish to grant a massive advantage to its opponents. While the pikeman would continue to play a vital role in warfare, it would be equal to that of the arquebusier; together, the two types of infantry would be combined into the so-called \\"pike and shot\\" units that would endure until the development of the bayonet at the end of the seventeenth century.Taylor, Art of War, 53‚Äì54, 57‚Äì58. The offensive doctrine of the Swiss‚Äîa \\"push of pike\\" unsupported by firearms‚Äîhad become obsolete. Indeed, offensive doctrines in general were increasingly replaced with defensive ones; the combination of the arquebus and effective field fortification had made frontal assaults on entrenched positions too costly to be practical, and they were not attempted again for the duration of the Italian Wars.Arfaioli, Black Bands, 11; Oman, Art of War, 185. As a result of the battle, the word \\"bicoca\\"‚Äîmeaning a bargain, or something acquired at little cost‚Äîentered the Spanish language.Real Academia Espa√±ola, Diccionario de la lengua espa√±ola, 22nd ed.

Construction of the gaol commenced in 1859 and the facility was opened in October 1861. In 1887 it was converted for use as a maximum security psychiatric ward for the criminally insane. J Ward officially closed in January 1991 and in 1993 it was re-opened as a museum providing tours. ==History== Construction of original building commenced in 1859, as a goldfields prison, based on the Pentonville concept, by the Public Works Department. They were built out of blue stone. On 10 October 1861 the gaol was opened, with a total of 21 prisoners incarcerated. The first Governor was Samuel Walker (previously the Governor of Portland Gaol). In 1864 the gaol housed 40 prisoners and in 1867 John Gray became the gaol's second Governor, a position he held for ten years. On 15 August 1870 the first execution was conducted at the gaol, when Andrew Vere was hanged for the murder of Amos Cheale in January 1869. The second execution at the gaol was held on 25 September 1883, when Robert Francis Burns was hanged for the murder of Michael Quinlivan. In 1877 Henry Pinniger was appointed as the gaol's third Governor. On 6 June 1884 the gaol held its third execution, with Henry Morgan being hanged for the murder of Margaret Nolan in November 1883. In 1884 George Fiddimont became the gaol's fourth Governor, he died of a heart attack at the goal on 14 September 1886. In the aftermath of the Victorian gold rush the gaol was no longer required and in December 1886 the gaol building was proclaimed as the 'J Ward', part of the Ararat Lunatic Asylum. J Ward is now a museum open to the public. Tours are run every day except on public holidays at 11 am, 12 pm, 1pm & 2pm. Other notes about J Ward include the amazing art work done by prisoners on the walls outside in their open area, the way this place makes you still imagine it being operated, and the thought to detail is amazing.

It is located on the border of Northcliff and Cresta. It has gone through multiple extensions and refurbishments. The mall is owned by Pareto, a unit of the Public Investment Corporation.Roy Cokayne, \\"Pareto Boss Warns on Sustainability of Wave of Shopping Malls\\", The Star, September 18, 2014 . The original design of the shopping centre had a model train which would run through the centre of the shopping centre stopping at various places around the inner mall to allow passengers off. The train would then come out one of the entrances and around a loop. Turning the train around inside the centre was done on a giant turntable, which became more popular to watch than the train itself. The train was removed in approximately 1992. Cresta was built in 1977. The first refurbishment finished in 1987 for the tenth anniversary adding the section from present day Showbiz ending just past Edgars. It was during this refurbishment that the train was added with the outside fun park with castle and pirate ship with water cannons. The transformation to family shopping mall is probably the recipe for its success. In 1990 the second refurbishment was completed bridging the road and adding an ice skating rink. The ice skating rink was subsequently changed into a cinema complex. In 2002 more additions were added including a third floor near CNA, an extension and parking lot at Stuttafords where the original Checkers stood, and an extension past the cinemas including a theatre and restaurant complex.

Its unit is kilogram per second in SI units, and slug per second or pound per second in US customary units. The common symbol is \\\\dot{m} (·πÅ, pronounced \\"m-dot\\"), although sometimes Œº (Greek lowercase mu) is used. Sometimes, mass flow rate is termed mass flux or mass current, see for example Fluid Mechanics, Schaum's et al.Fluid Mechanics, M. Potter, D.C. Wiggart, Schuam's outlines, McGraw Hill (USA), 2008, In this article, the (more intuitive) definition is used. Mass flow rate is defined by the limit:http://www.engineersedge.com/fluid_flow/mass_flow_rate.htmhttp://www.grc.nasa.gov/WWW/k-12/airplane/mflow.html :\\\\dot{m} = \\\\lim\\\\limits_{\\\\Delta t \\\\rightarrow 0}\\\\frac{\\\\Delta m}{ \\\\Delta t}= \\\\frac{{\\\\rm d}m}{{\\\\rm d}t} i.e. the flow of mass m through a surface per unit time t. The overdot on the m is Newton's notation for a time derivative. Since mass is a scalar quantity, the mass flow rate (the time derivative of mass) is also a scalar quantity. The change in mass is the amount that flows after crossing the boundary for some time duration, not the initial amount of mass at the boundary minus the final amount at the boundary, since the change in mass flowing through the area would be zero for steady flow. ==Alternative equations== Illustration of volume flow rate. Mass flow rate can be calculated by multiplying the volume flow rate by the mass density of the fluid, œÅ. The volume flow rate is calculated by multiplying the flow velocity of the mass elements, v, by the cross-sectional vector area, A. Mass flow rate can also be calculated by: :\\\\dot m = \\\\rho \\\\cdot \\\\dot V = \\\\rho \\\\cdot \\\\mathbf{v} \\\\cdot \\\\mathbf{A} = \\\\mathbf{j}_{\\\\rm m} \\\\cdot \\\\mathbf{A} where: *\\\\dot V or Q = Volume flow rate, *œÅ = mass density of the fluid, *v = Flow velocity of the mass elements, *A = cross-sectional vector area/surface, * jm = mass flux. The above equation is only true for a flat, plane area. In general, including cases where the area is curved, the equation becomes a surface integral: :\\\\dot m = \\\\iint_A \\\\rho \\\\mathbf{v} \\\\cdot {\\\\rm d}\\\\mathbf{A} = \\\\iint_A \\\\mathbf{j}_{\\\\rm m} \\\\cdot {\\\\rm d}\\\\mathbf{A} The area required to calculate the mass flow rate is real or imaginary, flat or curved, either as a cross-sectional area or a surface, e.g. for substances passing through a filter or a membrane, the real surface is the (generally curved) surface area of the filter, macroscopically - ignoring the area spanned by the holes in the filter/membrane. The spaces would be cross-sectional areas. For liquids passing through a pipe, the area is the cross-section of the pipe, at the section considered. The vector area is a combination of the magnitude of the area through which the mass passes through, A, and a unit vector normal to the area, \\\\mathbf{\\\\hat{n}}. The relation is \\\\mathbf{A} = A \\\\mathbf{\\\\hat{n}}. The reason for the dot product is as follows. The only mass flowing through the cross-section is the amount normal to the area, i.e. parallel to the unit normal. This amount is: :\\\\dot m = \\\\rho v A \\\\cos\\\\theta where Œ∏ is the angle between the unit normal \\\\mathbf{\\\\hat{n}} and the velocity of mass elements. The amount passing through the cross-section is reduced by the factor \\\\cos\\\\theta , as Œ∏ increases less mass passes through. All mass which passes in tangential directions to the area, that is perpendicular to the unit normal, doesn't actually pass through the area, so the mass passing through the area is zero. This occurs when Œ∏ = œÄ/2: :\\\\dot m = \\\\rho v A \\\\cos(\\\\pi/2) = 0 These results are equivalent to the equation containing the dot product. Sometimes these equations are used to define the mass flow rate. Considering flow through porous media, a special quantity, superficial mass flow rate, can be introduced. It is related with superficial velocity, vs, with the following relationship: :\\\\dot m_s = v_s \\\\cdot \\\\rho = \\\\dot m/A Lindeburg M. R. Chemical Engineering Reference Manual for the PE Exam. ‚Äì Professional Publications (CA), 2013. The quantity can be used in particle Reynolds number or mass transfer coefficient calculation for fixed and fluidized bed systems. ==Usage== In the elementary form of the continuity equation for mass, in hydrodynamics:Essential Principles of Physics, P.M. Whelan, M.J. Hodgeson, 2nd Edition, 1978, John Murray, : \\\\rho_1 \\\\mathbf{v}_1 \\\\cdot \\\\mathbf{A}_1 = \\\\rho_2 \\\\mathbf{v}_2 \\\\cdot \\\\mathbf{A}_2 In elementary classical mechanics, mass flow rate is encountered when dealing with objects of variable mass, such as a rocket ejecting spent fuel. Often, descriptions of such objects erroneously [Emphasis as in the original] invoke Newton's second law F =d(mv)/dt by treating both the mass m and the velocity v as time-dependent and then applying the derivative product rule. A correct description of such an object requires the application of Newton's second law to the entire, constant-mass system consisting of both the object and its ejected mass. Mass flow rate can be used to calculate the energy flow rate of a fluid: :\\\\dot{E}=\\\\dot{m}e where: * e = unit mass energy of a system Energy flow rate has SI units of kilojoule per second or kilowatt. ==Analogous quantities== In hydrodynamics, mass flow rate is the rate of flow of mass. In electricity, the rate of flow of charge is electric current. == See also == * Continuity equation * Fluid dynamics * Mass flow controller * Mass flow meter * Mass flux * Orifice plate * Standard cubic centimetres per minute * Thermal mass flow meter * Volumetric flow rate ==References Category:Fluid dynamics Category:Temporal rates Category:Mass ","title":"Mass flow rate"},{"id":"2223546","text":"The Granite Chief Wilderness is a 19,048 acre (77 km2) federally designated wilderness area of the Tahoe National Forest. Created by the California Wilderness Act of 1984, The National Park Service webpage on this Act it is located in the Sierra Nevada mountains west of Lake Tahoe in California, USA. It is managed by the US Forest Service Tahoe National Forest. Elevations range from to USGS at the summit of Granite Chief. Events such as the Western States Endurance Run and the equestrian Western States Trail Ride, (popularly called The Tevis Cup) cross portions of the wilderness. The Pacific Crest Trail also passes through along the east edge of the wilderness. This region is extensively glaciated and has features such as hanging valleys, cirques and U-shaped valleys, but few lakes. Just outside the wilderness boundary there are two large recreation reservoirs, Hell Hole Reservoir to the south and French Meadows Reservoir to the west. The Sierra Club had maintained the Bradley Hut, which was a ski hut located at the Five Lakes Basin, but in 1994 the Sierra Club was asked to remove the hut by the U. S. Forest Service as it was now inside the newly created wilderness. The hut was dismantled and relocated four miles (6 km) away. Because no mechanical equipment can be used in a wilderness, the dismantling of the Bradley Hut took until the fall of 1996 to finish.The Sierra Club's webpage on the Bradley Hut. ==Lakes and waterways== Picayune Valley, Granite Chief Wilderness California USA The principal drainages are the Middle Fork of the American River and Five Lakes Creek. The small lakes within the wilderness boundary are the Five Lakes, Mildred Lake and Little Needle Lake. Fish such as rainbow, brook and brown trout can be seen in Whiskey, Picayune, and Bear Pen creeks as well as the largest lake of the Five Lakes group. ==Flora and fauna== Rich, volcanic soils support a range of plant life, from fields of mule ears to conifer forests including whitebark pine at the highest elevations. Along the creeks grow black cottonwood, alder and aspen. ===Rare plants=== The three bracted onion (Allium tribracteatum) is a native perennial bulb endemic to California. The California Native Plant Society lists the three bracted onion as \\" rare, threatened, or endangered ... \\" and there are only 10 counties with either specimens obtained or a verified observation made. Near the North Forth American River is Whitney's milk vetch (Astragalus whitneyi var. lenophyllus). Typical of the high Sierra Nevada Mountains, the wildlife include mountain lion, black bear, and mule deer. Granite Chief wilderness provides important fawning areas for mule deer, so visitors are prohibited from bringing dogs into certain areas of the wilderness from May 15 to July 15. == Recreation == Map showing restricted deer fawning areas in gray Activities include day- hiking, backpacking, fishing, cross-country skiing, mountain climbing and horsepacking. The Five Lakes basin is the most heavily used area in the wilderness due to the close proximity to both Squaw Valley and Alpine Meadows ski areas. Two commercial outfitters offer horsepacking trips into the wilderness. ===Trails=== There are of trails with eight trailheads. The most used is the Granite Chief trailhead located at Squaw Valley Ski Area parking lot. Talbot campground is located near the Talbot trailhead, four miles (6 km) north of French Meadows Reservoir and is the only trailhead with a no-fee campground. ===Notable peaks=== {  width=\\"450\\" style=\\"text- align:center\\" + Peaks in Granite Chief Wilderness - !

Their main competitor was EMD. ==Arrangement== Alco produced locomotive bodies and prime movers while GE supplied the electrical gear. ALCo had previously partnered with GE and Ingersoll-Rand to produce the first successful line of diesel-electric switch engines from 1924 to 1928. In forming the Alco-GE partnership, GE sought to expand the market for their electrical equipment after EMD started producing their own while ALCo gained GE's support in terms of marketing and service infrastructure, areas in which EMD had a formidable advantage. ==Achievements== Notable locomotives produced by Alco-GE were the RS-1, the first road switcher, and UP 50, a prototype gas turbine-electric locomotive. Alco-GE attained a 26% share of the market for diesel locomotives as of 1946, mainly for switching and short-haul applications, but they could not crack EMD's dominant position in mainline locomotives. Alco's development of higher powered engines for such locomotives had not been satisfactory and EMD's introduction of the GP7 road-switcher in 1949 threatened Alco-GE's position in their most advantageous market. ==Dissolution== GE dissolved the partnership in 1953 to develop and build their own locomotives. Alco still received electrical gear from GE, but only as a customer and not a corporate partner. GE took over the gas turbine-electric venture in 1953 and during the early 1960s would replace Alco as EMD's strongest competitor in the North American market. Alco went out of business in 1969. ==References== Category:Locomotive manufacturers of the United States ","title":"Alco-GE"},{"id":"2223558","text":"Chlothar IV (died 718) was the king of Austrasia from 717 until his death. He was a member of the Merovingian dynasty, and was installed by Charles Martel, a contender for the office of mayor of the palace, in opposition to Chilperic II, whose rule was thereby restricted to Neustria. This marked the first time since 679 that the kingdom of the Franks was divided. Following Chlothar's death, it was reunited under Chilperic. Chlothar's parentage and the exact dates of his reign are uncertain, since no primary source gives them explicitly. Documents from Chlothar's reign place him on the throne between 28 June 717 and 24 February 718. A Frankish king-list from the reign of Charles the Bald a century and a half later gives his reign a length of one year, which is consistent with all other evidence. His reign began no earlier than 21 March 717 and was over by 18 May 718.Richard A. Gerberding, The Rise of the Carolingians and the Liber Historiae Francorum (Oxford University Press, 1987), pp. 141‚Äì44. Although it has been suggested that he was not a true Merovingian but a puppet king of convenience, this is unlikely, since it was the need for Merovingian legitimacy that compelled Charles Martel to name a rival king in the first place. Chlothar's father must have been either Theuderic III (died 691), in which case he was about 35 years old when he came to the throne, or Childebert III (died 711), in which case he was probably closer to 20.Martina Hartmann, \\"Pater incertus? Zu den V√§tern des Gegenk√∂nigs Chlothar IV. (717‚Äì718) und des letzten Merowingerk√∂nigs Childerich III. (743‚Äì751)\\", Deutsches Archiv f√ºr Erforschung des Mittelalters 58 (2002), pp. 1‚Äì15. Chlothar was made king at the instigation of Charles Martel following his victory over the forces of Chilperic II and the mayor of the palace, Ragamfred, at the Battle of Vincy on 21 March 717. This put Charles in control of most of Austrasia, although pockets still recognised Chilperic. The creation of a rival king in Chlothar IV served two goals: it legitimised Charles as mayor of the palace, an office which he claimed as an inheritance from his father, Pippin of Herstal, and it expanded his military resources by allowing him to raise a larger army through royal summons and the royal power to command.Paul Fouracre, The Age of Charles Martel (Routledge, 2016), pp. 65, 69‚Äì70. Following Chlothar's elevation, Chilperic and Ragamfred allied with Duke Odo of Aquitaine. In early 718, Charles led an army in Chlothar's name against the Neustrians and Aquitanians, whom he defeated at the Battle of Soissons, forcing Chilperic II to flee to Aquitaine and Duke Odo's protection. He then led the same army deep into Saxony, as far as the river Weser. The Lex Alamannorum, a law code for the Alamanni, was promulgated during Chlothar's reign and in his name. One of the three manuscripts groups of the Lex Alamannorum is called the Lex Alamannorum Hlotharii because of its invocation of Chlothar.Theodore John Rivers (ed.), Laws of the Alamans and Bavarians (University of Pennsylvania Press, 1977), p. 39. The Liber Historiae Francorum seems to imply that Chlothar died in 719. It is more likely that he died in 718 between 24 February, the date of his last known act, and 18 May, when Wissembourg Abbey, which was loyal to Charles Martel and dated its charters by the reign of Chlothar IV, switched to dating them by Chilperic II. Charles's pursuit of Chilperic, which culminated in a negotiated settlement with Odo for the king's return, was probably required by the sudden death of Chlothar IV. It has even been suggested that the suddenness of his death is suspicious, indicating perhaps that Charles had him removed‚Äîas soon as he no longer need him‚Äîin favour of the more legitimate Chilperic. No primary sources casts any suspicion, however. ==NotesReferences== Category:Merovingian kings Category:Frankish warriors Category:718 deaths Category:Year of birth unknown Category:Rois fain√©ants Category:8th-century Frankish kings ","title":"Chlothar IV"},{"id":"2223561","text":"The Kerzhenets () is a river in the Nizhny Novgorod Oblast in Russia.

Starr attended Western Canada High School and Queen's University. After moving to Vancouver, Starr formed her first band in 1992. According to legend, the true extent of her talent was first revealed on trip to New York City, when a friend pushed her onstage at an East Village club's open-mic night, where her impromptu spoken-word poetry met an enthusiastic reception. ==Career== Following a self-released demo called Learning 2 Cook in 1995, she released her debut album Tidy in 1996, mixing rock, punk, pop, and hip-hop, along with her trademark spoken-word poetry. On that album, she rapped in three languages: English, Spanish, and French. Starr signed to major label group Island/Def Jam in 1997, following a massive bidding war during which Clive Davis personally flew out to dine the young artist to try and sign her to his roster of pop stars. The next year, Seagram bought Polygram, the parent company of Island Def Jam, and merged it into Universal Music Group. In the resulting upheaval, Starr felt she was lost in the shuffle and she asked to be released from her contract. The material she recorded for her first album with Island Def Jam, 1998's Mending was never released, though some record labels have talked of releasing the lost album.

He played for six different Major League Baseball (MLB) teams from 1980 to 1990, primarily with the Seattle Mariners. Baseball statistician Bill James cited Phelps as an example of a player who is unfairly denied a chance to play in the majors, despite compiling strong minor league statistics. ==Early years== Born and raised in Seattle, Washington, Phelps graduated from Ingraham High School in north Seattle in 1972. He played a year at Washington State in Pullman under Bobo Brayton, then headed south to Arizona to Mesa Community College, looking for an opportunity to play at Arizona State in Tempe. In his only season at MCC in 1974, Phelps was named a junior college All-American. He was drafted twice in the first round (January and June drafts) by the New York Yankees and Philadelphia Phillies, respectively. He had previously been drafted by the Atlanta Braves in the eighth round out of high school in 1972. All this earned Phelps a chance from Coach Jim Brock to play at ASU, where he was named to the College World Series All Star team in 1976, when the Sun Devils lost to rival Arizona after having defeated the Wildcats seven times that season, including a first-round game in Omaha. ==Professional career== The left-hitting first baseman was selected by the Kansas City Royals in the fifteenth round of the 1976 baseball amateur draft. Phelps hit a combined 43 home runs from for the Omaha Royals, KC's Triple-A affiliate in the American Association. The Royals traded him to the Montreal Expos prior to 1982 season for pitcher Grant Jackson. In the American Association in 1982, Phelps hit .333 with 46 home runs and 141 RBI for the Wichita Aeros. He had only eight major league at-bats that year, as there was no room on a very talented Montreal roster for Phelps to break in. Instead, Phelps' hometown club, Seattle, purchased him from the Expos after the 1982 season. ===Seattle=== An average defensive player, Phelps was better suited to play with Seattle in the American League, as he could serve as the designated hitter, and the struggling franchise also had plenty of room for advancement. Phelps split time in 1983 between Seattle and its Pacific Coast League affiliate in Salt Lake City. Again, he hit minor league pitching well (.341 with 24 HR and 82 RBI in 74 games), but he did not play much in the majors. In 1984, he played a bit more for Seattle, hitting 24 HR in only 290 at-bats. Bad luck intervened early that year when a pitch broke his hand in the third game of the season; he had won the regular first base job, and hit two home runs in his first three-game and had five hits in his first ten at-bats. The injury resulted in the call-up of first baseman Alvin Davis after just one game in Triple-A, who immediately produced; Davis was named to the American League All-Star team and was the league's Rookie of the Year. The next season, Phelps found himself behind Davis at first and Gorman Thomas at DH, who had been signed as a free agent the previous season as an which limited Phelps to a mere 116 major league at-bats. In 1986 at the age 31, Phelps got into the major league lineup on a more-or-less regular basis. Although he was normally platooned against left-handed pitchers, Phelps still clocked 51 HR from It was at this time that his career travails inspired author Bill James to create the \\"Ken Phelps All-Star\\" team. As James described it: > Ken Phelpses are just available; if you want one, all you have to do is ask. > They are players whose real limitations are exaggerated by baseball > insiders, players who get stuck with a label -- the label of their limits, > the label the things they can't do -- while those that they can do are > overlooked... The Ken Phelps All-Stars [are] a whole teamful of guys who are > wearing labels, but who nonetheless can play major-league baseball, and will > prove it if they ever get the chance. ===The Buhner Trade=== Phelps hit 14 more home runs for Seattle in the first half of 1988. Impressed, owner George Steinbrenner of the New York Yankees traded Triple-A prospect Jay Buhner to Seattle in exchange for Phelps, despite already having Don Mattingly and Jack Clark to play first base and DH. With limited playing time, Phelps found it difficult to maintain his production of the previous four-and-a-half seasons, while Buhner went on to become an All- Star and legendary Mariners player. A Seinfeld episode in early 1996 (\\"The Caddy\\") depicted Yankee fan Frank Costanza (played by Jerry Stiller) as more upset about the Buhner trade than about the supposed death of his own son Phelps only hit 17 home runs for the Yankees before being traded to the Oakland Athletics in late August 1989. The A's won the World Series, but Phelps had just two at-bats in the post-season, with a pinch-hit double in the third game of the league championship series. ===Final homer=== Phelps' final home run might have been his most notable; it came with Oakland before a sell- out home crowd in 1990 on April 20, with two outs in the bottom of the ninth that Friday night. Phelps was called out of the dugout to pinch hit against Brian Holman of the Mariners, who had retired the first 26 batters in succession; he homered on the first pitch to ruin the perfect game.April 20, 1990 Seattle vs. Oakland Years later, Phelps said he wanted to hit it out because he did not want to watch himself on ESPN's SportsCenter all season making the out to complete Holman's gem.https://www.baseball- reference.com/bullpen/Ken_Phelps He was traded to Cleveland in mid-June, and retired after playing 7 games for the Giants AAA affiliate in Phoenix the next season in 1991 at the age of 36. ===Summary=== Phelps' career .239 batting average hides the things that, as James pointed out, he could do. Thanks to outstanding power and strike zone judgment, his career OPS is a strong .854. Phelps hit 123 home runs in 1854 career at-bats, the 28th best ratio in major league history through 2004 (min. 1500 plate appearances). Phelps hit 100 career home runs in 1322 at-bats ‚Äî the second fastest, as measured by at bats, in MLB history, behind Ryan Howard in 1141 at-bats; Phelps still holds the AL record. ==After baseball== As of 2005, Phelps did color commentary on the radio for Arizona Diamondbacks baseball games. In 2006, Phelps was replaced as the Diamondbacks color analyst by former Major League pitcher Tom Candiotti. Today, he does baseball analysis for Fox Sports Arizona, along with community and media work he does for the state's largest electric utility, Arizona Public Service. Programs that Phelps has been involved with (The ABC's of Baseball, and Life and Power Players) have received national recognition for having positive impact on children. ==Notes== # ==References *Venezuelan Professional Baseball League Category:1954 births Category:Living people Category:American Association (20th century) MVP Award winners Category:American expatriate baseball players in Canada Category:Arizona Diamondbacks broadcasters Category:Arizona State Sun Devils baseball players Category:Baseball players from Washington (state) Category:Caribbean Series players Category:Cleveland Indians players Category:Daytona Beach Islanders players Category:Gulf Coast Royals players Category:Jacksonville Suns players Category:Kansas City Royals players Category:Leones del Caracas players Category:Major League Baseball designated hitters Category:Major League Baseball first basemen Category:Mesa Thunderbirds baseball players Category:Montreal Expos players Category:New York Yankees players Category:Oakland Athletics players Category:Omaha Royals players Category:Phoenix Firebirds players Category:Salt Lake City Gulls players Category:Seattle Mariners players Category:Sportspeople from Seattle Category:Waterloo Royals players Category:Wichita Aeros players ","title":"Ken Phelps"},{"id":"2223583","text":"Ron Marz (born November 17, 1965) is an American comic book writer, known for his work on titles such as Batman/Aliens, DC vs. Marvel, Green Lantern, Silver Surfer, and Witchblade. ==Career== Marz is known for his work on Silver Surfer and Green Lantern, as well as the DC vs. Marvel crossover and Batman/Aliens.

It is based upon Bapsi Sidhwa's novel, Cracking India (1991, US; 1992, India; originally published as Ice Candy Man, 1988, UK), set during the 1947 partition of India. Earth is the second installment of Mehta's Elements trilogy, preceded by Fire (1996) and followed by Water (2005). It was India's entry for the 1999 Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film. ==Plot== The story is set in Lahore (now the capital of Pakistani Punjab) in the time period directly before and during the partition of India in 1947 at the time of Indian independence. A young girl with polio, Lenny (Maia Sethna), narrates the story through the voice of her adult self (Shabana Azmi). She is from a wealthy Parsi family who hope to remain neutral to the rising tensions between Hindus, Sikhs, and Muslims in the area. She is adored and protected by her parents, Bunty (Kitu Gidwani) and Rustom (Arif Zakaria), and cared for by her Ayah, a beautiful Hindu woman named Shanta (Nandita Das). Both Dil Navaz, the Ice-Candy Man (Aamir Khan), and Hassan, the Masseur (Rahul Khanna) are Muslim and in love with Shanta. Shanta, Dil, and Hassan are part of a small group of friends from different faiths (some of whom work for Lenny's family) who spend their days together in the park. With partition, however, this once unified group of friends becomes divided and tragedy ensues. ==Cast== * Aamir Khan ‚Äì Dil Nawaz * Rahul Khanna ‚Äì Hassan, the Masseur * Nandita Das ‚Äì Shanta, the maid * Maia Sethna ‚Äì Lenny Sethna * Shabana Azmi ‚Äì older Lenny, narrator * Kitu Gidwani ‚Äì Bunty Sethna * Arif Zakaria ‚Äì Rustom Sethna * Kulbhushan Kharbanda ‚Äì Imam Din * Kumar Rajendra ‚Äì Refugee Police * Pavan Malhotra ‚Äì Butcher ==Critical receptionReviews=== The film holds an 86% rating on Rotten Tomatoes based on 35 reviews. Roger Ebert gave the film three out of four stars and states that Earth, \\"is effective because it doesn't require much history from its viewers, explains what needs to be known, and has a universal message.\\" The New York Times described it as \\"a powerful and disturbing reminder of how a civilization can suddenly crack under certain pressures.\\" The New Yorker argues that, \\"Deepa Mehta handles her material convincingly, and the cast is so likable that they wear the larger themes like beautiful garments.\\" Rediff.com notes that, \\"Aamir Khan has probably given the best performance of his life. It is hard to imagine another actor bringing alive the nuances of the ice-candy man the way he does.\\" Planet Bollywood gave the film a 9.5 out of 10 and stated that, \\"Earth is strongly recommended to those who want to see a different type of Hindi film and who are tired of the usual boy meets girl stories and revenge dramas.\\" ===Awards and nominations=== * Asian Film Festival ‚Äì Best Film Award * Filmfare Best Male Debut Award ‚Äì Rahul Khanna * Filmfare Best Female Debut Award ‚Äì Nandita Das * Earth was India's official entry for the 71st Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film in 1999, but was not included among the final five nominees selected by the AMPAS. ==SoundtrackReferences * *Official trailer * Category:1998 films Category:1990s romantic drama films Category:Indian films Category:Indian romantic drama films Category:1990s Hindi-language films Category:English-language films Category:English-language Indian films Category:Films based on American novels Category:Films directed by Deepa Mehta Category:Films set in 1947 Category:Films set in Lahore Category:Films about religious violence in India Category:Films set in the partition of India Category:Films set in the Indian independence movement Category:Films scored by A.

Originally based on a modified OH-6A, it was later based on the MD 500E, with a single five-bladed main rotor. The newest version, the MH-6M, is based on the MD 530F and has a single, six-bladed main rotor and four-bladed tail rotor. ==Development== US Army Rangers on exercise using an MH-6 The OH-6 was started in 1960, when the U.S. Army issued Technical Specification 153 for a Light Observation Helicopter (LOH) that could perform personnel transport, escort and attack missions, casualty evacuation, and observation. Twelve companies took part in the competition and Hughes Tool Company's Aircraft Division submitted the Model 369. Two designs, those submitted by Fairchild-Hiller and Bell, were selected as finalists by the Army-Navy design competition board, but the Army later included the helicopter from Hughes as well. The first Model 369 prototype flew on 27 February 1963. Originally designated the YHO-6A under the army's designation system, the aircraft was redesignated the YOH-6A under the Department of Defense's new joint system in 1962. Five prototypes were built, each fitted with a Allison T63-A-5A engine, and delivered to the U.S. Army at Fort Rucker, Alabama to compete against the other 10 prototype aircraft submitted by Bell and Fairchild-Hiller. In the end, Hughes won the competitionThe Hughes Companies ‚Äì US Centennial of Flight Commission and the Army awarded a contract for production in May 1965. The initial order was for 714 aircraft, but that was later increased to 1,300 with an option to buy another 114. Seventy helicopters were built in the first month. This agile, unarmed helicopter is outfitted with outboard \\"benches\\" designed to ferry up to three commandos on each side. There is also a gunship variant, the AH-6. Painted black for nighttime operations, this small aircraft can conduct rapid insertions and extractions of special operations forces into areas its larger brother, the MH-60 Black Hawk, cannot. ==Operational history== After the April 1980 failure of Operation Eagle Claw, it was determined that the US Army lacked aircraft and crews who were trained and prepared to perform special operations missions. (Marine pilots and Navy helicopters were used.) To remedy this shortcoming, the Army began developing a special aviation task force to prepare for the next attempt to rescue the hostages: Operation Credible Sport. ===Task Force 160=== MH-6 of the 160th Special Operations Aviation Regiment The United States Army 160th Special Operations Aviation Regiment (Airborne), also known as Night Stalkers, is a special operations force that provides helicopter aviation support for general purpose forces and special operations forces. Its missions have included attack, assault, and reconnaissance, and are usually conducted at night, at high speeds, low altitudes, and on short notice. The architects of the task force identified the need for a small helicopter that could land in the most restrictive locations and could be easily transported on Air Force airlifters. They chose the OH-6A scout helicopter, and it became known as the Little Bird compared to the other aircraft in the task force, the UH-60A and the CH-47C. As a separate part of the project, armed OH-6As were being developed at Fort Rucker, Alabama. The pilots selected to fly the OH-6A helicopters came from the 229th Attack Helicopter Battalion and were sent to the Mississippi Army National Guard's Army Aviation Support Facility (AASF) at Gulfport, Mississippi, for two weeks of qualification training in the aircraft. When the training was completed, C-141 aircraft transported the aircraft and crews to Fort Huachuca, Arizona, for two weeks of mission training. The mission training consisted of loading onto C-130 transport aircraft which would then transport them to forward staging areas over routes as long as . The armed OH-6 aircraft from Fort Rucker joined the training program in the fall of 1980. ===Operation Credible Sport=== Operation Credible Sport was a joint project of the U.S. military in the second half of 1980 to prepare for a second rescue attempt of the hostages held in Iran. It was canceled after the hostages were released on 20 January 1981 and, for a short while, it looked as if the task force would be disbanded and the personnel returned to their former units. However, the Army decided that it would be more prudent to keep the unit. The task force, which had been designated Task Force 158, was soon formed into the 160th Aviation Battalion. The OH-6A helicopters used for transporting personnel became the MH-6 aircraft of the Light Assault Company and the armed OH-6As became the AH-6 aircraft of the Light Attack Company. ===Operation Urgent Fury (Grenada)=== The OH-6s of 160th SOAR were some of the first to see action in Grenada during Operation Urgent Fury. A/MH-6 Little Birds were used during the 1983 invasion of Grenada to evacuate casualties onto naval ship decks. The existence of the unit became widely known in the aftermath of the October 1983 invasion of Grenada, as OH-6s helicopters were seen supporting Special Operations during this operation.DoD and the US Army denied A/MH-6s were used in the operation despite amateur video showing the helicopters in action. The OH-6s were flown in USAF C-130 transport planes, two at a time, to nearby Barbados. From there they flew to Grenada. ===Nicaragua=== By 1983, 160th SOAR and its helicopters were heavily committed to supporting the contras, a United States-subsidized military force. Specially adapted unmarked Hughes 500D helicopters from CIA Seaspray unit based in Fort Eustis also took part in this task .160th Special Operations Aviation Regiment (Airborne) Homepage MH-6s were based in Palmerola Air Base, Honduras, and flew missions into Nicaragua. The unit members wore civilian clothes, flew by night, and were instructed to destroy their aircraft if they were forced down. ===Iran-Iraq War=== On 24 July 1987, a Kuwaiti oil tanker, reflagged as Bridgeton and escorted by U.S. Navy warships, struck a mine in the Persian Gulf. It became apparent that more than escort ships would be required to guard merchant ships. The U.S. military deployed the MH-6 and AH-6 aircraft from the 160th Special Operations Aviation Regiment (SOAR) to provide surveillance and patrols in cooperation with other U.S. special operations units in Operation Prime Chance. Two MH-6 and four AH-6 aircraft were initially deployed and designated as Detachment 160 Aviation Group (DET 160 AVGP). The MH-6 aircraft carried Forward Looking Infra-Red (FLIR) and a videotape system which gave them excellent ability to detect and identify targets, then direct the armed AH-6s. The AH-6 helicopters were armed with 7.62 miniguns and 2.75-inch rockets. Initially, the aircraft patrolled in teams (call sign \\"SEABAT\\") that waited for U.S. Navy SH-2s to direct them to the targets. Later, to preserve the aircraft and crews from fatigue and wear, the SEABAT teams remained on the ship's deck until a contact was identified. At 10 pm on 21 September 1987, the captain of launched a SEABAT team (a MH-6 and two AH-6s) to check out reports of Iranian minelaying. The team found Iran Ajr, an amphibious landing ship equipped with minelaying racks. The MH-6 confirmed that Iran Ajr was laying mines, the AH-6s opened fire, causing the crew to abandon ship. The vessel was subsequently boarded and captured. On the night of 8 October 1987, an Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps Boghammar and two Boston Whaler boats were detected by an SH-2. A SEABAT team was launched from , and as the MH-6 drew near to investigate, the Boghammar opened fire, the first of a series of engagements by both AH-6s and the MH-6 (recently armed with a minigun). The Boghammar launched two Stinger missiles at the helicopters, but eventually all three boats were sunk. For the remainder of the operation, it was decided that barges set up as mobile sea bases (MSB) would facilitate the operation of the special operations forces. Hercules and Wimbrown VII were leased to provide these bases and the SEABAT teams began operating from the barges. In early 1988, it was decided that modified U.S. Army OH-58D helicopters, fitted with weapons, would replace the SEABAT teams. On 24 February 1988, a team of two AHIP helicopters replaced the SEABAT team on the Wimbrown VII but it would be several months (June 1988) before the SEABAT team aboard the barge Hercules would be relieved by another AHIP detachment. ===Operation Just Cause (Panama)=== On 17 December 1989, 9 MH-6s, 11 AH-6G/Js, 19 UH/MH-60As were flown by Air Force C-5 Galaxy airlifters to Howard AFB's Hangar 3. After dark, on 19 December, the aircraft were rolled out to prepare for Operation Just Cause. Before the main invasion force arrived in Panama City, Panama, two MH-6s supported by two AH-6s landed at Torrijos-Tocumen Airport to insert a beacon and combat controllers. Four other AH-6s conducted pre-assault attacks on the Panamanian Defense Force (PDF) Headquarters, La Comandancia, adjoining the heavily populated El Chorrillo neighborhood in downtown Panama City. One of the AH-6s was damaged by ground fire and crashlanded in the Comandancia compound. The two pilots, pinned down by small-arms fire for two hours, eventually made their way back to friendly forces, taking a PDF soldier prisoner along the way. Other AH-6s escorted MH-6s on a rooftop rescue operation conducted at C√°rcel Modelo, a prison adjacent to La Comandancia. In Operation Acid Gambit, the aircraft approached the prison. Under fire from a nearby apartment house, the Little Birds landed on the roof, dropped off the rescue team, and lifted off. Upon their return, heavy smoke made it tough to find the roof and the helicopters took heavy fire from a cellblock about 50 to from the landing site. Maj. Richard Bowman, a copilot, took a round in the elbow. His pilot took over the controls and landed the aircraft. The aircraft picked up the rescue personnel and headed back toward Howard AFB, but one MH-6 lost power as it left the roof, and crashed in the street below with minor injuries to the passengers, who were helped from the crash site by U.S. infantry soldiers. Elsewhere, four AH-6s provided fire support for the airborne assault at Rio Hato Airfield, supported by an MH-60 which operated as a Forward Arming and Refuel Point (FARP). Two nine-man teams from the 160th participated in the airborne assaults of Torrijos-Tocumen Airfield and Rio Hato Airfield, and were dropped from Air Force C-141s to set up FARPs, platforms with HE-rocket and minigun ammunition, parts and replacements for the miniguns, and fuel and refueling pumps, hoses, etc. But the FARP dropped at Rio Hato landed out of reach in a marsh, forcing the team to \\"wet wing\\" refuel from the MH-60. The Rio Hato mission originally included nine other MH-60s and four MH-6s. Several hours prior to H-hour, these aircraft and crews were instead sent to support a raid near Col√≥n, Panama, a key PDF stronghold where PDF leaders were believed to be. At H-hour, the helicopters conducted an air assault on a beach house along the coast of Colon. It was during this mission that the first 160th soldiers to die in combat perished when their AH-6 was shot down. Another force of eight MH-60s and four MH-6s waited on the airstrip with crew aboard, to conduct follow-on raids should the need arise. After these initial missions, elements of the 160th provided support to special operations forces securing outlying areas, recovering weapons caches, and \\"hunt for Elvis\\" ‚Äì the phrase the men of the 160th used to refer to the search for General Manuel Noriega. Four MH-60s, two MH-6s, two AH-6s, and two MH-47s were moved to Ft. Sherman in the north for operations in and around Colon. The 160th conducted numerous air assault missions over the next two weeks, and on 3 January 1990, the majority of the force went back to Fort Campbell, Kentucky. ===Somali Civil War=== MH-6 Little Birds were part of the initial assault near the Olympic Hotel in the Bakara Market of Mogadishu, Somalia. The MH-6s conducted rooftop insertions of Delta Force soldiers. After the shootdown of the MH-60L, call sign \\"Super Six- One\\", by a rocket-propelled grenade (RPG), an MH-6 Little Bird, call sign \\"Star Four-One\\", landed in the street next to the downed MH-60 and attempted to evacuate the casualties.

Under intense ground fire, the MH-6 departed with its crew and survivors. During the night, AH-6J gunships provided fire support to Rangers and Delta Force operators who were in defensive positions around the crash site of \\"Super 6-1\\" and under constant fire from Warlord Mohammad Farrah Aidid's militia members. ===Global War on Terrorism=== Iraq War Two AH-6J Little Birds take off for a mission during Operation Iraqi Freedom in 2003. During the invasion of Iraq in 2003 and up until the end of the war in late 2011, Little Bird pilots took part in numerous missions. Two AH-6 and two MH-6 helicopters were part of a special operations raid at Al Qadisiyah in western Iraq. AH-6 and MH-6 gave support for the 75th Ranger Regiment during its seizure of the Haditha Dam complex in April 2003. AH-6 helicopters were also tasked with supporting the rescue mission of Private First Class Jessica Lynch in April 2003. MH-6 helicopters were part of TF-145, as well as the rescue of three Italian contractors and Polish businessman taken hostage by Iraqi insurgents in 2004. Operation Celestial Balance In September 2009, two AH-6 and two MH-6 helicopters were used in an operation in Somalia by U.S. Navy SEALs to kill wanted terrorist Saleh Ali Saleh Nabhan. ==Variants== For OH-6 and TH-6 variants, see OH-6 Cayuse.

It was the only 3 Ninjas film released by Touchstone Pictures, while the others were released by TriStar Pictures. The film is about three young brothers who learn martial arts from their Japanese grandfather. ==Plot== Every year, twelve-year-old Samuel, eleven-year-old Jeffrey and eight-year-old Michael Douglas visit their grandfather, Mori Tanaka at his cabin. Mori trains his grandchildren in the art of ninjutsu. As the summer comes to an end, Mori gives each of them a new \\"ninja\\" name based on their personalities: 'Rocky', 'Colt', and 'Tum-Tum'. Meanwhile, the boys' father, Sam Douglas, is an FBI agent who stages a sting operation to entrap Hugo Snyder in the sale of warheads. Snyder escapes the trap with the use of his own ninja henchmen. Snyder decides to test Mori's fighting skill. The boys ignore Mori's orders to stay in the house and aid by defeating two ninjas on their own. Snyder threatens Mori's family if he does not get Douglas off his back, and Mori chides the boys briefly for interfering in his personal affairs. When they return home, they find their father unenthusiastic to see what they had learned during their visit and more annoyed at their new names. Emily, a friend of Rocky's, compliments his new name and agrees to ride with them to school the next day. Snyder develops a plan to kidnap the boys to use them as leverage to get Douglas to back off. Since the FBI watches them, his assistant Brown contacts his nephew Fester and his buddies Hammer and Marcus to kidnap the boys. Due to Douglas and his FBI crew's presence, they are unable to capture the boys. The next day, Fester and his friends follow the boys to school but are side-tracked by a fender bender with a police car. Emily becomes separated from the boys and encounters a group of bullies who steal her bike. At recess, the boys challenge the bullies to a two-on-two basketball game to ten, and they spot the bullies nine points. The brothers effortlessly score ten consecutive points, winning Emily's bike and respect back. That night, Colt learns that Snyder, who they assumed was a friend of Mori's, is actually the criminal their father is after. They are left with a babysitter when Jessica leaves to pick up Sam, and Fester and his friends break into the house with a fake pizza order, subduing the babysitter. They use a device in Rocky's bedroom to call Emily over and use her as a hostage. Due to an earlier trap, Hammer and Marcus run to the bathrooms sick to their stomachs, and the boys defeat Fester. Hammer and Marcus are subsequently defeated. After freeing the babysitter, the boys are overpowered by Brown and Snyder's bodyguard Rushmore. The boys escape their captivity and manage to subdue Rushmore. Snyder confronts Mori and challenges him to a fight for the boys' freedom. Due to his youth and speed, Snyder almost proves too much for Mori, until he remembers a handful of jelly beans which Tum-Tum had given him and uses them to gag Snyder. Refusing defeat, Snyder grabs a gun from one of his subordinates but is suddenly shot and subdued by Douglas. Snyder and his men are arrested. ===International version=== The international cut of the film features a number of small parts of scenes that were cut from the movie for its American release, most likely to ensure a PG rating. Among the cut scenes are (not all-inclusive): extra footage of Snyder's escape in which he confronts two FBI agents whom he promptly defeats, a scene in which the robbers fire a gun in the convenience store and tie up the clerk behind the counter, a scene in which the robbers get the Douglas family address from Brown, additional footage of Grandpa trailing Snyder to his ship hideout, numerous small portions of the scene where the robbers invade the Douglas household, including Colt beating the robbers after getting them under a tarp in the room being renovated and a scene of Fester, the leader of the robbers asking his uncle (Brown) if he can be paid, extra sarcastic dialogue while the boys are locked up in Snyder's ship, an extended scene in which the boys are reunited with Grandpa. Additionally, in the international version the boys lose the basketball challenge and their bikes, so a scene ends the international version of the film in which they fight the bullies to get them back. ==Cast== * Michael Treanor ‚Äì Samuel \\"Rocky\\" Douglas * Max Elliott Slade ‚Äì Jeffrey \\"Colt\\" Douglas * Chad Power ‚Äì Michael \\"Tum Tum\\" Douglas * Victor Wong ‚Äì Grandpa Mori Tanaka * Alan McRae ‚Äì Sam Douglas * Margarita Franco ‚Äì Jessica Douglas * Rand Kingsley ‚Äì Hugo Snyder * Joel Swetow ‚Äì Mr. Nigel Brown * Professor Toru Tanaka ‚Äì Rushmore * Patrick Labyorteaux ‚Äì Fester * Race Nelson as Marcus * D.J.

Accessed August 9, 2020. Stephen Holden of The New York Times said that \\"the film can't seem to make up its mind whether it wants to be a comedy, a fantasy or an adventure film\\" and that \\"beneath all the excitement, the message that '3 Ninjas' conveys is anything but reassuring.\\" It did attain a favorable response from Kevin Thomas of the Los Angeles Times, who said that \\"although their attention may wander, parents can be grateful that there's some substance as well as fun in this Disney release, for martial arts is presented as a matter of defense rather than aggression, emphasizing that it is a matter of mind and spirit as well as body and requiring resourcefulness and discipline.\\" Later on, it would receive a cult following for its camp factor and spawned three less-successful sequels 3 Ninjas Kick Back, 3 Ninjas Knuckle Up, and 3 Ninjas: High Noon at Mega Mountain. ===Box office=== The film opened at the box office in the #4 position, and by the end of its 6-week run in theaters grossed US$29,000,301 domestically. Considering that the film was budgeted at $2.5 million, it was a huge financial success, and turned out to be the most profitable film of the year in terms of cost-to-gross ratio. ===Legacy=== Slade, Power and Treanor host an annual screening and Q&A; in Oak Park, a neighborhood in Sacramento, California each April. ==References* Category:1992 films Category:1990s action comedy films Category:1992 independent films Category:1992 martial arts films Category:American action comedy films Category:American films Category:American independent films Category:American martial arts films Category:English-language films Category:Films about brothers Category:Films about families Category:Films directed by Jon Turteltaub Category:Films set in the United States Category:Ninja films Category:American martial arts comedy films Category:Touchstone Pictures films Category:1992 comedy films ","title":"3 Ninjas (film)"},{"id":"2223596","text":"Elissa may refer to: * Elissa (name), a feminine given name (including people by that name) ==People== *Dido, Queen of Carthage in Greek and Roman mythology, also referred to as Elissa or Alyssa *Elissa (born 1972), Lebanese singer. ==Other uses == *Elissa (book), a 1900 novel by H.

She is based in Galveston, Texas, and is one of the oldest ships sailing today. Launched in 1877, she is now a museum ship at the Texas Seaport Museum. She was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1990. ==History== The foremast of the Elissa Elissa was built in Aberdeen, Scotland as a merchant vessel in a time when steamships were overtaking sailing ships. She was originally launched on October 27, 1877. She was named for the niece of Henry Fowler Watt, Elissa's first owner, though according to his descendants the ship was named for the Queen of Carthage, Elissa (more commonly called Dido), Aeneas' tragic lover in the epic poem The Aeneid. Elissa also sailed under Norwegian and Swedish flags. In Norway she was known as the Fjeld of T√∏nsberg and her master was Captain Herman Andersen. In Sweden her name was Gustav of Gothenburg. In 1918, she was converted into a two-masted brigantine and an engine was installed. She was sold to Finland in 1930 (owned by Gustaf Erikson to 1942) and reconverted into a schooner. In 1959, she was sold to Greece, and successively sailed under the names Christophoros, in 1967 as Achaeos, and in 1969 as Pioneer. In 1970, she was rescued from destruction in Piraeus after being purchased for the San Francisco Maritime Museum. However, she languished in a salvage yard in Piraeus until she was purchased for $40,000, in 1975, by the Galveston Historical Foundation, her current owners. In 1979, after a year in Greece having repairs done to her hull, Elissa was first towed to Gibraltar. There, she was prepared for an ocean tow by Captain Jim Currie of the New Orleans surveyors J.K. Tynan International. The restoration process continued until she was ready for tow on June 7, 1979. Elissa has an iron hull, and the pin rail and bright work is made of teak. Her masts are Douglas fir from Oregon, and her 19 sails were made in Maine. She has survived numerous modifications including installation of an engine, and the incremental removal of all her rigging and masts. Elissa made her first voyage as a restored sailing ship in 1985, traveling to Corpus Christi, Texas. In Freeport the crew was joined by seventh grader Jerry Diegel and Betty Rusk, his history and English teacher, after Diegel won an essay contest on the history of the Elissa. A year later, she sailed to New York City to take part in the Statue of Liberty's centennial celebrations. When she's not sailing, Elissa is moored at the Texas Seaport Museum in Galveston. Public tours are available year- round-provided she is not out sailing. The ship is sailed and maintained by qualified volunteers from around the nation. The Tall Ship Elissa In July 2011, the U.S. Coast Guard declared Elissa to be \\"not seaworthy.\\" Officials at the Texas Seaport Museum in Galveston where Elissa is berthed were astonished when a Coast Guard inspection in 2011 revealed a corroded hull. The tall ship is inspected twice every five years, said John Schaumburg, museum assistant director. The 2011 inspection uncovered the worst corrosion since the tall ship was rebuilt in 1982, he said. Texas Seaport Museum raised the $3 million that paid for hull replacement and other long-overdue maintenance projects, finishing in January 2013. The museum also replaced the 22,000 board feet of Douglas fir decking. Including building new quarter deck furniture out of high quality teak. Elissa returned to sailing once again in March 2014. She ran a series of daily sails for a period of two weeks out of her home port of Galveston TX. Elissa's sail training program for the 2017-2018 sailing season is currently underway with plans to compete as the Flagship in the Tall Ship Challenge-Gulf Coast in April 2018 where she will sail to Pensacola, FL and New Orleans, LA. She will also complete a week long series of daily sails prior to her trip to Florida. Elissa remains one of the world's oldest sailing hulls still in operation.http://www.galvestonhistory.org The oldest is the coasting schooner Lewis R. French, launched in 1871 in Christmas Cove, Maine USA. She still sails as part of the windjammer fleet out of Camden, Maine USA. ==Honors== *National Register of Historic Places - first object granted this status while outside United States territory *National Historic Landmark *Named state Tall Ship by act of legislature in 2005 *Escorted into Galveston harbor to be commissioned ==See also== *List of National Historic Landmarks in Texas *National Register of Historic Places listings in Galveston County, Texas ==References== * . ==External links== *Elissa InfoPage *Elissa Handbook of Texas Online Category:Barques Category:Museum ships in Texas Category:Individual sailing vessels Category:Culture of Galveston, Texas Category:Tall ships of the United States Category:Sailing ships of the United States Category:National Historic Landmarks in Texas Category:Ships on the National Register of Historic Places in Texas Category:National Register of Historic Places in Galveston County, Texas Category:Museums in Galveston, Texas Category:1877 ships Category:Sailing ships of Scotland Category:Ships built in Aberdeen Category:1877 in Scotland Category:Windjammers ","title":"Elissa (ship)"},{"id":"2223602","text":"The Bellarine HighwayBellarine Highway, Point Nepean Road, & Mornington Peninsula Freeway (B110), Expressway - Paul Rands.

He quickly established himself as the franchise's top position prospect in the system. He was often compared to Lenny Dykstra due to his aggressive play and ability to hit for average and draw walks. He made it to the major leagues in 2002, but during a baserunning mishap tore his ACL in his left knee. After that incident, his status as a top prospect began to decline, as Snelling suffered numerous serious injuries in subsequent years. At Seattle Mariners fan blog USS Mariner, Snelling was dubbed \\"Doyle\\" (his middle name) in hopes of driving off the injury curse that plagued him. ===Washington Nationals=== On the night of December 13, 2006, The Washington Post reported that Snelling and Mariners pitching prospect Emiliano Fruto would be traded to the Washington Nationals for veteran second baseman Jos√© Vidro. The trade was completed several days later. Following the Virginia Tech massacre, players for the Nationals wore Virginia Tech baseball caps for their game against the Atlanta Braves on April 17, 2007. Snelling's cap was then sent to the Hall of Fame in Cooperstown, New York. On the evening of May 2, 2007, during a game between the Nationals and San Diego Padres, Snelling was traded to the Oakland Athletics for outfielder Ryan Langerhans. ===Tampa Bay Devil Rays=== Snelling was claimed off waivers from the Athletics by the Tampa Bay Devil Rays on October 25, 2007. ===Philadelphia Phillies=== With a crowded outfield, the Rays traded Snelling to the Philadelphia Phillies for cash considerations on November 20, 2007. The Phillies sent him outright to the minors on March 28, 2008. On April 12, 2008, Snelling was recalled from the minor leagues by the Phillies after an injury to Shane Victorino. Despite getting only 4 AB, he had two very key hits for the Phillies who won the division by just three games. On April 15, he hit a pinch hit, first pitch HR off Houston Astros closer Jos√© Valverde in the 9th inning with his team down three runs.

He was designated for assignment on June 7. He spent most of the season with the Phillies' Triple-A affiliate, the Lehigh Valley IronPigs. ===San Diego Padres=== Snelling signed a minor league deal with San Diego Padres on March 14, 2009. ===Pittsburgh Pirates=== On June 10, 2009, Snelling was traded to the Pittsburgh Pirates for future considerations, but was released after Ryan Doumit was activated. He played the rest of the season with the Monterrey Sultanes in the Mexican League. ==International career== Although he was born in the United States, Snelling grew up in Australia and has played for the Australian national team. He selected at the 2009 World Baseball Classic, 2009 Baseball World Cup and 2013 World Baseball Classic.

Initially worn by choice, its wearing was enforced in some places in Europe after the 1215 Fourth Council of the Lateran for adult male Jews to wear while outside a ghetto to distinguish them from others. Like the Phrygian cap that it often resembles, the hat originated in pre-Islamic Persia, as a similar hat was worn by Babylonian Jews. Modern distinctive or characteristic Jewish forms of male headgear include the kippah (skullcap), shtreimel, spodik, kolpik, kashkets, and fedora; see also Hasidic headwear. ==EuropeShape=== The shape of the hat is variable. Sometimes, especially in the thirteenth century, it is a soft Phrygian cap, but rather more common in the early period is a hat with a round circular brim‚Äîapparently stiff‚Äîcurving round to a tapering top that ends in a point,For example as worn by the Old Testament figures on the Klosterneuburg Altar of 1181 called the \\"so-called oil-can type\\" by Sara Lipton.Lipton, 16 Smaller versions perching on top of the head are also seen. Sometimes a ring of some sort encircles the hat an inch or two over the top of the head. In the fourteenth century a ball or bobble appears at the top of the hat, and the tapering end becomes more of a stalk with a relatively constant width.Occasionally small straight \\"stalks\\" are seen earlier, e.g. Schreckenberg:77, illus 4, of c. 1170 The top of the hat becomes flatter, or rounded (as in the Codex Manesse picture). The materials used are unclear from art, and may have included metal and woven plant materials as well as stiffened textiles and leather. By the end of the Middle Ages the hat is steadily replaced by a variety of headgear including exotic flared Eastern style hats, turbans and, from the fifteenth century, wide flat hats and large berets. In pictures of Biblical scenes these sometimes represent attempts to portray the contemporary dress of the (modern) time worn in the Holy Land, but all the same styles are to be seen in some images of contemporary European scenes. Where a distinctive pointed Jewish hat remains it has become much less defined in shape, and baggy. Loose turbans, wide flat hats, and berets, as well as new fur hat styles from the Pale of Settlement, remain associated with Jews up to the eighteenth century and beyond. ===History=== German Jews of the twelfth century. From Herrad von Landsperg, Hortus deliciarum The origin of the hat is unclear, although it is often seen as ultimately evolving from the same origin as the mitre, perhaps from late Roman styles, which may themselves derive from the hats of ancient Persian clergy. Hats worn (by Pharaoh's advisors, among others) in the illustrations to the Old English Hexateuch, a manuscript of around 1030, have been seen as an early form, and they appear in the Mosan Stavelot Bible of 1097.Silverman, 55-56 In Europe, the Jewish hat was worn in France from the eleventh century, and Italy from the twelfth. The Gniezno Doors were probably made in Germany around 1175, and two Jewish merchants depicted on the doors wear them. Under Jewish law, observant Jews should keep their heads covered almost all the time,Although this may not yet have acquired the force of law at this period. See Roth op cit. and indeed men of all religious groups tended to wear hats when outside in the Middle Ages to a much greater extent than today.Silverman, 56 Unlike the yellow badge, the Jewish hat is often seen in illustrated Hebrew manuscripts, and was later included by German Jews in their seals and coats of arms, suggesting that at least initially it was regarded by European Jews as \\"an element of traditional garb, rather than an imposed discrimination\\".Piponnier and Mane, p. 138; Silverman, 57; Seals from Norman Roth, op cit. Also Schreckenburg p. 15 & passim. The hat is also worn in Christian pictures by figures such as Saint Joseph and sometimes Jesus (see below). However, once \\"made obligatory, the hat, hitherto deliberately different from hats worn by Christians, was viewed by Jews in a negative light\\".Piponnier & Mane, 138 (quoted) A provincial synod held in Breslau in 1267 said that since Jews had stopped wearing the pointed hats they used to wear, this would be made compulsory.Medieval Jewish History: An Encyclopedia. Edited by Norman Roth, Routledge The Fourth Council of the Lateran of 1215 ruled that Jews and Muslims must be distinguishable by their dress (Latin \\"habitus\\"), the rationale given being: \\"In some provinces the dress of Jews and Saracens distinguishes them from Christians, but in others a degree of confusion has arisen, so that they cannot be recognised by any distinguishing marks. As a result, in error Christians have sexual intercourse with Jewish or Saracen women, and Jews and Saracens have intercourse with Christian women. In order that the crime of such an accursed mingling shall not in future have an excuse and an evasion under the pretext of error, we resolve that (Jews and Saracens) of both sexes in all Christian lands shall distinguish themselves publicly from other people by their dress. According to the testimony of scripture, such a precept was already made by Moses (Lev.19.19; Deut.22.5.11)\\".Schreckenburg, p.15 ===Local regulations=== However, not all European medieval monarchs followed these pontifical resolutions. King Andrew II of Hungary (1177‚Äì1235), ignored on several occasions demands from the Pope, which gained him excommunication twice. At that time many Jews were in royal service. The excommunications even forbade Andrew II from being present at his daughter Elisabeth of Hungary's canonization in Germany.Feh√©r, J. (1967). Magyar K√∂z√©pkori Inkvizicio. Buenos Aires, Argentina: Editorial Transilvania. The hat was mostly found north of the Alps, despite some of the earliest examples being seen in Italy, and was not found in Spain. Additional rules were imposed by local rulers at various times. The council decision was confirmed by the Council of Vienne of 1311‚Äì12. In 1267 the hat was made compulsory in Vienna. A doctor was given a temporary dispensation from wearing it in Venice in 1528, at the request of various distinguished patients (at the time in Venice each profession had special clothing rules). Pope Paul IV ordered in 1555 that in the Papal States it must be a yellow, peaked hat, and from 1567 for twenty years it was compulsory in Lithuania, but by this period it is rarely seen in most of Europe.Papal Bull Cum nimis absurdum.

As an outcome of the Jewish Emancipation its use was formally discontinued, although it had been declining long before that, and is not often seen after 1500; the various forms of the yellow badge were far more long-lasting.Schreckenburg:288-296 This was an alternative form of distinguishing mark, not found in Europe before 1215, and later reintroduced by the Nazis. It was probably more widely required by local laws, for example English legislation concentrated on the badge, which took the form of the two Tablets of the Law. In some pictures from all parts of the Middle Ages, rabbis or other Jewish leaders wear the Jewish hat when other Jews do not, which may reflect reality.For example in the enigmatic illustrations to the Golden Haggadah of Darmstadt, of about 1300. See sacrifice illustration below also. In a late addition to local rulings, the very strict and unpopular Counter Reformation Pope Paul IV ordered in 1555 that all Jews in Rome were required to wear the yellow hat \\"under the severest penalties.\\" When he died, his statue, erected before the Campidoglio just months before, had a yellow hat placed on it (similar to the yellow hat Paul IV had forced Jews to wear in public). After a mock trial, the statue was decapitated. It was then thrown into the Tiber.

Often the Jews so shown are those shown in an unfavourable light by the story being depicted, such as the money-changers expelled by Jesus from the Temple (Matthew 21:12‚Äì17), but this is by no means always the case. The husband of Mary, Saint Joseph, is often shown wearing a Jewish hat, and Jesus himself may be shown wearing one, especially in depictions of the Meeting at Emmaus, where his disciples do not recognise him at first (Luke.24.13-32).Schreckenburg: 125‚Äì196. A twefth century English example is in the Getty Museum Sometimes it is used to distinguish Jews from other peoples such as Egyptians or Philistines. It is often depicted in art from times and places where the hat does not seem to have actually been commonly worn by Jews, \\"as an external and largely arbitrary sign devised by Christian iconographers\\", one of a number of useful visual ways of identifying types of persons in medieval art.Lipton, 16-19, 17 quoted In notable contrast to forms of Jewish badge, the Jewish hat is often seen in Hebrew manuscript illuminations such as Haggadot made in medieval Europe (picture above). In the Birds' Head Haggadah (Germany, c. 1300), the figures wear the hat when sitting to eat the Passover Seder.Meyer Schapiro, Selected Papers, volume 3, Late Antique, Early Christian and Mediaeval Art, pp. 380-86, 1980, Chatto & Windus, London, ; Lipton, 16-17 However, in Christian art the wearing of the hat can be sometimes be seen to express an attitude to those wearing it. In one extreme example in a manuscript of the Bible moralis√©e, an illustration shows the rod of Aaron, which has turned into a serpent, turning on the Pharaoh's magicians (Exodus, 7:10-12); Moses and Aaron do not wear the hat but the Egyptian magicians do, signifying not that they are Jews, but that they are like Jews, i.e. on the wrong side of the dispute. The paired roundel below shows two tonsured clerics confronting a group of hat-wearing Jews, and has a Latin caption explaining \\"Moses and Aaron signify good prelates who, in explaining the words of the Gospel, devour the false words of the Jews\\".Lipton, 18; the image is on folio 25c of Vienna ONB Codex 1179 Bible moralis√©e. In another scene showing the conversion of Jews and other non- Christians at the end of the world, a series of figures show different stages of removing their hats to signify the stages they have reached in their conversion, so that \\"the hat does not just identify Jews; it functions independently of its placement to signify infidelity and recalcitrant Jewishness\\".Lipton, 19; ONB Codex 1179, f. 181a Other scenes in Christian art where some characters often wear it include the Circumcision of Christ and Saint Helena Finding the True Cross, where the medieval legend specified a Jewish character. ==On coinage== Judenkopf Groschen William III the Brave (1425‚Äì1482) of Meissen, minted a silver groschen known as the Judenkopf Groschen. Its obverse portrait shows a man with a pointed beard wearing a Judenhut, which the populace took as depicting a typical Jew.Saurma no. 4386 ==Regulated dress for Jews in the Islamic world== For dhimmis to be clearly distinguishable from Muslims in public, Muslim rulers often prohibited dhimmis from wearing certain types of clothing, while forcing them to put on highly distinctive garments, usually of a bright colour. These included headgear, though this was not usually the primary element. At some times the regulated dress of Christians and Jews differed, at others it did not. As in Europe, the degree to which the recorded regulations were enforced is hard to assess, and probably varied greatly. Islamic scholars cited the Pact of Umar in which Christians supposedly took an obligation to \\"always dress in the same way wherever we may be, and‚Ä¶ bind the zunar [wide belt] round our waists\\". Al- Nawawi required dhimmis to wear a piece of yellow cloth and a belt, as well as a metallic ring, inside public baths.Al-Nawawi, Minhadj, quoted in p. 91 Regulations on dhimmi clothing varied frequently to please the whims of the ruler. Although the initiation of such regulations is usually attributed to Umar I, historical evidence suggests that it was the Abbasid caliphs who pioneered this practice. In 850 the caliph al‚ÄëMutawakkil ordered Christians and Jews to wear both a sash called a zunnah and a distinctive kind of shawl or headscarf called a taylasin (the Christians had already been required to wear the sash).Medieval Jewish History: An Encyclopedia. Edited by Norman Roth, Routledge He also required them to wear small bells in public baths. In the eleventh century, the Fatimid caliph Al-Hakim, whose various extreme decrees and actions are usually attributed to mental illness, ordered Christians to put on half-meter wooden crosses and Jews to wear wooden calves around their necks. In the late twelfth century, Almohad ruler Abu Yusuf ordered the Jews of the Maghreb to wear dark blue garments with long sleeves and saddle-like caps. His grandson Abdallah al-Adil made a concession after appeals from the Jews, relaxing the required clothing to yellow garments and turbans. In the sixteenth century, Jews of the Maghreb could only wear sandals made of rushes and black turbans or caps with an extra red piece of cloth.Bat Ye‚Äôor (2002), pp. 91‚Äì96 Ottoman sultans continued to regulate the clothing of their non-Muslim subjects. In 1577, Murad III issued a firman forbidding Jews and Christians from wearing dresses, turbans, and sandals. In 1580, he changed his mind, restricting the previous prohibition to turbans and requiring dhimmis to wear black shoes; Jews and Christians also had to wear red and black hats, respectively. Observing in 1730 that some Muslims took to the habit of wearing caps similar to those of the Jews, Mahmud I ordered the hanging of the perpetrators. Mustafa III personally helped to enforce his decrees regarding clothes. In 1758, he was walking incognito in Istanbul and ordered the beheading of a Jew and an Armenian seen dressed in forbidden attire. The last Ottoman decree affirming the distinctive clothing for dhimmis was issued in 1837 by Mahmud II. Discriminatory clothing was not enforced in those Ottoman provinces where Christians were the majority, such as Greece and the Balkans. ==See also== * Conical hat * Court Jew * Dhimmi laws * Ethnic segregation * Fulani hat * Ghetto, Melah * List of hats and headgear * Ottoman Millet system * Tembel hat * Yellow badge * Clothing laws by country ==NotesReferences== :Parts of this article are translated from :de:Judenhut of 13 July 2005 * Judenhut at the Jewish Encyclopaedia * Lipton, Sara, Images of Intolerance: The Representation of Jews and Judaism in the Bible moralis√©e, 1999, University of California Press, , 9780520215511, Amazon preview * Fran√ßoise Piponnier and Perrine Mane; Dress in the Middle Ages, Yale UP, 1997; * Roth, Norman, \\"Was There a \\"Jewish Hat\\"?\\" * Schreckenburg, Heinz, The Jews in Christian Art, 1996, Continuum, New York, * Silverman, Eric, A Cultural History of Jewish Dress, 2013, A&C; Black, , 9781847882868, google books ==Further reading== * Straus Raphael, The \\"Jewish Hat\\" as an Aspect of Social History, Jewish Social Studies, Vol. 4, No. 1 (Jan., 1942), pp. 59‚Äì72, Indiana University Press. . ==External links== * PBS feature * Website in German with many illustrations Category:Hats Category:Jewish religious clothing Category:Medieval costume ","title":"Jewish hat"},{"id":"2223638","text":"Go For Wand (April 6, 1987 - October 27, 1990) was a champion American thoroughbred racehorse. Go For Wand was sired by Canadian Hall of Famer Deputy Minister, out of Obeah (winner of, among other races, the Blue Hen Stakes, and the Delaware Handicap twice). She was foaled and raised at Jane du Pont Lunger's Christiana Stables. As a two-year-old, she had a record of three-for- four before winning the 1989 Breeders' Cup Juvenile Fillies. Her performances earned her the 1989 Eclipse Award for Outstanding Two-Year-Old Filly. As a three-year-old, she was seven-for-nine and was voted the 1990 Eclipse Award for Outstanding Three-Year-Old Filly. In 1990 at Belmont Park she ran against the Argentinian mare Bayakoa in the Breeders' Cup Distaff. Go For Wand was leading by a head at the sixteenth pole when she suffered an open fracture to her right cannon bone. She fell to the track and threw jockey Randy Romero to the ground before rising to limp on three legs. Track personnel caught her and got her to lie down, and she was immediately euthanized on the track. The next day, she was buried in the infield at Saratoga racetrack. Like the death of Ruffian at the same track, the accident was shown by NBC on live television, and reminded viewers of that promising filly who was fatally injured on the track. Several veterinarians estimate that she broke her leg about twelve strides before she fell, which would mean that she suffered her catastrophic injury while passing the flagpole next to which Ruffian was buried. In 1992, the Maskette Stakes, a Grade 1 handicap race for fillies and mares, was renamed the \\"Go For Wand Handicap\\" in her memory. She is listed as #72 by Blood Horse on their list of top 100 U.S. thoroughbred champions of the 20th Century and in 1996 was inducted into the National Museum of Racing and Hall of Fame.

During Campbell's tenure with the Pistons, perhaps his most important contribution was his defense against center Shaquille O'Neal in the two playoff series in which the Pistons engaged O'Neal's teams (against the Lakers in the 2004 Finals and against the Miami Heat in the 2005 NBA Eastern Conference Finals);Little-used Campbell plays big vs. Shaq because of his enormous bulk and strength, he presented a unique challenge to O'Neal in the low post and was one of the few NBA players who could pose a serious physical challenge to O'Neal on defense.

The film stars Shirley MacLaine and Anne Bancroft, along with Leslie Browne, Mikhail Baryshnikov, and Tom Skerritt. The film was nominated for eleven Academy Awards, including Best Picture. The script is a fictionalized version of the real-life Brown family and the friendship between ballerinas Isabel Mirrow Brown (whose daughter, Leslie Browne, stars in the film) and Nora Kaye. ==Plot== DeeDee Rodgers (Shirley MacLaine) leaves the ballet company after becoming pregnant by Wayne (Tom Skerritt), another dancer in the company. They marry and later move to Oklahoma City to run a dance studio. Emma Jacklin (Anne Bancroft) stays with the company and eventually becomes a prima ballerina and well-known figure in the ballet community. While the company is on tour and performs a show in Oklahoma City, DeeDee and the family go to see the show, and then have an after-party for the company at her home. The reunion stirs up old memories and things begin to unravel. At the party, DeeDee's aspiring dancer/daughter, Emilia (Leslie Browne), who is also Emma's goddaughter, is invited to take class with the company the following day. After taking class with the company, Emilia is asked to join the company but she does not immediately accept the offer as she wants to think it over before making her final decision. DeeDee and Wayne decide that DeeDee should go to New York with Emilia, who is rather shy and does not make friends as easily as her younger sister. Meanwhile, their son, Ethan, gets a scholarship to the company's summer program while Wayne and their other daughter stay in Oklahoma City. Once in New York, they rent several rooms in Carnegie Hall with Madame Dakharova, a ballet coach. Emilia soon starts a relationship with a Russian playboy in the company, Yuri (Mikhail Baryshnikov). DeeDee runs into the former conductor of the company and has an affair with him, which causes conflict between Emilia and DeeDee. Meanwhile, Emma argues with Arnold, the choreographer, about giving her a better role in his new ballet, which he refuses and leads Emma to suggest Emilia for the role instead. It is also revealed Emma has been seeing a married man, Carter. During rehearsal, Emilia has an argument with Arnold and storms out, going to a bar and getting drunk. She then shows up for the performance that night still drunk and Emma takes care of her, which angers DeeDee. Emilia suffers when she sees Yuri getting involved with another dancer, Carolyn. Emma and DeeDee eventually enter into major conflict. DeeDee resents that Emma dotes on Emilia, when she has criticized DeeDee for choosing family life over her career while Emma chose not to have children. DeeDee accuses Emma of telling her to get pregnant and have Wayne's baby so Emma could play the lead in Anna Karenina, which Emma later admits is true. Eventually, misunderstandings are settled, with Emma and DeeDee working things out after a physical altercation. Emilia is announced as the star of the next season, and she and Yuri make up and agree to a professional partnership and nothing more. Deedee decides she is content with her life and the decision she made to leave professional ballet to have a family. Emma accepts that her performing days are numbered and she must embrace a different role within the company. DeeDee and Emma step onto the stage and reminisce together. ==Cast== *Shirley MacLaine as DeeDee Rodgers ‚Äì a former ballerina with the company (based on Isabel Mirrow) *Anne Bancroft as Emma Jacklin ‚Äì an aging prima ballerina (based on Nora Kaye) *Tom Skerritt as Wayne Rodgers ‚Äì a former dancer with the company, married to DeeDee (based on Kelly Brown) *Leslie Browne as Emilia Rodgers ‚Äì a young ballerina beginning professional training and becoming a woman (based on herself) *Mikhail Baryshnikov as Yuri Kopeikine ‚Äì Emilia's playboy love interest *Martha Scott as Adelaide ‚Äì a former dancer, now head of the company (based on Lucia Chase) *James Mitchell as Michael Cooke ‚Äì the company artistic director (based on Jerome Robbins) *Alexandra Danilova as Madame Dakharova ‚Äì a ballet coach *Lisa Lucas as Janina Rodgers ‚Äì sister of Emilia (based on Elizabeth Brown) *Philip Saunders as Ethan Rodgers ‚Äì brother of Emilia who takes ballet himself (based on Ethan Brown) *Antoinette Sibley as Sevilla Haslam ‚Äì a rival ballerina *Marshall Thompson as Carter ‚Äì a married man Emma is dating *Starr Danias as Carolyn ‚Äì a rival ballerina that Yuri leaves Emilia for *Anthony Zerbe as Joe \\"Rosie\\" Rosenberg ‚Äì a married former conductor of the company who DeeDee has an affair with *Daniel Levans as Arnold Berger ‚Äì a headstrong choreographer with the company A number of actresses were offered the roles of Emma and DeeDee, including Audrey Hepburn, Grace Kelly, and Doris Day. Bancroft had no previous dance experience, while MacLaine had started her career as a dancer of ballet and other types. She appeared on Broadway performing in the musicals Me and Juliet and The Pajama Game. The title \\"The Turning Point\\" is a double entendre, meaning a big change in a person's life and being on pointe. Choreography for the film was done by Alvin Ailey and George Balanchine. ==Background== Isabel Mirrow Brown and Nora Kaye were childhood friends. Their parents had immigrated from Russia around the same time and they lived in the same New York City brownstone building. Kaye was a few years older than Mirrow and encouraged her to train. Nora Kaye was in a relationship with Jerome Robbins in the early 1950s, but they never married, focusing on their careers instead. Robbins was also a known bisexual. Isabel Mirrow danced with the American Ballet Theatre from 1947 until 1953. Nora was with the company from its inception in 1939 until 1951, and later returned in a leadership role. Unlike the film, Isabel did not get pregnant while she was with the company; however, during this time Isabel married fellow dancer Kelly Brown, who was widely sought after. Lucia Chase was the head of the company when Isabel and Nora were there. Kaye continued to dance in New York with other companies and became a more prominent figure in the ballet world, while Isabel had stopped performing to marry and have children. Their first child, Leslie Browne, born in 1957, was Nora Kaye's goddaughter. Kaye went on to marry director Herbert Ross in 1959. The two couples were close friends, along with Arthur Laurents. Kelly Brown, Ross, Kaye, and Laurents all worked together in the Broadway musical I Can Get It for You Wholesale in 1962. In his autobiography, Laurents wrote that in the 1940s he had a sexual relationship with Nora Kaye. In 1965, an opportunity to run a dance studio opened up, and Kelly Brown decided to move his family to Phoenix, Arizona (changed to Oklahoma City in the film). By this time he and his wife had aged out of performing. Isabel Mirrow Brown was not thrilled to leave her native New York for Arizona, and the move caused strain in their marriage. When their daughter Leslie auditioned and was accepted to train back in New York in the School of American Ballet (SAB), Isabel moved back to New York to watch over Leslie, who was still a teenager. The film depicts Isabel's experience entering back into the dance world after living in Phoenix and having four children (three in the film). In real life she eventually divorced Kelly Brown, who died in 1981 at age 52. While in Arizona the Browns had kept in touch with their friends Nora and Herbert. Later in the mid 1970s, a script based on the Brown family was developed by Arthur Laurents. Ross directed the film and co-produced with his wife. Ross, Laurents, and Kaye never had children and took a special interest in Leslie Browne as she grew older. The script was a fictionalized version of the Browns' life and the long friendship between Isabel and Nora. The fictional parts primarily concern the character Yuri, who was created as a love interest for Emilia. Originally, the ballerina Gelsey Kirkland, who was at the height of her fame at the time and dating Mikhail Baryshnikov (Yuri), was offered the role of Emilia. She rejected the role as she was dealing with substance abuse issues at the time and she \\"wanted no part of Hollywood\\". Ross then decided that Leslie Browne, who was nineteen at the time, would be able to portray a fictionalized version of herself in the film. In real life, Leslie had just joined ABT in 1976 and was experiencing the same things she portrayed on screen. Leslie had added an \\"e\\" to her last name as her stage name to sound more feminine after being mistaken as a man in a playbill. The script changed the family name from Brown to Rodgers, and all the first names except for their son Ethan Brown. The real-life Ethan Brown later became a principal dancer with the American Ballet Theatre, retiring from performing in 2004; he now teaches. In real life, the Browns had another son, Kelly Brown II, who danced as a child but did not train professionally like his siblings and later became a film producer. Their other daughter, Elizabeth Brown (born 1959), was also a dancer, unlike in the film, and was accepted into SAB a year after Leslie. Nora Kaye died of cancer in 1987 at age 67. After the film, Leslie Browne went on to become principal dancer with the American Ballet Theatre in New York City from 1986 until 1993 and now teaches ballet. Her mother Isabel continued to be associated with New York Ballet and she died in August 2014 at the age of 86. Herbert Ross later directed two more dance-themed films, Nijinsky (1980) and Dancers (1987), both of which also feature Leslie Browne. Arthur Laurents claimed an important subplot regarding Wayne's homosexuality in the original script was cut from the film by Herbert Ross and his wife. This was the reason why Wayne's character's development does not progress steadily throughout the film. ==Reception== Vincent Canby of The New York Times called it the film an \\"entertaining new movie, an old-fashioned backstage musical transplanted to the world of ballet by three people who not only know it but also love it, sentimental clich√©s and all.\\"Canby, Vincent (November 15, 1977). \\"'Turning Point' Limns Ballet Life\\". The New York Times. 48. Arthur D. Murphy of Variety declared it \\"one of the best films of this era.

Variety. 25. Gene Siskel of the Chicago Tribune gave the film three-and-a-half stars out of four and wrote, \\"In a movie year that will be remembered as the year of the science-fiction special effect, it is refreshing to see a film such as 'The Turning Point,' which offers another kind of excitement: the pleasure of following a story you can't easily anticipate.\\"Siskel, Gene (November 18, 1977). \\"MacLaine excels in choice 'Point'\\". Chicago Tribune. Section 2, p. 3. Charles Champlin of the Los Angeles Times stated, \\"The performances by Bancroft and MacLaine are stunning, and both are at Academy Award level ...

Los Angeles Times. Calendar, p. 40. Gary Arnold of The Washington Post called the film \\"enormously appealing\\" and \\"an authentic breakthrough-throwback: a vividly enacted depiction of the conflicts between strong, capable, conscious, willful women.\\"Arnold, Gary (November 13, 1977). \\"The Turning Point\\". The Washington Post. L1. Pauline Kael of The New Yorker wrote, \\"As a device, the turning point (like that synthetic summer when adolescent heroes grow into men) is so mechanical it's an exposed construction ...

The New Yorker 212. The film currently holds a score of 65% on Rotten Tomatoes based on 26 reviews, with an average rating of 6.23/10. The consensus reads, \\"The Turning Point is a handsomely-made resuscitation of Old Hollywood melodramas with a compelling duo at its center, but the formulaic script keeps this story from realizing its symphonic potential.\\" ==Awards and nominations== The film was nominated for 11 Academy Awards, but despite those nominations, the film won no awards. Along with The Color Purple, it shares the record of receiving the most Oscar nominations without a single win. { class=\\" plainrowheaders\\" - ! Award ! Category ! Nominee(s) !

His work was influenced by James McNeill Whistler, and he is best known for his landscapes and seascapes painted in a tonalist style. ==Biography== Tryon was born in Hartford, Connecticut, to Anson Tryon and Delia O. Roberts. His father was killed in a gun accident before Tryon reached four years of age, and Tryon was raised by his mother on his grandparents' farm in East Hartford. His interest in art evolved naturally. As a young man Tryon took a job at a prominent Hartford bookstore and studied art instruction manuals from the store shelves. He also took to sketching the surrounding countryside during his off hours. Tryon sold his first painting in 1870. After exhibiting and selling work locally, he successfully exhibited at the National Academy of Design in 1873. His artistic convictions affirmed, Tryon married Alice Belden, quit his job at the bookstore and became a full-time artist. Some of his first works from this period are seascapes and harbor views executed in a luminist manner. Soon after, however, Tryon's style shifted towards the Barbizon school, which was then becoming popular among American artists. He may have been influenced by the works of George Inness and Alexander Helwig Wyant. In 1876 Tryon decided to advance his skills through a formal study of art. He sold all of his paintings at auction and, with the help of a benefactor, traveled to France with his wife. He enrolled in the atelier of Jacquesson de la Chevreuse, and took classes at the √âcole des Beaux-Arts. He also received instruction from Charles-Fran√ßois Daubigny, Henri Harpignies, and Jean Baptiste-Antoine Guillemet. Impressionism was blossoming in France all around Tryon, but he was not swayed by the new style and remained comfortably within the realm of the Barbizon school. Tryon traveled and sketched Europe with his wife, and met Abbott Handerson Thayer and his wife with whom he became friends. He returned to the United States in 1881 and settled in New York City where he taught and painted landscapes. In New York, Tryon became friends with artists Robert Swain Gifford and Thomas Dewing. He became an early member of the Society of American Artists and continued to exhibit paintings to the National Academy of Design. He also became a member of the American Water Color Society and the National Institute of Arts and Letters (now The American Academy of Arts and Letters). On the advice of Gifford, Tryon and his wife built a summer house in South Dartmouth, Massachusetts in 1887. Though he would continue to spend each winter in New York City, South Dartmouth became Tryon's home for the rest of his life. The coastal area appealed to Tryon's aesthetic sensibilities and allowed him to indulge in fishing, his favorite pastime. By the late 1880s Tryon, working most often in oils, began painting landscapes in what would become his mature and iconic style. Tryon's paintings typically feature a group or broken row of trees in the middle distance, often colored in an autumnal hue, separating a glowing sky above and a foreground marsh or pasture below. He also continued to paint the sea in his mature career, often employing pastel to show a bare expanse of water, sky and beach in various weather and light. He exhibited his works nationally but tended to favor The Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts in Philadelphia and the Montross Gallery in New York. A Detroit industrialist, Charles Lang Freer, first bought a painting by Tryon in 1889 and became his most important patron. Freer eventually bought dozens of Tryon's paintings, including many of his best works, and worked closely with Tryon in the interior design of his Detroit home. Freer, a major collector of Asian art and works by James McNeill Whistler, went on to establish the Freer Gallery of Art, part of the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, DC, where many works by Tryon can be seen today. He took the first prize for his painting Salt-Marsh, December at the Tennessee Centennial Exposition that was held in Nashville, Tennessee in 1897. He is described in the \\"Fine Art Catalogue\\" which is copyrighted by Theodore Cooley as follows: \\"William Tryon is an American landscape painter whose pictures are greatly sought for their delicacy of coloring and refinement of feeling. A pupil of Daubdigny, he is, like that artist, a painter of country life - the idyllic rusticity of apple trees in bloom, of waving cornfields, of shining valleys and streams rippling gently to the sea. He is especially fine in the silvery- gray atmosphere.\\" He went on to win the Carnegie Prize at the Carnegie Exhibition of 1908 at the Carnegie Museum of Art. In addition to his painting, Tryon taught at Smith College from 1886 to 1923, visiting part-time to critique students' work and, late in his career, establishing the Tryon Gallery of Art. He died of cancer in South Dartmouth on July 1, 1925. == Papers == Dwight William Tryon's papers can be found at the Freer Gallery of Art and Arthur M. Sackler Gallery Archives in Washington, D.C. Charles Lang Freer, founder of the Freer Gallery of Art, was a primary patron of Tryon. The collection includes correspondence, photographs, a sketchbook, and newspaper clippings. ==Works by Tryon== Image:Self portrait dwight william tryon.jpegSelf Portrait, 1918 Image:Autumn_new_england_dwight_william_tryon.jpegAutumn: New England Image:After sunset looking east dwight william tryon.jpegAfter Sunset: Looking East File:Brooklyn Museum - Apple Blossoms - Dwight William Tryon - overall.jpgApple Blossoms, Brooklyn Museum * Glastonbury Meadows, 1881 * Cerney La Ville, 1881 * Landscape: A Lighted Village, 1887, Freer Gallery of Art, Washington, D.C.

Ihsan (  æi·∏•sƒÅn, also romanized ehsan), is an Arabic term meaning \\"beautification\\", \\"perfection\\" or \\"excellence\\" (Ara. husn, meaning: beauty). It is a matter of taking one's inner faith (iman) and showing it in both deed and action, a sense of social responsibility borne from religious convictions. In Islam, ihsan is the Muslim responsibility to obtain perfection, or excellence, in worship, such that Muslims try to worship God as if they see Him, and although they cannot see him, they undoubtedly believe that He is constantly watching over them. That definition comes from the Hadith of Gabriel in which Muhammad states, \\"[Ihsan is] to worship God as though you see Him, and if you cannot see Him, then indeed He sees you\\". (Al-Bukhari and Al-Muslim).Mahmoud M. Ayoub, Islam: Faith and History, pp. 68‚Äì69 According to prophet Muhammad Hadith \\"God has written Ihsan on everything\\". Ihsan, meaning \\"to do beautiful things\\", is one of the three dimensions of the Islamic religion (Ara. ad-din): islam, iman and ihsan. In contrast to the emphases of islam (what one should do) and iman (why one should do), the concept of ihsan is primarily associated with intention. One who \\"does what is beautiful\\" is called a muhsin. It is generally held that a person can only achieve true ihsan with the help and guidance of God, who governs all things. While traditionally Islamic jurists have concentrated on Islam and theologians on Iman, the Sufis have focused their attention on Ihsan.Sufism. William C. Chittick. . Page 9 Some Islamic scholars explain ihsan as being the inner dimension of Islam whereas shariah is often described as the outer dimension: > From the preceding discussion it should be clear that not every Muslim is a > man or woman of faith (mu'min), but every person of faith is a muslim. > Furthermore, a Muslim who believes in all the principles of Islam may not > necessarily be a righteous person, a doer of good (muhsin), but a truly good > and righteous person is both a muslim and a true person of faith.Mahmoud M. > Ayoub, Islam: Faith and History, p. 54 Ihsan \\"constitutes the highest form of worship\\" (ibadah). It is excellence in work and in social interactions. For example, ihsan includes sincerity during Muslim prayers and being grateful to parents, family, and God. ==ReferencesFurther reading== * *The Mysteries of Ihsan: Natural Contemplation and the Spiritual Virtues in the Quran by James W.

Eldritch: \\"The next Sisters album was going to be called 'Left On Mission and Revenge'.\\"Andrew Eldritch TV interview (SkyTrax programme on Sky Channel late 1987) Singer Andrew Eldritch saw the time ripe for a change of direction: \\"I always wanted to do something different, because whatever we did it all eventually sounded the same.\\" Markus Hartmann: \\"...and the wind blows wild again...\\" (Zillo November 1990, page 12) \\"I wanted to find out how to record songs without any rock structures and especially without guitars.\\"\\"Gruft is in the heart\\". Sebastian Zabel: (SPEX December 1990) Together with guitarist Wayne Hussey Eldritch went to Hamburg-Bramfeld during August and September 1985 Ute Arndt, Bernd Gerstacker, Thomas Duff√©: \\"St. Pauli ‚Äì Gesichter und Ansichten vom Kiez\\" (Historika Photoverlag 1995) to compose new material. Wayne Hussey: \\"I went to Hamburg for a month with Andrew to try and write songs for the second Sisters album, and we came back with all my ideas rejected and Andrew's very skeletal.\\" Neil Perry, Greg Freeman: \\"The Adams/Hussey Story\\" (Sounds magazine 22 February 1986) \\"Andrew rejected all my songs and let me work on one single chord all the time: 'Here's my song ‚Äì E minor!\\"Michael Ruff: \\"The Mission ‚Äì Stock it!\\" (SPEX, March 1987, page 16) Back in England the band came together to rehearsals in October 1985, but the musical differences had become irreconcilable. Wayne Hussey: \\"We got to doing the second album and Andrew said 'I'm not singing any of your songs.'\\" Neil Perry, Greg Freeman: \\"The Adams/Hussey Story\\". Sounds, 22 February 1986 Eldritch: \\"Then they said 'Well, okay, what are we gonna do for new songs?' And I said 'How about this, this and this' and, unfortunately, the first 'this' I cited had too many chords per minute and Craig said 'If that's the guitar line, I'm not playing it' and walked out. That was really that.\\"Steve Sutherland: \\"His Master's Voice\\" Melody Maker, 5 September 1987 \\"The others didn't want to play my new songs, such as 'Torch' for instance. [...] The song has some unusual chord changes. Craig thought it was crap, he said 'I'm not playing it, I'm going home.' And there he stayed.\\"\\"Flucht aus der Gruft\\". Sven Niechziol: ME/Sounds February 1988 Hussey: \\"Craig walked out of rehearsal and a day later I did.\\" Neil Perry, Greg Freeman: \\"The Adams/Hussey Story\\" (in: Sounds magazine 22 February 1986) The music press reported the break-up of the band on Saturday, 2 November 1985: \\"The Sisters of Mercy were down to singer Andrew Eldritch and his faithful drum machine Doktor Avalanche this week after guitarist Wayne Hussey and bassist Craig Adams left the band. Although this has scuppered recording plans for a new album this month, Andrew now intends to record the same album in the New Year and could well be using Wayne as a session guitarist. The split was described as 'friendly' by a Merciful Release spokesperson. 'The clich√© of musical differences would not be inappropriate. Wayne and Craig were unable to comprehend the direction the band was going.' Andrew has also approached former Gun Club bassist Patricia Morrison ‚Äì now in Fur Bible ‚Äì to play on the album, but it's not yet known whether Andrew will continue with the name Sisters of Mercy. Wayne and Craig are now reported to be getting their own band together.\\"Sounds, 2 November 1985 (page 4) Andrew Eldritch: \\"The people that are now the Mission and myself had an agreement, no one would use the name when the band went its separate ways.\\"\\"His Master's Voice\\". Steve Sutherland: (Melody Maker, 5 September 1987) \\"The band was good and successful, each of us could continue. The split came at a time when it wouldn't do us any damage.\\" == \\"Giving Ground\\" single (January 1986) == On the very same day Eldritch made a phone call to bassist Patricia Morrison whose band Fur Bible was on a UK tour with Siouxsie and the Banshees at the time, and asked her to play on his planned album. Morrison: \\"The day they fell apart he called me and said 'Will you do it?' and I said yes. [...] We had some tours set up, so I waited until that was cleared, then left.\\" Steve Sutherland: \\"Sister Midnight\\" (Melody Maker magazine 4 June 1988, page 14) Hussey and Adams, who like Eldritch remained under contract with WEA Records, booked some studio time at Slaughterhouse Recording Studios in Driffield at the end of October 1985, recorded a four-song demo tape, and set up a new band. But the demo tape was rejected by the record company who were not convinced by Hussey's singing talents.Martin Roach, Neil Perry: \\"The Mission ‚Äì Names Are For Tombstones Baby\\" (Independent Music Press 1993, page 49) Eldritch went into the studio at the tail end of 1985 to produce the debut single of James Ray and the Performance for his Merciful Release label. \\"Mexico Sundown Blues\\"\\"/\\"Edie Segdwick\\" (Merciful Release June 1986) James Ray: \\"The Sisterhood project arose during the recording of 'Mexico Sundown Blues'.\\" James Ray interview. Heartland.co.uk, September 2005 While Eldritch was in the studio, Hussey and Adams, who had taken over the Sisters' roadcrew and equipment, announced their debut concert for 20 January 1986, which they were going to play under the new name the Sisterhood. Eldritch was alarmed: \\"They began to claim rights to [the Sisters name], which patently had to be stopped. And when they wanted to be called the Sisterhood, there was nothing I could do but be the Sisterhood before them ‚Äì the only way to kill that name was to use it, then kill it.\\" \\"Warners thought they could have two bands on the same label with pretty much the same name.\\"Andrew Eldritch radio interview (Andrew Collins Show, BBC 6 Music 17 April 2003) Eldritch decided to secure the rights to the Sisterhood name as quickly as possible. He registered a company under the nameThe Sisterhood Limited, 19 All Saints Road, London W11 (Companies House company no. 01959298) and prepared a record to be released on his own label. In only five days Eldritch recorded a song called \\"Giving Ground,\\" which he co-wrote with Merciful Release manager Boyd Steemson and co- produced with Lucas Fox. Fox and Eldritch had met in the spring of 1985, when Fox was the stand-in drummer for Australian support band the Scientists on the Sisters of Mercy's UK tour. Eldritch recorded all instruments himself (guitar, bass, synthesizers and drum programming), while Fox programmed some additional percussion tracks. Neil Spencer, Martyn Strickland: \\"The Eldritch Story\\" (in: Sounds magazine 22 February 1986) The single contained two different mixes of the song, Eldritch's original instrumental \\"Giving Ground (AV)\\" (5:45 min) on the b-side and the vocal remix \\"Giving Ground (RSV)\\" (4:50 min) on the a-side. 'AV' and 'RSV' are explained on the official Sisters of Mercy website this way: \\"The 'Authorised Version' of 'Giving Ground' is Andrew's original version, and the 'Revised Standard Version' is the version developed by colleagues at Merciful Release and subsequently adopted as the standard version. 'AV' and 'RSV' are well-known versions of the Bible.\\"FAQ. thesistersofmercy.com (as on 7 December 2000) Because Eldritch, as an artist, was under contract to WEA Records, he could not sing on the record, otherwise WEA would have had an option on the recording. James Ray: \\"He asked me and I did the vocals, as easy as that\\". Markus Hartmann: \\"James Rays Gangwar\\" (Zillo magazin July 1992, page 24) Merciful Release announced the single's release with a press statement: \\"From among the forces allied to Merciful Release we bring you the Sisterhood. capturing (in this instance) the musical bile of Andrew Eldritch, and introducing James Ray and the Performance ... of whom more soon.\\" The single was released as planned on 20 January 1986, the same day that Hussey and Adams played their debut concert in London as the Sisterhood. The press hype about the two conflicting parties made the single enter the UK Indie Chart on 8 February, where it got to no. 1 on 15 February 1986. The reviews in the music press were unanimously negative, and even James Ray later declared: \\"It's a terrible track.\\" James Ray-Interview. Heartland.co.uk, September 2005 Hussey and Adams had to give up the Sisterhood name. A radio session for the Janice Long Evening Show on BBC Radio 1 on 10 February was broadcast under the provisional name of the Wayne Hussey and Craig Adams Band, and at the end of February 1986 the new name the Mission was announced. Another Eldritch press release commented: \\"We assume that their choice of name is entirely unconnected with the forthcoming Andrew Eldritch album that for some months has had the working title Left on Mission and Revenge.\\" On 2 March 1986 the Mission played in Birmingham. Wayne Hussey: \\"The majority of the songs we've been doing in the set so far are my songs that Andrew rejected for the Sisters' second album. It's ironic cos he saw us at Birmingham and told us how good he thought the songs were.\\" Martin Roach, Neil Perry: \\"The Mission ‚Äì Names Are For Tombstones Baby\\" (Independent Music Press 1993, page 38) == \\"This Corrosion\\" 12 inch EP (spring 1986, unreleased) == Sounds magazine reported on 20 February 1986 that \\"a new 12-inch EP called 'This Corrosion' will soon be in the shops, featuring the same line-up but with the addition of a mysterious and so far undisclosed American vocalist.\\" Neil Spencer, Martyn Strickland: \\"The Eldritch Story\\" (Sounds magazine 22 February 1986) This 12 inch single even appeared in German music paper adverts as \\"available soon\\".SPEX magazine (April 1986, page 43) (May 1986, page 43) James Ray: \\"So during the recording of ['Mexico Sundown Blues'] we made and released 'Giving Ground'. We then spent weeks on what was to be the Sisterhood's second single, 'This Corrosion', but Eldritch decided he was going to use it to kickstart the Sisters Mk II.\\" \\"Interview [1]: James Ray\\" (Glasperlenspiel 06 fanzine June 2003, page 6) Recording took place at Fairview Studios near Hull with in-house engineer John Spence. American vocalist Alan Vega, who had made friends with the Sisters of Mercy in 1983,Paul O'Reilly: \\"The Truth is Known\\" (ZigZag, October 1983) and undertook a solo tour through the UK and Europe during February and March 1986, recorded one version of the song, other vocal takes featuring James Ray and Andrew Eldritch are in existence as well. The projected 12 inch EP remained unreleased, instead the song \\"This Corrosion\\" in 1987 became the Sisters of Mercy's comeback single. == Gift album (July 1986) == In March 1986, the Mission began negotiations with Phonogram Ltd. as WEA Records refused to release any material. So the band released the October 1985 demo tape in slightly re-recorded form as an independent single on 9 May 1986. The single (its b-side was titled \\"Wake (RSV)\\" as a nod to \\"Giving Ground (RSV)\\") promptly entered the UK Indie Chart at no. 1. WEA Records had to release the Mission from their contract. Both Andrew Eldritch and the Mission still had a publishing contract with RCA Records from their days in the Sisters of Mercy. A sum of ¬£25,000 for one studio album was payable for the year of 1986 in an Advance against royalties deal, so RCA decided to split up the money to the two concerned parties. version of events on official Sisters website (as on 8 February 2000) Eldritch decided to claim the whole sum for himself by being first to compose, produce and release a studio album, much in the same way as he did with the \\"Giving Ground\\" single. Again he didn't appear as a vocalist, so he could release the album on his own label without having to offer it to WEA Records: \\"They thought it was great that I called myself the Sisterhood while they still had the Sisters of Mercy, so they didn't have to back me at all. I had to put out the album on Merciful Release, but it gave me free rein.\\" Michael Ruff: \\"Prinz der Feuchtgebiete\\" (SPEX magazine January 1988) Eldritch and Lucas Fox returned to Fairview Studios. Merciful Release office manager Boyd Steemson: \\"Basically, we had some extra tracks around, so Andrew quickly put some songs together.\\" Ken McIntyre: \\"The Sisterhood\\" (Classic Rock magazine July 2007, page 61) James Ray: \\"I wasn't involved too much with the album, as it was taking ages for Eldritch to formulate any concrete ideas, and I wanted to be writing my own stuff. I personally think the album transpired to cash in on the sales of the single.\\" \\"Giving Ground\\" was included as an extended remix on the album, the only track featuring James Ray. James Ray: \\"Lucas Fox done the spoken word stuff.\\" \\"If I remember correctly I advised Andrew on how Lucas Fox should approach his vocals and that was quite enough for me.\\" Lucas Fox does the vocal parts on \\"Colours\\", \\"Finland Red, Egypt White\\" and \\"Rain from Heaven\\". The text of \\"Finland Red, Egypt White\\" comes from an arms dealer's catalogue for the AK-47 rifle, while the title cites the country code for blank cartridges. James Ray remembers Norman Cook (AKA Fatboy Slim), then bassist of local band the Housemartins, having done a mix of the track that remains unreleased. \\"Rain from Heaven\\" with its choral singing seems to have been one of the tracks Eldritch intended for the Left on Mission and Revenge album, as he later mentioned how \\"Wayne and Craig had said those choral singings were insane.\\" Patricia Morrison got her first opportunity to collaborate with Eldritch, but her only verified contribution to the album is one spoken passage on the opening track \\"Jihad\\". Eldritch: \\"So I asked Patricia to come to the studio and told her: 'Speak this ‚Äì Two-Five-Zero-Zero- Zero'. It took the Mission two months to realise the meaning of those words.

He was possibly part of the \\"Chorus of Vengeance\\" on the track \\"Rain from Heaven\\". In July 1986 Eldritch put the album out on his Merciful Release label to unanimously negative press reactions. The album did not accomplish its purpose, as RCA Records dissolved the publishing contract with Eldritch and decided to keep the Mission instead. Tony Perrin, the Mission's manager: \\"I think Eldritch perpetuated it longer than anyone else bothered. We'd still get letters from his lawyers ages after but nothing would ever come of it. The whole thing cost us legal bills and that's all, the rumours about big losses by us were all rubbish, it was never going to court.\\" Martin Roach, Neil Perry: \\"The Mission ‚Äì Names Are For Tombstones Baby\\" (Independent Music Press 1993, page 44) Andrew Eldritch later said about the album: \\"The Sisterhood album was a weapon in this corporate war. That's why I called it Gift. [in German: poison] [...] But I still like the record. It's weird but it's fine.\\" \\"I see it as a techno record.

He worked in oils and watercolors, often depicting scenes of rural life in Canada. He was influenced by the French Barbizon school of painting. ==Life and workEarly life=== Horatio Walker's Watching the Turkeys, not dated. Walker was born in 1858 to parents Thomas and Jeanne Maurice Walker. Thomas Walker emigrated in 1856 from Yorkshire, England, to Listowel, Ontario, with his wife of French and English heritage. Having some wealth, Thomas purchased land for lumber in Midwestern Ontario and Horatio was raised in relative comfort. His interest in art may originate from his father who crafted small figures as a hobby, and both his father and the local school teacher encouraged drawing as a pastime.Farr, 11. In 1870, on Walker's 12th birthday, his father brought him to Quebec City, Quebec, for the first time. His father made occasional business trips to the city as part of his timber business. During this sojourn, they visited the √éle d'Orl√©ans, in search of pine timber. Walker made subsequent visits to Quebec City during the following years. His formal schooling ended at the Listowel Public School in 1872; he never went on to pursue formal academic training in art. At the age of 15, Walker moved to Toronto, Ontario to apprentice with the photographic firm Notman and Fraser. It was a fortunate opportunity, as several successful artists also worked there; Walker learned watercolour from Robert Gagnon, miniature portrait painting from John Arthur Fraser, and painting from Lucius Richard O'Brien and Henri Perr√©.Harper, 204. ===Mature life and career=== Walker painting in his Ste-P√©tronille garden, 1933 Walker was only at the firm for three years until he moved to the United States of America for uncertain reasons. Writing in 1928, Hector Charlesworth suggested that Walker was \\"chucked down the stairs\\" and fired for quarrelling with a family relative. However, it is more likely that Walker travelled to Philadelphia for the American Centennial in 1876, an exhibition where Notman and Fraser won the international award, which gave the firm the privilege of exclusive photographic rights for the celebrations. Ultimately, Walker may have decided to stay and pursue painting. During the period of Walker's life around 1878, he would have become familiar with the painters of the Barbizon school, which were at the time, exhibited in American museums and galleries. In 1880, Walker made an extended trip to Europe to learn more about Barbizon methods, and its agrarian subject matter, that would come to define his painting for the rest of his life. What happened with Walker during the two following years remains vague, but in 1878, he opened a studio in New York City. During the 1880s, Walker's parents moved to Rochester, New York, and Walker participated in the founding of the Rochester Art Club. A further sign of Walker's growing success was an invitation to join the American Watercolour membership in 1882. In 1883 he married Jeanette Pretty (died 1938) of Toronto. They had two children, Alice (1884‚Äì1891) and Horatio Jr. (1886‚Äì1910). It was sometime during this period that Walker purchased a residence on √éle d'Orl√©ans in the village of Sainte-P√©tronille. From now on until his retirement, Walker would spend his summers in Quebec and winters in his New York City studio. Walker's personal life was disastrous: his daughter died of diphtheria, his son of tuberculosis and his wife Jeanette, was committed to hospital permanently in 1914 due to paranoia. These tragedies do not seem to have influenced his painting; Walker's subject matter and style remained constant throughout his career without much variation.Farr, 16. ==Memberships and organizations== Walker was a member of several artists' organizations, including the American Watercolor Society (1882), the Royal Canadian Academy of Arts (associate member in 1883, full member in 1913), the Society of American Artists (1887), the National Academy of Design (associate member in 1890, full member in 1891), and the British Institute of Watercolours (1901). He was a founding member of the Canadian Art Club, which elected him as its president in 1915. In 1928 he officially retired and moved to Sainte-P√©tronille, Quebec. He died there on September 27, 1938. ==Awards and prizes== * Gold medals, American Art Gallery, New York (1887, 1889) * Evans Prize, American Watercolor Society (1888) * Bronze medal, World Exposition, Paris, France (1889) * Gold medal, World's Columbian Exposition, Chicago, Illinois (1893) * Gold medal, Pan-American Exposition, Buffalo, New York (1901) * Gold medal, Charleston Exposition, Charleston, South Carolina (1902) * Two gold medals (for oil and watercolor), Louisiana Purchase Exposition, St. Louis, Missouri (1904) * Medal of honor, Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Art, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania (1906) * First prize, Worcester Art Museum, Worcester, Massachusetts (1907) * Gold medal, Pan-Pacific International Exposition, San Francisco, California (1915) He was awarded honorary doctorates from the University of Toronto (1916) and Universit√© Laval, Qu√©bec City (1938). ==Selected works== *A Canadian Pastoral *After the Wedding *An Old Islander *At Low Tide *Ave Maria *Boeuf √† l'abreuvoir *By the Fireside *Canoe Cove *C√©lestin *Corner of Pig Lane in Qu√©bec *Corner of Sainte-P√©tronille *Corner of the Stable *De Profundis *Deo Gratias *√âglise de l'√éle-aux-Grues *Fagot Gatherers *Farmhouse Interior *First Snow *Fishing Nets *Girl with Turkeys *Golden Dew *Hauling the Log *Hauling Wood *Hay Making *Horses at Trough *Ice Cutters *Interior of a House *Killing Pigs *La Rencontre *La soue √† cochons *La tonte du mouton *Le vieux four *Little White Pigs and their Mother *Man Sawing Wood *Maple Sugar Harvest *Mare and Foal *Milk Maid √éle d'Orl√©ans *Milking Early Morn *Milking on the Batture *Morning √éle d'Orl√©ans *Morning Sainte-P√©tronille *Old House at Sainte-Famille *Oxen drinking *Oxen Ploughing *Peasant Scraping Pig *P√©tronille de Saint-Fran√ßois *Potato Gatherers *Preparing the Feed *Sheep Shearers *Spring Forage *The Bake Oven *The Farmer's Wife *The Gardener *The Harrow *The Rainbow *The Return *The Royal Mail *The Sheep Fold *The Shepherdess *The Smugglers *The Sorcerers *The Thresher *The Turkey Girl *Tournant la herse *Tree Fellers *Turkeys *Turning the Harrow *Unloading Hay Boat *Vieille Maison √† Ste-Famille *Way- Side Shrine at Saint-Laurent *Winter *Wood-Cutters ==NotesReferences== *Farr, Dorothy.

Equal variances across populations is called homoscedasticity or homogeneity of variances. Some statistical tests, for example the analysis of variance, assume that variances are equal across groups or samples. The Bartlett test can be used to verify that assumption. In Bartlett test, we construct the null and alternative hypothesis. For this purpose several test procedures have been devised. The test procedure due to M.S.E (Mean Square Error/Estimator) Bartlett test is represented here. This test procedure is based on the statistic whose sampling distribution is approximately a Chi-Square distribution with (k-1) degrees of freedom, where k is the number of random samples, which may vary in size and are each drawn from independent normal distributions. Bartlett's test is sensitive to departures from normality. That is, if the samples come from non-normal distributions, then Bartlett's test may simply be testing for non-normality. Levene's test and the Brown‚ÄìForsythe test are alternatives to the Bartlett test that are less sensitive to departures from normality.NIST/SEMATECH e-Handbook of Statistical Methods. Available online, URL: http://www.itl.nist.gov/div898/handbook/eda/section3/eda357.htm . Retrieved December 31, 2013. The test is named after Maurice Stevenson Bartlett. ==Specification== Bartlett's test is used to test the null hypothesis, H0 that all k population variances are equal against the alternative that at least two are different. If there are k samples with sizes n_i and sample variances S_i^2 then Bartlett's test statistic is :\\\\chi^2 = \\\\frac{(N-k)\\\\ln(S_p^2) - \\\\sum_{i=1}^k(n_i - 1)\\\\ln(S_i^2)}{1 + \\\\frac{1}{3(k-1)}\\\\left(\\\\sum_{i=1}^k(\\\\frac{1}{n_i-1}) - \\\\frac{1}{N-k}\\\\right)} where N = \\\\sum_{i=1}^k n_i and S_p^2 = \\\\frac{1}{N-k} \\\\sum_i (n_i-1)S_i^2 is the pooled estimate for the variance. The test statistic has approximately a \\\\chi^2_{k-1} distribution. Thus the null hypothesis is rejected if \\\\chi^2 > \\\\chi^2_{k-1,\\\\alpha} (where \\\\chi^2_{k-1,\\\\alpha} is the upper tail critical value for the \\\\chi^2_{k-1} distribution). Bartlett's test is a modification of the corresponding likelihood ratio test designed to make the approximation to the \\\\chi^2_{k-1} distribution better (Bartlett, 1937). ==Notes== The test statistics may be written in some sources with logarithms of base 10 as: :\\\\chi^2 = 2.3026 \\\\frac{(N-k)\\\\log_{10}(S_p^2) - \\\\sum_{i=1}^k(n_i - 1)\\\\log_{10}(S_i^2)}{1 + \\\\frac{1}{3(k-1)}\\\\left(\\\\sum_{i=1}^k(\\\\frac{1}{n_i-1}) - \\\\frac{1}{N-k}\\\\right)} ==See also== * Box's M test * Levene's test ==References== *Bartlett, M.

A New South Wales State of Origin and Australia international representative goal-kicking centre, he played his club football for the Illawarra Steelers and the Penrith Panthers, winning the 2003 NRL Premiership with the Panthers. ==Background== Girdler was born in Sydney, New South Wales, Australia. ==Playing career== Girdler first played in the New South Wales Rugby League for the Illawarra Steelers in 1991, playing his first game from the bench in a 26‚Äì14 win over South Sydney at the Wollongong Showground. During his time at Illawarra, he struggled with injuries and with the likes of Paul McGregor and Brett Rodwell cemented as the Steelers centre pairing, received few chances to reach his full potential. As a result, he usually found himself playing on the for the Steelers, though in 1992, his form saw him play 20 games for Illawarra (12 in the centres) and take over the goal kicking duties from Rod Wishart. Girdler was the Steelers top point scorer in 1992, scoring 118 points from 8 tries and 43 goals from 66 attempts (65.15%) This prompted a move to the Penrith Panthers in 1993 where he stayed for the rest of his career. In 1997 he played three games for New South Wales in the Super League's Super League Tri-series. In the 1997 post season, Girdler was selected to tour England as part of the Super League only Australian team as a centre and goal kicker, playing two of the three matches of the Super League Test series against Great Britain. The 1997 Super League season saw Girdler record his career best goal kicking figures when he kicked 76 goals from 82 attempts (92.68%) for the Panthers. With 197 points (11 tries, 76 goals and 1 field goal), Ryan Girdler was the highest point scorer for the Super League season (he finished one point clear of Cronulla's Mat Rogers). As this was the only SL season to be played in Australasia, this remains the all-time record number of points scored for the competition. Following Super League, Girdler's standing as one of the best centres in rugby league was cemented when he was then selected for New South Wales in State of Origin. As the Super League War had ended at the end of 1997 with the Super and Australian Rugby Leagues merging to form the National Rugby League, the 1998 State of Origin series saw players from both the SL and ARL available for Origin selection (prior to 1998, Origin selection had only been open to ARL aligned players from 1995‚Äì1997, though SL had their own 'Origin' in the form of the Tri-series which also included New Zealand). Girdler was selected for the Australian team to compete in the end of season 1999 Rugby League Tri-Nations tournament. In the final against New Zealand he played from the interchange bench in the Kangaroos' 22‚Äì20 victory at Auckland's Ericsson Stadium. In 2000 Ryan set one of his many records at Penrith, kicking 78 goals in the season. In the 2000 State of Origin series he set records for most points in a game (32 in game 3) and most points in a series (52). Later that year Ryan was selected to play for the Kangaroos in the 2000 Rugby League World Cup. Ryan scored three tries and kicked 17 goals for a 46 points in total when Australia defeated Russia 110 to 4 at The Boulevard in Hull. In 2002, Ryan was once again injured, a knee injury ruling him out for half the season, despite the injury, Ryan was able to set another record at the Penrith club, scoring 28 points in a match against Manly-Warringah Sea Eagles at Penrith Stadium in July. In 2003 he was injured in the opening round and did not make a return until round 14. 2003 was the last year that Ryan would represent Australia, scoring the first try in a game against Wales, 76 to 4. That season the Panthers finished minor premiers and went on to the grand final. In the 2003 NRL grand final Ryan played in the centres and had to come from the field with a calf injury in the Panthers' victory over the Sydney Roosters. After that he went on the 2003 Kangaroo tour of Great Britain and France, helping Australia to victory over Great Britain in what would be the last time the two nations contested an Ashes series. His last game was the Preliminary Final loss to the Canterbury Bulldogs who went on to win the 2004 NRL premiership. ===Records=== Girdler was the top point-scorer in 1997's Super League premiership season. During the 2000 State of Origin he scored 32 points in one game, equalling Dally Messenger's for most points in an interstate game set 89 years earlier in 1911. His tally of 1,690 first grade points is the 8th highest in history and he was the first player to score 100 tries and kick 500 goals (a feat subsequently emulated by Canterbury's Hazem El Masri and Parramatta's Luke Burt).

One of the largest athletic facilities ever built, its twelve acres of interior space include a nine-story tower containing a third-floor swimming pool, fencing facilities, and a polo practice room. The building houses the facilities of many varsity teams at Yale, including basketball, fencing, gymnastics, squash, swimming, and volleyball. It is the second-largest gym in the world by cubic feet and the 94th largest in the United States by square footage. The building was donated to Yale by John Hay Whitney, of the Yale class of 1926, in honor of his father, Payne Whitney. Because it was designed in the Gothic Revival style that prevailed at Yale between 1920 and 1945, it is commonly known as \\"the cathedral of sweat\\". For the design of Payne Whitney Gymnasium, architect John Russell Pope was awarded the Silver Medal at the 1932 Olympic Games Art Competition. The stuffed original Handsome Dan, the bulldog mascot of Yale and the first college mascot in the United States, resides in a glass cabinet near the entrance to the building. ==Facilities== Entrance to Lee Amphitheater (2008) Interior of Lee Amphitheater (2008) The basketball team plays in the John J. Lee Amphitheater, which was named in 1996 for John J. Lee, '56 M.Eng., a star basketball player and benefactor in restoration projects; the volleyball and gymnastics teams also compete in the Amphiteater. The wing opposite the Amphiteater houses the Robert J. H. Kiphuth Exhibition Pool (6 lanes, 25 yards), where the swimming teams compete. The pool is named for Yale's legendary swimming coach and athletic director. A series of three crew tanks runs along the back of the gym, providing training facilities for the crews. Above the crew tanks is the Practice Pool, one of the world's largest suspended natatoriums (5 lanes, 50 meters, 2 bulkheads). Above the Practice Pool are recreational basketball courts. On the wings, the Adrian \\"Ace\\" Israel Fitness Center is located above the Kiphuth Exhibition Pool, and the Brady Squash Center is located above the Amphitheater. The Squash Center, one of the world's premier competition facilities, is also home to the U.S. Squash Hall of Fame. The roof of the Squash Center has a small outdoor running track. The tower itself contains the Kiphuth Trophy Room (where mementos from Harvard- Yale game balls to Olympic gold medals are displayed), several multi-purpose recreational areas, the fencing salon, and the gymnastics studio. The Lanman Center, located behind the Amphitheater wing, provides a vast spread of additional flexible floor space, with a balcony running track ringing the facility. ==Renovation== File:KiphuthPool.jpgExhibition Pool File:Payne Whitney Gymnasium practice pool.jpgPractice Pool File:Payne-whitney- squash.jpgSquash Courts File:Payne-whitney-exercise.jpgFitness Center File:Payne-whitney-exercise2.jpgFitness Center Lanman Center The William K.

In 2006, the building is having external work done to repair flashing and stop leaks. Other work includes the purchasing of banners and benches for the Kiphuth Exhibition Pool, the resurfacing of the floor in the Lee Amphitheater, and the upgrading of the Practice Pool's filtration system (see Pool Closure below). ==Trivia== Before coeducation, the third floor pool was strictly \\"no suits,\\" i.e. nude.

In Islam, ibadah is usually translated as \\"worship\\", and ibadat‚Äîthe plural form of ibadah‚Äîrefers to Islamic jurisprudence (fiqh) of Muslim religious rituals. ==Ibadah== In Arabic ibadah is connected with related words such as \\"Ubudiyyah\\" (\\"slavery\\"), and has connotations of obedience, submission, and humility. The word linguistically means \\"obedience with submission\\".al-Qamoos al-Muhit In Islam, ibadah is usually translated as \\"worship\\" and means obedience, submission, and devotion to God. Quran Surah Adh-Dhaariyat ( Verse 56 ) Other sources (noted Islamist author Abul A'la Maududi and others) give a broader definition of ibadah, including keeping speech free \\"from filth, falsehood, malice, abuse\\", and dishonesty, obeying Islamic Shariah law in \\"commercial and economic affairs\\" and in \\"dealings with your parents, relatives, friends\\", and everyone else. ==Ibadat== Ibadat (ÿπÿ®ÿßÿØÿßÿ™ ) is the plural form of ibƒÅdah. In addition to meaning more than one ibƒÅdah, it refers to Islamic jurisprudence (fiqh) on \\"the rules governing worship in Islam\\" or the \\"religious duties of worship incumbent on all Muslims when they come of age and are of sound body and mind\\". It is distinguished from other subjects of jurisprudence in Islam which are usually known as mu øƒÅmalƒÅt (interpersonal transactions). Ibadat include what are known as the \\"pillars of Islam\\": * Declaration of faith (shahadah), translated as \\"There is no god other than Allah. Muhammad is the messenger of Allah\\"; * ritual prayer (salat), observed five times every day at prescribed times, with prescribed preparations (ritual cleaning), prescribed movements (standing, bowing, prostrating, sitting) and prescribed verses, phrases; * alms giving (zakah) -- customarily 2.5% of a Muslim's total savings and wealth above a minimum amount known as nisab, which is based on income and the value of all of one's possessions; * fasting (sawm) -- the abstention from eating and drinking during daylight hours‚Äîespecially during the Islamic holy month of Ramadan; * pilgrimage to Mecca (hajj)‚Äîthe annual Islamic pilgrimage to the most holy city of the Muslims, and a mandatory religious duty for Muslims that must be carried out at least once in their lifetime by all adult Muslims who are physically and financially capable of undertaking the journey, and can support their family during their absence. According to Oxford Islamic Studies, \\"because they are of central importance to the Muslim community, the ibadat form the first subject matter of Islamic jurisprudence and most collections of prophetic traditions (hadith).\\" The subject of ibadat is especially important in Islam (according to author Faleel Jamaldeen) because without these religious laws, \\"Muslims would likely create their own rituals and prayers, and the religion of Islam would falter and eventually disappear.\\" ==See also== *Schools of Islamic theology ==References *Ibadah in Islam *The Meaning of Worship in Islam *Ibadah Category:Islamic behaviour and experience Category:Arabic words and phrases in Sharia Category:Islamic terminology Category:Islamic worship Category:Sharia legal terminology Category:Islamic jurisprudence ","title":"Ibadah"},{"id":"2223869","text":"Valentyna Semenivna Shevchenko (; 12 March 1935 ‚Äì 3 February 2020) was the Chairperson of the Presidium of Supreme Soviet of the Ukrainian SSR. ==Biography== Shevchenko was born the daughter of a miner, Semen Solianyk, in Kryvyi Rih, Dnipropetrovsk Oblast, Soviet Union.

Founded in 1896 by Leopold Friederich Schmidt, it was bought by G. Heileman Brewing Company in 1983. Through a series of consolidations, it was acquired by Pabst Brewing Company in 1999; the Tumwater brewery was closed in 2003. ==History== Leopold Schmidt, a German immigrant from Montana founded The Capital Brewing Company at Tumwater Falls on the Deschutes River in the town of Tumwater, near the south end of Puget Sound. He built a four-story wooden brewhouse, a five-story cellar building, a one-story ice factory powered by the lower falls, and a bottling and keg plant and in 1896, began brewing and selling Olympia Beer. In 1902, the firm became Olympia Brewing Company, with Frank Kenney as the Company Secretary. It was Frank Kenney who proposed the slogan \\"It's the Water\\" to promote the brewery's flagship product. Statewide Prohibition, which began in January 1916, four years before National Prohibition, ended beer making operations. After Prohibition ended, a new Olympia Brewery was erected just upstream from the original, and Olympia beer went back on sale in 1934.Brewery Gems, An Illustrated History of the Olympia Brewing Company (Retrieved on October 25, 2009). Olympia was a very popular regional brand in the Pacific Northwest for half of a century. It eventually expanded nationwide, repositioned as a low-price lager. During the 1970s, Olympia acquired Hamm's and Lone Star, and also produced Buckhorn Beer,Beer Advocate. What Happened to Buckhorn Beer?, (Retrieved on November 2, 2006) which had previously been a product of the Lone Star Brewing Company.The Buckhorn Museum. Fact Sheet, (Retrieved on November 30, 2008). Until the mid-1970s, competitor Coors of Colorado had a limited 11-state distribution area; Washington and Montana were not added until 1976, and Oregon did not approve sales of Coors in grocery stores until 1985. Between 1970 and 1980 Olympia faced flat revenuesTri City Herald, Schmidts may lose Olympia beer helm 2/21/1980 among consolidating nationwide breweries and, in 1982, the Schmidt family, which owned and operated the brewery and company, elected to sell the company. Olympia was subsequently purchased by G. Heileman Brewing Company in 1983, which was purchased by Stroh Brewery Company in 1996. In 1999, Pabst bought most of the Stroh brands, including Olympia.Victor J. Tremblay, The U.S. Brewing Industry: Data and Economic Analysis (Cambridge, Massachusetts, MIT Press, 2005), p. 305 As with many other regional breweries, ownership of Olympia eventually passed through several corporations including Pabst, Heileman, and Stroh's, until the brewery was eventually purchased by Miller Brewing Company. For a time, the Olympia brewery took over the brewing of other Pacific Northwest brands as their original breweries were closed one by one, including the Lucky Lager brewery in Vancouver, Washington, the Henry Weinhard's brewery in Portland, and even the brewery of its arch-rival, Rainier Beer, in Seattle. In 2002, SAB bought out Miller Brewing Co. SABMiller closed the Tumwater facility in mid-2003, citing the unprofitability of such a small brewery. Pabst was purchased, along with the Olympia label, by beer industry veteran Eugene Kashper with backing from TSG Consumer Partners in 2014, and Olympia Beer continues to be contract brewed by MillerCoors at their brewery in Irwindale, California. Ag Energy Resources of Benton, Illinois purchased the machinery from Olympia Brewing to make ethanol for motor fuel use. Part of the brewery complex was heavily damaged in a fire on October 7, 2018. The administration building's south side partially collapsed, and a 3-alarm fire call caused fire units to respond from many neighboring departments. ==Use of artesian water== For many years, Olympia Beer was brewed with water obtained from artesian wells. The company's promotions made much of the use of artesian water in the brewing process. However, the advertisements never explained what artesian water was, preferring to claim that the water was controlled by a mythical population of \\"artesians\\".Kelley Advertising & Marketing: Olympia Beer: A Good Campaign Accelerates the Death of a Brand .

The word \\"kƒÅlua\\" (\\"to cook in an underground oven\\" in the Hawaiian language) may also be used to describe the food cooked in this manner, such as kƒÅlua pig or kƒÅlua turkey, which are commonly served at l≈´ ªau feasts. The word l≈´ ªau is the Hawaiian name for the taro leaf, which, when young and small resembles cooked spinach after being steamed for a few hours . The traditional l≈´ ªau was eaten on the floor over lauhala mats (leaves of the hala tree woven together). Traditionally, a hardwood fire is built inside a pit large enough to contain the food to be cooked, the stones, and the vegetation used to cover the food. Stones are placed on top of the fire in the pit, taking around two to three hours to reach their maximum temperature. Most important is the selection of stones that contain very little moisture to avoid stones exploding from the steam generated by the heat. Once the stones have become extremely hot, they are spread out over the coals and the pit is lined with vegetation, such as banana trees, that have been pounded to make them pliable. A layer of ti leaves (Cordyline fruticosa) would then be spread over the layer of pounded vegetation and the food to be cooked placed on top. Meat to be cooked would be salted and in the instance of cooking a whole pig, some hot stones would also be placed inside the body cavity to ensure the meat is fully cooked. To maintain even heating and to retain the meat's natural moisture, the meat is covered with more layers of vegetation such as ti and banana leaves, then covered with a layer of soil at least several inches deep ensuring that no steam escapes. The layers of vegetation covering the food must extend past the edges of the pit to ensure the food is not contaminated by the soil it is buried under. The meat is then left to cook in the pit for several hours. When the meat is fully cooked, it is removed from the imu and shredded. Modern adaptations to the traditional cooking method include the use of wet burlap material as a substitute for the vegetation or to reduce the amount of vegetation needed, and also the use of non-galvanized steel chicken wire or mesh wrapped around the food to aid in its removal when cooked. The characteristic flavor of kƒÅlua pig is imparted by the smoke from the hardwood but more importantly the use of ti leaves to wrap the meat. The flavor of the ti leaf is what differentiates kƒÅlua pig from other methods of cooking a whole hog slowly using a hardwood fire. KƒÅlua pig is a main tourist attraction at many l≈´ ªau, though it is sometimes made using a gas or electric stove with artificial mesquite or kiawe liquid smoke. Other tourist businesses use substitutes instead of vegetation or use an imu pao, an above ground variation of the imu. The term \\"kƒÅlua pork\\" has been used by Hawaiian cook Sam Choy to describe pork shoulder butt which is rubbed with sea salt, wrapped in ti leaves, and slowly cooked in an oven using liquid mesquite smoke rather than an imu. == See also == * Hawaiian cuisine * Curanto * Hangi * List of cooking techniques * New England clam bake * Pachamanca * Pig roast * Pit barbecue * Pit oven ==References External links == * How to make an imu (imu site: Kahalu'u, O'ahu, Hawai'i.

They were named Country Group or Duo of the year six times by both the Canadian Country Music Association (CCMA) and the Juno Awards. The band also won the Bud Country Fans' Choice Award from the CCMA in 1994. They have four No. 1 country singles in Canada, with an additional 12 singles reaching the Canadian Country Top 10. Eight of their albums have been certified gold or platinum by the Canadian Recording Industry Association, including the 1992 CCMA Album of the Year Everybody Knows. While no formal announcement seems to have been made, the band is no longer touring nor are they maintaining their web site. Front-man Russell deCarle has been touring solo to promote a new CD. Guitarist Keith Glass released his own solo CD in 2013 and has been touring on his own as well as backing up other artists, such as Lynn Miles. ==Biography== Prairie Oyster formed in 1974 in Toronto. As a trio, consisting of singer/bassist Russell deCarle (born 31 May 1954), guitarist Keith Glass (born 1952) and steel guitarist Dennis Delorme, they toured and performed on television, but did not record. They subsequently broke up in 1978. In 1982, the band reunited, adding fiddler John P. Allen, keyboardist Joan Besen and drummer John Adames to the lineup. Bruce Moffat soon replaced Adames, and the group released its debut album, Oyster Tracks, in 1986 on Stony Plain Records. The album found its way to RCA Records executive Joe Galante, who signed the group after seeing them perform. RCA wanted the band to change their name, but they were already too well known. Prairie Oyster was named Country Group or Duo of the Year at the Juno Awards in 1986 and 1987. Their first album for RCA, Different Kind of Fire, was released in 1990 in both Canada and the United States. On the success of the album, Prairie Oyster was named the CCMA Group or Duo of the Year in 1990 and 1991. They also won the Juno Award for Country Group or Duo of the Year in 1991. All four singles released reached the top 15 in Canada, including the top 5s \\"Goodbye, So Long, Hello,\\" \\"I Don't Hurt Anymore\\" and \\"Something to Remember You By.\\" The band didn't do as well in the United States however, with the highest charting single peaking at No. 62\\\\. \\"Goodbye, So Long, Hello\\" was the CCMA Single of the Year in 1990. The following year, \\"Lonely You, Lonely Me\\" was named Song of the Year by the CCMA. In March 1991, the band received a nomination from the Academy of Country Music for Top New Group or Duo. Prairie Oyster's third album, Everybody Knows, was released in 1991. The album featured four top 10 singles in Canada: \\"Did You Fall In Love with Me,\\" \\"One Precious Love,\\" \\"Will I Do (Till the Real Thing Comes Along)\\" and \\"Everybody Knows.\\" Unfortunately, only one single charted in the U.S., \\"One Precious Love\\" (#51). Prairie Oyster won several CCMA Awards in 1992, including Album of the Year for Everybody Knows, Song of the Year for \\"Did You Fall In Love with Me,\\" as well as their third straight win as Group or Duo of the Year. The Juno Awards also awarded them Country Group or Duo of the Year for the fourth time. The band's fourth album, Only One Moon, was released in Canada on Arista Records in 1994. It would also go on to become their most successful. The first single, \\"Such a Lonely One,\\" was also their first No. 1 in Canada. Two more singles released from the project also reached the top of the Canadian Country chart, \\"Don't Cry Little Angel\\" and the title track. Additional singles \\"Louisiette,\\" \\"Black-Eyed Susan\\" and \\"Ancient History\\" all reached the top 10. They were named Group or Duo of the Year by the CCMA in 1994, 1995 and 1996, and won the Bud Country Fans' Choice Award in 1994. The Juno Awards also recognized Prairie Oyster as the Country Group or Duo of the Year in both 1995 and 1996. Their fifth album, Blue Plate Special, was released in 1996. The first song released from the disc, \\"Unbelievable Love,\\" reached No. 1\\\\. \\"One Way Track\\" was also a top 5, but follow-up singles peaked outside the top 10. Bohdan Hluszko replaced Bruce Moffat as the drummer on the album. The following year, Hluszko was fired from the band after coming out as transgender. With the 1998 release of their sixth album, What Is This Country?, the group returned to the top 10 with the songs \\"Canadian Sunrise\\" (#5) and \\"Keep On Dreaming (#9).

It was manufactured by Silverlit Toys Manufactory Ltd Hong Kong from 2000 to 2006. i-Cybie was developed for commercial distribution by Tiger Electronics. Outrageous International Hong Kong distributed the electronic pet from 2005 to 2006. The i-Cybie robotic dog responds to sound, touch, movement, and voice commands. The toy robot can autonomously recharge its batteries using a special docking station. I-Cybie was the first mass- produced toy that used advanced voice recognition technology. ==Features== i-Cybie has 16 built-in motors which allow 16 degrees of freedom. There are three CPU‚Äôs‚Äîthe main Toshiba TMP91C815F for motion control and for mood calculation, a SunPlus Technology CPU used for audio playback, and an RSC 364 used for voice recognition and recording.http://servo.texterity.com/servo/200312/?pg=13#pg13 i-Cybie is constructed using 1400 parts, and more than 90 feet of wire.http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Man's+Best+Friend+Just+Got+Better%3B+Introducing+i-Cybie,+Tiger's+Most...-a076864929 The robot uses a suite of sensors to determine mood and behavior. *Dimensions **Height: **Width: **Length: **Weight: about *Light Sensor (nose)‚Äî for motion detection in \\"guard\\" mode. *Infrared Obstacle Detector (chest array)‚Äîfor collision avoidance and edge detection. The chest array is also used to communicate with other toys (robo-chi, i-Cybie) and for receiving remote commands. *Touch Sensors (back button, head button, nose button)‚Äî influence the i-Cybie's moods and behavior. *Microphones (4)‚Äîthree microphones are used to hear sharp sounds and one is used to discriminate voice. The robot can localize the direction of a sharp sound and move towards it.http://servo.texterity.com/servo/200312/?pg=13#pg13 I-Cybies can recognize spoken commands and respond in a specific manner. Voice recognition features biometric authentication.http://www.13thmonkey.org/documentation/hardware/chips/80-0116.pdf Voice recognition is activated by the head contact sensor or by the remote control unit. *Orientation Sensor‚Äîthe robot can detect whether it has fallen over. The orientation sensor also contributes to the robot's mood. *Encoders (12)- three per leg, position legs. *Dynamic Drive feedback-it can sense when its limbs are jammed and take action to free itself. *Light Sensor (back)‚Äî for use in mood and behavior calculations. The light sensor can also detect petting and can initiate behavior. ==Basic Functions== i-Cybies can be programmed to respond to the voice commands of a specific user. Voice control is a form of speech recognition that is \\"speaker dependent\\". The RSC 300/364 microcontroller can process commands in any spoken language and features biometric authentication.http://www.13thmonkey.org/documentation/hardware/chips/80-0116.pdf There are 8 voice commands listed in the manual allowing the user to initiate 8 different behavior categories. In addition to voice, i-Cybies can hear sharp sounds and localize the general direction of the source. It can also count the number of hand claps given in clap command mode (play mode) and respond with the same number of barks. i-Cybie can also detected when it has fallen over and automatically stand back up. It has the ability to detect when it is in a confined space or if it has become snagged against an obstacle. i-Cybie can \\"see\\" movement when in guard mode (motion detection) using a light sensor in its nose and it can also detect ambient light levels and movement using a light sensor in its back. i-Cybie uses several gaits for walking and among its numerous actions it can sit, roll on its side, and stand on its head. Other features include edge detection (a special mode) and collision avoidance.http://www.hasbro.com/common/instruct/I-Cybie_Quick_Start_Guide.pdf i-Cybie can detect its battery charge and will shut down when battery power is low or if equipped with a Walk Up Charger and programmable cartridge it will automatically seek out its charger and recharge itself. i-Cybie uses five states or \\"moods\\" to determine autonomous behavior: happy, sad, sleepy, sick, and hyper. Moods are calculated based upon the cumulative count of interactions derived from the sensors. Users can tell the current mood/state by eye color, posture and type of behavior (i.e. yawning when sleepy or peeing when sick). I-Cybie is advertised as developing or evolving according to the environment and user treatment.http://www.hasbro.com/common/instruct/I-Cybie_Quick_Start_Guide.pdf i-Cybie accepts signals from an infrared remote control unit (RCU) and was designed to ‚Äúcommunicate‚Äù with Silverlit's robo-chi toys by transmitting and receiving IR signals using its chest array. There are several modes that are specific to the remote including play, stay, and guard mode. The remote is also used for \\"training\\" the robotic toy's voice recognition feature and for setting the pause mode. ==Cartridge== I-Cybies were originally sold with a \\"dummy\\" cartridge inserted in a programming port on the robot's right side. A fully programmable cartridge was included with the Silverlit Downloader and Walk Up Charger accessories which were sold separately (they were later bundled with the robot). The cartridge adds specific actions for navigation to the Walk Up Charger and a special charger approach routine. It can also be programmed with the Silverlit Downloader accessory to expand the robot's autonomous behavior with actions that are not part of i-Cybie's standard suite. With a programmable cartridge inserted i-Cybie can sense its battery charge and if it is low, the robot will autonomously locate its charger and dock. After charging the i-Cybie will back away from the charger and resume autonomous operation. Tiger Electronics programmable cartridges were populated with two 1 Mbit SST39vf010 chips with a total capacity of 256KB of flash ROM.http://servo.texterity.com/servo/200312/?pg=13#pg13 The cartridge stores extra motion data and can be used to store additional audio files.http://servo.texterity.com/servo/200312/?pg=13#pg13 (Late cartridges are populated with a single 2 Mbit SST39vf200 chip which will not program successfully in a standard Super iCybie). Late single chip carts can now be programmed by an updated SIC. A new CROMINST is available in the downloads of www.icybie.net16.net, which can be used to create a SIC which can program single chip carts, but the SIC MUST be an older style, dual-chip dog, as making a SIC from a single chip dog is as yet untested. In addition, a new walkup cart firmware was identified, indicating the newer single chip dogs may have a different firmware to the older i-cybie. ==Custom personalities== Although i-Cybies were designed to be programmed to individual tastes, Silverlit and Hasbro (Tiger Electronics' parent company) provided little support for development of this feature beyond the release of the Downloader and associated Downloader software. Faced with this deficit, users developed their own tools for modifying the robot's behavior. A group of dedicated modders and hackers provided unofficial support for i-Cybie during its early years on the market.https://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,1180411,00.asp The result was that a number of software and hardware tools were created to allow users to manipulate i-Cybie's behavior. YICT (Yanni Idolizes iCybie Tweeking) is a program based on the reverse-engineering efforts of a robot enthusiast known as \\"Aibopet\\" and is one of the user-developed tools designed to program a cartridge using either a Silverlit Downloader or a Super-i- Cybie.http://servo.texterity.com/servo/200312/?pg=13#pg13 An exploration of the functions allowed in YICT has revealed details about i-Cybie's programming logic and action categories that are not part of the general documentation. YICT also allows users to add more actions to each mood and change the overall behavior.http://servo.texterity.com/servo/200312/?pg=13#pg13 The YICT version 2.02 software contains a number of personalities for users to build upon (example: the Z/2 personality) and is a major source for early user group developed personalities. ==Super-I-Cybie== It is possible to hack Tiger/Silverlit model i-Cybies and make them capable of writing directly to a programmable cartridge without the use of the downloader. This modified i-Cybie is called a \\"Super\\" i-Cybie (SIC) by its creator Aibopet. In general, the hack involves soldering a communications port to traces near the main CPU and installing a boot loader (CROMINST) that has been pre-loaded on a programmable cartridge.http://www.hackinglab.org/icybie/index_icybie.html The one time process makes it possible for the robot to be programmed with a new personality and to serve as a programmer (downloader) for other i-Cybies. Users have noted that the Outrageous International i-Cybie cannot be hacked in this manner. A Super i-Cybie can also be completely reprogrammed in C language \\"from the ground up\\" with a user developed software development kit (ICSDK) to create new firmware.http://www.aibohack.com ==Firmware and hardware== The i-Cybie firmware was designed by Micom tech HK on behalf of Tiger.http://www.micomtech.com.hk/ Research by i-Cybie Fans has determined that Hasbro owns the firmware rights, having acquired Tiger.http://www.spokesman.com/stories/1998/feb/10/hasbro-to-acquire-tiger- electronics/ There appear to be three models of i-Cybie; 88011 (Tiger/Silverlit), 88012 (Silverlit) and 88013 (Outrageous/Silverlit).http://item.taobao.com/item.htm?id=2205006807&tracelog;=newcardfavirate Each model displays minor differences in component arrangement and structural detail and there are several circuit board versions for each model. It is not generally known whether there is a noticeable difference in firmware between models based on these differences. ==History== The Hong Kong based Toy Company Silverlit built the prototype i-Cybie and presented it at the 1999 American International Toy Fair in New York City.http://www.rainycity.com/i-cybie/news- release-on-icybie.htm The early prototypes looked very similar to Sony‚Äôs ERS-110 in appearance but were meant to compete at a significantly lower consumer price. Tiger Electronics acquired the rights to distribute i-Cybie in 2000 and spent more than 2 million dollars to further develop the robot.http://www.rainycity.com/i-cybie/news-release-on-icybie.htm Tiger subsequently redesigned the prototype i-Cybie to make it look more like a dog and less like the AIBO ERS 110.http://www.rainycity.com/i-cybie/news-release- on-icybie.htm A team of programmers led by Andy Filo reprogrammed i-Cybie to walk, interact, and to exhibit lifelike characteristics. The electronic pet was first released in January 2001.http://www.rainycity.com/i-cybie/news- release-on-icybie.htm Originally i-Cybies were sold with a plug-in charger, a remote, a rechargeable 12 volt nickel metal cadmium battery and a ‚Äúdummy‚Äù cartridge. In 2002 the Walk Up Charger and the Downloader, each sold with a programmable cartridge, were released as accessories. The robotic toy was offered in two colors; metallic blue and metallic gold. In 2002 new shell options were offered including black, white, and transparent. The price point for i-Cybie was set at US$200, significantly less than the price for its chief robotic competitor at the time, the Sony AIBO ERS 111, then priced at more than US$1500. The i-Cybie robotic pet was set to be on the shelves in December 2000 in time for the seasonal increase in consumer spending. However, difficulties in development caused Tiger Electronics to postpone the initial release to early 2001.http://www.rainycity.com/i-cybie/news-release-on- icybie.htm Soon after its debut consumers reported that an \\"error\\" in the original quick start manual instructed owners to charge the batteries ten hours. The time was not consistent with the recommended charge time for the charger (300ma) and the battery (800mah) released with the robot. The reported error allegedly resulted in some batteries being overcharged by users and rendered useless. Negative customer reviews may have effected some sales. Silverlit appears to have addressed this issue with the release of a \\"smart\\" battery charger accessory by 2002 and a higher capacity nickel metal hydride battery. Tiger Electronics discontinued support for i-Cybie soon after its release due to poor sales. Silverlit continued to support the robot and released new shell options, a Walk-Up Charger and Downloader as promised upgrades. Outrageous International Hong Kong relaunched i-Cybie in 2005 with the promise of improved features and a rumor circulated among i-Cybie fan sites of a new furry \\"x-Cybie\\" shell option for 2006. Although some Outrageous i-Cybies were made, only a few were released with fur (flock) covering. In 2006 the product was listed as discontinued in Western markets but some Chinese websites still list new i-Cybie's available for sale in China. As of Spring 2014, Silverlit still offered support for the robot and carried the Walk Up Charger, Downloader and other accessories for i-Cybie at their international 3deshop website. Throughout its production run i-Cybies were compared to Sony's Aibo entertainment robots.http://www.rainycity.com/i-cybie/news-release-on-icybie.htm Although both devices share many features, in general AIBOs are more mechanically complex and they have a more powerful and versatile CPU. The AIBO series also use a vision system that is capable of tracking color and they possess a comparatively large suite of behavior that takes advantage of their vision abilities. Beyond its infrared collision avoidance, the i-Cybie does not have a vision system and its behavioral suite is comparatively limited. However, the i-Cybie pioneered features found in later robotic pets such as speech recognition and autonomous recharging. Soon after i-Cybie's release a small user group community developed with the intent of enhancing i-Cybie's features.https://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,1180411,00.asp Although some success was made in creating tools to manipulate the toy robot's software, lack of official support and development led the community to eventually disband. ==Education== Because of the low cost versus technological capabilities, i-Cybies have been used by universities to teach programming and robotics. Notable examples include the work of France Cadet, an artist and Associate Professor & Chair (Art & Technology department) at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago. Known for her robotic and bio-oriented multi-media installations, Cadet has featured i-Cybies in many of her art exhibits worldwide.http://cyberdoll.free.fr/cyberdoll/index_e_doglab01.html Natalie Jeremijenko's Feral Dogs Project teaches students ecology at the University of California San Diego using i-Cybies modified with pollution sensors to seek out chemicals.http://inhabitat.com/robotic-pollution-sniffing-eco-dogs/ Recently (prior to 2010) inventor Andy Filo was interviewed and commented \\"[i-Cybie] is still probably one of the most complex toys that was ever sold on the toy isle\\".https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YRq5qd5nDM == See also == *Aibo, is an iconic series of robotic pets designed and manufactured by Sony. *Genibo, is a robotic dog produced by Dasarobot of Dasatech. *Musio is a social robot with friend and pet-like characteristics. *Pleo, is an animatronic pet dinosaur toy designed Ugobe ==References== # http://www.rainycity.com/i-cybie/news-release-on-icybie.htm # https://web.archive.org/web/20060517131054/http://www.servomagazine.com/contentFrame.php?83 # http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2001-03-19/business/0103190175_1_toy- industry-robotic-tiger-electronics # http://servo.texterity.com/servo/200312/?pg=13#pg13 # https://web.archive.org/web/20130206204726/http://www.tjpa- china.org/jsp/toyEnFront/usershop/hydp/companyinfo.jsp?shopname=silverlit # http://cyberdoll.free.fr/cyberdoll/index_e_doglab01.html # https://www.nytimes.com/2001/02/04/business/here-boy-come-to-the-toy-store- please.html?pagewanted=all&src;=pm # https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YRq5qd5nDM # http://www.i4u.com/9815/x-cybie- robot-dog-shipping-week # http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Man's+Best+Friend+Just+Got+Better%3B+Introducing+i-Cybie,+Tiger's+Most...-a076864929 # http://www.13thmonkey.org/documentation/hardware/chips/80-0116.pdf # http://www.hasbro.com/common/instruct/I-Cybie_Quick_Start_Guide.pdf # http://www.aibohack.com # http://www.hackinglab.org/icybie/index_icybie.html # http://www.micomtech.com.hk/ # http://item.taobao.com/item.htm?id=2205006807&tracelog;=newcardfavirate # http://www.spokesman.com/stories/1998/feb/10/hasbro-to-acquire-tiger- electronics/ # http://inhabitat.com/robotic-pollution-sniffing-eco-dogs/ # https://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,1180411,00.asp # https://web.archive.org/web/20110821170652/http://www.industryhk.org/english/survey/files/MadeInPRD_III_Toy_ENG_2010.pdf ==External links== *Wayback Machine Archive Old Silverlit archive *i-Cybie Hack Comprehensive source *Cartheur Robotics Cart programming service active 2015 *Battery source i-Cybie Batteries made to order active 2015 *Description of i-Cybie at virtualpet.com *The Old Robots Web Site i-Cybie and hundreds of other robots *Detailed analysis of comments by i-Cybie owners *Interstatebatteries Type i-Cybie in the search window. * * *taobao.com Where I-Cybie stock is still sold. *www.icybie.net16.net - collection of i-Cybie resources Category:Robotic dogs Category:2000 robots Category:Entertainment robots Category:Robots of China Category:Toy animals ","title":"I-Cybie"},{"id":"2223912","text":"Digi International is an American Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) technology company headquartered in Hopkins, Minnesota.

Demonstrating the resistance of any cryptographic scheme to attack is a complex matter, requiring extensive testing and reviews, preferably in a public forum. Good algorithms and protocols are required, and good system design and implementation is needed as well. For instance, the operating system on which the cryptographic software runs should be as carefully secured as possible. Users may handle passwords insecurely, or trust 'service' personnel overly much, or simply misuse the software. (See social engineering.) \\"Strong\\" thus is an imprecise term and may not apply in particular situations. ==Background== The use of computers changed the process of cryptanalysis, famously with Bletchley Park's Colossus. But just as the development of digital computers and electronics helped in cryptanalysis, it also made possible much more complex ciphers. It is typically the case that use of a quality cipher is very efficient, while breaking it requires an effort many orders of magnitude larger - making cryptanalysis so inefficient and impractical as to be effectively impossible. Since the publication of Data Encryption Standard, the Diffie-Hellman and RSA algorithm in the 1970s, cryptography has had deep connections with abstract mathematics and become a widely used tool in communications, computer networks, and computer security generally. == Cryptographically strong algorithms == This term \\"cryptographically strong\\" is often used to describe an encryption algorithm, and implies, in comparison to some other algorithm (which is thus cryptographically weak), greater resistance to attack. But it can also be used to describe hashing and unique identifier and filename creation algorithms. See for example the description of the Microsoft .NET runtime library function Path.GetRandomFileName. In this usage, the term means \\"difficult to guess\\". An encryption algorithm is intended to be unbreakable (in which case it is as strong as it can ever be), but might be breakable (in which case it is as weak as it can ever be) so there is not, in principle, a continuum of strength as the idiom would seem to imply: Algorithm A is stronger than Algorithm B which is stronger than Algorithm C, and so on. The situation is made more complex, and less subsumable into a single strength metric, by the fact that there are many types of cryptanalytic attack and that any given algorithm is likely to force the attacker to do more work to break it when using one attack than another. There is only one known unbreakable cryptographic system, the one- time pad, which is not generally possible to use because of the difficulties involved in exchanging one-time pads without their being compromised. So any encryption algorithm can be compared to the perfect algorithm, the one-time pad. The usual sense in which this term is (loosely) used, is in reference to a particular attack, brute force key search -- especially in explanations for newcomers to the field. Indeed, with this attack (always assuming keys to have been randomly chosen), there is a continuum of resistance depending on the length of the key used. But even so there are two major problems: many algorithms allow use of different length keys at different times, and any algorithm can forgo use of the full key length possible. Thus, Blowfish and RC5 are block cipher algorithms whose design specifically allowed for several key lengths, and who cannot therefore be said to have any particular strength with respect to brute force key search. Furthermore, US export regulations restrict key length for exportable cryptographic products and in several cases in the 1980s and 1990s (e.g., famously in the case of Lotus Notes' export approval) only partial keys were used, decreasing 'strength' against brute force attack for those (export) versions. More or less the same thing happened outside the US as well, as for example in the case of more than one of the cryptographic algorithms in the GSM cellular telephone standard. The term is commonly used to convey that some algorithm is suitable for some task in cryptography or information security, but also resists cryptanalysis and has no, or fewer, security weaknesses. Tasks are varied, and might include: * generating randomness * encrypting data * providing a method to ensure data integrity Cryptographically strong would seem to mean that the described method has some kind of maturity, perhaps even approved for use against different kinds of systematic attacks in theory and/or practice. Indeed, that the method may resist those attacks long enough to protect the information carried (and what stands behind the information) for a useful length of time. But due to the complexity and subtlety of the field, neither is almost ever the case. Since such assurances are not actually available in real practice, sleight of hand in language which implies that they are will generally be misleading. There will always be uncertainty as advances (e.g., in cryptanalytic theory or merely affordable computer capacity) may reduce the effort needed to successfully use some attack method against an algorithm. In addition, actual use of cryptographic algorithms requires their encapsulation in a cryptosystem, and doing so often introduces vulnerabilities which are not due to faults in an algorithm. For example, essentially all algorithms require random choice of keys, and any cryptosystem which does not provide such keys will be subject to attack regardless of any attack resistant qualities of the encryption algorithm(s) used. ==Legal issues== Since use of strong cryptography makes the job of intelligence agencies more difficult, many countries have enacted laws or regulations restricting or simply banning the non-official use of strong cryptography. For instance, the United States has defined cryptographic products as munitions since World War II and has prohibited export of cryptography beyond a certain 'strength' (measured in part by key size). President and government of Russia in 90s has issued a few decrees formally banning uncertified cryptosystems from use by government agencies. Presedential decree of 1995 also attempted to ban individuals from producing and selling cryptography systems without having appropriate license, but it wasn't enforced in any way as it was suspected to be contradictory the Russian Constitution of 1993 and wasn't a law per se.The sources provided here are in Russian. To alleviate the problem of lack of English-written ones the sources are cited by using official government documents. The decree of ‚Ññ313 issued in 2012 further amended previous ones allowing to produce and distribute products with embedded cryptosystems and requiring no license as such, even though it declares some restrictions. France had quite strict regulations in this field, but has relaxed them in recent years. == Examples Strong=== * PGP is generally considered an example of strong cryptography, with versions running under most popular operating systems and on various hardware platforms. The open source standard for PGP operations is OpenPGP, and GnuPG is an implementation of that standard from the FSF. However, the IDEA signature key in classical PGP is only 64bit long, therefor no longer immune against collision attacks. OpenPGP therefore uses SHA2 integrity and AES cryptography. * The AES algorithm is considered strong after being selected in a lengthy selection process that was open and involved numerous tests. * The Elliptic curve cryptography is another system which is based on a graphical geometrical function * The latest version of TLS protocol (version 1.3), used to secure Internet transactions, is generally considered strong. Several vulnerabilities exist in previous versions, including demonstrated attacks such as POODLE. Worse, some cipher-suites are deliberately weakened to use a 40-bit effective key to allow export under pre-1996 U.S. regulations. ===Weak=== Examples that are not considered cryptographically strong include: * The DES, whose 56-bit keys allow attacks via exhaustive search. * Triple-DES (3DES / EDE3-DES). see DES - this also suffers a meanwhile known phenomenom, called the \\"sweet32\\" or \\"birthday oracle\\" * Wired Equivalent Privacy which is subject to a number of attacks due to flaws in its design. * SSL v2 and v3. TLS 1.0 and TLS 1.1 are also deprecated now [see RFC7525] because of irreversible flaws which are still present by design and because they do not provide elliptical handshake (EC) for ciphers, no modern cryptography, no CCM/GCM ciphermodes. TLS1.x are also announced off by the PCIDSS 3.2 for commercial business/banking implementations on web frontends. Only TLS1.2 and TLS 1.3 are allowed and recommended, modern ciphers, handshakes and ciphermodes must be used exclusively. * The MD5 and SHA-1 hash functions. * The RC4 stream cipher. * The Clipper Chip, a failed initiative of the U.S. government that included key escrow provisions, allowing the government to gain access to the keys. * The 40-bit Content Scramble System used to encrypt most DVD-Video discs. * Almost all classical ciphers. * Most rotary ciphers, such as the Enigma machine. * some flawy RSA implementations exist which are suffering an algorithm problem, leading to weak, biased keys (\\"ROBOT\\" Vulnerability, the \\"Bleichenbacher Oracle\\") * RSA keys weaker than 2048 bits * DH keys weaker than 2048 bits * ECDHE keys weaker than 192 bits, also not all known older named curves still in use for this are vetted \\"safe\\". * DHE/EDHE is guessable/weak when using/ re-using known default prime values on the server * SHA-1 integrity (and everything weaker) is no longer immune against collision attacks. * CBC blockcipher subcoding of ciphertext is considered weak for TLS (CCM/GCM modes are recommended now) ==NotesReferences== * Cryptography - The Global Tide of Change, Cato Institute Briefing Paper no. 51 ==See also== * 40-bit encryption * Cipher security summary * Export of cryptography * Comparison of cryptography libraries * FBI‚ÄìApple encryption dispute * Hash function security summary * Security level Category:Cryptography ","title":"Strong cryptography"},{"id":"2223945","text":"Steps to an Ecology of Mind is a collection of Gregory Bateson's short works over his long and varied career.

Her mother, who raised her alone, was a Scottish-Irish legal secretary. Her father was a Somali-born dock worker, although Poly Styrene used to tell the press that he was a dispossessed Somali aristocrat. As a teenager, Styrene was a hippie. At age 15, she ran away from home with ¬£3 in her pocket, and hitchhiked from one music festival to another, staying at hippie crash pads. Thinking of this as a challenge to survive, her adventure ended when she stepped on a rusty nail while bathing in a stream and had to be treated for septicaemia. Having been, 'an itinerant traveller, alternative fashion designer and a failed pop-reggae singer',Garry Mulholland Fear of Music, p.51 after seeing the Sex Pistols performance at the Pier Pavilion Hastings on the south coast of England on 3 July 1976 (her 19th birthday) she decided to form the punk band X-Ray Spex. ==Music careerDemo and first single=== Styrene recorded her first demo album in 1975, when she was 18 years old. Her manager enlisted Ted Bunting to produce the record. In 1976, Styrene released her first single under her real name, Mari Elliott. Titled \\"Silly Billy\\", it was a reggae track, with some touches of the then popular ska style. Her daughter Celeste has called it 'similar to Althea and Donna, who she really liked'.Dayglo, the Poly Styrene Story, p.38 She co-wrote the B-side \\"What A Way\\" with the record's producer, Falcon Stuart. The single came in a GTO Records sleeve. ===X-Ray Spex=== After watching a very early gig by the Sex Pistols in an empty hall on Hastings Pier, playing a set of cover songs, she was inspired to put an ad in the paper for 'young punx who want to stick it together' to form a band. So it was from that, she went as singer with X-Ray Spex, Poly Styrene, a name she chose from the 'Yellow Pages' when she was 'looking for a name of the time, something plastic.' She was described by Billboard as the \\"archetype for the modern-day feminist punk\\"; because she wore dental braces, stood against the typical sex object female of 1970s rock star, sported a gaudy Dayglo wardrobe, and was of mixed race. She was \\"one of the least conventional front-persons in rock history, male or female\\". They launched their debut single in 1977. In 1978, after a gig in Doncaster, South Yorkshire, Styrene had a vision of a pink light in the sky and felt objects crackling when she touched them. Thinking she was hallucinating, her mother took her to the hospital where Marianne was misdiagnosed with schizophrenia, sectioned, and told she would never work again. Although she missed playing at the time, in hindsight, she felt that getting out of the public eye was good for her. She was diagnosed with bipolar disorder in 1991. ===Solo career=== After the original line-up of X-Ray Spex broke up, Poly Styrene recorded a solo album, Translucence, in 1980. The album abandoned X-Ray Spex's loud guitar work for a quieter and more jazzy sound that has since been described as anticipating later work by Everything but the Girl. In 1986, she released the EP God's & Godesses on the Awesome record label. A New Age solo album, Flower Aeroplane, followed in 2004. She described herself as \\"an observer, not a suffering artist writing from tortured experiences. I was playing with words and ideas. Having a laugh about everything, sending it up.\\" In 2007, Styrene was invited to the Concrete Jungle festival in Camber Sands, by her friend Goldblade's John Robb where she and the gathering's organiser, Symond Lawes, agreed to initiate a 30-year celebration of X-Ray Spex's debut album, Germfree Adolescents. They decided to hold a live show at the Camden Roundhouse, which was a sell-out event on 6 September 2008. A live album/DVD of this event, Live @ The Roundhouse London 2008, was released in November 2009 on the Year Zero label by Future Noise Music. She made a guest appearance at the 2008 30th anniversary concert of Rock Against Racism in Victoria Park, London, performing \\"Oh Bondage Up Yours!\\" with guest musicians Drew McConnell (of Babyshambles and Helsinki) and 'Flash' David Wright playing saxophone. That same year, she dueted with Goldblade's John Robb on a remix of Goldblade's \\"City of Christmas Ghosts\\". In March 2009, Styrene joined other members of PRS for Music in criticising Google for allegedly not paying a fair share of royalties to musicians. This followed Google's removal of millions of videos from YouTube because of a royalties dispute with the organisation. NME.com announced on 29 October 2010 that Poly Styrene was to release a solo album titled Generation Indigo, produced by Martin Glover (aka Youth from Killing Joke), in March 2011. She released a free download of \\"Black Christmas\\" in November 2010. Inspired by a Los Angeles killing spree of a man dressed as Santa Claus, \\"Black Christmas\\" was written in collaboration with her daughter, Celeste. Styrene announced \\"Virtual Boyfriend\\" as the first single from the new album Generation Indigo via Spinner Music, as well as the launch of her new website. \\"Virtual Boyfriend\\" was released on 21 March 2011, and featured an animated promotional video directed by Ben Wheele. Generation Indigo was released on 28 March 2011, via Future Noise Music. The album received critical acclaim, including a perfect 10 out of 10 score in Artrocker magazine, and 8 out of 10 in The Daily Telegraph newspaper. Generation Indigo was also chosen as Album of the Day on UK radio station BBC 6 Music. It was released in the US on 24 April 2011, the day before her death. \\"Ghoulish\\" was the first posthumous single to be released from Generation Indigo, and was backed by a remix from Hercules and Love Affair. New York magazine's music journalist Nitsuh Abebe described her singing style with X-Ray Spex as \\"in a bold, keening yelp\\" and \\"fierce but fiercely feminine.\\" The band U2 paid tribute to Styrene during the \\"HerStory\\" video tribute to notable women in 2017 for the 30th anniversary of The Joshua Tree during a performance of \\"Ultraviolet (Light My Way)\\" from the band's 1991 album Achtung Baby. ==Personal life== In 1983, Styrene was initiated into the Hare Krishna movement and recorded at their recording studios while living as a devotee at Bhaktivedanta Manor. She lived as a Hare Krishna convert in Hertfordshire and London from 1983 to 1988. Styrene was a vegetarian. In March 2009, Styrene took part in the inaugural Instigate Debate night. The night's theme was modern day consumerism. Other current issues were also discussed. She lived in St Leonards, East Sussex. ==Death== In February 2011, in an interview published in The Sunday Times magazine, which largely focused on her past and present relationship with her daughter Celeste, Styrene revealed that she had been treated for breast cancer, and that it had spread to her spine and lungs. She died of metastatic breast cancer on 25 April 2011, at the age of 53. == Documentary and biography == Styrene is the subject of an upcoming documentary Poly Styrene: I Am A Clich√© that is being crowd-funded as of March 2017. The documentary was directed by Paul Sng and was co-written by Styrene's daughter Celeste Bell (who also narrates) and author Zo√´ Howe.

The band consisted of John Ferdinando, Peter Howell, and Lee Menelaus. They released one privately pressed album under the band name, Fly Away, on the Merlin label. This LP has commanded high prices amongst collectors especially after a mid-nineties CD release. In total, the partnership released five albums credited without the band name. The members of Agincourt were also involved in writing tracks for Alice Through The Looking Glass, Ithaca, and Tomorrow Come Some Day. The group broke up in the early 1970s when Howell secured a BBC sound engineering position and worked on the soundtrack for Doctor Who. Ferdinando would sporadically involve himself in the folk music scene thereafter. As for Menelaus, she performed small roles of vocals and spoken- word on soundtracks. ==References * Site with details of various Peter Howell and John Ferdinando projects Category:Psychedelic folk groups ","title":"Agincourt (band)"},{"id":"2223999","text":"The family Micrococcaceae includes bacterial genera of Gram positive cocci that inhabit the air and skin, such as Micrococcus luteus. ==Phylogeny== The currently accepted taxonomy is based on the List of Prokaryotic names with Standing in Nomenclature (LPSN) and National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) and the phylogeny is based on 16S rRNA-based LTP release 106 by 'The All-Species Living Tree' Project 'The All-Species Living Tree' Project.

ARMs are a spectrum of different congenital anomalies which vary from fairly minor lesions to complex anomalies. The cause of ARMs is unknown; the genetic basis of these anomalies is very complex because of their anatomical variability. In 8% of patients, genetic factors are clearly associated with ARMs. Anorectal malformation in Currarino syndrome represents the only association for which the gene HLXB9 has been identified. == Types == There are other forms of anorectal malformations though imperforate anus is most common. Other variants include anterior ectopic anus. This form is more commonly seen in females and presents with constipation. ==Presentation== There are several forms of imperforate anus and anorectal malformations. The new classification is in relation of the type of associated fistula.Pena A, Levitt MA. (2006) \\"Anorectal Malformations\\" in: Grosfeld et al. Ed. \\"Pediatric Surgery\\", Mosly The classical Wingspread classification was in low and high anomalies: * A low lesion, in which the colon remains close to the skin. In this case, there may be a stenosis (narrowing) of the anus, or the anus may be missing altogether, with the rectum ending in a blind pouch. * A high lesion, in which the colon is higher up in the pelvis and there is a fistula connecting the rectum and the bladder, urethra or the vagina. * A persistent cloaca (from the term cloaca, an analogous orifice in reptiles and amphibians), in which the rectum, vagina and urinary tract are joined into a single channel. Imperforate anus is usually present along with other birth defects‚Äîspinal problems, heart problems, tracheoesophageal fistula, esophageal atresia, renal anomalies and limb anomalies are among the possibilities, collectively being called the VACTERL association.Colorectal Center, Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center. \\"Anorectal Malformations / Imperforate Anus.\\" Retrieved July, 2005. ===Associated anomalies=== Imperforate anus is associated with an increased incidence of some other specific anomalies as well, together being called the VACTERL association. Other entities associated with an imperforate anus are trisomies 18 and 21, the cat-eye syndrome (partial trisomy or tetrasomy of a maternally derived chromosome 22), Baller‚ÄìGerold syndrome, Currarino syndrome, caudal regression syndrome, FG syndrome, Johanson‚ÄìBlizzard syndrome, McKusick‚ÄìKaufman syndrome, Pallister‚ÄìHall syndrome, short rib‚Äìpolydactyly syndrome type 1, Townes‚ÄìBrocks syndrome, 13q deletion syndrome, urorectal septum malformation sequence and the OEIS complex (omphalocele, exstrophy of the cloaca, imperforate anus, spinal defects). == Diagnosis == When an infant is born with an anorectal malformation, it is usually detected quickly as it is a very obvious defect. Doctors will then determine the type of birth defect the child was born with and whether or not there are any associated malformations. It is important to determine the presence of any associated defects during the newborn period in order to treat them early and avoid further sequelae. There are two main categories of anorectal malformations: those that require a protective colostomy and those that do not. The decision to open a colostomy is usually taken within the first 24 hours of birth. Sonography can be used to determine the type of imperforate anus. ==Treatment== Imperforate anus usually requires immediate surgery to open a passage for feces unless a fistula can be relied on until corrective surgery takes place. Depending on the severity of the imperforate, it is treated either with a perineal anoplasty or with a colostomy. While many surgical techniques to definitively repair anorectal malformations have been described, the posterior sagittal approach (PSARP) has become the most popular. It involves dissection of the perineum without entry into the abdomen and 90% of defects in boys can be repaired this way. ==Prognosis== With a high lesion, many children have problems controlling bowel function and most also become constipated. With a low lesion, children generally have good bowel control, but they may still become constipated. For children who have a poor outcome for continence and constipation from the initial surgery, further surgery to better establish the angle between the anus and the rectum may improve continence and, for those with a large rectum, surgery to remove that dilated segment may significantly improve the bowel control for the patient. An antegrade enema mechanism can be established by joining the appendix to the skin (Malone stoma); however, establishing more normal anatomy is the priority. ==Epidemiology== Imperforate anus has an estimated incidence of 1 in 5000 births.Texas Pediatric Associates. \\"Imperforate anus.\\" Retrieved 13 July 2005.MedLine Plus. \\"Imperforate anus.\\" Retrieved 13 July 2005. It affects boys and girls with similar frequency. However, imperforate anus will present as the low version 90% of the time in females and 50% of the time in males. Imperforate anus is an occasional complication of sacrococcygeal teratoma. ==History== 7th-century Byzantine physician Paulus Aegineta described a surgical treatment for imperforate anus for the first time. 10th-century Persian physician Haly Abbas was the first to highlight preserving the sphincter muscles throughout the surgery and the prevention of strictures with a stent. He has reported the use of wine for wound care in this surgery. Some reports of children surviving this surgery are available from the early medieval Islamic era. == References  External links == * Medline Plus Medical Encyclopedia: Imperforate anus Category:Congenital disorders of digestive system Category:Colorectal surgery Category:Rectum ","title":"Imperforate anus"},{"id":"2224021","text":"Tibetan Gelug monk and sand mandala Prayer flags Woodblock printing Tibet developed a distinct culture due to its geographic and climatic conditions. While influenced by neighboring cultures from China, India, and Nepal, the Himalayan region's remoteness and inaccessibility have preserved distinct local influences, and stimulated the development of its distinct culture. Tibetan Buddhism has exerted a particularly strong influence on Tibetan culture since its introduction in the seventh century. Buddhist missionaries who came mainly from India, Nepal and China introduced arts and customs from India and China. Art, literature, and music all contain elements of the prevailing Buddhist beliefs, and Buddhism itself has adopted a unique form in Tibet, influenced by the B√∂n tradition and other local beliefs. Several works on astronomy, astrology and medicine were translated from Sanskrit and Classical Chinese. The general appliances of civilization have come from China, among many things and skill imported were the making of butter, cheese, barley-beer, pottery, watermills and the national beverage, butter tea. Tibet's specific geographic and climatic conditions have encouraged reliance on pastoralism, as well as the development of a different cuisine from surrounding regions, which fits the needs of the human body in these high altitudes. ==Tibetan language== Ethnolinguistic map of Tibet The Tibetan language is spoken in a variety of dialects in all parts of the Tibetan- inhabited area which covers 1/2 Million square miles. Some of these dialects are tonal like the Chinese language, while others remain non-tonal. Historically Tibet was divided into three cultural provinces called U-Tsang, Kham and Amdo. Each one of these three provinces has developed its own distinct dialect of Tibetan. Most widely spoken is the Lhasa dialect, also called Standard Tibetan, which is spoken in Central Tibet and also in Exile by most Tibetans. In Kham the Khams Tibetan dialect is spoken and in Amdo the Amdo Tibetan dialect. The Tibetan dialects are subject to the Tibetic languages which are part of the Tibeto-Burman languages. Modern Tibetan derives from Classical Tibetan, which is the written norm, and from Old Tibetan. The official language of Bhutan, Dzongkha, is also closely related to Tibetan. ==Visual arts== Tibetan art is deeply religious in nature, a form of religious art. It spreads over a wide range of paintings, frescos, statues, ritual objects, coins, ornaments and furniture. Tibetan art is deeply religious sacred art. Tagong Monastery, 2009, using butter lamps ===Mahayana Buddhist influence=== As Mahayana Buddhism emerged as a separate school in the fourth century BCE. It emphasized the role of bodhisattvas, compassionate beings who forgo their personal escape to nirvana in order to assist others. From an early time various bodhisattvas were also subjects of statuary art. Tibetan Buddhism, as an offspring of Mahayana Buddhism, inherited this tradition. A common bodhisattva depicted in Tibetan art is the Avalokite≈õvara, often portrayed as a four or a thousand-armed saint with an eye in the middle of each hand, representing the all-seeing compassionate one who hears our requests. The Dalai Lama is believed to be his reincarnation. ===Tantric influence=== Most of the typical Tibetan Buddhist art can be seen as part of the practice of tantra. A surprising aspect of Tantric Buddhism is the common representation of fierce deities, often depicted with angry faces, circles of flame, or with the skulls of the dead. These images represent Dharmapalas \\"Protectors\\"; their fearsome bearing belies their true compassionate nature. Their wrath represents their dedication to the protection of the dharma as well as to the protection of the specific tantric practices to prevent corruption or disruption of the practice. ===B√∂n influence=== The indigenous shamanistic religion of the Himalayas is known as B√∂n. B√∂n contributes a pantheon of local tutelary deities to Tibetan art. In Tibetan temples, known as lhakhang, statues of Gautama Buddha or Padmasambhava are often paired with statues of the tutelary deity of the district who often appears angry or dark. These gods once inflicted harm and sickness on the local citizens but after the arrival of Padmasambhava, these negative forces have been subdued and now must serve Buddhism. === Rugs === The Tibetan uses rugs for almost any domestic use from flooring to wall hanging to horse saddles. Tibetan rug making is an ancient art and craft in the tradition of Tibetan people. These rugs are primarily made from Tibetan highland sheep's virgin wool. The Tibetan uses rugs for almost any domestic use from flooring to wall hanging to horse saddles. Traditionally the best rugs are from Gyantse, a city which is known for its rugs. The process of making Tibetan rugs is unique in the sense that almost everything is done by hand. But with the introduction of modern technology, a few aspects of the rug making processes have been taken over by machine primarily because of cost, the disappearance of knowledge etc. Moreover, some new finishing touches are also made possible by machine. Tibetan rugs are big business in not only Tibet, but also Nepal, where Tibetan immigrants brought with them their knowledge of rug making. Currently in Nepal the rug business is one of the largest industries in the country and there are many rug exporters. ===Painting=== Thangkas, a syncrestistic art of Chinese hanging scrolls with Nepalese and Kashmiri painting, first survive from the eleventh century. Rectangular and intricately painted on cotton or linen, they are usually traditional compositions depicting deities, famous monks, and other religious, astrological, and theological subjects, and sometimes mandalas. To ensure that the image will not fade, the painting is framed in colorful silk brocades, and stored rolled up. The word thangka means \\"something to roll\\" and refers to the fact that thangkas can easily be rolled up for transportation. Besides thangkas, Tibetan Buddhist wall paintings can be found on temple walls as frescos and furniture and many other items have ornamental painting.

Tibetan literature has a historical span of over 1300 years. Perhaps the best known category of Tibetan literature outside of Tibet are the epic stories - particularly the famous Epic of King Gesar. == Architecture == The White Palace of the Potala Palace Tagong Monastery with prayer flags Tibetan architecture contains Chinese and Indian influences, and reflects a deeply Buddhist approach. The prayer wheel, along with two deer or dragons, can be seen on nearly every gompa in Tibet. The design of stupas (ch√∂rtens) can vary, from roundish walls in Kham to squarish, four-sided walls in Ladakh. The most unusual feature of Tibetan architecture is that many of the houses and monasteries are built on elevated, sunny sites facing the south, and are often made of a mixture of rocks, wood, cement and earth. Little fuel is available for heat or lighting, so flat roofs are built to conserve heat, and multiple windows are constructed to let in sunlight. Walls are usually sloped inwards at 10 degrees as a precaution against frequent earthquakes in the mountainous area. ===World Heritage Site=== Standing at 117 meters in height and 360 meters in width, the Potala Palace, designated as a World Heritage site in 1994 and extended to include the Norbulingka area in 2001, is considered a most important example of Tibetan architecture. Formerly the residence of the Dalai Lamas, it contains over a thousand rooms within thirteen stories, and houses portraits of the past Dalai Lamas and statues of the Buddha. It is divided into the outer White Palace, which serves as the administrative quarters, and the inner Red Quarters, which houses the assembly hall of the Lamas, chapels, 10,000 shrines and a vast library of Buddhist scriptures. ===Traditional architecture=== Traditional Kham architecture is seen in most dwellings in Kangding. Kham houses tend to be spacious and fit in well with their environment. Their floors and ceilings are wooden, as houses are throughout in Kangding. [This article is dated. Modern Kangding city is now rebuilt, eliminating the earlier fire-prone wooden architecture]. Horizontal timber beams support the roof and these in turn are supported by wooden columns. Although the area has been heavily logged, wood is imported and used abundantly for housing. The Garz√™ Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture of Kham, surrounded by forests, is known for its beautiful wooden houses built in a range of styles and lavishly decorated with wooden ornamentation. The interiors of houses are usually paneled with wood and the cabinetry is ornately decorated. Although various materials are used in the well-built houses, it is the skilful carpentry that is striking. This skill is passed down from father to son and there appear to be plenty of carpenters. However a threat to traditional Tibetan carpentry is the growing use of concrete structures. Some consider the increased use of concrete as a deliberate infiltration of the Chinese influence into Tibet. In Gaba Township, where there are few Han Chinese, almost all the structures are traditional.. ===Architecture and monastic architecture=== Gyantse Kumbum, a good example of Dzong architecture Potala Palace The events that took place in Tibet in the twentieth century exacted a heavy toll on Tibetan monastic architecture. Under the 13th Dalai Lama, the Tengyeling monastery was demolished in 1914 for seeking to come to terms with the Chinese.Heinrich Harrer, Seven Years in Tibet, with a new epilogue by the author. Translated from the German by Richard Graves. With an introduction by Peter Fleming, First Tarcher/Putnam Hardcover Edition, 1997 (): \\"The penalties for political offenses are very strict. People still speak of the monks of Tengyeling, who forty years ago sought to come to terms with the Chinese. Their monastery was demolished and their names blotted out. Under Regent Taktra, the Sera monastery was bombarded with howitzers and ransacked by the Tibetan army in 1947 for siding with former regent Reting.Heinrich Harrer, Seven Years in Tibet, op. cit.: \\"It was not until the government bombarded the town and monastery of Sera with howitzers and knocked down a few houses that the resistance ceased.(...) The monastery was thoroughly ransacked by the soldiers, and for many weeks afterward gold cups, brocades, and other valuable objects kept turning up in the bazaars. It is important to see that Sera monastery was by no means destroyed but only looted partially. The major destruction happened during the Cultural Revolution. China's Cultural Revolution resulted in the deterioration or loss of Buddhist monasteries, both by intentional destruction and through lack of protection and maintenance. Starting in the 1980s, Tibetans have begun to restore those monasteries that survived. This has become an international effort. Experts are teaching the Tibetans how to restore the building and save the remaining monasteries on the eastern plateau. Monasteries such as the Kumbum Monastery continue to be affected by Chinese politics. Simbiling Monastery was completely flattened in 1967, although it has to some degree been restored. Tashi Lhunpo Monastery shows the influence of Mongol architecture. Tradruk Temple is one of the oldest in Tibet, said to have been first built in the 7th century during the reign of Songtsen Gampo of the Tibetan Empire (605?-650). Jokhang was also originally built under Songsten Gampo. Jokhang Temple is the most splendid surviving building of the Tubo period in Tibet and also the earliest civil structural building in Tibet. It integrated the architectural styles of Tibet, Tang Dynasty of China, Nepal, and India, and has become a model of Tibetan religious architecture for thousands of years. Tsurphu Monastery was founded by D√ºsum Khyenpa, 1st Karmapa Lama (1110‚Äì1193) in 1159, after he visited the site and laid the foundation for an establishment of a seat there by making offerings to the local protectors, dharmapalas and genius loci. In 1189 he revisited the site and founded his main seat there. The monastery grew to hold 1000 monks. Tsozong Gongba Monastery is a small shrine built around the fourteenth century Palcho Monastery was founded in 1418 and known for its kumbum which has 108 chapels on its four floors. Chokorgyel Monastery, founded in 1509 the 2nd Dalai Lama once housed 500 monks but was completely destroyed during the Cultural Revolution. Ramoche Temple is an important temple in Lhasa. The original building complex was strongly influenced by Tang dynasty architectural style as it was first built by Han Chinese architects in the middle of the 7th century. Princess Wencheng took charge of this project and ordered the temple be erected facing east to show her homesickness. See List of Tibetan monasteries.

Women wear dark-colored wrap dresses over a blouse, and a colorfully striped, woven wool apron, called pangden signals that she is married. Men and women both wear long sleeves even in summer months. In his 1955 book, Tibetan Marches, Andr√© Migot describes Tibetan clothing as follows: woman's dress, Field Museum of Natural History Tibetan herdsman's coat, fur-lined.

Butter tea Tibetan kitchen items. The butter churn is of a small size with shoulder strap, suitable for nomadic life. The Cuisine of Tibet is quite distinct from that of its neighbours. Tibetan crops must be able to grow at high altitudes, although a few areas in Tibet are low enough to grow such crops as rice, oranges, lemon and bananas. The most important crop in Tibet is barley. Flour milled from roasted barley, called tsampa, is the staple food of Tibet. It is eaten mostly mixed with the national beverage, the butter tea. Butter tea perfectly fits the needs of the human body in these high altitudes as it contains butter (protein and fat), milk (protein, fat and calcium), salt and tea. Tibetan cuisine contains a wide variety of dishes. The most famous are Momos (Tibetan dumplings). Balep is Tibetan bread eaten for breakfast and lunch. There many other types of balep bread and fried pies. Thukpa is noodle soup. It consists of noodles of various shapes, vegetables, and meat in broth. Tibetan cuisine is traditionally served with bamboo chopsticks, in contrast to other Himalayan cuisines which are eaten by hand. Small soup bowls are also used by Tibetans, and the rich are known to have used bowls of gold and silver. Since only a few crops grow at such high altitudes, many features of Tibetan cuisine are imported, such as tea, rice and others. Meat dishes are likely to be yak, goat, or mutton, often dried, or cooked into a spicy stew with potatoes. Tibetans would never eat dogs and fish only in special cases as dogs are regarded as domestic animals and also guard dogs, and fishes are one of the Eight Auspicious Symbols of Buddhism. Mustard seed is cultivated in Tibet, and therefore features strongly in its cuisine. Yak yogurt, butter and cheese are frequently eaten, and well- prepared yogurt is considered something of a prestige item. In larger Tibetan towns and cities many restaurants nowadays serve Sichuan-style Chinese food. Western imports and fusion dishes, such as fried yak and chips, are also popular. Nevertheless, many small restaurants serving traditional Tibetan dishes persist in both cities and the countryside. Jasmine tea and yak butter tea are drunk. Alcoholic beverages include: *Chang, a beer usually made from barley *Raksi, a rice wine ==Tibetan family life== Tibetans traditionally venerate their elders within their families. ===Polyandry and polygyny=== Tibetans used to practice polyandry widely.Stein, R. A. Tibetan Civilization (1922). English edition with minor revisions in 1972 Stanford University Press, pp. 97-98. (cloth); . In his memoirs about his life in Tibet in the 1940s, Austrian writer Heinrich Harrer reports encountering nomads practising polyandry: \\"We were astonished to find polyandry practised among the nomads.\\" \\"When several brothers share the same wife, the eldest is always the master in the household and the others have rights only when he is away or amusing himself elsewhere.\\"Harrer, Heinrich. Seven Years in Tibet, with a new epilogue by the author. Translated from the German by Richard Graves. With an introduction by Peter Fleming, First Tarcher/Putnam Hardcover Edition, 1997. . Harrer also mentions the practice of polygyny in one particular case: a man marrying \\"several daughters of a house in which there is no son and heir.\\" \\"The arrangement prevents the family fortune from being dispersed.\\"Harrer, Heinrich. Seven Years in Tibet, op. cit. == Calendar == Butter lamps The Tibetan calendar is the lunisolar calendar, that is, the Tibetan year is composed of either 12 or 13 lunar months, each beginning and ending with a new moon. A thirteenth month is added approximately every three years, so that an average Tibetan year is equal to the solar year. The name of the months are ‡ºº ‡Ωò‡ΩÜ‡Ω¥‡ºã‡Ωü‡æ≥‡ºã‡Ωñ‡ºç‡ºΩ January, ‡ºº ‡Ωë‡Ωñ‡Ωº‡ºã‡Ωü‡æ≥‡ºã‡Ωñ‡ºç‡ºΩ February, ‡ºº ‡Ωì‡ΩÇ‡ºã‡Ωî‡ºã‡Ωü‡æ≥‡ºã‡Ωñ‡ºç‡ºΩ‡ºã March, ‡ºº ‡Ω¶‡ºã‡ΩÇ‡ºã‡Ωü‡æ≥‡ºã‡Ωñ‡ºç‡ºã‡ºΩ April, ‡ºº ‡ºΩ‡Ω¶‡æ£‡æ≤‡Ωº‡Ωì‡ºã‡Ωü‡æ≥‡ºã‡Ωñ‡ºç‡ºΩ May, ‡ºº ‡ΩÜ‡Ω¥‡ºã‡Ω¶‡æü‡Ωº‡Ωë‡ºã‡Ωü‡æ≥‡ºã‡Ωñ‡ºç‡ºΩ June, ‡ºº ‡ΩÇ‡æ≤‡Ωº‡ºã‡Ωñ‡Ωû‡Ω≤‡Ωì‡ºã‡Ωü‡æ≥‡ºã‡Ωñ‡ºç‡ºΩ July, ‡ºº ‡ΩÅ‡æ≤‡Ω¥‡Ωò‡Ω¶‡ºã‡Ω¶‡æü‡Ωë‡Ωº‡ºç‡ºΩ August, ‡ºº ‡Ωë‡Ωñ‡æ±‡Ω¥‡ºã‡ΩÇ‡Ω¥‡ºã‡Ωü‡æ≥‡ºã‡Ωñ‡ºç‡ºΩ September, ‡ºº ‡Ω¶‡æ®‡Ω≤‡Ωì‡ºã‡Ωë‡æ≤‡Ω¥‡ΩÇ‡ºã‡Ωü‡æ≥‡ºã‡Ωñ‡ºç‡ºΩ October, ‡ºº ‡ΩÇ‡Ωº‡ºã‡Ωü‡æ≥‡ºã‡Ωñ‡ºç‡ºΩ November and ‡ºº ‡Ω¢‡æí‡æ±‡Ω£‡ºã‡Ωü‡æ≥‡ºã‡Ωñ‡ºç‡ºΩ December. -, but the fourth month which is called the saka dawa, celebrating the birth and enlightenment of Buddha.http://www.china- guide.de/english/festivals__in_china/tibetan_festivals/saka_dawa_festival.html The Tibetan New Year celebration is Losar. Each year is associated with an animal and an element. The animals alternate in the following order: { border=\\"1\\"   RabbitDragonSnakeHorseGoatMonkeyRoosterDogPigRatOxTiger } The elements alternate in the following order: { border=\\"1\\"   FireEarthIronWaterWood } Each element is associated with two consecutive years, first in its male aspect, then in its female aspect. For example, a male Earth-Dragon year is followed by a female Earth-Snake year, then by a male Iron-Horse year. The sex may be omitted, as it can be inferred from the animal. The element-animal designations recur in cycles of 60 years, starting with a (female) Fire-Rabbit year. These big cycles are numbered. The first cycle started in 1027. Therefore, 2005 roughly corresponds to the (female) Wood-Rooster year of the 17th cycle, and 2008 corresponds to a (male) Earth-Rat year of the same cycle. ===Days of the week=== Tibetan inscription on a stupa Tent made of yak wool The days of the week are named for celestial bodies. {  - !

It symbolizes goodwill, auspiciousness and compassion. It is usually made of silk, and the color is generally white to symbolise the pure heart of the giver.Khata/Tibet \\"roof of the world\\"\\\\ Purity is an important aspect of the Khata. It would be regarded impolite, even rude, to offer a dirty Khata. The khata is a highly versatile gift. It can be presented at any festive occasions to a host or at weddings, funerals, births, graduations, arrivals and departure of guests etc. The Tibetans commonly give a kind acknowledgment of \\"Tashi Delek\\" (meaning good luck) at the time of presenting. A gift traditionally given at the time of a new birth is that of an ibex figurine, as described below by August Hermann Francke. > \\"Our Christian evangelist at Khalatse had become a father a few weeks > before, and the people of the village had made presents of \\"flour-ibex\\" to > him and his wife.

First and foremost Tibetan music is religious music, reflecting the profound influence of Tibetan Buddhism on the culture. Chanting Tibetan music often involves chanting in Tibetan or Sanskrit as an integral part of the religion. These chants are complex, often recitations of sacred texts or in celebration of various festivals. Yang chanting, performed without metrical timing, is accompanied by resonant drums and low, sustained syllables. Other styles include those unique to the various schools of Tibetan Buddhism, such as the classical music of the popular Gelug school and the romantic music of the Nyingma, Sakya and Kagyu schools. Secular Tibetan music has been promoted by organizations like the 14th Dalai Lama's Tibetan Institute of Performing Arts. This organization specialized in the lhamo, an operatic style, before branching out into other styles, including dance music like toeshey and nangma. Nangma is especially popular in the karaoke bars of the urban center of Tibet, Lhasa. Another form of popular music is the classical gar style, which is performed at rituals and ceremonies. Lu are a type of songs that feature glottal vibrations and high pitches which are typically sung by nomads. There are also epic bards who sing of Tibet's national hero, Gesar. Modern and popular Tibetans are well represented in Chinese popular culture. Tibetan singers are particularly known for their strong vocal abilities, which many attribute to the high altitudes of the Tibetan Plateau. Tseten Dolma (ÊâçÊó¶ÂçìÁéõ) rose to fame in the 1960s for her music-and-dance suite \\"The Earth is Red\\". Kelsang Metok (Ê†ºÊ°ëÊ¢ÖÊúµ) is a popular singer who combines traditional Tibetan songs with elements of Chinese and Western pop. Purba Rgyal (Pubajia or Ëí≤Â∑¥Áî≤) was the 2006 winner of Haonaner, the Chinese version of American Idol. In 2006, he starred in Sherwood Hu's Prince of the Himalayas, an adaptation of Shakespeare's Hamlet, set in ancient Tibet and featuring an all-Tibetan cast. Tibetan music has influenced certain styles of Western music, such as new-age. Philip Glass, Henry Eichheim and other composers are known for Tibetan elements in their music. The first Western fusion with Tibetan music was Tibetan Bells in 1971. The soundtrack to Kundun, by Glass, has also popularized Tibetan music in the West. Citipati mask depicting MahƒÅkƒÅla Foreign styles of popular music have also had a major impact within Tibet. Indian ghazal and filmi are very popular, as is rock and roll, an American style which has produced Tibetan performers like Rangzen Shonu. Since the relaxation of some laws in the 1980s, Tibetan pop, popularized by the likes of Yadong, Jampa Tsering, 3-member group AJIA, 4-member group Gao Yuan Hong, 5-member group Gao Yuan Feng, and Dechen Shak- Dagsay are well-known, as are the sometimes politicized lyrics of nangma. Gaoyuan Hong in particular has introduced elements of Tibetan language rapping into their singles. === Drama === The Tibetan folk opera known as (Ache) Lhamo \\"(sister) goddess\\", is a combination of dances, chants and songs. The repertoire is drawn from Buddhist stories and Tibetan history. Lhamo was founded in the fourteenth century by the Thang Tong Gyalpo, a lama and important historical civil engineer. Gyalpo and seven recruited girls organized the first performance to raise funds for building bridges that would facilitate transportation in Tibet. The tradition continued, and lhamo is held on various festive occasions such as the Linka and Shoton festivals. The performance is usually a drama, held on a barren stage, that combines dances, chants and songs. Colorful masks are sometimes worn to identify a character, with red symbolizing a king and yellow indicating deities and lamas. The performance starts with a stage purification and blessings. A narrator then sings a summary of the story, and the performance begins. Another ritual blessing is conducted at the end of the play. ===Cham dance=== The cham dance is a lively masked and costumed dance associated with some sects of Tibetan Buddhism and Buddhist festivals. == Festivals == Tibetan festivals such as Losar, Shoton, the Bathing Festival and many more are deeply rooted in indigenous religion, and also contain foreign influences. Tibetan festivals are a high source of entertainment and can include many sports such as yak racing. Tibetans consider festivals as an integral part of their life and almost everyone participates in the festivities. File:Nawang Khechog.jpgA musician at The Tibetan Culture Festival.

The main purpose of this is to help evoke their sense of belonging to regional and cultural Tibet via online means and also to further spread the Tibetan culture and representation across borders. However, as of August 2019, despite the efforts of members of the Emoji Subcommittee and Unicode‚Äôs negotiating body (and Unicode‚Äôs official admission that the flag proposal is strong), the decision-making process of approval and eventual release of the Tibetan flag emoji by Unicode has been and remained stalled. This is probably due to strong opposition by millions of Mainland Chinese citizens, Mainland Chinese members of Unicode Consortium and the Chinese government‚Äôs willingness to place economic sanctions against the company if Unicode ‚Äòunilaterally‚Äô releases the Tibetan flag emoji (unless China returns to a state of democracy and is willing to support the rights and freedoms of Tibetans in Tibet Autonomous Region). Nonetheless, Tibetans across the globe have been pushing on. In light of the ongoing 2019‚Äì20 Hong Kong protests that have been taking place since June 2019 and subsequent Mainland Chinese interference in major social media platforms, Tibetans have called or are calling for Unicode to extend the timeline for at least one more year, to ensure the elimination of Mainland Chinese influence in operations conducted by social media platforms and Unicode before prioritising on the eventual acceptance and release of the Tibetan flag emoji to the public. The flag emoji may only be released in Emoji 13.0, 14.0 or later, depending on the socio-political circumstances. ==See also== * Mongolian and Tibetan Cultural Center * Culture of Bhutan * Tibetan Institute of Performing Arts * Ghosts in Tibetan culture * List of Tibetan poets from India * List of Tibetan monasteries * Ma Jian, modern Chinese author whose works feature depictions of traditional Tibetan culture * Tibet since 1950 * Snow Lion ==FootnotesReferences== * Stein, R.

Mart√≠nez switched parties to become a Republican after being defeated in a 2000 primary. ==Early life== Mart√≠nez's family moved to Los Angeles, California, when he was young, and he attended public schools in Los Angeles. In 1949 he graduated from Roosevelt High School. From 1947 to 1950 he served in the U.S. Marine Corps, achieving the rank of private first class. In 1956 he received a certificate of competence from the Los Angeles Trade-Technical College. For the next fifteen years he owned and operated a custom furniture upholstery company and worked as a building contractor. ==Political career== He began his political career in 1971 when he became a member of the Monterey Park Planning Commission, and served until 1974 when he was elected to the Monterey Park City Council. He served until 1980, including two terms as mayor in 1974 and 1980. In 1980, Mart√≠nez defeated incumbent Jack R. Fenton in the Democratic primary election in California's 59th State Assembly district. He was elected to the California State Assembly with no major-party opponent. In 1982 George E. Danielson left the U.S. House of Representatives to take the bench. Mart√≠nez won the special election to succeed him, and was reelected nine times by varying margins. In his first term in Congress he was assigned to the Education and Labor Committee. In the 99th Congress (1985‚Äì87) he chaired the Subcommittee on Employment Opportunities. In 1991, he became the Chairman of the Human Resources Subcommittee. In 1992, Mart√≠nez was named to the Foreign Affairs Committee, and served on the Subcommittee on International Security, International Organizations and Human Rights. In 2000, Mart√≠nez was defeated in the Democratic primary by liberal State Senator Hilda Solis 62% to 29%. She charged that he was out of touch with his district when he voted to ban partial-birth abortion and opposed gun control. (He was both Roman Catholic and a member of the National Rifle Association.) While he had been a reliably Democratic vote on most issues throughout his congressional career, after his primary loss Mart√≠nez began to vote overwhelmingly with Republicans. On July 27, 2000, Mart√≠nez switched to the Republican Party, arguing that the Democrats had abandoned him. There was no Republican candidate on the ballot in the district for the 2000 election, and Mart√≠nez declined to attempt a write-in candidacy, though he remained critical of Solis and promised to stay active in the Republican party. His term in Congress ended on January 3, 2001, at the end of the 106th Congress. ==Family== Mart√≠nez was married to Elvira Yorba Martinez, with whom he had five children: Matthew Adrian, Michael Gilbert, Diane, Susan, and Carol Ann. His daughter, Diane Mart√≠nez, served in the State Assembly from 1992 to 1998. ==Death== On October 15, 2011, Mart√≠nez died at his home in Fredericksburg, Virginia.

It consists of two churches (Pinhook Church of Christ and Pinhook Christian Church), a cemetery, and several small farms and homesteads. Two legends describe how Pinhook got its unique name. One states that because the roads leading to it are quite curvy, they reminded people of hooked pins. The other states that the local general store, around 1900, had lost its liquor license, and in order to keep serving alcohol hooked pins around drink glasses.

Generally considered one of the most important groupings in the genre, it has contained or been associated with a large proportion of major English folk performers in its long and fluid history. The one constant in the band‚Äôs history has been the band leader Ashley Hutchings, founding member of arguably the two other pre- eminent English folk rock groupings Fairport Convention and Steeleye Span, and it has been the home for most of the projects of his long and highly productive career, though in the 2011 incarnation of the band he has handed over the reins to his son Blair Dunlop. ==HistoryOrigins=== Initially Hutchings formed the band in April 1971 to accompany his then wife the singer Shirley Collins on her No Roses album. Dave Mattacks, Richard Thompson and Simon Nicol, from Fairport Convention, beside such luminaries as Lal and Mike Waterson of The Watersons and Maddy Prior, were among twenty five credited backing musicians. On a short tour, core members were joined by Richard Thompson and his then wife Linda Thompson. Several members contributed with Hutchings to the project Morris On (1972), including John Kirkpatrick, Richard Thompson and Dave Mattacks, and cumbersomely all their names appeared on the album cover. ===First album (1973)=== Hutchings was keen to make a permanent band from these musicians and the first attempt included Royston Wood, Steve Ashley and Sue Draheim in the line-up, but the group failed to gel and he recruited a second band, turning to Martin Carthy, John Kirkpatrick, Sue Harris, Roger Swallow and Simon Nicol. The band remained fragile and split in August 1973, but an album was released retrospectively under the title Battle of the Field, on Island Records in 1976.P. Humphries, Meet on the Ledge, Fairport Convention, the Classic Years, (Virgin, 2nd edn 1997), p. 126. Other material recorded by this line-up eventually appeared on the later BBC Sessions CD (1998). ===The Albion Dance Band=== From 1974 to 1975, Hutchings abandoned the Albion name and focused on forming the Etchingham Steam Band with his wife Shirley Collins. However, in 1976 he pulled together a new Albion Band, this time with the aim of playing traditional dance music. It had a huge and unstable membership that included Simon Nicol, Graeme Taylor from Gryphon, the early musicians Phil Pickett and John Sothcott, fiddle player Ric Sanders, plus John Tams, one of folk music‚Äôs most distinctive and highly regarded vocalists. The immediate result was a lively traditional based album The Prospect Before Us under the name The Albion Dance Band. In 1978 they shortened the name to The Albion Band (which has remained the basis of the group‚Äôs identity since) and released, under Tams' direction, what is usually considered the finest album in the long history of the band Rise Up Like the Sun (1978).M. Brocken, The British Folk Revival, 1944-2002 (Ashgate, 2003), p. 104. ===Shows=== The band took part in a 1977 TV show Here We Come A-Wasseling and in 1978-9 collaborated with playwright Keith Dewhurst for a stage adaptation of British author Flora Thompson‚Äôs Lark Rise to Candleford, tracks from which were released as an album in 1980. The band was probably at the height of its mainstream profile at this point, getting its own BBC Arena documentary that explored their work. While Hutchings was more interested in pursuing theatrical possibilities, many members of the band wanted to be a touring and recording band and, despite critical acclaim, this line-up split. Tams, Taylor and Gregory went on to form the nucleus of Home Service.Sleeve notes from 1997 edition of Home Service, All Right Jack (Fledg'ling, 1997). Live material from this period has been released in Songs from the Shows (1997 and 1999) and The Guvnor, Vols 1-4 (1996‚Äì2004). ===Reformation and stability (1980-90)=== Hutchings reformed the band around the nucleus of the remaining ex-Fairporters Nicol and Mattacks. He added three members of Cock and Bull (Dave Whetstone, Jean-Pierre Rasle and John Maxwell) and for the first time on record, opted for a lead female vocalist in Cathy Lesurf of the Oyster Band, whose tones characterize most recordings from this era.P. Humphries, Meet on the Ledge, Fairport Convention, the Classic Years, (Virgin, 2nd edn 1997), p. 142. Probably the best album of this relatively stable period was Light Shining (1983), on which most of the tracks were original material. However, the reputation of the album has since been marred by accusations that Hutchings plagiarized one of its best songs, \\"Wolfe,\\" from \\"Northwest Passage\\" by Canadian folksinger Stan Rogers.Garnet Rogers, Night Drive: Travels with My Brother (Brampton, ON: Tickle Shore Publishing, 2016), pp 400-401 Shuffle Off (1983) followed, after which Nicol and Mattacks left to reform Fairport Convention. Phil Beer on guitar/fiddle/vocals and Trevor Foster on drums joined the band, and Under the Rose (1984), A Christmas Present From The Albion Band (1985) and The Wild Side of Town (1987) followed, the last of which was based on a five-part BBC television series presented by Chris Baines. The line-up then shifted with Martin Bell joining on violin before the release of Stella Maris in (1987). Martin Bell and Cathy Lesurf then left and the group were joined by Simon Care and John Shepherd. This was the most stable lineup in the band's history in terms of albums, producing three: I Got New Shoes (1988), Give Me a Saddle and I'll Trade you a Car (1989) and 1990 in the year of that name. ===Acoustic period (1990-7)=== In 1990 they were joined by singer-songwriter and instrumentalist Julie Matthews, but although they toured they produced no albums before her departure in 1993. Some sessions from this line-up surfaced as Captured in 1995. Trevor Foster and Phil Beer left and were temporarily replaced by virtuoso acoustic guitarist Keith Hinchliffe shifting the emphasis away from electric instruments. In 1993 Hutchings decided to follow this trend turning the band into a small four piece unit comprising himself, Julie Matthews‚Äô replacement Chris While, original member Simon Nicol, and Ashley Reed on violin. This allowed them to play small folk club, pub and college venues and gave the Band a whole new direction, now drawing on contemporary songwriters like Beth Nielsen Chapman and Steve Knightley as well as the internal songwriting talent of While and Hutchings. The first studio album of this period Acousticity (1993) had a more lively and contemporary feel, aided by Reed‚Äôs energetic playing. In 1995 Reed left and Matthews returned to the band to add her vocal, instrumental and considerable songwriting talents. The resulting album, Albion Heart (1995), is usually considered the best of this later period and marked the beginning of While and Matthews‚Äô long and productive partnership. It was also unusual for the lack of traditional folk instruments and the four were soon joined by violinist and mandolin player Chris Leslie for the last recording of this era Demi Paradise (1996), before Leslie left for Fairport Convention and While and Matthews for solo and joint projects. Live performances of this era have been released as Acousticity on Tour (2004) and Albion Heart on Tour (2004). ===Multi-generational phase (1997-2002)=== The last phase of the full band would be based around a return to a more traditional rock format and the incorporation of two generations of musicians. Hutchings called in experienced guitarist and writer Ken Nicol and added newcomers Joe Broughton on fiddle and Neil Marshall on drums. Female vocals were supplied by Kellie While and Gillie Nicholls, who were guests on the first studio album of this era, Happy Accident (1998). Gillie Nicolls was a full member of the band for the second outing Before Us Stands Yesterday (1999), but was then replaced by Kellie While for the recording of The Christmas Album later that year and for Road Movies (2001), their last studio project. Ken Nicol left to be replaced by Pete Zorn, but it was becoming increasingly hard to find venues of a suitable size and in 2002 it was decided to suspend the band. Their 1999 album Ridgeriders also saw them reunite with former members of the band. ===Albion Christmas=== While Hutchings continued to pursue other projects he revived the Albion Band in an acoustic format for seasonal tours in 2005, allowing them to play smaller venues which could usually be easily filled. The line-up is based around Simon Nicol, Kellie While and multi-instrumentalist Simon Care. The results have been three further seasonal albums: An Albion Christmas (2005), Winter Songs (2006), and Snow on Snow (2008). A fourth album Traditional (2009) is a compilation of tracks from the preceding three which excludes spoken word recordings. ===The Albion Band reborn=== In July 2011, Hutchings announced that the Albion Band would be forming again, and for the first time he himself would not be a member. Instead he passed the baton to his son - the guitarist and singer Blair Dunlop. This new line-up also features a number of other current folk performers from a range of backgrounds reflecting earlier versions of the Albion Band. These members include Folk Award nominee Katriona Gilmore (Tiny Tin Lady, Gilmore/Roberts) on fiddle and vocals, vocalist, concertina player and guitarist Gavin Davenport (Crucible, Glorystrokes, Hekety), drummer Tom Wright (Eliza Carthy projects/Glorystrokes), and Tim Yates (Blackbeard's Tea Party/The QP) on bass - only the second bass player in the band's history, and lead guitarist and relative newcomer Benjamin Trott. This line-up released an own label EP Fighting Room in 2011 and their first studio album Vice of the People in 2012. On 10 January 2014, Dunlop announced the friendly dissolution of the band \\"in the current incarnation\\", to allow its members to pursue individual projects.

She is identified as the Etruscan equivalent of Juno in Roman mythology, and Hera in Greek mythology.de Grummond, Etruscan Myth, Sacred History and Legend, page 78-84 As the supreme goddess of the Etruscan pantheon, she is part of the Etruscan trinity, an original precursor to the Capitoline Triad, made up of her husband Tinia, the god of the sky, and daughter Menrva, the goddess of wisdom. She is often depicted with a goatskin cloak and sandals whilst holding a shield, similarly to Juno, wearing a bridal veil, or completely nude.Nancy Thomson de Grummond, Etruscan Myth, Sacred History, and Legend (University of Pennsylvania Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology, 2006). Livy states (Book V, Ab Urbe Condita) that Juno was an Etruscan goddess of the Veientes, who was adopted ceremonially into the Roman pantheon when Veii was sacked in 396 BC. This seems to refer to Uni. She also appears on the Liver of Piacenza. == Etymology == The name Uni is of uncertain etymology, however may be related to an Indo-European root iuni meaning \\"young\\", connecting to her association with fertility, love, and marriage. In relation, it has also been suggested that the Latin Iuno (Juno) originated from Etruscan, changed from a feminine -i Etruscan ending. == Mythology == As most of Etruscan literature has not survived through time, mythological stories involving the Etruscan gods have been largely interpreted through engraved scenes in bronze mirrors, and other mixed media artworks. === Uni and Hercle === A notable mirror from Volterra depicts Uni nursing an adult demigod Hercle (the Greek Heracles or Roman Hercules). Tinia, amongst other gods present at the scene, points to a tablet with the inscription indicating the significance of the event: \\"eca: sren: tva: iœánac hercle:unial clan: Œ∏ra:sce\\" meaning \\"this picture shows how Hercle mecame Uni's son\\".Bonftante, L. (2006). Etruscan inscriptions and Etruscan religion. In Thomson de Grummond, N. & Simon, E (Eds.), Religion of the Etruscans(pp. 9-26), Austin, Texas: University of Texas Press. In other depictions of this myth, deities such as Menrva, Turan, and Mean - the goddess of victory - are present as part of an animated crowd bearing witness to the adoption. The motif of Hercle suckling Uni is understood as holding Greek origins, where counterpart Hera was unknowingly deceived by Zeus (Tinia) into nursing, and by that process adopting, an infant Heracles against her will.Mandowsky, E. (1938). The Origin of the Milky Way in the National Gallery. The Burlington Magazine for Connoisseurs, 72(419), 88-93. Depiction of this myth in which the adoption process features an adult Hercle, and an obliging Uni is widely acknowledged as having developed entirely in Etruria. Most scholars view this interpretation of the myth as the Hercle's welcome initiation to godhood; it has also been suggested that the scene represents Uni and Hercle's reconciliation, where the Etruscan recount accurately represents the meaning of Hercle's Greek name \\"Glory of Hera\\".

File:Bronzespiegel von Volterra - Detail 1.jpgDetail of inscription on bronze mirror from Volterra, pointed to by Tinia. === The Judgement of Elcsntre === The Judgement of Elcsntre (equivalently known in Greek terms as the Judgement of Paris) is secondarily notable as a myth often represented on Etruscan terms through bronze mirrors. The major themes of the Greek myth remain intact; Elcsntre (Paris), as guided by Turms (Hermes), must choose who is ‚Äòthe fairest‚Äô between Menrva, Uni, and Turan (Aphrodite) to be the recipient of a gifted eggDe Grummond, N. (2007). Corpus Speculorum Etruscorum GB 3. L'ERMA di BRETSCHNEIDER. p. 15 (golden apple) which had been presented at the wedding of Peleus and Thetis. Where Elcsntre could not easily choose between the three goddesses, they then resorted to bribing him. Etruscan interpretation of the specific offerings presented is not clear due to the lack of written sources, and various different representations on a number of mirrors, however there are common representations of Menrva‚Äôs and Turan‚Äôs gifts in alignment with their Greek counterparts. Menrva‚Äôs spear and a wreathde Grummond, Etruscan Myth, Sacred History and Legend, p. 78 are often depicted, as representative of offered glory in battle. Turan is often depicted holding branches of flowers and displaying her body, representative of her offering to Elcsntre the most beautiful women in the world as his wife. Uniquely, Uni is depicted in a different manner which does not entirely correspond to the Greek origin of the myth. Amongst different mirrors, she has been depicted as being nude, or fully clothed but holding a pomegranate branch with three pieces of fruit, which has generally not been interpreted as the offering of political power from the Greek myth. Instead rather while there is no clear assertion of her offering, it has been argued that these depictions demonstrate her unique Etruscan characteristics where she is more greatly associated with the fruits of fertility.

A chariot is being drawn in the upper extremities of the mirror, and the lower extremities feature Vile strangling serpents. == Trinity == Uni, alongside Tinia and Menrva, acts as one of the three deities which make up the Etruscan Trinity, equivalent to the Roman Capitoline Triad. Most scholars agree that this triad was imported by the Romans from original Etruscan custom, where Uni and Menrva traditionally played larger roles than their counterparts Juno and Minerva. Ancient sources have described the expectation of towns to dedicate temples to Tinia, Uni, and Menrva at the end of three roads, leading to three gates, as a part of Etrusca disciplina.Servius, In Aeneida ii.225 Further, it was suggested by Vitruvius that these such temples should have been located on the most elevated sites of the town, and spread apart from one another.Vitruvius De architectura I 7 == Cult == Uni was worshipped both individually at dedicated shrines, and alongside other deities as part of large public sanctuaries throughout Etruria. Established cults to Uni worshipped her status as a supreme goddess of family and reproduction.Demetriou, D. (2012). Negotiating identity in the ancient Mediterranean: The archaic and classical greek multiethnic emporia. New York, NY: Cambridge University press. Copy of the Pyrgi tablets. === Shrine at Pyrgi === As part of a large Tuscan style temple, the north-located shrine at Pyrgi dedicated to Uni was built in approximately 500 BC,Neil, S. (2016). Materializing the Etruscans: The expression and negotiation of identity during the orientalising, archaic, and classical periods. In Bell, S. & Carpino, A. (Eds.) A companion to the Etruscans(pp. 15-27). West Sussex, UK: Wiley and neighboured a smaller Greek temple. Compared to other locations, the cult of worship dedicated to Uni at Pyrgi held close resemblance to traditional Greek worship sanctuaries; at least 300 votive objects were dedicated there, alongside animal bones suggestive of sacrifice.Turfa, J. (2006). Votive offerings in Etruscan religion. In Thomson de Grummond, N. & Simon, E (Eds.), Religion of the Etruscans(pp. 90-106), Austin, Texas: University of Texas Press Additionally, two bowls made by the Etruscan Spurinas designated vota to Uni alongside Tinia and Thesan. Three gold plaques were excavated from the site in 1964, two written in Etruscan, and one in Phoenecian. The two longer Etruscan and Phoenecian inscriptions clarify the dedication of the temple was to unialastres as the genitive form of uni-astre, an amalgamated goddess of the Etruscan Uni as uni and Phoenecian Astarte as astre.Heurgon, J. (1966). The inscriptions of Pyrgi. The Journal of Roman Studies, 56(1-2), pp. 1-15. The dedication came from the ruler of Caere, in gratitude for her support of his reign.Nagy, H. (2016). Votives in their larger religious context. In Bell, S. & Carpino, A. (Eds.) A companion to the Etruscans(pp. 261-274). West Sussex, UK: Wiley The shorter of the Etruscan inscriptions outlines distinct annual rituals which took place to ensure the ongoing purity of the temple. === Sanctuary at Gravisca === Excavations at Gravisca. At the port of Gravisca in the 6thcentury BC, Uni was worshipped amongst other Etruscan and pan-Hellenic deities in a large network of sanctuaries. Dedication to Uni was aggregated in a singular room at the sanctuary in the southern area of the complex. Nearby, a similar room was dedicated individually to Turan. Both rooms featured statuettes of swaddled babies, and a myriad of votive anatomical dedications such as breasts and uteri. There is little difference between type of votive offering presented to Uni and Turan, however the numbers of these votives differentiate the rooms comparatively; 145 votive uteri were excavated from Uni‚Äôs dedicated sanctuary, compared to the 74 recovered from Turan‚Äôs. Additionally, 22 swaddled babies were found dedicated to Uni, where two were found dedicated to Turan. Both sanctuaries featured two votive breasts. It has been suggested that this difference could represent specialisation of offerings.Glinister, F. (2008). Women, colonisation, and cult in Hellenistic central Italy. Archiv der Religionsgeschichte, 8(1), 89-104. === Poggio Colla === An Etruscan sanctuary at Poggio Colla, located near the town of Vicchio in the Mugello region of northern Tuscany, was part of an ongoing archaeological project run from 1995 until 2015 by the Mugello Valley Archaeological Project and Poggio Colla Field School (PCFS). Excavations over the 21-season project potentially suggested Uni as the nominal deity of the area, with the uncovering of a bucchero vase depicting a, potentially sacred, birth scene, ritual behaviour at west of the sanctuary‚Äôs network, and other dedications made by women.Warden, G. (2016). The Vicchio Stele and its context. Etruscan and Italic Studies, 19(2), 208-219. In 2015, the Vicchio Stele was excavated from a temple on site, and recovered as one of the longest recorded sacred Etruscan texts thus far. The date extrapolated from letter-forms and punctuation, and the place in which it was found link the stele to have being presented at the sanctuary in its ‚Äúphase 0‚Äù of architectural history;Steiner, A. & Neils, J. (2018). An imported attic kylix from the sanctuary at Poggio Colla. Etruscan and Italic Studies, 21(1-2), p. 107 this phase predated stone architecture, and was characterised by huts.Steiner, A. & Neils, J. (2018). An imported attic kylix from the sanctuary at Poggio Colla. Etruscan and Italic Studies, 21(1-2), p. 99 Inscriptions on the edges of the stele were written in a form of ‚Äúpseudo- boustrophedon‚Äù, and potentially have up to 200 letters. Around 120 of these are legible. Etruscan archaeologist Adriano Maggiani has dated the inscription as being from 525-510 BCE., right before the building of the foundations in which it was placed Translation of the stele is incomplete, but from preliminary readings, scholars have tentatively linked a reference to Uni, based on the way the stele was placed in the foundations of the temple,Bec Crew, This 2,500-Year-Old Stone Just Revealed The Name of a Powerful Etruscan Goddess, Science Alert, 26 August 2016. Recovered from https://www.sciencealert.com/this-inscribed-stone-just-revealed-the-name-of-a- mystery-etruscan-goddess and where it may mention a goddess presiding over birth, potentially connecting her as the patron divinity of the cult at Poggio Colla, along with brief mention of her consort Tinia.Maggiani, A. (2016). The Vicchio Stele: The inscription. Etruscan and Italic Studies,19(2), 220-224. Part of the text which has been deciphered seems to display requirements of practice for the cult, demanding two objects of something for Tinia, ‚Äúin the place of Uni‚Äù. Archeologists have stated that \\"The centre of worship was an underground fissure that was ritually treated after the destruction of the temple,\\" and that. \\"Underground cults of this type were often associated with female divinities.\\" The university of Florence is currently undertaking the process of 3D documentation of the Vicchio Stele in order to create a more complete reconstruction of the entire text. == Regional placement in Heaven == Diagram of the inscriptions on the Liver of Piacenza - Uni is representative of the fourth \\"house\\".In a practice that has been argued by scholars as having originated in EtruriaGinge, B. (1991). The Bronze Liver of Piacenza. Analysis of a Polytheistic Structure by L. B. van der Meer. American Journal of Archaeology. 95(3), p. 557, Etrusca disciplina divided the Heavens into sixteen different cosmological regions.Stevens, N. (2009). A New Reconstruction of the Etruscan Heaven. American Journal of Archaeology. 113(2), p. 153 Reflected in the Piacenza Liver, deities were assigned respective ‚Äòhouses‚Äô where labels were inscribed into the sixteen sections of the bronze work. Etruscan temples held no unified orientation; temples dedicated to Uni have commonly been found to be oriented southwest, and dedications to Tinia oriented south, unlike Greek temples which have been found to all be usually directed east. It is clear that the placements of deities in the Liver of Piacenza held influence over orientation and places of worship, however there has been some debate towards interpretation of the plate. Two predominant schools of thought have largely dominated readings of the regions of the Liver, however a third theory which somewhat reconciles the two mutually exclusive views has emerged as suggested by Stevens. This theory demonstrates Uni‚Äôs placement in heavenly region number four as flexible with the seasons and in alignment with the difference in sunset and sunrise positions throughout the year.Stevens, N. (2009). A New Reconstruction of the Etruscan Heaven. American Journal of Archaeology. 113(2), p. 162 Where the temple of Fontanile di Legnisina dedicated to Uni found in Vulci, is located in the fixed terrestrial region number 10, and its entrance is opposite to region number 2 rather than 4, the non-corresponding position by two regions is explained by this theory of a ‚Äúrotating Etruscan heaven‚Äù.Stevens, N. (2009). A New Reconstruction of the Etruscan Heaven. American Journal of Archaeology. 113(2), p. 113 Similarly, at Pyrgi, the orientation of a temple belonging to Uni is southeast. This positioning places it in fixed terrestrial regions 10 and 11 where opposite to the entrance, Uni‚Äôs heavenly region number 4 is still evident in the terrestrial region number 2 to allow for seasonal fluctuation. == See Also == * Capitoline Triad * Pyrgi Tablets * Liver of Piacenza ==References * Category:Etruscan goddesses Category:Etruscan religion Category:Perugia ","title":"Uni (mythology)"},{"id":"2224061","text":"Boris Borisovich Piotrovsky (; also written Piotrovskii; - October 15, 1990) was a Soviet Russian academician, historian-orientalist and archaeologist who studied the ancient civilizations of Urartu, Scythia, and Nubia.

It serves the West Kootenay region, including Castlegar, Nelson and Trail. It is owned and operated by the City of Castlegar, and has a passenger terminal. Due to the mountainous terrain impinging on both runway approaches, there is no possibility of a straight-in approach. The airport is therefore certified for day operations only, and the glideslope on approach is set to a steep 5.0¬∞ rather than the standard 3.0¬∞. The instrument approaches to Castlegar are considered among the most challenging of any in use at a commercial airport in North America. As of 2017, the Dash-8s serving the airport required minimums of 2874 foot cloud ceilings and three miles visibility (Air Canada Jazz adds 100 feet to these minimums). In 2006, Castlegar airport was developing departure procedures for night time operation, but as of 2010 the airport was certified for daytime operation only.

At the age of three, his Australian father, Colin Edwards Sr. (an amateur motorcycle racer himself), introduced him to a minibike, and Edwards entered his first motocross race at the age of four. Over the next ten years, Edwards became one of the top-ranked junior motocross competitors in the US, winning dozens of races in the 50cc to 80cc categories in local, regional and national events. In 1988 at the age of 14, Edwards stopped competing in motocross races, having become distracted by the normal demands of being a teenager. However, in 1990, Edwards and his father attended a motorcycle road race event in north Texas, and this inspired him to attempt road racing. In 1991 Edwards began competing in amateur road-racing events locally, but rapidly progressed to national events. He was undefeated in every amateur event he entered that year, and won numerous national amateur titles. His performance was sufficiently impressive for him to be offered a sponsored ride with South West Motorsports, and Edwards turned professional just before the commencement of the 1992 season. ==Career== In his first professional season (1992), Edwards entered the AMA 250cc National Series.Motorcycle-USA Staff. Colin Edwards Bio . Motorcycle-USA.com. Retrieved on 2009-06-19. He won five of the nine races and the national title over second-place earner Kenny Roberts, Jr.. In 1993 and 1994 Edwards rode for Vance & Hines on a Yamaha in the AMA Superbike Championship, earning 6th and 5th place overall in those years. ===Superbike World Championship=== In Edwards was offered a factory position with Yamaha in the Superbike World Championship. His results in were disappointing as Edwards struggled to adjust to the demands of competing in a global competition, and he missed the last two meetings after teammate Yasutomo Nagai perished in a crash at Assen. In he achieved a greatly improved sixth overall in the Superbike World championship. was a disappointing year for Edwards as he was forced to withdraw from competing due to injuries sustained in the fifth round of the Superbike World Championship. He was replaced in the Yamaha World Superbike Team and was unable to negotiate a position in the 500cc Grand Prix competition. Fortunately Edwards was able to conclude a deal with Honda to ride the RC45 motorcycle in the Superbike World Championship. Edwards finished fifth overall that year, and earned his first solo international victories with a double win at Monza followed by his 3rd win of the season at Brands Hatch. In , Edwards managed several more victories for Honda (including leading teammate Aaron Slight home twice at Brands Hatch, giving Honda a rare Double-1-2) and ended the season in second overall position, behind champion Carl Fogarty. In , Edwards rode the new Honda VTR-1000 SP1/RC51 twin cylinder motorcycle to overall victory in the Superbike World Championship after Yamaha rider and points leader, Noriyuki Haga was disqualified for testing positive for a banned substance. Edwards came second to Ducati rider, Troy Bayliss in but reclaimed the title from Bayliss in in a dramatic fashion, clinching the championship in the final race of the season in Imola (Italy). Edwards also holds the record for the most points in a single season with 552 points in 2002 breaking the previous record of 489 points set by Carl Fogarty in 1999. Runner-up Troy Bayliss also broke the previous record with 541 points. ===MotoGP World Championship=== After winning his 2nd Superbike World Championship Edwards moved to MotoGP in 2003. He rode for the greatly troubled Aprilia team on the RS Cube, and his only notable accomplishment in that otherwise dismal year was avoiding serious injury when his machine caught fire due to an incorrectly fitted fuel cap at Sachsenring. Yet Edwards, known in all motorcycle paddocks as a great bike tester, tried to no avail to help lift the struggling team. 2004 saw Edwards riding for Telefonica Movistar Honda, and he achieved his first MotoGP podium position at Donington. Edwards finished the season in fifth overall position. In 2005, Edwards moved to Gauloises Yamaha factory team as the teammate to the world champion Valentino Rossi. His best result for 2005 was a second position at Laguna Seca, behind compatriot Nicky Hayden. He finished the season fourth overall. 2006 For 2006 Colin Edwards continued riding for the Camel Yamaha factory team on board the YZR-M1 with teammate and good friend Valentino Rossi in the MotoGP championship. The factory Yamaha team had a troubling start to their racing year with \\"chatter\\" problems and tire wear issues. The factory team built a new chassis for the 2006 spec YZR-M1 to combat the aforementioned problems. Rossi took to the new chassis quickly and rode to victory at his home race of Mugello for the fifth consecutive time since 2001. Edwards did not have the time to \\"gel\\" with the new chassis early in the season, which resulted in him sticking with the older version for the Mugello race. He finished 12th. At Assen he took the lead at the start, and led until Nicky Hayden passed him on the penultimate lap. He caught back up to his countryman on the last lap, and managed to pass him a few corners from the end. When Hayden attempted to pass him again in the final chicane, Edwards ran across the AstroTurf and lost control of his bike, which briefly continued on without him. He remounted to finish 13th. Hayden, who ran across the gravel on the final chicane himself, managed to keep control of his bike and won the race. At his home race, the Red Bull U.S. Grand Prix, Edwards finished ninth suffering tire problems in the scorching heat like his teammate Valentino Rossi. At Estoril he qualified second and finished fourth in one of his most competitive showings of the season. 2007 2007 brought great prospects early on. Colin entered his second of a two-year deal with Yamaha factory team, now known as Fiat Yamaha riding the new Yamaha YZR-M1 800cc. Yet after starting second on the grid in Istanbul, a first lap crash caused by Olivier Jacque took him out. At Le Mans Colin took pole position, but made a slow start and gambled on switching to wet tyres in damp conditions. He did this too early, and by the time it was wet enough his tyres had shredded, forcing him to pit again and finish at the back of the field. Fiat Yamaha was having problems with the M1 and the Michelin tires, Edwards along with teammate Valentino Rossi both struggled to find competitive set up nearly the entire season to run up front. Edwards best result of the season was 2nd (equaling his career best in MotoGP) at the wet British Grand Prix at Donington Park. 2008 2008 Indianapolis Grand Prix For the 2008 season, Colin Edwards continued in MotoGP, this time for the satellite Tech 3 Yamaha team alongside fellow Superbike World Champion James Toseland. A series of solid performances left him 5th in the overall standings after nine rounds, never qualifying lower than 6th on the grid and finishing on the podium twice. After qualifying 6th for round 9 at Assen, he was delayed by Rossi's early crash and was in next to last place at the end of the first lap (in front of only Rossi, who was able to rejoin the race), however he then fought back to snatch 3rd from Nicky Hayden at the final corner after Hayden ran out of fuel, gaining a measure of revenge for the 2006 race at the track.Waheed, Adam.

He secured a second-place finish in the British Grand Prix at Donington Park. After being caught in a crash at the San Marino Grand Prix, Edwards directed typically outspoken criticism towards Alex de Angelis, claiming: \\"We are in Italy and occasionally you have to deal with an Italian rider who wants to be a hero and today that was De Angelis. De Angelis is the guy who needed to be wearing Valentino‚Äôs donkey helmet,\\" in reference to a special edition helmet being worn by Valentino Rossi. 2010 On October 1, 2009 Edwards announced that he had signed a one-year contract extension that would see him ride for Tech 3 Yamaha in the season.

They released a number of LPs for Island Records in the early 1970s. They are sometimes categorised as psychedelic folk or as medieval folk rock, but their music was much more a reinvention of Renaissance music, based around the use of period instruments such as lutes and recorders. ==History== John Gladwin (guitar and vocals) and Terrance (Terry) Wincott (guitar and vocals) formed a band called The Dimples along with Stuart Smith (drums) and Johnny Jackson (bass guitar). Signed to the Decca label they recorded a single, the \\"A\\" side \\"Love of a Lifetime\\" and the \\"B\\" side written by John Gladwin titled \\"My Heart is Tied to You\\". The record did not chart, although more recently the B-side has become popular on the Northern soul scene. Following the break up of The Dimples John and Terry formed a loud \\"electric\\" band called Methuselah. However, at some point in Methuselah concerts, the duo would play an acoustic number together: they found that this went down well with the audiences and allowed them to bring out more of the subtlety of their singing and instrumental work. They left Methuselah in 1969 and began working on their own acoustic material. Initially their material was derived from folk music, in line with many of the other performers of the time. However, they began to develop their own musical idiom, influenced, at one extreme, by the early music revivalists such as David Munrow, and the other extreme, by their childhood memories of the Robin Hood TV series, with its pseudo-mediaeval soundtrack by Elton Hayes. The band was named after Blondel de Nesle, the musician in the court of Richard I. According to legend, when Richard was held prisoner, Blondel travelled through central Europe, singing at every castle to locate the King and assist his escape. This name for the band was suggested by a chef, Eugene McCoy, who listened to some of their songs and commented: \\"Oh, very Blondel!\\" and they began to use that name. They were then advised to add an adjective (in line, for example, with The Incredible String Band) and so they became \\"Amazing Blondel\\". Their first album The Amazing Blondel (also called \\"Amazing Blondel and a Few Faces,\\") was recorded in 1969 and released by Bell Records. It was directed by session guitarist Big Jim Sullivan. At about this time, Eddie Baird (who had known the other members at school) joined the band. On 19 September 1970 they were one of the bands to play at the first Glastonbury Festival. Following what Baird described as \\"a disastrous 'showbiz' record signing\\", Amazing Blondel were introduced, by members of the band Free, to Chris Blackwell of Island Records and Artists. Blackwell signed them up to Island, for whom they recorded their albums Evensong, Fantasia Lindum and England. In Baird's words (in a 2003 interview) the band \\"adored recording\\". They recorded the Island albums in the company's Basing Street Studios which, at that time, was the source of some of the most innovative independent music in Britain. They toured widely, both in their own concerts and as a support act for bands such as Genesis, Procol Harum and Steeleye Span. On stage, they aimed at technical precision of the music and versatility of instrumentation (with most concerts involving the use of some forty instruments) interspersed with banter and bawdy humour. However, there was a conflict between their managers' desires to organise ever more demanding tour schedules and the band's own wish to spend more time writing material and working in the studio. In the end, this led to the departure of John Gladwin (who had written most of their material) from the band in 1973, and the remaining two members decided to continue as a duo. In this new format, they went on to record several more albums, with Baird now writing the bulk of the material. The first of these, Blondel, was their final release for Island. They were next signed to Dick James' DJM label, where they recorded three albums, Mulgrave Street, Inspiration and Bad Dreams. They gradually modernized and electrified their sound. These albums featured a number of guest musicians, including Steve Winwood and Paul Kossoff. There is a mistaken belief that, during this period, they shortened the band name to Blondel. This is probably caused by the title of the final Island album, and the front cover of Mulgrave Street, which gives the short version of the name. But the full name is given on the back and on the front of the next two albums. The final release in the 1970s was a live album. By the end of the 1970s, with disco being the largest selling music genre and with folk losing popularity, Baird and Wincott stopped performing under the Amazing Blondel name. John Gladwin reinherited the name and began to tour universities with bandmates, and former session players for the original Amazing Blondel; Adrian Hopkins and Paul Empson. This line-up had originally been billed as \\"John David Gladwin's Englishe Musicke\\". The original band reformed in 1997 and produced a new album Restoration. They have since played at venues across Europe in the period 1997‚Äì2000. As of 2005, Terry Wincott had a successful heart bypass operation, which curtailed the band's plans for future concerts. In 2005, Eddie Baird played two concerts in a duo with acoustic guitarist and singer songwriter Julie Ellison and is currently working on a collaboration with Darryl Ebbatson, called \\"Ebbatson Baird\\". ==Band membership== John David Gladwin and Edward Baird were born and brought up in Scunthorpe, Lincolnshire: Terence Alan Wincott was born in Hampshire but moved to Scunthorpe at an early age. The members of the band were all accomplished musicians. Gladwin sang and played twelve-string guitar, lute, double bass, theorbo, cittern, tabor and tubular bells. Wincott sang and played 6 string guitar, harmonium, recorders, flute, ocarina, congas, crumhorn, pipe organ, tabor, harpsichord, piano, mellotron, bongos and assorted percussion. Baird sang and played lute, glockenspiel, cittern, dulcimer, twelve string guitar and percussion. ==Style of music== The style of their music is difficult to categorise. Most of it was composed by themselves, but was based on the form and structure of Renaissance music, featuring, for example, pavanes, galliards and madrigals. It is sometimes categorised as psychedelic folk but would probably have been disowned by both the psychedelic community and the folk community, whilst being instantly recognisable to students of early music. Terry Wincott described it as \\"pseudo- Elizabethan/Classical acoustic music sung with British accents\\". Eddie Baird is quoted as saying \\"People used to ask us, How would you describe your music? Well, there was no point asking us, we didn't have a clue.\\" Their music has been compared with that of Gryphon and Pentangle: however, Amazing Blondel did not embrace the rock influences of the former nor the folk and jazz influences of the latter. They have also been likened to Jethro Tull. ==Instruments== The band employed a wide range of instruments (see above) but, central to their sound was their use of the lute and recorders. When touring, the lutes proved to be quite difficult instruments for stage performance (in terms of amplification and tuning) and, in 1971, the band commissioned the construction of two 7-string guitars, which could be played in lute tuning. The design and construction of these instruments was undertaken by David Rubio who made classical guitars, lutes, and other early instruments for classical players, including Julian Bream and John Williams. Gladwin's instrument was designed to have slightly more of a bass sound, as it was used mainly as an accompaniment instrument, whereas Baird's had a little bit more treble emphasis, to allow his melodic playing in the higher register to predominate. The two instruments were individually successful and also blended well together. They also proved to be stable (from a tuning point of view) for stage performance. The guitars were fitted with internal microphones to simplify amplification. ==DiscographyStudio albums=== {  - Title Year Label Line-up - The Amazing Blondel (aka The Amazing Blondel and a Few Faces) 1970 Bell Records John Gladwin, Terry Wincott - Evensong 1970 Island Records  rowspan=\\"3\\"  Eddie Baird, John Gladwin, Terry Wincott - Fantasia Lindum 1971 Island Records - England 1972 Island Records - Blondel 1973 Island Records  rowspan=\\"4\\"  Eddie Baird, Terry Wincott - Mulgrave Street 1974 DJM Records - Inspiration 1975 DJM Records - Bad Dreams 1976 DJM Records - Restoration 1997 HTD Records Eddie Baird, John Gladwin, Terry Wincott - The Amazing Elsie Emerald 2010 Talking Elephant Eddie Baird, Terry Wincott } ===Other releases=== * Live in Tokyo (1977) (actually this live album was recorded in Europe) *Englishe Musicke (compilation), Edsel Records, (1993) *A Foreign Field That Is Forever England (recorded live, 1972‚Äì1973) HTD Records (1996) *Evensong/Fantasia Lindum, Beat Goes On 626 (2004) *Going Where The Music Takes Me (Live & Studio Archive recordings From The 60's To the 80's) (2-CD-Box + DVD), Shakedown Records (2004)(Compilation with 38 unreleased songs; no Amazing Blondel recordings but songs by the individual members) *Harvest of gold - The English Folk Almanach (Live sampler including recordings from Steeleye Span; Fairport Convention and Magna Carta as well as five live recordings by Amazing Blondel from the early 1970s which are otherwise unreleased) ==References *Blondel CD re-issues and latest news on their reformation courtesy of Talking Elephant *The last snapshot of the official site of Amazing Blondel *The last snapshot of the official site of the Ebbatson-Baird project Category:English folk musical groups Category:English progressive rock groups Category:Medieval folk rock groups Category:Psychedelic folk groups Category:Bell Records artists Category:Island Records artists Category:DJM Records artists Category:Transatlantic Records artists Category:Mooncrest Records artists ","title":"Amazing Blondel"},{"id":"2224089","text":"State Route 377 (SR 377) is a state highway in Nye County, Nevada, United States.

The Rolling Stone Illustrated History of Rock and Roll. ==Music career== Born in Chicago, Davis began his musical career with his brothers, singing bass in his family's vocal trio. He studied double bass in high school with his music theory teacher and band director, Walter Dyett. He was a member of Chicago Youth Symphony Orchestras (then known as the Youth Orchestra of Greater Chicago) and played in the orchestra's first performance at Chicago's Orchestra Hall on November 14, 1947. After high school, he studied double bass with Rudolf Fahsbender of the Chicago Symphony Orchestra while attending VanderCook College of Music. After college, Davis performed in dance bands. The connections he made led him to pianist Don Shirley. In 1954 he and Shirley moved to New York City and performed together until 1956, when Davis began playing with the Sauter-Finegan Orchestra. In 1957, he became part of Sarah Vaughan's rhythm section, touring and recording with her until 1960. During the 1960s, Davis was in demand in a variety of musical circles. He worked with many of the small jazz groups of the time, including those led by Eric Dolphy, Jaki Byard, Booker Ervin, Andrew Hill, Elvin Jones, and Cal Tjader. From 1966‚Äì1972, he was a member of The Thad Jones/Mel Lewis Orchestra. He has also played with Don Sebesky, Oliver Nelson, Frank Sinatra, Miles Davis, Dexter Gordon, and Ahmad Jamal. Davis recorded with pop and rock musicians in the 1970s, appearing on Laura Nyro's Smile, Van Morrison's Astral Weeks, and Bruce Springsteen's Greetings From Asbury Park, N.J. and Born to Run. During his career he performed classical music with conductors Igor Stravinsky, Leonard Bernstein, Pierre Boulez, Leopold Stokowski, and Gunther Schuller.

The group was named after the Elizabethan miniaturist painter Nicholas Hilliard. Founded in 1974,[ The Hilliard Ensemble biography by Timothy Dickey, discography and album reviews, credits & releases] at AllMusic the group disbanded in 2014. Although most of its work focused on music of the Medieval and Renaissance periods, the Hilliard Ensemble also performed contemporary music, working frequently with the Estonian composer Arvo P√§rt and included in its concerts works by John Cage, Gavin Bryars, Giya Kancheli, and Heinz Holliger. ==HistoryMembership=== The group was founded by Paul Hillier, Errol Girdlestone, Paul Elliott, and David James, although the membership was flexible until Hillier left in 1990. After that, the core members were David James (counter-tenor), Rogers Covey-Crump (tenor/high tenor), John Potter (tenor), and Gordon Jones (bass), except that in 1998 John Potter was replaced by Steven Harrold. ===Recordings=== The Hilliard Ensemble, under Paul Hillier, had an extensive discography with EMI's Reflexe early music series during the 1980s. The ensemble then recorded mainly for the ECM label. In 1994, when popular interest in Gregorian chant was at its height, the ensemble released the CD Officium, an unprecedented collaboration with the Norwegian saxophonist Jan Garbarek.

It has a circular shape of a diameter of 137 m and depth 48.8m. The locals refer to it as simply \\"the lake\\". The lake is connected to the harbour of the town by a channel dug by the French army in 1907. A panoramic view of the lake can be seen from a small park situated above it. According to legend, the goddess Athena bathed in it. Every year at midnight turning to Orthodox Christian Easter day, the majority of the population of the town gathers around the lake to celebrate with fireworks, and firecrackers thrown by the people attending that highlight event. The rocks at the lake are limestone breccias, the result of undersea landslides coming down from the mountains to the north-west of the town. A normal fault which cuts right through the town in a roughly NNE to SSW direction passes directly through the north-western side of the lake, the cliff at the lake is the scarp slope of this fault. Elsewhere in the town the fault was later buried by subsequent underwater landslides. An underground stream that was cut by this fault created a solution sinkhole and a small cave following the disappearance of the overlying sea during the Messinian Salinity Crisis. After only a few hundred thousand years the small cave, dissolved out of the unstable and structurally weak breccia, collapsed creating a deep hole. The destabilised breccia at the top of this hole subsided into the hole creating a deep funnel-shaped sinkhole which was subsequently filled with freshwater by the still running spring. The creation of the Mediterranean Sea during the Zanclean Flood left a deep, spring-fed, freshwater lake that overflowed via a small stream into the nearby sea. In 1852 Captain Thomas Spratt surveyed eastern Crete on behalf of the Royal Navy and recorded the lake as being '...a small circular pool of brackish water' and '....having a small stream opening out of it into the sea'Spratt T.A.B. John Van Horst, 1865, p. 144., clear evidence that the spring was still flowing at that time. He also measured the depth of the lake as 210 feet (64m) and it is this figure that is used in almost all publications and writings about the lake today. In September 2000 the geology department of the University of Athens conducted a detailed underwater survey of the lake, they found its maximum depth to be only 48.8m On 12 October 1856 a massive earthquake occurred in the sea off Crete with an epicentre only 40km from the lake. Although its magnitude was not recorded it was listed as grade XI on the Modified Mercalli Intensity Scale, one grade down from the maximum possible. This earthquake was most likely responsible for the blocking or diversion of the freshwater spring leading to the later stagnation of the lake and the collapse of the western corner of the lake which reduced the lake depth from the 64m measured by Thomas Spratt to the 48.8m today. Once the spring had stopped flowing the lake soon became stagnant, it was known locally as Vromolimni; 'the stinky lake'. The obvious solution was to dig a channel to the nearby sea to allow the denser seawater to flush away the stagnant freshwater and remove the source of the smell. The first channel connecting the lake to the sea was dug by Kostas Adosides Pasha, the Ottoman governor of Lasithi at the time, between 1867 and 1871. This canal was dredged and widened several times between 1883 and 1890 and a simple wooden footbridge was built. The wider canal we see today was constructed by the French army between 1905 and 1907 with a lifting footbridge to allow boats to be loaded and unloaded in the relative safety of the lake. The modern concrete road bridge was opened in 1954. == Urban legends == A local urban myth is that the lake is bottomless and the crater of an extinct volcano. That notion is most likely based on its impressively high depth compared to its width (48.8m depth and only 134m width) or/and on locals noticing disturbances at the surface or also the level of the water during the 1956 Amorgos earthquake (which was wrongly attributed to an eruption of Santorini). Because of the latter, many assume a possible (and incorrect) geological relation of the two locations. The complete absence of igneous rocks anywhere near the lake precludes its being a volcano, the supposed connection with Santorini can also be dismissed for the same reason. ==References * Homepage of the Municipality of Agios Nikolaos Category:Landforms of Lasithi Voulismeni Category:Landforms of Crete ","title":"Lake Voulismeni"},{"id":"2224124","text":"Paul Reginald Nelson (born 21 May 1955), known by the stage name Paul Hyde, is a British-born Canadian musician and record producer (a notable client being Spirit of the West). Born in Yorkshire, Hyde came to Canada as a teenager. ==CareerHyde in the Payola$, Phase One (1978-1988)=== Hyde was a founding member, with Bob Rock, of the Payola$. Hyde and Rock formed the band in 1978, cheekily naming it after the U.S. radio scandal of the '50s. Rock would also start engineering and producing at Little Mountain Sound in Vancouver, where Payola$ relocated from Langford, British Columbia. The band's major label EP, Introducing Payola$, was released on A&M; in 1980. The band had made a few DIY recordings in 1979 before signing to A&M.; Their other A&M; releases were 1981's In a Place Like This, 1982's No Stranger to Danger and 1983's Hammer on a Drum. In 1985, Hyde was a credited co-writer of the No. 1 Canadian charity single \\"Tears Are Not Enough\\" by Northern Lights. He also sang in the song's chorus. For Here's the World for Ya (1985), the band changed its name to Paul Hyde and the Payolas, but disappointing sales resulted in their being dropped by the label. The team resigned with Capitol/EMI and put out one album, Under the Volcano (1987), as Rock And Hyde. These attempts to increase radio play in the U.S. by changing their band name met with limited success, although they gave Hyde his only two US Hot 100 entries. Still, Rock and Hyde went their separate ways in 1988: Hyde became a solo artist, and Rock an extremely successful hard rock/metal producer (his clients included Metallica), and part of the short-lived band Rockhead. ===Hyde out of the Payola$ (1989 - 2002)=== In 1988, with Murray McLauchlan and Tom Cochrane, Hyde recorded a benefit single and video for UNICEF called \\"Let the Good Guys Win\\". In 1989, Hyde's solo single \\"America is Sexy\\" reached No. 28 on the RPM 100 Singles chart of 23‚Äì28 October. In December 1988, the song was ranked as No. 23 of the top 25 Cancon songs of the year. The single was from Hyde's debut solo album, Turtle Island, which appeared on the RPM Top 100 Albums chart in 1989.\\"RPM Top 100 Albums\\". RPM Magazine Volume 50, No. 24 October 14, 1989. Some of the album's other songs were co-written with his first wife, Myriam Nelson. Despite the respectable chart success of the song, there was to be an eleven-year gap between Turtle Island and Hyde's next major label album. During this interval, he completed an album for the small Broken Records label: Love and the Great Depression was released in 1996. The album escaped the notice of anyone not specifically looking for it. A prominent figure in Canadian pop in the 1980s, Hyde had become obscure. Always remaining good friends with Hyde, Rock generously gave of his time to produce Hyde's 2000 EMI Music Canada album, Living off the Radar, which included some songs that the two co-wrote for the project. The response to the album proved the truth of its name, although singles \\"I Loved You Before I Met You\\" (co-written with Craig Northey) and \\"The Snake\\" (co-written with Rock) received some airplay. Again without a major label contract, in 2002 Hyde released The Big Book of Sad Songs, Volume 1 on the small Bongo Beat label. A stripped-down production that clocked in at barely over 30 minutes, the album nevertheless demonstrated the enduring craftsmanship of its songwriter. ===Hyde in the Payola$, Phase Two (2003 - 2008)=== Hyde and Rock reunited again as Payola$ in 2003 for a gig in Vancouver, after which they decided to write more material together. Linus Entertainment released a Payola$ Live DVD in 2005. Best known for such hits as \\"China Boys,\\" \\"Eyes Of A Stranger\\" and \\"Where is This Love?\\", Payola$ played a special performance at EMI's post-Juno Award party April 1, 2007, in Saskatoon after Rock‚Äîwho now lives in Hawaii, where he has a recording studio‚Äîwas inducted into the Canadian Music Hall of Fame at the telecast. The line-up included the final 1980s configuration of band personnel, drummer Chris Taylor (joined 1982) and bassist Alexander \\"A-train\\" Boynton (joined circa 1985). The Payola$ became active again as recording artists when the long-time musical partners released a seven-track CD EP, Langford (Part One), on July 17, 2007, through EMI Music Canada. Named for the Victoria, British Columbia suburb where Hyde and Rock met, the EP has a cover featuring Belmont Secondary School in Langford, which they attended together. The Payola$ ceased operation in 2008. Rock and Hyde have not announced whether they will be working together again or whether they will complete the full album that was supposed to follow their 2007 CD EP Langford (Part One). ===Hyde's solo career resumes (2009-present)=== Hyde released a second album for Bongo Beat on October 20, 2009, called Peace Sign. In January 2018, Hyde released a third album for Bongo Beat called No Gods, Just Men, which is currently a digital-only release. ==DiscographySolo albums=== * Turtle Island (1989) * Love and the Great Depression (1996) * Living off the Radar (2000) * The Big Book of Sad Songs, Volume 1 (2002) * Peace Sign (2009) * No Gods, Just Men (2018) ==Personal life== Paul has three children with ex-wife Myriam Nelson.

The head is brown with a concealed yellow crown patch, white supercilium and dusky eye mask. The upperparts are brown with darker brown streaks on the back, rufous and white edges on the wings, and wide chestnut edges on the rump and tail. The underparts are yellowish- white streaked with brown. Canopy Camp - Darien, Panama Jorupe Preserve - Ecuador Sexes are similar, but immature birds are brown where the adult is black. M. m. solitarius has black rather than brown streaking above and below. The streaked flycatcher is a conspicuous bird, with a noisy sqEEE-zip call. It is very similar in appearance to the less widespread sulphur-bellied flycatcher. The streaked flycatcher has a heavier bill, lighter yellow belly, pink basal half of the lower mandible and creamy (not white) superciliary. ==Distribution and habitat== This species breeds from eastern Mexico, Trinidad and Tobago south to Bolivia and Argentina. The southern subspecies M. m. solitarius migrates to Venezuela and the Guianas from March to September during the austral winter. It is found at the edges of forests and cocoa plantations. Common across its wide range, this species is not considered threatened by the IUCN. ==BehaviourFeeding=== Streaked flycatchers eat a range of food items, mostly large insects, but also lizards and berries. It perches on a high watchpoint from which it sallies forth to catch insects in mid-flight or off plants using a range of aerobatic maneuvers, and occasionally gleans prey from the vegetation. The wintering southern migrants seem to include a considerable amount of fruit in their diet, for example those of Tamanqueiro (Alchornea glandulosa) which they sometimes eat in quantity; fruit are typically ripped off in mid-hover. It occasionally follows mixed-species feeding flocks, pouncing from up in the trees on prey flushed by birds in the undergrowth. ===Breeding=== The nest is an open cup of twigs and grasses placed in a tree hollow or sometimes a bromeliad. The female builds the nest and incubates the typical clutch of two or three creamy-white eggs, which are marked with red-brown spots, for 16‚Äì17 days to hatching. Both sexes feed the chicks, which fledge in a further 18‚Äì21 days. == References == * * ==External links== * * * Streaked flycatcher Photo at Robert Scanlon's \\"Birds of Panama\\" gallery * * streaked flycatcher Category:Birds of Central America Category:Birds of South America streaked flycatcher streaked flycatcher ","title":"Streaked flycatcher"},{"id":"2224134","text":"The Macquarie Fields riots were a series of disturbances in southwest Sydney in February 2005 which were referred to as a riot by both the Parliament of New South Wales and the media. == Trigger event == The riots were sparked by a high speed police pursuit on 25 February through the Glenquarie housing estate in the South West Sydney suburb of Macquarie Fields. The chase resulted in the driver, 20-year-old Jesse Kelly, crashing the stolen vehicle into a tree and killing his two passengers, 17-year-old Dylan Raywood and 19-year-old Matthew Robertson. Certain circumstances around the riots including the fatal police pursuit in a low-income area were seen to be a repeat of the riots that took place in Redfern, New South Wales during the previous year. The accident sparked protests and accusations of police impropriety after Kelly's aunt Deborah falsely claimed police had rammed the car prior to the crash. Kelly eventually adopted the accusation, which was untrue. New South Wales state Premier Bob Carr mobilised hundreds of police, including heavily armed riot squads into the area. The violence that followed lasted four nights, involving at least 300 residents clashing with police. The rioters hurled rocks, bottles, bricks, petrol bombs, and set cars alight, injuring several officers. During a Parliamentary inquiry nine months later, NSW Police Commissioner Ken Moroney stated that the violence during the incident was not a riot when compared to incidents in Los Angeles or Paris, referring to the distinction between \\"disturbance\\" and \\"riot\\" as defined by Los Angeles Police Department police chief Bill Bratton, who had been visiting Australia at the time of the disturbances. == Criticism of response == The police were criticised at the time for not acting to quell the disturbances quickly enough, with some arguing the riots could have been ended in their first day had a more aggressive stance been adopted. The so-called 'soft' approach by police was put down to downsizing and a lack of training within the NSW Police Force that inhibited their ability to contain the ringleaders effectively. The police eventually made 55 arrests, including that of Jesse Kelly, who had fled the scene of the fatal car crash which preceded the riots. == Social issues == The suburb of Macquarie Fields suffered from a high unemployment rate of 11.3 percent, more than twice the National average. Of its 4,600 homes, 1,500 are housing commission projects and home to low-income and disadvantaged families. Criticisms have been made about this controversial cul de sac style urban planning that left many residents with very little privacy. == Charges and sentences == In October 2006, Jesse Kelly was formally charged after admitting two counts of aggravated dangerous driving occasioning death and was sentenced to 5 years jail. In the same month a coronial inquiry officially cleared New South Wales Police of any responsibility for the riot. His aunt Deborah Kelly, who started the rumors that sparked the riots, was charged with attempting to pervert the course of justice and with concealing a serious indictable offence. ==See also== * List of riots ==References== Category:2005 in Australia Category:Crime in Sydney Category:Riots and civil disorder in New South Wales Category:2005 riots Category:2000s in Sydney ","title":"2005 Macquarie Fields riots"},{"id":"2224137","text":"Cranbrook/Canadian Rockies International Airport is an international airport located north of Cranbrook, British Columbia and south-east of Kimberley in the Canadian Rockies.

Formed in 1986, the group initially consisted of six players, while it is currently five viols. Its repertoire consists primarily of music of the Renaissance period, in particular that of Elizabethan and Jacobean England, arrangements of the music of Johann Sebastian Bach, and contemporary music written for them. The group has toured all over the world, with tours of Japan and the United States, and three visits to Russia, the first in 1989, when it was still a part of the Soviet Union. They initiated a series of courses for voices and viols on the Greek island of Evvia with Michael Chance, and have also been invited twice to teach on the annual Conclave of the Viola da Gamba Society of America. It currently teaches each year in the first week of Dartington International Summer School. In addition to its performances of earlier music, Fretwork has been active in commissioning new works for viol consort. Its 1997 recording Sit Fast includes new works by such composers as Gavin Bryars, Tan Dun, and Elvis Costello. It has also commissioned music from Sir John Tavener, Michael Nyman, Alexander Goehr, George Benjamin, Duncan Druce, Fabrice Fitch, Gavin Bryars, Barry Guy, Poul Ruders, Simon Bainbridge, Ivan Moody, John Woolrich, Thea Musgrave, Peter Sculthorpe, Sally Beamish, Andrew Keeling and Orlando Gough. Fretwork has recorded a series of discs for Virgin Classics and Harmonia Mundi USA, but currently records for Signum Records. Recent discs include 'Bach's Goldberg Variations arranged for viols by Richard Boothby and The World Encompassed, with Simon Callow. In 2007 they recorded Birds on Fire: Jewish Music for Viols which presents some of the music composed by Italian- Jewish composers from the Bassano & Lupo families, who came to England to work at the court of Henry VIII in 1540. It also includes music by Salamone Rossi and Leonora Duarte. Finally it includes the first recording of 'Birds on Fire' itself, a three-part piece by Orlando Gough written for Fretwork in 2001. This work is based on the novel by Aaron Appelfeld \\"Badenheim 1939\\", telling the story of a group of Jews who holiday in a resort near Vienna in the spring of 1939. The town gradually becomes a ghetto, and the band of musicians gradually rediscover their Jewish roots to break out from the Vienese schmalz to play klezmer tunes. Their second recording of the complete Fantazias by Henry Purcell, including the two in Nomines, for HMU (Harmonia Mundi USA) was selected as Editor's Choice in Classic FM Magazine; where Fretwork's playing was described as \\"all one could wish for\\"; and it won the Gramophone Award on the Baroque Instrumental section 2009. In 2008, they recorded two tracks on Ryuichi Sakamoto's album Out of Noise. Fretwork was featured on the soundtracks of two Jim Jarmusch movies, Coffee and Cigarettes (2003) and Broken Flowers (2005). Other filmtracks include The Da Vinci Code, Kingdom of Heaven, The Crucible, La Fille d'Artagnant and many others. It has also recorded for Robbie Williams (Supreme) and Loreena McKennitt (for the album An Ancient Muse). In March 2011, Richard Campbell committed suicide, losing his battle against a melancholy he had been fighting for years. His loss is keenly felt by all his colleagues. In 2016 they celebrated their 30 years of activity with a concert in London's Kings Place, with guest players and singers, ending the concert with an arrangement of 'Because' by Lennon & McCartney. Since 2017 they have been recording for Signum Classics, and have released three CDs on this label: The World Encompassed, In Chains of Gold and John Jenkins Four- part Consort music. ==Current members== *Richard Boothby * *Joanna Levine *Asako Morikawa *Sam Stadlen *Emily Ashton (* denotes members when the group originally formed) ===Former members=== *Julia Hodgson* *William Hunt* *Wendy Gillespie* *Susanna Pell* *Richard Campbell * *Liam ByrneLiam Byrne, the musician's website *Richard Tunnicliffe *Reiko Ichise ==Frequent guests== *Clare Wilkinson ‚Äì mezzo-soprano *Emma Kirkby ‚Äì Soprano *Michael Chance ‚Äì Counter-Tenor *Charles Daniels ‚Äì Tenor *Jacob Heringman ‚Äì Lute *The Hilliard Ensemble ==Prizes and awards== *1997: French Grand Prix du Disque for Lachrimae, or Seaven Teares by John Dowland *2009: Gramophone Award for 'Purcell: Complete Fantazias' (by Henry Purcell) on Harmonia Mundi *2016: Royal Philharmonic Society 'Chamber Music & Song' Award ==Discography== * In Nomine ‚Äì 1987 * Heart's Ease ‚Äì 1988 * Armada ‚Äì 1988 * Cries and Fancies by Orlando Gibbons ‚Äì 1989 * Night's Black Bird by John Dowland and William Byrd ‚Äì 1989 * Goe nightly cares by John Dowland and William Byrd ‚Äì 1990 * Lachrimae by John Dowland ‚Äì 1990 * For ye Violls by William Lawes ‚Äì 1991 * Music for Viols ‚Äì 1992 * A Play of Passion ‚Äì 1992 * The English Viol ‚Äì 1994 (compilation album) * William Byrd: The Complete Consort Music by William Byrd ‚Äì 1994 * Henry Purcell: The Fantazias and In Nomines by Henry Purcell ‚Äì 1995 * Concord is conquer'd by William Lawes ‚Äì 1995 * Matthew Locke: Consort of Fower Parts by Matthew Locke ‚Äì 1996 * The Mirrour and Wonder of his Age by John Jenkins ‚Äì 1996 * Sit Fast ‚Äì 1997 * Celestiall Witchcraft ‚Äì 1999 * Missa 'Mater Christi sanctissima' by John Taverner ‚Äì 2000 * The Hidden Face by John Tavener and John Taverner ‚Äì 2001 * Harmonice Musices Odhecaton compiled by Ottaviano Petrucci ‚Äì 2001 * The Art of Fugue by J.S.

The device made its first appearance in Fantastic Four volume 1, issue #50 (May 1966), in which Johnny Storm retrieves it from the home of Galactus‚Äîas directed by Uatu the Watcher‚Äîfor the Fantastic Four to employ against the threat of Galactus himself. The Nullifier appears as a small, hand-held metallic device with no apparent functionality. When first introduced in 1966 it was described as the only known weapon in the universe capable of inspiring fear in Galactus.Fantastic Four vol. 1, #50 ==History== In its first appearance, Reed Richards threatens the use of the Ultimate Nullifier as a last-ditch effort to stop Galactus from destroying Earth as Human Torch recovered it from the base of Galactus with the help of Uatu the Watcher. Faced with the prospect of dying by Richards' activation of the Nullifier, Galactus withdraws. The Nullifier later appears in The Infinity War. Quasar tries to use it in an attempt to destroy the Magus, who had acquired the collective power of five cosmic cubes and a gauntlet containing 5 of the 6 Infinity Gems. The Reality Gem was replaced in this instance with a duplicate created by Thanos. Although Quasar tried to use the weapon on Magus, Quasar's attack gets redirected by the incomplete Infinity Gauntlet, temporarily nullifying Quasar in the process.The Infinity War #5 (Oct. 1992) The Ultimate Nullifier is generally kept within Galactus' Worldship, Taa II, though at times Galactus has been known to carry it aboard his spherical starship. In the rare instances that the Nullifier gets stolen or kept in other locales, such as the Fantastic Four's headquarters, the Nullifier inevitably returns to Galactus' possession. In the Abraxas saga Galactus demonstrates his ability to recall the Nullifier to himself at will. In conjunction, he stated it to be \\"as much a part of me as my heart itself.\\" In the 2006 edition of Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe, Marvel Comics included a profile of the 'Ultimate Nullifier' which, using technobabble, described the device to be of \\"unknown origins\\" within the context of the fictional Marvel Universe.All-New Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe A-Z #11 (November 2006) During the Original Sin storyline, an evolved Mindless One had the Ultimate Nullifier in its possession and used it on itself to put it out of its misery despite Thing trying to talk it down. By this time, Nick Fury and the Avengers arrive where Captain America wants the Ultimate Nullifier left alone until it is contained.Original Sin #1 ==Powers== The Ultimate Nullifier has been described as \\"the universe's most devastating weapon\\". As such, the Ultimate Nullifier has the ability to completely eliminate any target the wielder chooses, along with the user if his or her mind is not focused enough. In the hands of a being with an extremely powerful mind, the Ultimate Nullifier can destroy entire timelines from beginning to endFantastic Four #478 (Jan. 2002)Fantastic Four vol. 3, #24 or even erase (and paradoxically recreate) the entire infinite Marvel multiverse.Fantastic Four vol. 3, #49 ==Other versionsEarth X=== In the Earth X trilogy, Universe X in particular, the Ultimate Nullifier is one of the cosmic objects Captain Marvel, resurrected as a child, gathers to create Paradise. Later, it is used against Death after Marvel's spiritual counterpart, Mar-Vell, reveals to Thanos how Death has manipulated him in the past and gives the Ultimate Nullifier to him. Thanos annihilates Death and removes her from power, paving the way for the new paradise. However, as an unforeseen consequence, it leaves those still living unable to die, forcing the remaining heroes on Earth to resurrect Jude The Entropic Man as a means for dying. ===JLA/Avengers=== During the JLA/Avengers crossover (published between Sep 2003 - Mar 2004), the JLA and the Avengers go after twelve items of power, six from each universe. The Grandmaster approaches the League and tells them the Ultimate Nullifier is one of the great six items of power of the Marvel Universe, along with the Infinity Gems, the Casket of Ancient Winters, the Wand of Watoomb, the Evil Eye of Avalon and the Cosmic Cube. The first item the League collects is the Ultimate Nullifier. The Martian Manhunter examines it, but it threatens to overwhelm his mind, and he starts to lose control of his shape due to the immense power felt while probing the Nullifier, stating the item alone could destroy an entire universe. ===Marvel Adventures=== In Marvel Adventures: The Avengers #26, Spider-Man theorizes that the Nullifier does not actually destroy things, or it would be called an \\"Ultimate Annihilator.\\" He believes that it instead alters the laws of probability, changing the universe so that \\"everything has an equal likelihood of affecting everything else.\\" The theory turns out to be right when Spider-Man activates the Nullifier in an attempt to stop Galactus. ===Ultimate Marvel=== During the Ultimate Extinction storyline in the Ultimate Marvel universe, Reed Richards created a massively upsized, towering version of the very same portal device that he had previously designed on two other occasions to connect to the N-Zone. This weapon unleashed the tremendous energies of an alternate universe's Big Bang at Gah- Lak-Tus, destroying 20% of its mass and driving it off. This weapon is referred to as \\"the Nevada Gun\\", and is activated by triggering a Big Bang in an infant universe, and channeling that energy into a giant beam of destruction. ===Marvel: What If?=== In What If? vol. 1 #32 'What If The Avengers Had Become Pawns of Korvac?,' Korvac sends a recreated and mind- controlled Captain America to the worldship of Galactus to steal the Nullifier and then use it on Galactus. In doing so Captain America destroys both Galactus and himself. It is explained that that is the secret of the Nullifier: that it nullifies both target and wielder. The story ends with a frustrated and angry Korvac having absorbed almost all the most powerful beings in the universe, but still unable to achieve complete domination. Saying \\"I am strong, stronger than any being in the universe... but not stronger than every being in the universe,\\" in a fatalistic rage, he absorbs the energy of every living being on Earth and grows to planetary size. He bonds with the spirit of Eternity, and uses the Nullifer against an armada of the sentient races of universe who have banded together to stop him. Not physically present at the destruction of Galactus, Korvac is potentially unaware of how the Nullifier works, and destroys all of reality, and himself, in the confrontation. Even in this all-encompassing use of the device, it survives the destruction of all else. Several issues later, in issue #43 of the same volume of the series, Doctor Strange, the Phoenix, and The Silver Surfer‚Äîwho had all been thrown entirely out of the local universe at an earlier point by Korvac and thus were spared its destruction‚Äîwere stopped by the \\"ghost\\" of Eternity from attempting to use the Ultimate Nullifier on the void once they separately found their way back to that alternate universe and located the device‚Äîthe only remaining object in all of the void. The entity implied that the three survivors of the destroyed universe were correct in their deduction that if they used the device on the same region that it had previously nullified, that the resulting action would \\"undo\\" the previous nullification event and restore the universe; instead of restoring the universe, Eternity's spirit wanted the empty expanse to forever serve as a warning to others that might try to use the Nullifier. ===Age of Ultron=== In the Age of Ultron storyline, the Ultimate Nullifer is shown stored at Nick Fury's secret base in the Savage Land. When its use is discussed, Iron Man claims that he will not entertain the thought.Age of Ultron #5 (Apr. 2013) ==In other mediaTelevision=== * The Ultimate Nullifier appears in the 1967 Fantastic Four TV series episode \\"Galactus\\". The episode is very faithful to the comic version. * The Ultimate Nullifier appears in the 1994 Fantastic Four TV series episode \\"Silver Surfer and the Coming of Galactus\\". This version of the Nullifier differs greatly in shape from the original where it looks more like a two-handed gun. Uatu the Watcher takes the Human Torch to Galactus' world to obtain the Ultimate Nullifier in order to stop Galactus. * The Ultimate Nullifier makes a cameo in the Ultimate Spider-Man episode \\"Awesome\\". It is seen amongst the items in Dr. Curt Connors' laboratory on the S.H.I.E.L.D. Helicarrier. ===Video games=== * In Marvel: Ultimate Alliance, Crystal mentions to the heroes that Medusa left for Earth to search for the Ultimate Nullifier to be used against Doctor Doom. It is mentioned that the Ultimate Nullifier was in the possession of the Fantastic Four, then S.H.I.E.L.D., then with Dr. Moira MacTaggert on Muir Island. Medusa ends up running into Doctor Doom and becomes corrupted, knowing someone would use the Ultimate Nullifier against him. One of the side missions involves finding the damaged Ultimate Nullifier in a laboratory at Castle Doom (it can also help in defeating Doctor Doom by using it alongside the M'Kraan Crystal and the Muonic Inducer). If the player successfully finds the damaged Ultimate Nullifier, Mister Fantastic will repair it and use it one day to prevent Mephisto from invading Earth before all is lost. If the damaged Ultimate Nullifier is not found, the team of heroes will be forced to band together once again to fight Mephisto with the resulting battle causing a tremendous amount of destruction. * In Marvel Heroes, the Ultimate Nullifier is one of the Legendary Items available to players, giving the donned character a tremendous Brutal bonus. * The Ultimate Nullifier is mentioned in Marvel vs. Capcom 3. When confronting Galactus at the end of the game, he will sometimes boast that only the Ultimate Nullifier could give him pause. ==References * Galactus: The Web Page * ","title":"Ultimate Nullifier"},{"id":"2224150","text":"MARAUDER (Magnetically accelerated ring to achieve ultrahigh directed energy and radiation) is, or was, a United States Air Force Research Laboratory project concerning the development of a coaxial plasma railgun. It is one of several United States Government efforts to develop plasma-based projectiles.Plasma railgun#Examples The first computer simulations occurred in 1990, and its first published experiment appeared on August 1, 1993. == Objectives == The first MARAUDER experiment was motivated by RACE, or the Ring Accelerator Experiment, which took place in 1991 at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory. The ultimate goal of the MARAUDER program was to accelerate highly dense toroids containing plasma to high speeds. Such a system could be used for ‚Äúhypervelocity projectiles,‚Äù x-ray production, and electrical power amplification. The stated goals of the program included studying the ‚Äúformation, compression, and acceleration of magnetized plasma rings.‚Äù Specifically, the objective of the program was the acceleration of a toroid of 0.5-2.0 mg plasma to a kinetic energy level on the order of megajoules using a 5-10 MJ coaxial gun design. == Design == In 1993, the Phillips Laboratory developed a coaxial plasma gun capable of accelerating 1‚Äì2 mg of plasma by up to 1010g in a toroid of 1 meter in diameter. The toroids are similar to spheromaks, but differ in that an inner conductor is used to accelerate the plasma and that confinement behavior results from interactions of the toroid with its surrounding atmosphere. It utilized the Shiva Star capacitor bank to satisfy the large energy requirements that were needed. The plasma projectiles would be shot at a speed expected to be 3000 km/s in 1995 and 10,000 km/s (3% of the speed of light) by 2000. A shot has the energy of 5 pounds of TNT2.27 kg of TNT, 9.5 megajoules exploding. Doughnut-shaped rings of plasma and balls of lightning exploded with devastating thermal and mechanical effects when hitting their target and produced pulse of electromagnetic radiation that could scramble electronics, the energy would shower the interior of the target with high-energy x-rays that would potentially destroy the electronics inside.Jane's Defence Weekly 29 July 1998 == Current status == As of 1993, the project appeared to be in the early experimental stages. The weapon was able to produce doughnut-shaped rings of plasma and balls of lightning that exploded with devastating thermal and mechanical effects when hitting their target and produced pulse of electromagnetic radiation that could scramble electronics. The project's initial success led to it becoming classified, and only a few references to MARAUDER appeared after 1993.

The pair recorded and self-released an EP entitled Night of the Lawnchairs on the GROK Studios imprint, which had also released Lenssen's concept band \\"Rushing To Redlights\\". The Oneironauts grew to trio status with the addition of Nick Greaves on guitar before ultimately becoming The Most Serene Republic. Their debut album Underwater Cinematographer was produced, mixed and engineered by Lenssen and mastered by Ryan A. Mills and recorded at ASF Studios. Its original release was in late 2004 on the independent label Sunday League Records before being picked up by Arts & Crafts. It was re-released on June 28, 2005 featuring new artwork. They were the first band signed by Arts & Crafts that was not related to Broken Social Scene in any way or form. After touring the album extensively with the likes of Metric, Stars and Broken Social Scene, the band recorded what ultimately became the Phages EP, that was first made available when the band supported The Strokes on their Canadian tour of 2006. In 2006 longtime drummer Adam Nimmo left the band, replaced by Tony Nesbitt-Larking. Tony appeared on Population and toured with the band throughout 2008. TMSR spent much of 2007 prepping their second album Population, which was released by Arts & Crafts on October 2, 2007 to generally positive reviews. In 2007 Jewett and Lenssen appeared on MTV Canada to promote the release of Population. This would be the band's first television appearance. The two were interviewed during the airing of Making The Band wearing Star Trek outfits. During the interview they said they were on their way to a Star Trek Convention following the interview. In 2008 the full band appeared on MTV Live for an interview and three-song performance. In an interview from June 17, 2008, guitarist Nick Greaves stated that the band will be recording their third album with Broken Social Scene and Super Furry Animals producer David Newfeld, and hinted there might be a slight change of musical direction. 2008 saw the release of Live At XMU, a 4-song acoustic EP made up of songs from Population and Phages. It was recorded December 11, 2007 at the XMU studios in Washington, D.C.and released August 12, 2008 exclusively to iTunes. On April 20, 2009, the band announced their newest album, ...And The Ever Expanding Universe, would be released on July 14, and offered the album's second track, \\"Heavens to Purgatory\\", as a free download. In addition, they announced that an EP of 16-bit remixes entitled Digital Population would be released on April 28. On August 14 their song \\"Humble Peasants\\" was featured in the trailer for \\"A Generation After Genocide\\" a documentary about the healing power of soccer in Rwanda. Their video \\"Heavens to Purgatory\\" was directed by Ben Steiger-Levine and was nominated for Video of the Year at the 2010 Juno Awards. The band released \\"Pre Serene: Thee Oneironauts\\", a remastered compilation of material recorded by the band's direct ancestor, Thee Oneironauts in the latter half of 2003, on May 24, 2011. The Most Serene Republic have announced a return to action with their first new full-length album in six years, Mediac, which will arrive November 13 on MapleMusic Recordings.

(1998). Foundations of Social Research: Meaning and Perspective in the Research Process. SAGE Publications. . Describing Freire (1976). p. 155-156. It is a method of defamiliarization of common sense. Problematization is a critical thinking and pedagogical dialogue or process and may be considered demythicisation. Rather than taking the common knowledge (myth) of a situation for granted, problematization poses that knowledge as a problem, allowing new viewpoints, consciousness, reflection, hope, and action to emerge. What may make problematization different from other forms of criticism is its target, the context and details, rather than the pro or con of an argument. More importantly, this criticism does not take place within the original context or argument, but draws back from it, re- evaluates it, leading to action which changes the situation. Rather than accepting the situation, one emerges from it, abandoning a focalised viewpoint. To problematize a statement, for example, one asks simple questions: * Who is making this statement? * For whom is it intended? * Why is this statement being made here, now? * Whom does this statement benefit? * Whom does it harm? The term is also used in association with actor‚Äìnetwork theory (ANT), and especially the \\"sociology of translation\\" to describe the initial phase of a translation process and the creation of a network. According to Michel Callon, problematization involves two elements: # Interdefinition of actors in the network # Definition of the problem/topic/action program, referred to as an obligatory passage point (OPP) == Problematization (Foucault) == For Michel Foucault, problematization serves as the overarching concept of his work in \\"History of Madness\\". He treats it both as an object of inquiry and a specific form of critical analysis. As an object of inquiry, problematization is described as a process of objects becoming problems by being ‚Äúcharacterized, analyzed, and treated‚Äù as such. As a form of analysis, problematization seeks to answer the questions of ‚Äúhow and why certain things (behavior; phenomena, processes) became a problem‚Äù. Foucault does not distinguish clearly problematization as an object of inquiry from problematization as a way of inquiry. Problematization as a specific form of critical analysis is a form of ‚Äúre-problematization‚Äù. === History of Thought === Problematization is the core of his ‚Äúhistory of thought‚Äù which stands in sharp contrast to \\"history of ideas\\" (\\"the analysis of attitudes and types of action\\") as well as \\"history of mentalities\\" (\\"the analysis of systems of representation\\"). The history of thought refers to an inquiry of what it is, in a given society and epoch, ‚Äúwhat allows one to take a step back from his way of acting or reacting, to present it to oneself as an object of thought and question it as to its meaning, its conditions and its goals‚Äù. Therefore, thought is described as a form of self-detachment from one's own action that allows ‚Äúto present it to oneself as an object of thought [and] to question it as to its meaning, its conditions, and its goals\\". Thought is the reflection of one's own action ‚Äúas a problem‚Äù. According to Foucault, the notions of thought and problematization are closely linked: to problematize is to engage in ‚Äúwork of thought‚Äù. Crucially, then, Foucault implies that our way of reflecting upon ourselves as individuals, as political bodies, as scientific disciplines or other, has a history and, consequently, imposes specific (rather than universal or a priori) structures upon thought.  Responses To Problems  A central element in the problematization analysis are responses to problems. The analysis of a specific problematization is ‚Äúthe history of an answer (‚Ä¶) to a certain situation‚Äù. However, Foucault stresses that \\"most of the time different responses [...] are proposed\\". His analytical interest focuses on finding at the root of those diverse and possibly contrasting answers, the conditions of possibility of their simultaneous appearance, i.e. ‚Äúthe general form of problematization‚Äù. This sets Foucauldian problematization apart from many other approaches in that it invites researchers to view opposing scientific theories or political views, and indeed contradictory enunciations in general as responses to the same problematization rather than as the manifestations of mutually excluding discourses. It is this level of problematizations and discourses that Foucault refers to when establishing that Foucault's ‚Äúhistory of thought‚Äù seeks to answer the question of \\"how [...] a particular body of knowledge [is] able to be constituted?\\".  Engaging in Problematization  Engaging in problematization entails questioning beliefs held to be true by society. Ultimately, this intellectual practice is ‚Äúto participate in the formation of a political will‚Äù. It also carves out elements that ‚Äúpose problems for politics‚Äù. At the same time, it also requires self-reflection on behalf of the intellectual, since problematization is to investigate into the ontological question of the present and to determine a distinguishing ‚Äúelement of the present\\".

During his career, he won a number of race stages and finished fourth in the cycling road race at the 1996 Olympics. His testimony played a key part in the United States Anti-Doping Agency's investigation of fellow U.S. Postal cyclist Lance Armstrong's doping practices. ==BiographyCycling career=== Andreu was born in Dearborn, Michigan. He began his cycling career in track cycling, with Wolverine Sports Club in Detroit, winning the individual pursuit during the 1984 Junior National Track Cycling Championships in Trexlertown, Pennsylvania. In 1985, he finished first in the Madison during the National Track Cycling Championships in Indianapolis, Indiana and second in the points race and team pursuit. In 1988, he qualified as a member of the United States cycling team for that year's Olympic Games, where he finished eighth in the points race. Andreu moved from track cycling to road cycling after signing to the 7-Eleven Pro Cycling Team in 1989 when he finished his first professional stage race, the Giro d'Italia. His highest finish in the Tour de France was second during the 18th stage of the 1993 race where he was teammates with a young Lance Armstrong on the Motorola Pro cycling team. Andreu finished fourth in the road race during the 1996 Olympic Games in Atlanta, Georgia. He is best remembered by the professional cycling community for his role as a \\"super domestique\\". ===Performance-enhancing drug use=== In a September 2006 interview given to The New York Times, Andreu admitted that he had taken the performance- enhancing drug erythropoietin (EPO) to help prepare for the 1999 Tour de France. Andreu said that he was introduced to performance-enhancing drugs in 1995 while he was riding for Motorola. Andreu gave more details in his September 2012 USADA affidavit declaring he used EPO in 1998 as he traveled preparing for the 1999 Tour. Andreu declared he knowingly received EPO injections in 1999 after races by the USPS Team doctor, Luis Garcia del Moral. His wife, Betsy, became suspicious when she watched her husband pull Armstrong through the Alps at Sestriere during the ninth stage of the 1999 Tour, which paved the way for Armstrong to win the first of his seven titles. She knew that Frankie was a sprinter, not a climber; normally, it would have been all he could do to finish a mountain stage. Her suspicions were confirmed shortly after the Tour, when she found a thermos with EPO in their refrigerator. Betsy questioned Andreu about the drugs and was very upset. In a signed affidavit to the U.S. Anti-Doping Agency (USADA), Andreu testified he responded to his wife by saying: \\"You don't understand. This is the only way I can keep up in the Tour.\\" Betsy then told her husband that if he needed to dope to be on the USPS team, he shouldn't be riding for it. Andreu continued to ride strongly for the USPS Team in 2000 and to serve as the team's Assistant Director in 2001 and 2002. ===Armstrong testimony=== In 2005, Andreu and his wife Betsy testified that Lance Armstrong told cancer doctors in their presence in 1996 he had doped with EPO (erythropoietin), growth hormone and steroids. This took place after Frankie Andreu began using performance-enhancing drugs himself in 1995. The Andreus' testimony was intended to remain sealed in court documents and is among thousands of pages of documents related to litigation between Armstrong and a Texas-based company that was attempting to withhold a $5 million bonus. Armstrong swore under oath it didn't happen. Frankie Andreu never offered information to media sources on the topic until court documents were released. He then stood by his testimony when giving interviews.VeloNews  Papers charge Armstrong admitted doping  The Journal of Competitive Cycling A settlement was reached in February 2006 before the three-person arbitration panel made a ruling. As part of the settlement, SCA Promotions paid Armstrong and Tailwind Sports $7.5 million, to cover the $5-million bonus plus interest and lawyers' fees. In a statement, Armstrong said, \\"It's over. We won. They lost. I was yet again completely vindicated.\\" Armstrong's statement also suggested that Betsy Andreu may have been confused by possible mention of his post-operative treatment which included steroids and EPO that are routinely taken to counteract wasting and red-blood-cell destroying effects of intensive chemotherapy.VeloNews  Armstrong issues statement  The Journal of Competitive Cycling In that period of time, the Andreus claim to have received threatening messages on their answering machine left by Stephanie McIlvain, the Oakley representative for Armstrong. In one of them, she stated that she hopes someone \\"breaks a baseball bat over your [Betsy's] head\\", among other threats. In 2012, the Andreus participated in the USADA investigation into Armstrong's doping practices, testifying along with 24 other witnesses, including former Armstrong teammates. Armstrong did not contest the doping charges, was banned for life from competing and was stripped of all results from August 1, 1998 onward, including his seven Tour de France titles. In the USADA's 200 page \\"Reasoned decision\\", the hospital room incident where the Andreus heard Armstrong say to his doctor that he took performance-enhancing drugs was covered in great details in the \\"Addendum Part 2\\". In a January 2013 interview, Lance Armstrong finally admitted that he had used performance- enhancing drugs for much of his professional career, including all seven of his Tour de France wins. In response to being asked if the 1996 claims by the Andreus were true, he responded; \\"Um, I‚Äôm not gonna take that on. I‚Äôm laying down on that one\\". He also admitted to describing Betsy as a \\"crazy bitch\\". ===Post-racing career=== Andreu has served as a bicycle race commentator for Universal Sports on the Versus television network since retiring from professional cycling in 2001 and remains active in domestic pro racing, often lending his voice and knowledge announcing for professional races. Frankie also serves as the official voice of the USA CRITS Series on USACRITS.tv In 2007, Andreu became the director of Rock Racing, but resigned in January 2008 stating differences \\"with business strategies and the direction the team is headed\\". When Andreu started out with Rock Racing, he described in a Cycling News interview how attitudes in cycling had changed, and that it was no longer acceptable to use drugs. A year later, it was clear that there were differences between him and the owner of Rock & Republic jeans, Michael Ball. Andreu was unhappy that his role as a director was being undermined; in some instances, he was not consulted before riders were signed. Many of the riders, including Tyler Hamilton, Santiago Botero, Oscar Sevilla and Mario Cipollini, were involved in or linked to drug investigations in cycling. This raised eyebrows, especially when aligned with Ball's \\"win or you're fired\\" mentality. Andreu was working with the American women's cycling team, Proman, in 2008. The team hoped to draw attention to women's cycle racing with Andreu's leadership. In 2010, Andreu took the position of directeur sportif for the Kenda Pro Cycling team, a UCI Continental team sponsored by 5-hour Energy.5-hour Energy presented by Kenda Racing Team Andreu was also identified as the only American that Lance Armstrong would allow to interview him in Alex Gibney's documentary The Armstrong Lie. ==Major results== ;1991 :8th Overall Ruta del Sol :8th Paris‚ÄìTours ;1992 :7th Tour du Haut-Var ;1993 :7th Het Volk ;1994 :1st Stage 7 Tour of Poland :9th Paris‚ÄìRoubaix ;1996 :4th Olympics Road Race ;1997 :1st Stage 6 Mi-Ao√ªt Bretonne ;1998 :1st Lancaster Classic :1st Stage 5 Tour du Luxembourg ;2000 :8th Overall Paris‚ÄìNice ==See also== *List of doping cases in cycling *List of sportspeople sanctioned for doping offences == References * Frankie Andreu at CyclingBase.com * * Frankie Andreu's 1989 Eddy Merckx 7-Eleven TEAM bike Category:1966 births Category:Living people Category:American male cyclists Category:American sportspeople in doping cases Category:Cyclists at the 1988 Summer Olympics Category:Cyclists at the 1996 Summer Olympics Category:Doping cases in cycling Category:Sportspeople from Dearborn, Michigan Category:Olympic cyclists of the United States Category:Cycling announcers Category:Tour de France cyclists ","title":"Frankie Andreu"},{"id":"2224181","text":"The Ghotki rail crash occurred on 13 July 2005, at around 3:40am local time (2240 July 12 UTC) near Ghotki, Pakistan. No. 24 Dn train (Quetta Express) stopped at the station of Sarhad was hit from behind by the following Karachi Express (No. 16 Dn) train, causing several cars to derail; these were then hit by a third train running in the opposite direction (Tezgam). A total of seventeen train cars, carrying over 3000 passengers, were wrecked. Estimates of the death toll ranged as high as over 130. It was the worst train accident in Pakistan in fifteen years. ==Accident== The Quetta Express was stopped at Sarhad station because of a fault in the brakes when the Karachi Express travelling from Lahore to Karachi on the same line half an hour later and moving at about 120km/h (75mph), collided with it from behind. An emergency brake application after the crew saw the tail light of the stopped train could not prevent the collision because of insufficient braking power; two coaches had been isolated from the train braking system. The collision caused at least three train cars to derail onto the opposite direction track, where they were subsequently hit by Tezgam, heading from Karachi to Rawalpindi. More cars were derailed by this second impact, bringing the total to thirteen. All three trains were full of passengers, as trains often are in Pakistan. a total of seventeen cars were wrecked, with over 3000 passengers. The Ghotki crash was the worst rail accident in Pakistan since the 1990 Sukkur rail disaster. The exact number killed was not originally known; initial reports were of 109 120, 127, or more than 130 deaths, with many critically injured. ==Causes== Initially the conductor or driver of the Karachi Express was believed to have missed or misread a signal, but subsequent investigations found that the signalling system was faulty and the crew had misjudged which signal was wrong. Also the points had not been set to direct the train to the loop line. ==References Category:Railway accidents in 2005 Rail crash Category:Train collisions in Pakistan Category:Transport in Sindh Category:History of Sindh (1947‚Äìpresent) Category:2005 in Pakistan Category:Government of Shaukat Aziz Category:Accidents and incidents involving Pakistan Railways ","title":"Ghotki rail crash"},{"id":"2224185","text":"The Balete people, traditionally called the Bamalete, or baMalete, are a Southern African ethnic group.

The song was written by bassist Dee Dee Ramone in the style of the Beach Boys and early surf rock bands. The song is about Rockaway Beach in Queens, where Dee Dee liked to spend time. Guitarist Johnny Ramone claimed that Dee Dee was \\"the only real beachgoer\\" in the group. Released in 1977, it was the Ramones' highest-charting single in their career, peaking at number 66 on the Billboard Hot 100. In June 2013, the song was used in a radio ad campaign sponsored by Queens Economic Development Corporation to promote recovery from Hurricane Sandy by drawing New Yorkers back to Rockaway Beach. ==Background== \\"Rockaway Beach\\" was inspired by the actual Rockaway Beach located in New York, where lead singer Joey Ramone was raised. The song was written by bassist Dee Dee Ramone who frequently visited the beach. ==Composition== \\"Rockaway Beach\\" is an punk rock song that runs for a duration of two minutes and six seconds. According to the sheet music published at Musicnotes.com by Alfred Music, it is written in the time signature of common time, with a driving punk rock tempo of 185 beats per minute. \\"Rockaway Beach\\" is composed in the key of A major, while Joey Ramone's vocal range spans from the low-note of E4 to the high-note of A5. The song has a basic sequence of C‚ÄìD‚ÄìC‚ÄìD during the introduction, follows A‚ÄìD‚ÄìE in the verses and chorus, and changes to G‚ÄìDtype2‚ÄìD‚ÄìE‚ÄìF‚ÄìC at the bridge as its chord progression. The musical arrangement opens with an instrumental introduction, where a rhythm guitar part is played at high-speed using downstrokes with grinding distortion. \\"Rockaway Beach\\" is a breezy number laden with catchy hooks. It express carefree lyrics that hearken back to simpler, brighter days of the band's youth. The song's verses illustrate an idiosyncratic worldview, one flanked by surfboards and discotheques. They celebrate a scene set in the middle of a hot summer in New York. ==Critical reception== Greg Beets of The Austin Chronicle called the song \\"backhanded genius\\". AllMusic's Stephen Thomas Erlewine cites \\"Rockaway Beach\\" as being among the \\"finest set of songs\\" Ramones had written for Rocket to Russia. He characterized its musical composition as \\"teeming with irresistibly catchy hooks\\". Gina Boldman, from the same publication, praised the song's \\"mindless, bopping opening\\" and summarized, \\"One of the group's most carefree and breezy songs ... The imagery puts you right in the middle of a hot New York summer in the mid-to-late '70s, and it's easy to feel as jubilant as the song (and Ramone) does. Time Out's Steve Smith hailed the song as a \\"bubblegum masterpiec\\". Music critic Robert Christgau regarded \\"Rockaway Beach\\" as an \\"actual potential hit\\". In his review of the anniversary edition, Zachary Hopskins from Slant Magazine ranks the song one of the group's \\"stone-cold classics: as likely to put a smile on one‚Äôs face and a bounce in one‚Äôs Chucks in 2017 as they were 40 years ago\\". ==Chart performance== \\"Rockaway Beach\\" has since become the Ramones' highest charting single, peaking at number sixty-six on Billboard Hot 100. ==References * Category:1977 songs Category:Songs written by Dee Dee Ramone Category:Ramones songs Category:Song recordings produced by Tony Bongiovi Category:1977 singles Category:Sire Records singles Category:Song recordings produced by Tommy Ramone Category:Songs about New York City Category:Songs about beaches ","title":"Rockaway Beach (song)"},{"id":"2224206","text":"The New Zealand Republican Party of 1967 was a political party which campaigned for the creation of a New Zealand republic.

Various standards have applied to English units at different times, in different places, and for different applications. The two main sets of English units were the Winchester Units, used from 1495 to 1587, as affirmed by King Henry VII, and the Exchequer Standards, in use from 1588 to 1825, as defined by Queen Elizabeth I. The English units were replaced by Imperial Units in 1824 (effective 1 January 1826) by a Weights and Measures Act, which retained many though not all of the unit names and redefined (standardised) many of the definitions. Use of the term \\"English units\\" can be ambiguous, as, in addition to the meaning used in this article, it is sometimes mistakenly used to refer to United States customary units, which have somewhat different definitionsMarks' Standard Handbook for Mechanical Engineers, McGraw Hill, 2006, or to Imperial units, the standard units throughout the British Empire and Commonwealth. ==History== Very little is known of the measurement units of the British Isles prior to Roman colonisation in the 1st century AD. During the Roman period, Roman Britain relied on Ancient Roman units of measurement. During the Anglo-Saxon period, the North German foot of 13.2 inches (335 millimetres) was the nominal basis for other units of linear measurement. The foot was divided into 4 palms or 12 thumbs. A cubit was 2 feet, an elne 4 feet. The rod was 15 Anglo-Saxon feet, the furlong 10 rods. An acre was 4 √ó 40 rods, i.e. 160 square rods or 36,000 square Anglo-Saxon feet. However, Roman units continued to be used in the construction crafts, and reckoning by the Roman mile of 5,000 feet (or 8 stades) continued, in contrast to other Germanic countries which adopted the name \\"mile\\" for a longer native length closer to the league (which was 3 Roman miles). From the time of Offa King of Mercia (8th century) until 1526 the Saxon pound, also known as the moneyers' pound (and later known as the Tower pound) was the fundamental unit of weight (by Offa's law, one pound of silver, by weight, was subdivided into 240 silver pennies, hence (in money) 240 pence - twenty shillings - was known as one pound). Prior to the enactment of a law known as the \\"Composition of Yards and Perches\\" () some time between 1266 and 1303, the English system of measurement had been based on that of the Anglo- Saxons, who were descended from tribes of northern Germany. The Compositio retained the Anglo-Saxon rod of 5.03 metres and the acre of 4 √ó 40 rods. However, it redefined the yard, foot, inch, and barleycorn to of their previous value. Thus, the rod went from 5 old yards to new yards, or 15 old feet to new feet. The furlong went from 600 old feet (200 old yards) to 660 new feet (220 new yards). The acre went from 36,000 old square feet to 43,560 new square feet. Scholars have speculated that the Compositio may have represented a compromise between the two earlier systems of units, the Anglo- Saxon and the Roman. Contrary to popular belief, the Norman conquest of England had little effect on British weights and measures, other than to introduce one new unit: the bushel. William the Conqueror, in one of his first legislative acts, confirmed existing Anglo-Saxon measurement, a position which was consistent with Norman policy in dealing with occupied peoples. Another popular myth is that the Magna Carta of 1215 (specifically chapter 35) had a significant effect on English weights and measures, for this document only mentions one unit (the London Quarter) but does not define it. Later development of the English system was by defining the units in laws and by issuing measurement standards. Standards were renewed in 1496, 1588 and 1758. The last Imperial Standard Yard in bronze was made in 1845; it served as the standard in the United Kingdom until the yard was redefined by the international yard and pound agreement (as 0.9144 metres) in 1959 (statutory implementation was in the Weights and Measures Act of 1963). Over time, the English system had spread to other parts of the British Empire. ===Timeline=== Selected excerpts from the bibliography of Marks and Marking of Weights and Measures of the British Isles *1215 Magna Carta ‚Äî the earliest statutory declaration for uniformity of weights and measures *1335: 8 & 9 Edw III c1 ‚Äî First statutory reference describing goods as avoirdupois *1414 2 Hen V c4 ‚Äî First statutory mention of the Troy pound *1495 12 Hen VII c5 ‚Äî New Exchequer standards were constructed including Winchester capacity measures defined by Troy weight of their content of threshed wheat by stricken measure (first statutory mention of Troy weight as standard weight for bullion, bread, spices etc.). *1527 Hen VIII ‚Äî Abolished the Tower pound *1531 23 Hen VIII c4 ‚Äî Barrel to contain 36 gallons of beer or 32 of ale;

Mostly for measuring cloth. ; Fathom : Distance between arms outstretched, from fingertip to fingertip, equalling 6 feet. ; Rod (= perch) (= pole): Used for surveying land and in architecture. The rod is the same length today as in Anglo-Saxon times, although its composition in terms of feet were changed by the Composition of Yards and Perches from 15 feet to . The pole is commonly used as a measurement for Allotment Gardens. (See also perch as an area and a volume unit.) ; Chain : four linear rods. Named after the length of surveyor's chain used to measure distances until quite recently. Any of several actual chains used for land surveying and divided in links. Gunter's chain, introduced in the 17th century, is 66 feet. ; Furlong (= stade) : Notionally the distance a plough team could furrow without rest, but actually a measure of 40 rods or 600 feet prior to the Composition of Yards and Perches and 40 rods or 660 feet afterwards. ; Mile : Originally the Roman mile alternatively reckoned as 5000 feet, 1000 paces, or 8 stades but adjusted to 5280 feet in 1593 to account for the differences introduced to these methods of reckoning by the Composition of Yards and Perches. ; League : Notionally an hour's travel, but usually reckoned as three miles. Approximate length of the traditional \\"mile\\" in German and Scandinavian countries. == Area == ; Perch: an area equal to one square rod. (See also perch as a length and volume unit.) ; Rood: one quarter of an acre, confusingly sometimes called an acre itself in many ancient contexts. One furlong in length by one rod in width, or 40 square rods. ; Acre: area of land one chain (four rods) in width by one furlong in length. As the traditional furlong could vary in length from country to country, so did the acre. In England an acre was 4,840 square yards, in Scotland 6,150 square yards and in Ireland 7,840 square yards. It is a Saxon unit, meaning field. Traditionally said to be \\"as much area as could be ploughed in one day\\". ; Bovate: the amount of land one ox can plough in a single year (also called an oxgang). Approximately 15 acres or one eighth of a carucate. ; Virgate: the amount of land a pair of oxen can plough in a single year. Approximately 30 acres (also called yard land). ; Carucate: an area equal to that which can be ploughed by one eight-oxen team in a single year (also called a plough or carve). Approximately 120 acres. === Administrative units === ; Hide: four to eight bovates. A unit of yield, rather than area, it measured the amount of land able to support a single household for agricultural and taxation purposes. ; Knight's fee: five hides. A knight's fee was expected to produce one fully equipped soldier for a knight's retinue in times of war. ; Hundred or wapentake: 100 hides grouped for administrative purposes. == Volume == Many measures of capacity were understood as fractions or multiples of a gallon. For example, a quart is a quarter of a gallon, and a pint is half of a quart, or an eighth of a gallon. These ratios applied regardless of the specific size of the gallon. Not only did the definition of the gallon change over time, but there were several different kinds of gallon, which existed at the same time. For example, a wine gallon with a volume of 231 cubic inches (the basis of the U.S. gallon), and an ale gallon of 282 cubic inches, were commonly used for many decades prior to the establishment of the imperial gallon. In other words, a pint of ale and a pint of wine were not the same size. On the other hand, some measures such as the fluid ounce were not defined as a fraction of a gallon. For that reason, it is not always possible to give accurate definitions of units such as pints or quarts, in terms of ounces, prior to the establishment of the imperial gallon. ===General liquid measures=== ;Dram: 60 minim or drops or fluid ounce (fl oz) ;Teaspoon: 80 minim or drops or fl oz ;Tablespoon: 4 dram (240 minim or drops), 3 teaspoons, or fl oz ;Jack: usually gill, in some dialects equal to a gill or pint ;Gill or Jill: 2 jacks, pint, or gallon, in some dialects pint ;Pint: 2 cups or gallon ;Quart: 2 pints or gallon ;Pottle: 2 quarts or gallon ;Gallon: 2 pottle, 4 quarts, 8 pints Liquid measures as binary submultiples of their respective gallons (ale or wine): {  - ! !! jack !! gill !! pint !! quart !! pottle !! gallon ! 2n gal. - !1 jack = 1 ‚Äì6 - !1 gill = 21 ‚Äì5 - !1 pint = 841 ‚Äì3 - !1 quart = 16821 ‚Äì2 - !1 pottle = 3216421 ‚Äì1 - !1 gallon = 64328421 0 } ===Wine=== Wine is traditionally measured based on the wine gallon and its related units. Other liquids such as brandy, spirits, mead, cider, vinegar, oil, honey, and so on, were also measured and sold in these units. The wine gallon was re-established by Queen Anne in 1707 after a 1688 survey found the Exchequer no longer possessed the necessary standard but had instead been depending on a copy held by the Guildhall. Defined as 231 cubic inches, it differs from the later imperial gallon, but is equal to the United States customary gallon. ;Rundlet: 18 wine gallons or wine pipe ;Wine barrel: 31.5 wine gallons or wine hogshead ;Tierce: 42 wine gallons, puncheon or wine pipe ;Wine hogshead: 2 wine barrels, 63 wine gallons or wine tun ;Puncheon or tertian: 2 tierce, 84 wine gallons or wine tun ;Wine pipe or butt: 2 wine hogshead, 3 tierce, 7 roundlet or 126 wine gallons ;Wine tun: 2 wine pipe, 3 puncheon or 252 wine gallons ===Ale and beer=== ;Pin: 4.5 gallons or beer barrel ;Firkin: 2 pins, 9 gallons (ale, beer or goods) or beer barrel ;Kilderkin: 2 firkins, 18 gallons or beer barrel ;Beer barrel: 2 kilderkins, 36 gallons or beer hogshead ;Beer hogshead: 3 kilderkins, 54 gallons or 1.5 beer barrels ;Beer pipe or butt: 2 beer hogsheads, 3 beer barrels or 108 gallons ;Beer tun: 2 beer pipes or 216 gallons ===Grain and dry goods=== The Winchester measure, also known as the corn measure, centered on the bushel of approximately 2,150.42 cubic inches, which had been in use with only minor modifications since at least the late 15th century. The word corn at that time referred to all types of grain. The corn measure was used to measure and sell many types of dry goods, such as grain, salt, ore, and oysters. However, in practice, such goods were often sold by weight. For example, it might be agreed by local custom that a bushel of wheat should weigh 60 pounds, or a bushel of oats should weigh 33 pounds. The goods would be measured out by volume, and then weighed, and the buyer would pay more or less depending on the actual weight. This practice of specifying bushels in weight for each commodity continues today. This was not always the case though, and even the same market that sold wheat and oats by weight might sell barley simply by volume. In fact, the entire system was not well standardized. A sixteenth of a bushel might be called a pottle, hoop, beatment, or quartern, in towns only a short distance apart. In some places potatoes might be sold by the firkin‚Äîusually a liquid measure‚Äîwith one town defining a firkin as 3 bushels, and the next town as 2 1/2 bushels. The pint was the smallest unit in the corn measure. The corn gallon, one eighth of a bushel, was approximately 268.8 cubic inches. Most of the units associated with the corn measure were binary (sub)multiples of the bushel: {  - ! !! pint !! quart !! pottle !! gallon !! peck !! kenning !! bushel !! strike !! coomb !! seam ! 2n gal. - !1 pint = 1 ‚Äì3 - !1 quart = 21 ‚Äì2 - !1 pottle = 421 ‚Äì1 - !1 gallon = 8421 0 - !1 peck = 168421 1 - !1 kenning = 32168421 2 - !1 bushel = 6432168421 3 - !1 strike = 1286432168421 4 - !1 coomb = 2561286432168421 5 - !1 seam = 5122561286432168421 6 - } Other units included the wey (6 or sometimes 5 seams or quarters), and the last (10 seams or quarters). ===Specific goods=== ;Perch: 24.75 cubic feet of dry stone, derived from the more commonly known perch, a unit of length equal to 16.5 feet.Blocksma, Mary. Reading the Numbers. New York: Penguin Books, 1989. ;Cord: 128 cubic feet of firewood, a stack of firewood 4 ft √ó 4 ft √ó 8 ft == Weight == Chart showing the relationships of weight measures. The Avoirdupois, Troy and Apothecary systems of weights all shared the same finest unit, the grain; however, they differ as to the number of grains there are in a dram, ounce and pound. This grain was legally defined as the weight of a grain seed from the middle of an ear of barley. There also was a smaller wheat grain, said to be (barley) grains or about 48.6 milligrams. The avoirdupois pound contained 7,000 grains and was used for all products not subject to Apothecaries's or Tower weight. === Avoirdupois === ; Grain (gr) : 64.79891 mg, of a pound ; Dram/drachm (dr) : 27.34375 gr (sixteenth of an ounce) (possibly originated as the weight of silver in Ancient Greek coin drachma) ; Ounce (oz) : 16 dr = 437.5 grains ‚âà 28 g ; Pound (lb) : 16 oz = 7000 grains ‚âà 454 g (NB: 'lb' stands for libra) ; Quarter : cwt ; Hundredweight (cwt) : 112 lb ; Ton : 20 cwt Additions: ; Nail : cwt = 7 lb ; Clove : 7 lb (wool) or 8 lb (cheese) ; Stone (st) : 14 lb (see Stone (unit) for other values) ; Tod : 2 st = cwt (long) === Troy and Tower === The Troy and Tower pounds and their subdivisions were used for coins and precious metals. The Tower pound, which was based upon an earlier Anglo-Saxon pound, was replaced by the Troy pound when a proclamation dated 1526 required the Troy pound to be used for mint purposes instead of the Tower pound.A proclamation of Henry VIII, 5 November 1526. Proclamation 112 in Paul L. Hughes and James F. Larkin, editors. Tudor Royal Proclamations. Volume 1. New Haven: Yale University Press,1964.

It has the alternative spelling forms of tode, todd, todde, toad, and tood. It was usually 28 pounds, or two stone. The tod, however, was not a national standard and could vary by English shire, ranging from 28 to 32 pounds. In addition to the traditional definition in terms of pounds, the tod has historically also been considered to be of a sack, of a sarpler, or of a wey. == See also == * Approximate conversion of units *Ancient Roman Units of Measurement * Comparison of the imperial and US customary measurement systems * Domesday Book * English Engineering Units * Feudalism * History of measurement * Hundred, a unit of 100 or 120 items * Imperial and US customary measurement systems * Imperial units * Long hundred of 120 * Metrication * Obsolete Scottish units of measurement * Plan for Establishing Uniformity in the Coinage, Weights, and Measures of the United States * Slug and poundal * Spanish customary units * Weights and measures * Welsh units * Winchester measure == References  External links == * English Customary Weights and Measures * Jacques J.

Mitchell is also the former president of CNN Productions, where she executive produced hundreds of hours of documentaries and specials, which received 35 Emmy Awards and five Peabody Awards. She was inducted into the Broadcasting and Cable Hall of Fame in 2008, named one of the Most Powerful Women in Hollywood by The Hollywood Reporter and featured in Fast Company‚Äôs special report, \\"The League of Extraordinary Women: 60 Influencers Who Are Changing the World.\\" Mitchell is a magna cum laude graduate of the University of Georgia with bachelor's and master's degrees in English literature (watch the 2012 commencement address she gave at her alma mater). She has taught at the University of Georgia, Virginia Commonwealth University, and at Harvard University's John F. Kennedy School of Government. == Career == Pat Mitchell started her career as an English instructor at the University of Georgia and Virginia Commonwealth University. An innate curiosity and the need to feel challenged led her to accept a position as a writer/researcher for the popular newsweekly, LOOK magazine. Only nine months later, LOOK stopped publishing, and Mitchell, an unemployed single mother living in New York City with her young son, was advised to \\"try television.\\" Over the next three decades, she created a body of award-winning work (including 35 Emmy Awards and five Peabody Awards) in front of the cameras as a news reporter and news anchor, national talk show host and White House correspondent, as well as behind the cameras as a creator and producer of documentaries and series, many of which focused on women's stories, challenges and accomplishments. In the mid-80s, she left a secure position at NBC to establish an independent production company to create, produce and host the Emmy-award-winning daytime series, \\"Woman to Woman,\\" which was the first national program produced and hosted by a woman. \\"Woman to Woman\\" also became the first television series to be added to the Schlesinger Library on the History of Women at Radcliffe College. In 1992 Mitchell approached media entrepreneur Ted Turner about producing a documentary series on the history of women in America. The resulting 10-hour series, \\"A Century of Women,\\" was broadcast in 1993 on the Turner cable networks and syndicated around the world. Turner convinced Mitchell to join Turner Broadcasting, and as president of Turner Original Productions and later CNN Productions, Mitchell was the executive producer of hundreds of hours of documentaries and specials, many of which were awarded Emmy's and Peabody Awards for Excellence; several were nominated for Academy Awards for best documentary. In 2012, The Women's Media Center honored Mitchell with their first-annual Lifetime Achievement Award. Mitchell has also been recognized with the Sandra Day O'Connor Award for Leadership, and was honored by the Center for the Advancement of Women for her accomplishments and contributions in the world of communications in creating a more equitable society for women. She is also one of 12 Americans awarded the Bodley Medal from the Oxford University. Mitchell was appointed by House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi as one of nine commissioners to develop a plan to build a National Women's History Museum in Washington, D.C. The commission delivered its report to Congress in the fall of 2016.

Routledge: London. . and active interest in others. It is the first of the four sublime states (Brahmaviharas) and one of the ten pƒÅramƒ´s of the TheravƒÅda school of Buddhism. The cultivation of benevolence (mettƒÅ bhƒÅvanƒÅ) is a popular form of Buddhist meditation. It is a part of the four immeasurables in Brahmavihara (divine abidings) meditation. Metta as 'compassion meditation' is often practiced in Asia by broadcast chanting, wherein monks chant for the laity. The compassion and universal loving- kindness concept of Metta is discussed in the Metta Sutta of Buddhism, and is also found in the ancient and medieval texts of Hinduism and Jainism as Metta or Maitri. Small sample studies on the potential of loving-kindness meditation approach on patients suggest potential benefits. However, peer reviews question the quality and sample size of these studies. ==Etymology and meaning== MettƒÅ is a Pali word, from maitrƒ´ itself derived from mitra which, states Monier-Williams, means \\"friendly, amicable, benevolent, affectionate, kind, good-will\\",Monier Williams, 1964, p. 834, entry for \\"Maitrƒ´,\\" retrieved 2008-04-29 from \\"U. Cologne\\" at http://www.sanskrit-lexicon.uni-koeln.de/cgi- bin/serveimg.pl?file=/scans/MWScan/MWScanjpg/mw0834-meSUraNa.jpg. as well as a form of \\"love, amity, sympathy\\". The term is found in this sense in the Vedic literature, such as the Shatapatha Brahmana and various early Upanishads, and Vedanga literature such as PƒÅ·πáini's A·π£·π≠ƒÅdhyƒÅyƒ´ 5.4.36. The term appears in Buddhist texts as an important concept and practice. Buswell and Lopez, as well as Harvey, translate metta as \\"loving-kindness\\". In Buddhist belief, this is a Brahma-vihara (divine abode) or an immeasurable that leads to a meditative state by being a counter to ill-will. It removes clinging to negative state of mind, by cultivating kindness unto all beings. The \\"far enemy\\" of Metta is hate or ill-will, a mind-state in obvious opposition. The \\"near enemy\\" (quality which superficially resembles Metta but is in fact more subtly in opposition to it), is (attachment) greed: here too one likes experiencing a virtue, but for the wrong reason.Buddhagosha, 'Vishudimagga' Section 2.98 == MettƒÅ meditation == MettƒÅ meditation, or often loving-kindness meditation, is the practice concerned with the cultivation of MettƒÅ, i.e. benevolence, kindness, and amity. The practice generally consists of silent repetitions of phrases such as \\"may you be happy\\" or \\"may you be free from suffering\\", for example directed at a person who, depending on tradition, may or may not be internally visualized. Two different methodological approaches have been discerned in recent review papers, practices that focus on compassion and practices focussing on loving-kindness. Focussing on compassion means that meditation consists of the wish to relieve a being from suffering, whereas focussing on loving-kindness means wishing a being happiness. The practice gradually increases in difficulty with respect to the targets that receive the practitioner‚Äôs compassion or loving-kindness. At first the practitioner is targeting \\"oneself, then loved ones, neutral ones, difficult ones and finally all beings, with variations across traditions\\". Difficult may include rude, annoying, busy bodied, arrogant, self-righteous, vice-respect, neglectful, war-profiteers, fence sitters, nay-saying, charlatans, unkind, accusers, rebukes, provocation, liars, sacrilegious and unhappy. A 2015 meta- analysis synthesising various high quality experiments on loving-kindness meditation, found a medium-sized improvement to daily positive emotion, with meditation on the loving-kindness aspect of metta having a greater effect than practices with a focus on compassion. The length of time meditating did not affect the magnitude of positive impact of the practice. Kindness is the actions to alleviate suffering. Taking actions to improve the subjective experience of someone suffering, having experienced the instinct to help someone suffering (compassion). Imagine the pain, hatred, evil, terrible, annoying, stressful person, and consider how he/she feels all the time. Empathy may be feeling the entirety of his/her subjective experience, and understanding their thoughts or feelings. ==Origins== Prior to the advent of the Buddha, according to Martin Wiltshire, there existed the traditions of Brahma-loka and meditation with the four virtues of loving-kindness, compassion, empathetic joy and equanimity. The early Buddhist texts assert that pre-Buddha ancient Indian sages who taught these virtues were earlier incarnations of the Buddha. Post-Buddha, these same virtues are found in the Hindu texts such as verse 1.33 of the Yoga Sutras of Pata√±jali, wherein the word Maitri is synonymous with Metta.Quote: ‡§Æ‡•à‡§§‡•ç‡§∞‡•Ä ‡§ï‡§∞‡•Å‡§£‡§æ ‡§Æ‡•Å‡§¶‡§ø‡§§‡•ã‡§™‡•á‡§ï‡•ç‡§∑‡§æ‡§£‡§æ‡§Ç ‡§∏‡•Å‡§ñ‡§¶‡•Å‡§É‡§ñ‡§™‡•Å‡§£‡•ç‡§Ø‡§æ‡§™‡•Å‡§£‡•ç‡§Ø‡§µ‡§ø‡§∑‡§Ø‡§æ‡§£‡§æ‡§Ç ‡§≠‡§æ‡§µ‡§®‡§æ‡§§‡§∂‡•ç‡§ö‡§ø‡§§‡•ç‡§§‡§™‡•ç‡§∞‡§∏‡§æ‡§¶‡§®‡§Æ‡•ç ‡•• ‡•©‡•©‡•• - Yogasutra 1.33; Source, SanskritDocuments.Org Loving-kindness (maitri), along with compassion and equanimity, are found in the early Upanishads of Hinduism, while loving- kindness (metta) is found in early Sutras of Jainism along with compassion, empathetic joy and equanimity. The ancient Indian Paccekabuddhas mentioned in the early Buddhist Suttas, those who lived before the Buddha, mention all \\"four immeasurables\\" and Brahmavihara, and they are claimed in the Suttas to be previous incarnations of the Buddha. According to Peter Harvey, the Buddhist scriptures acknowledge that the Metta-concept containing four Brahmavihara meditation practices \\"did not originate within the Buddhist tradition\\". The Buddha never claimed that the \\"four immeasurables\\" and related Metta-meditation were his unique ideas, states Harvey Aronson, in a manner similar to \\"cessation, quieting, nirvana\\". The pre-Buddha Chandogya Upanishad, states Jayatilleke, in section 8.15 teaches metta and ahimsa (doctrine of non- harm, esp. non-violence) to all creatures claiming that this practice leads to Brahmaloka. The shift in Vedic ideas, from rituals to virtues, is particularly discernible in the early Upanishadic thought, and it is unclear as to what extent and how early Upanishadic traditions of Hinduism and Sramanic traditions such as Buddhism and Jainism influenced each other, on ideas such as \\"four immeasurables\\", meditation and Brahmavihara. In the Jain text, the Tattvartha Sutra (Chapter 7, sutra 11), which is accepted by all Jainism sub- traditions as authoritative, there is a mention of four right sentiments: Maitri, pramoda, karunya, madhyastha: ==Buddhist texts== In the PƒÅli Canon, the term metta appears in many texts such as the Kakacupama Sutta and Karaniya Metta Sutta. Other canonical materials, such as in the Pa·π≠isambhidƒÅmagga, elaborate on it as a practice. And yet other canonical sources, such as the Abhidhamma, underline the key role of benevolence in the development of wholesome karma for better rebirths. This basic statement of intention and verse can also be found in several other canonical discourses.In addition to AN 10.176, other discourses that contain this text include: Discourse for the Brahmans of Sala (SƒÅleyyaka Sutta, MN 41) (√ëanamoli & Khantipalo, 1993); Discourse for the Brahmins of Vera√±ja (Vera√±jaka Sutta, MN 42, which is substantially a reiteration of MN 41 in a different locale); Sutta on the To Be Cultivated and Not to Be Cultivated (SevitabbƒÅsevitabba Sutta, MN 114) ( & Bodhi, 2001, p. 917); First Discourse on Hell and Heaven (Pahama-niraya-sagga Sutta, AN 10.211); Second Discourse on Hell and Heaven (Dutiya-niraya-sagga Sutta, AN 10.212); First Discourse on Intentional Actions (Pahama-sa√±cetanika Sutta, AN 10.217); Second Discourse on Intentional Actions (Dutiya-sa√±cetanika Sutta, AN 10.218); as well as in the Pa·π≠isambhidƒÅmagga (see below) and the paracanonical Milinda Pa√±ha. ===Karaniya Metta Sutta (Sn 1.8)=== Metta or lovingkindness here, states Harvey, is a heartfelt aspiration for the happiness of all beings. It is different than \\"lack of ill-will\\", and more an antidote to fear and hatred. It is the precept to conquer anger by kindness, conquer the liar by truth, conquer stingy by giving, conquer evil by good, states Harvey. ===Vatth≈´pama Sutta=== In over a dozen discourses, the following description (in English and PƒÅli) is provided for radiating loving- kindness in six directions:See for instance, in the Digha NikƒÅya alone, The Great Splendor Discourse (MahƒÅsudassana Sutta, DN 17), v. 2.4 (Walshe, 1995, p. 287); The Great Steward Discourse (MahƒÅgovinda Sutta, DN 19), v. 59 (Walshe, 1995, p. 312); The Great Lion's Roar to the Udumbarikans Discourse (Udumbarika-Sƒ´hanƒÅda Sutta, DN 19), v. 17 (Walshe, 1995, pp. 390-391); and The Lion's Roar on the Turning of the Wheel Discourse (Cakkavatti-Sƒ´hanƒÅda Sutta, DN 79), v. 28 (Walshe, 1995, p. 405). { style=\\"margin:auto\\"  style=\\"padding- right:2em\\"  One abides, having suffused with a mind of benevolence one direction of the world, likewise the second, likewise the third, likewise the fourth, and so above, below, around and everywhere, and to all as to himself; one abides suffusing the entire universe with benevolence, with a mind grown great, lofty, boundless and free from enmity and ill will.This particular English text is from the Nyanaponika (1988) translation of the Simile of the Cloth (Vatth≈´pama Sutta, MN 7), v. 12.  'Bodhgaya News(n.d.), Majjhima Nikaya, book 1, BJT p. 88, retrieved 2009-08-07 at http://www.bodhgayanews.net/tipitaka.php?title=&record;=2987 . } In the canon, this basic formula is expanded upon in a variety of ways. For instance, a couple of discoursesSee, for instance, the Discourse to Subha (Subha Sutta, MN 99) ( & Bodhi, 2001, pp. 816-17); and, The Threefold Knowledge Discourse (Tevijja Sutta, DN 13), vv. 76-77 (Walshe, 1995, p. 194). See also the Discourse to DhƒÅna√±jƒÅni (DhƒÅna√±jƒÅni Sutta, MN 97) ( & Bodhi, 2001, p. 796), in which a similar statement about union with Brahma is made by the Ven. Sariputta without the trumpeter metaphor. provide the following description to gain rebirth in the heavenly realm of BrahmƒÅ ( sahavyatƒÅya maggo) : :\\"What ... is the path to the company of BrahmƒÅ? Here a bhikkhu abides pervading one quarter with a mind imbued with benevolence, likewise the second, likewise the third, likewise the fourth; so above, below, around, and everywhere, and to all as to himself, he abides pervading the all-encompassing world with a mind imbued with benevolence, abundant, exalted, immeasurable, without hostility, and without ill will. When the deliverance of mind by benevolence is developed in this way, no limiting action remains there, none persists there. :\\"Just as a vigorous trumpeter could make himself (or herself) heard without difficulty in the four quarters, so too, when the deliverance of mind by benevolence is developed in this way, no limiting action remains there, none persists there. This is the path to the company of BrahmƒÅ.\\"MN 99 ( & Bodhi, 2001, pp. 816-17). In this translation, this text is presented as one paragraph. Here, it was divided into two, thus following the PƒÅli text presentation, to enhance readability.Given this text's length, relatively uncomplicated translation and lesser known status (e.g., compared with the Karaniya Metta Sutta), the associated PƒÅli text is not represented in this main article but here: :'''' :' (Bodhgaya News, n.d., Majjhima Nikaya, book 2, BJT p. 730 [MN 99], retrieved 2009-08-07 at http://www.bodhgayanews.net/tipitaka.php?title=&record;=3702 .) In this particular PƒÅli text, the word that is repeatedly elided (\\"...\\") is ' (\\"student\\" or \\"young man\\") so that only the text that is common to all of the identified discourses is represented here. (For instance, in MN 97, instead of ', it uses the name of the Brahmin being addressed.) ===Patisambhidamagga Mettakatha (Ps. 2.4)=== In the Khuddaka NikƒÅya's ', traditionally ascribed to Sariputta, is a section entitled MettƒÅkathƒÅ (Ps. 2.4, \\"Story on Loving- Kindness\\").In this section of this article, the primary English-language sources are Buddhaghosa & (1999), pp. 301-304, Vsm.IX,49-58; and, √ëanamoli (1987), section 11, \\"Methodical Practice: from the Patisambhidamagga.\\" The Pali is primarily based on Bodhgaya News (n.d.), Patisambhidamagga 2, BJT pp. 64-80, retrieved 2009-08-07 starting at . In this instruction, a general formula (below, in English and PƒÅli), essentially identical to the aforementioned Cunda Kammaraputta Sutta verse (especially evident in the PƒÅli), is provided for radiating benevolence: In addition, this instruction categorizes twenty-two ways in which \\"the mind-deliverance of benevolence\\" (mettƒÅcetovimutti) can be radiated with * five ways of \\"unspecified pervasion\\" (') - all beings (sabbe sattƒÅ ), all breathing things ('), all creatures (sabbe bh≈´tƒÅ bhƒÅvapariyƒÅpannƒÅ), all persons (sabbe puggalƒÅ bhƒÅvapariyƒÅpannƒÅ), all with a personality (sabbe attabhƒÅvapariyƒÅpannƒÅ) * seven ways of \\"specified pervasion\\" (') - all women (sabbƒÅ itthiyo), all men (sabbe purisƒÅ), all Noble Ones (sabbe ariyƒÅ), all non-Noble Ones (sabbe anariyƒÅ), all deities (sabbe devƒÅ), all humans (sabbe manussƒÅ), all born in lower realms (sabbe vinipƒÅtikƒÅ), * ten ways of \\"directional pervasion\\" ('), of the eastern direction (puratthimƒÅya disƒÅya), of the western direction (pacchimƒÅya disƒÅya), of the northern direction (uttarƒÅ disƒÅya), of the southern direction ( disƒÅya), of the eastern intermediate direction (puratthimƒÅya anudisƒÅya), of the western intermediate direction (pacchimƒÅya anudisƒÅya), of the northern intermediate direction (uttarƒÅ anudisƒÅya), # of the southern intermediate direction ( anudisƒÅya), of the downward direction ('), of the upward direction (uparimƒÅya disƒÅya). Moreover, the directional pervasions can then be applied to each of the unspecific and specific pervasions. For instance, after radiating benevolence to all beings in the east (Sabbe puratthimƒÅya disƒÅya sattƒÅ ...), one radiates it to all beings in the west and then north and then south, etc.; then, one radiates it to all breathing things in this fashion (Sabbe puratthimƒÅya disƒÅya ...), then all creatures, persons, and so forth until such is extended for all those born in the lower realms. ===Benefits=== The Pali Canon says that there are a number of benefits from the practicing of metta meditation, including: :One sleeps easily, wakes easily, dreams no evil dreams. One is dear to human beings, dear to non-human beings. The devas protect one. Neither fire, poison, nor weapons can touch one. One's mind gains concentration quickly. One's complexion is bright. One dies unconfused and ‚Äì if penetrating no higher ‚Äì is headed for [reborn in]Metta (Mettanisamsa) Sutta Piyadassi Thera (translator) the Brahma worlds.AN 11.16 (trans. Thanissaro, 1997b). See also AN 8.1 (similarly entitled, MettƒÅnisasa Sutta [SLTP] and MettƒÅ Sutta·πÉ [CSCD]) which omits the last three of four benefits mentioned in AN 11.16 (that is, it omits \\"One's mind gains concentration quickly. One's complexion is bright. One dies unconfused...\\"). The Canon also upholds fully ripened metta development as a foremost antidote to ill will: :‚ÄúNo other thing do I know, O monks, on account of which unarisen ill will does not arise and arisen ill will is abandoned so much as on account of this: the liberation of the heart by benevolence. For one who attends properly to the liberation of the heart by benevolence, unarisen ill will does not arise and arisen ill will is abandoned.‚ÄùAN 1.ii.7 (trans. Nyanaponika & Bodhi, 1999, p. 34). Monks, whatever grounds there are for making merit productive of a future birth, all these do not equal a sixteenth part of the liberation of mind by benevolence. The liberation of mind by benevolence surpasses them and shines forth, bright and brilliant. MettƒÅ meditation is regularly recommended to the Buddha's followers in the Pali canon. The canon generally advises radiating metta in each of the six directions, to whatever beings there may be.See, e.g. MN 7.12, Snp 1.8/Khp 9: , . A different set of practical instructions, still widely used today, is found in the 5th CE Visuddhimagga; this is also the main source for the 'near and far enemies' given above. In addition, variations on this traditional practice have been popularized by modern teachers and applied in modern research settings. == Maitrƒ´ and MettƒÅ == Metta is found in pre- Buddhist Vedic Sanskrit texts as Maitrƒ´, Maitra and Mitra, which are derived from the ancient root Mid (love), and these Vedic words appear in the Samhita, Aranyaka, Brahmana and Upanishad layers of texts in the Rigveda, Samaveda, Yajurveda and Atharvaveda.Maurice Bloomfield, A Vedic Concordance, Harvard University Press, pages 713-717 Similarly, the term appears in hymn 55 of Book 19 of the Atharvaveda, and various Upanishads. A major early Upanishad of Hinduism, named Maitri Upanishad, discusses universal kindness and amity. The Maitri Upanishad, states Martin Wiltshire, provides the philosophical underpinning, by asserting, \\"what one thinks, that one becomes, this is the eternal mystery\\". This idea, adds Wiltshire, reflects the assumption in the ancient thought that one influences their own environment and situation, causality is equitable, and \\"good volitional acts conduce pleasant situations, while bad volitional acts conduce unpleasant situations\\". The Maitri Upanishad teaches, states Juan Mascar√≥, that peace begins in one's own mind, in one's longing for truth, in looking within, and that \\"a quietness of mind overcomes good and evil works, and in quietness the soul is one: then one feels the joy of eternity.\\" The Isha Upanishad similarly discusses universal amity and loving-kindness, but without the term metta. These teachings of universal Maitri influenced Mahatma Gandhi. In Jainism, Yogabindu ‚Äì the 6th-century yoga text by Haribhadra ‚Äì uses the Sanskrit word Maitri in verses 402-404, in the sense of loving-kindness towards all living beings. ==Metta meditation research== Some pilot research studies on the effect of MettƒÅ meditation indicate an increase in positive emotions for practitioners. In particular, an immediate impact on positive emotions after practice as well as a long term effect could be shown, though these effects might not hold true for everybody. In one proof-of-concept study, uncontrolled in sample selection and benchmarking, the researchers report therapeutic potential for psychological problems like depression or social anxiety, when combined with other reliable treatments. === Therapeutic potential === The application of MettƒÅ meditation for the treatment of psychological and other healthcare-related problems is the topic of current research. Hofmann et al. discuss in their paper the potential use for therapy and report insufficient data, with some promising studies so far. Those studies could show a positive impact on problems such as schizophrenia, depression and anxiety. According to Hofmann et al., there needs to be more rigorous research, especially with the application of Buddhist approaches to loving-kindness and compassion meditation. In an 8-week pilot study in 2005, loving-kindness meditation showed reduced pain and anger in people with chronic lower back pain. Compassion meditation, a Science Daily article states, may benefit by reductions in inflammatory and behavioral responses to stress that have been linked to depression and a number of medical illnesses. MettƒÅ meditation is a central practice within mindfulness- based pain management (MBPM), the effectiveness of which has been supported by a range of studies. === Caution and reviews === Bishop in a 2002 review suggests caution on claims of benefits, and states, \\"what has been published has been rife with methodological problems. At present, we know very little about the effectiveness of this [mindfulness-lovingkindness-compassion meditation] approach; however, there is some evidence that suggests that it may hold some promise.\\" In a 2014 review of multiple studies, Galante et al. reach a similar conclusion, stating \\"results were inconclusive for some outcomes, in particular against active controls; the methodological quality of the reports was low to moderate; results suffered from imprecision due to wide CIs (confidence intervals) deriving from small studies\\" and that \\"the kindness meditation methods show evidence of individual and community benefits through its effects on their well-being and social interaction\\". ==See also== * Anapanasati Sutta * Kayagatasati Sutta * Satipatthana Sutta, also called the Four Satipatthanas * Agape, Philia, Philautia, Storge, Eros: Greek terms for love * Brahmavihara * Caritas, Latin term for love * Chesed, loving-kindness and compassionate love in Judaism * Kamma·π≠·π≠hƒÅna * Theoria, the practice of \\"loving contemplation\\" in Eastern Christianity * Yogasutras, a text that includes loving-kindness as a part of Yoga practice ==NotesSources== * Acharya Buddharakkhita (trans.)

He left Germany for sanctuary in Britain in 1934 and went on to have his teaching and performing career there. As a composer, he successfully blended the equally strong but very different influences of his primary teachers, Hindemith and Vaughan Williams. ==Life== Franz Reizenstein's parents were Dr. Albert Reizenstein (1871‚Äì1925) and Lina Kohn (b. 1880), both of Nuremberg, Germany. The family was Jewish and counted many professionals, scientists, bankers, and musically inclined people among its members. Through his mother's Kohn family, Reizenstein was related to the writer Catherine Yronwode. Reizenstein grew up in Nuremberg and was considered a child prodigy. He composed his first pieces when he was 5, and by the age of 17 he had written a string quartet. His well- to-do and artistic family encouraged him to play chamber music at home. Eventually he was sent to study composition under Paul Hindemith and piano under Leonid Kreutzer at the Berliner Hochschule f√ºr Musik.Cole, Hugo. 'Franz Reizenstein' in Grove Music Online In 1934 he emigrated to England at the age of 23 to escape the Nazis, one of the first of nearly 70 √©migr√© musicians from Nazi Europe to do so between 1933 and 1945.Michael Haas, \\"The Emigr√© Composers\\" Jewish Music Institute, University of London, 2004 Once in England, he furthered his studies under Ralph Vaughan Williams at the Royal College of Music, and began to incorporate English musical influences into his works. He also studied the piano for eleven years with Solomon Cutner. Reizenstein published his first piece, the Suite for Piano, Op. 6, in 1936. He gained more attention with the \\"virtuosic and flamboyant\\" Prologue, Variations and Finale, Op. 12, composed two years later for the violinist Max Rostal. Its South American rhythms (in the finale) were inspired by an extended tour which he took to Chile and Argentina in 1937, undertaken with another legendary violinist, Roman Totenberg. During the 1930s Reizenstein performed as a pianist and played with the violinist Carl Flesch, as well as working as a composer. He was the first to perform Hindemith's three piano sonatas of 1936 in the UK, on Wednesday 1 June 1938 at the Wigmore Hall.The Times, 30 May 1938, p 12 At the start of World War II, Reizenstein, as a German, was interned in Central Camp in Douglas, Isle of Man. He continued to compose while within the camp although he was soon released, along with the other internees who did not pose a threat to the British.Cultural Heritage and Prisoners of War: Creativity Behind Barbed Wire, edited by Gilly Carr and Harold Mytum He married his wife Marguerite in 1942, and they had a son, John Reizenstein.Biography, Royal College of Music They lived at 34, Hollycroft Avenue, London NW3.Norris, Gerald. A Musical Gazetteer of Great Britain and Ireland (1981), p 75 In 1958 he became a professor (of piano, not composition) at the Royal Academy of Music and (in 1964) the Royal Manchester College of Music. Amongst his pupils at the Academy was Philip Martin whom he taught piano and also composition. His academic credentials in composition were finally officially recognised when in 1966 he was appointed Visiting Professor of Composition at Boston University for six months, where there were also special concerts given of his works.Simon Wynberg, \\"Franz Reizenstein biography\\", The OREL Foundation ==Music== Like fellow √©migr√© composer Hans G√°l, Reizenstein rejected the serial procedures followed by many of his contemporaries and adopted a tonal, expressive style influenced by Vaughan Williams and the English lyrical tradition, tempered with the objectivity and contrapuntal complexity of Hindemith.Gordon, David and Gordon, Peter. Musical Visitors to Britain (Routledge, 2005), p 212 Hugo Cole divided his work into three periods: the first (1936-1945) emphasising motivic development, rhythmic energy and fugal counterpoint; the second (1947-1959) introducing more elegiac and expressive material; and the third (1960-1968) a late style more genial and relaxed, with freer thematic development and transformation. In the first period are the early Piano Concerto and Piano Sonata No 1. In the second are the Scherzo, Op. 21, the Piano Quintet, the 12 Preludes and Fugues and the Second Piano Concerto. The late period includes the three solo string sonatas, the Elizabeth Browning Sonnets and his final work, the Concerto for String Orchestra, which received its premiere a year after his death. He composed a number of orchestral works including overtures (such as Cyrano de Bergerac, performed at the BBC Proms on 30 August 1957)Prom 36, 30 August 1957, BBC Proms performance archive and concertos (such as the two Piano Concertos, the late Concerto for String Orchestra, a Violin Concerto and a Cello Concerto). A symphony remained unfinished at his death. The chamber and piano works are particularly highly regarded, the best known of these is the Piano Quintet in D major, Op. 23 (1949) of which the critic Lionel Salter wrote in Gramophone in July 1975: It \\"stands alongside Shostakovitch's as the most noteworthy of this century's piano quintets.\\" The Violin Sonata (1945) was dedicated to Maria Lidka, who performed it at the premiere in January 1946. That was followed by the Viola Sonata (1946), written for Watson Forbes, who performed it the same year in Cambridge.Radio Times, Issue 1259, 30 November 1947, p 24 The 12 Preludes and Fugues, heavily influenced by Hindemith's Ludus Tonalis, display Reizenstein's personal harmonic idiom (heavy with 4ths and semitones) and feature pairs of preludes and fugues that are closely related thematically. The cantata Voices of Night (1950‚Äì51) represented, according to John Weissmann, \\"the complete maturity of [his] recently assimilated musical idiom...this cantata places him at a single stroke in the English choral tradition\\".Weissmann, John. 'The Music of Franz Reizenstein' in The Listener, Issue 1215, 12 June 1952 He also wrote two operas, Men Against the Sea (1949) and Anna Kraus (1952), and composed lavish orchestral scores for the Hammer horror film The Mummy (1959) and the cult British horror film Circus of Horrors (1960). Commercially available recordings include the piano music played by Martin Jones (Lyrita SRCD.2342, 2014),Reviewed at MusicWeb International the Piano Concerto No 2 and Serenade in F with Oliver Triendl and the N√ºrnberger Symphoniker (CPO 555245-2, 2019),Reviewed at MusicWeb International and the Violin Sonata, op 20, played by Louisa Stonehill and Nicholas Burns (Lyrita SRCD.360, 2017).Reviewed at MusicWeb International ===Hoffnung Festivals=== Reizenstein contributed the Concerto Popolare (\\"A piano concerto to end all piano concertos\\") to Gerard Hoffnung's first music festival in 1956. Hoffnung's festivals were comedy events, trading on the musical knowledge of the audience. The premise of the Concerto Popolare is that the orchestra believes it is playing Tchaikovsky's First Piano Concerto, but the pianist believes he or she is playing the Grieg Piano Concerto. A pitched musical battle ensues, dragging in other themes (notably from Rhapsody in Blue, the Warsaw Concerto and the song \\"Roll Out the Barrel\\"). The soloist at the premiere was Yvonne Arnaud (otherwise a renowned actress), who had been chosen after Hoffnung's first choice, Eileen Joyce, declined. At the 1958 Hoffnung Festival he contributed (with William Mann) Let's Fake an Opera or The Tales of Hoffnung Hoffnung's Music Festivals, CD reissue, liner notes, EMI Records No. CMS 7633022, 1989 Mann's libretto consisted of \\"ridiculously juxtaposed excerpts from more than forty operas, which delighted both Reizenstein and the audience\\".Hoffnung, A. Gerard Hoffnung (Garden Press, 1988), p 156 Daniel Snowman called it \\"an insane collage of opera plots and themes\\".Snowman, Daniel. The Hitler Emigr√©s (2002) p 345 Also popular was his set of Variations on The Lambeth Walk (a popular song of the 1930s), for solo piano, each variation being a parody of the style of a major classical composer.

Players create a character from one of three character classes and explore the game's 84 locations, deciding whether to ally themselves with one of the four factions or remain neutral. The game's plot concerns an apprentice Shaper and an Agent (whose name is Shanti), both members of a secretive sect of wizards who can create life by using their own life energy. They are sent on a mission to investigate a failing Shaper colony called Drypeak. When they arrive not all is well, the player becomes drawn into a four-way war which has been hidden from the outside world. The game's development was made more simple by the use of the same game engine to that of its predecessor, though extra dialogue was involved due to the presence of four factions rather than the three in Geneforge. Video game journalists awarded both positive and average review scores, they were impressed by Geneforge 2's plot and replayability but criticized the game's graphics and ambient sound effects. ==Gameplay== Geneforge 2 is a role-playing game where the player's choice of answers during conversations with non-player characters affects how the player is regarded amongst the game's four factions. The player character is an apprentice Shaper, a feared and secretive group who can create life. Players create a character from one of three character classes and explore the area surrounding Drypeak, a failing Shaper colony, solving quests and gaining experience. Each of the three character classes has a particular playing style and can approach tasks in different ways. Guardians are fighters who excel in standard combat skills, especially hand-to-hand fighting. They are capable of shaping creations, but have little affinity for magic. Agents are the game's version of rogues, and excel in spell casting and are capable of hand-to-hand combat. The Shaper is a summoner, capable of creating living creatures by using their own life essence. Shapers rely on their creations for protection. Players can also convince certain non-player characters to join them. The game is played in 45¬∞ axonometric perspective, movement through the game's environs is real- time, combat is turn-based. The game world is divided into 84 areas accessible through a world map. Clearing areas by defeating leaders or successfully traversing the terrain allows players to bypass those areas via the world map, reducing travelling time. The game uses an auto-map, each area is completely darkened and is revealed as the player explores, similar to the fog of war used in real-time strategy games. As the player completes tasks and defeats enemies they receive experience, leading to increased levels and additional skill points. The player character's skill points can be used to increase their statistics. Canisters which increase skills or add new abilities are scattered throughout the game. Geneforge 2 offers a number of changes and additions over its predecessor. Three new creations are available to players: massive Drakons; telepathic Gazers; and acidic, decaying Rotghroths. Several new spells are available, such as Kill and Aura of Flames. The skill \\"Anatomy\\", which allowed the player to cause extra damage in melee combat, is replaced with \\"Parry\\", which has a chance of blocking incoming attacks. Also the spell \\"Dominate\\" which allows the player to take control of one of the enemies is replaced with \\"Wrack\\". The game engine itself, however, is essentially unchanged from the original Geneforge. ==Plot== An apprentice Shaper is sent on a training mission with a Shaper Agent named Shanti by the Shaper Council. The pair are tasked with assessing the failed Shaper colony Drypeak and making contact with the pair of Shapers, Barzahl and Zakary, who were dispatched years ago to revitalize the colony. The gates of Drypeak are found unmanned, much to Shanti's disgust, the Agent and her charge are also attacked by rogue Shaper creations. When the pair gain access to the colony, they find a dishevelled Zakary who informs them that both he and Barzahl were unsuccessful in revitalizing the colony, which remains a barren desert. He also states that Barzahl has died. Zakary and the population of Drypeak behave suspiciously. Shanti is shadowed by an armed guard against her will. She instructs the apprentice, who is not guarded, to explore Drypeak and beyond in order to discover the truth behind the colony and Barzahl's disappearance. A Shaper explores a desert area with four creations, 2 \\"Battle Betas\\" and 2 \\"Vlish\\" After exploring a number of the game's locations, the apprentice gains access to a guarded tunnel and is astonished to discover what lies on the other side. Whereas the valley where Drypeak is located is a dustbowl devoid of vegetation, the lands on the other side of the tunnel are lush and green, meaning highly illegal shaping is taking place in secret. Serviles, the Shapers' slaves created from life essence, show abnormal intelligence and self-awareness. While still reeling from the revelation of what lies beyond Drypeak, the Shaper apprentice discovers that Shanti has disappeared during one of her escapes from her armed escorts, her necklace lay broken on the grass outside the tunnel. At this point, approximately a quarter of the way through the game, the player's choices expand considerably. When confronted with the apprentice's findings, Zakary confesses to being part of a plot to conceal illegal experiments from the Shaper Council. Both he and Barzahl were sent to Sucia Island, the location where the original Geneforge game is set, where Barred Shaper technology had allowed Shapers to manipulate life in countless ways. Instead of destroying the Geneforge, the pair agreed to spirit away the technology and experiment in private. Several of the intelligent serviles who lived on Sucia were brought along; a number of Shapers also followed Barzahl. Zakary remained in Drypeak to provide a front for the experimentation and rogue serviles which lay beyond the tunnel. Barzahl moved further into the valleys to build settlements and run experiments. Repeated use of the canisters can render the user cold, detached and possibly mad. When Zakary saw this happening to Barzahl the pair argued, Zakary regretted his part in the deceit. This occurred a year before the arrival of Shanti and the apprentice, Zakary had lost contact with Barzahl since the argument. Zakary pledges his loyalty to the Shaper Council once more and asks for help from the apprentice in dealing with what lies beyond the guarded cave. Using the Geneforge to empower himself and his followers, the Barzites, Barzahl intends to bestow god-like abilities on himself and his followers within the city of Rising. Barzahl cut off contact with Drypeak, preparing to repel the inevitable assault of the Shaper Council, who they wish to remain independent from. The Takers, a faction of intelligent serviles who had originated on Sucia Island, were given powers by Barzahl because they worked for him. In turn the Takers created powerful dragon-like beasts called drakons, taught the drakons how to create life themselves, and betrayed Barzahl. The Takers stand for the total destruction of the Shaper Council. The Awakened, the other servile faction in Geneforge 2, believe that Shapers should treat them as equals. They had been working with the Barzites, but the Awakened's leader Learned Pinner rejected the Barzites' view that serviles need to be controlled. Trade and communications between Zakary's now Shaper Council loyalist Drypeak and the other three factions have ceased, replaced with spies and subterfuge. The player is free to decide which faction they wish to join, if any, and to explore the game world, reacting to the characters and situations they encounter. ==Development== Geneforge 2 was developed in tandem with another Spiderweb Software title, Blades of Avernum. Developer Jeff Vogel described the game's production as \\"very relaxing\\", since the game engine was already completed from the previous game he was familiar with it and therefore could devote his time to creating the game itself. Due to the different reactions the player receives from the factions, depending on their actions and conversation choices, it required days to complete a single town. This was further increased from the original game, due to there being four factions instead of three. In an interview held during the development of Geneforge 2 Vogel stated \\"I'm really excited about the Geneforge series. And we're already thinking about Geneforge 3.\\" A 20 area demo version was released, allowing players access to towns, mines and woodlands. ==Reception== Geneforge 2 received both positive and average review scores. Video game magazine PC Gamer's reviewer stated that \\"graphics aside, Geneforge 2 is a terrific game\\" for players new to the RPG genre. The reviewer of Computer Games Magazine praised the Spiderweb Software's titles and said that Geneforge 2 \\"is probably the best twenty-five bucks an RPG fiend can spend.\\" CNET's staff member was more critical, describing the game as \\"complex enough to keep you interested, but not quite good enough to enjoy.\\" Indie gaming website Game Tunnel's Gianfranco Berardi praised Geneforge 2 as \\"an RPG of amazing quality.\\" Inside Mac Games' Ken Newquist stated the game is \\"a real find\\" for players who have been disappointed by lack of gameplay in expensive mainstream titles. The game's graphics and sound effects received a largely negative response, Matt Peckham of GameSpy described them as \\"yesteryear\\" and \\"minimalist\\" respectively. Ken Newquist called the graphics \\"far from spectacular\\" and stated they were worse than older titles such as Baldur's Gate. He also highlighted that enchanted items look identical to their mundane counterparts and that highly evolved creatures are identical to their standard brethren. Newquist also disliked the ambient sounds, which make up the game's soundtrack, calling them \\"numerous, but repetitive\\". Gianfranco Berardi was more positive. He stated that \\"the graphics aren't exactly top-notch\\", but noted variation between different areas. He also said \\"the sound effects and ambience simply added to the involving storyline.\\" CNET's editor described the sound effects as \\"merely adequate\\" and the graphics \\"less so\\". Gianfranco Berardi praised the plot, stating that it \\"isn't just good background noise like in most games.\\" He added that he found the plot involving, and that it can cause the player to stop and think about their actions. Matt Peckham described the plot as \\"fantastic and original\\", and praised the game's replayability. Ken Newquist compared the game's setting to the pen and paper role-playing game Gamma World, and stated \\"players get a huge world to explore and‚Äîthanks to the intricacies of the game's plot‚Äîre-explore.\\" ==References * *Geneforge 2 main page Category:2003 video games Category:Fantasy video games Category:Indie video games Category:MacOS games Category:Role-playing video games Category:Spiderweb Software games Category:Video game sequels Category:Video games developed in the United States Category:Video games featuring protagonists of selectable gender Category:Video games with isometric graphics Category:Windows games ","title":"Geneforge 2"},{"id":"2224332","text":"Geneforge 3 is the third video game in the Geneforge series of role-playing video games created by Spiderweb Software. ==Gameplay== The games are played in a 45¬∞ axonometric view and feature turn-based combat. The lands are split up into small areas, which can be traveled through using a world map. During combat, each warrior gets a certain amount of action points, which are spent moving, attacking, casting spells, and using items. At the beginning of the game, the player chooses a type of Shaper to be. The three types are Shapers, Guardians, and Agents. When the player gains a level, he or she gains an amount of skill points, which can be spent on improving one or more of the character's abilities. The Geneforge game engine has been revamped in this sequel, debatably improving gameplay in some instances and making others more cumbersome to deal with. No new creations or spells are available to players in Geneforge 3, however a number of different features have been added. For instance, there are two NPCs who will join the party, interject comments upon situations, and possibly leave if the player does something they disagree with. Their names are Alwan and Greta. There has also been a new forging system added, allowing players to create powerful artifacts or enhance existing items. Unlike the previous two games, Geneforge 3 offers only two sides to choose from in the ensuing conflict. Players cannot get very far before being forced to choose a side, although they can change sides with some success fairly late in the game if they so desire, whereas the previous games were possible to complete without ever actually taking sides. ==Plot== The player begins as an apprentice learning the arts of Shaping. While attending school on Greenwood Isle the player character is awoken when the school is attacked. Luckily, two Shapers are ready to join the shaper and assist to survive in the world outside. Alwan is a loyal Shaper Guardian who has only one skill, that of using his iron sword. He is trained as a Guardian, to obey without questioning. Due to there not being anyone he is able to obey, at first he is disoriented by the attack and does not know what to do. The player can get him to join only after obtaining permission from the servant mind in the school. Greta is a castout from the school because she started to sympathise with the Shapers' creations. She was an Agent, skilled in magic (starts with Firebolt but the player can get teachers to teach her other spells later in the game) and battle arts (also a sword). She is living in the village, outside the school, that is aptly named South End. She consents to joining the player's group without any conditions. It is discovered that a traitor Shaper named Litalia had orchestrated the attack on the school and other strikes against Shaper communities. She and others, including a former teacher at your school, believe that the Shapers are tyrannical rulers who make the lives of their creations miserable and should be stopped by extreme measures. The rebellion has been creating rogue spawners throughout the Ashen Isles, summoning creations that are causing chaos and attacking the Shapers and those who serve them. The player can choose between fighting for Litalia and her comrades, or allying with Lord Rahul and the Shapers and stifling the insurgency. It is found that either Alwan or Greta will leave the player's group depending on which faction the player joins. Greta will leave if the player joins the Shapers due to her thinking that the player is inhumane and Alwan will leave if the player join the rebellion because he will think the player is disloyal. ==External links== * *Geneforge 3 main page *Spiderweb Software Category:2005 video games Category:Fantasy video games Category:Indie video games Category:MacOS games Category:Role-playing video games Category:Spiderweb Software games Category:Video game sequels Category:Video games developed in the United States Category:Video games featuring protagonists of selectable gender Category:Video games with isometric graphics Category:Windows games ","title":"Geneforge 3"},{"id":"2224335","text":"Gin Drinkers Bay or Gin Drinker's Bay, also known as Lap Sap Wan, was a bay in Kwai Chung, Hong Kong.

The Indravati River is a stream of the river Godavari. Its starting point, found to be the Ghats of Dandakaranya, range from a hilltop village Mardiguda of Thuamula Rampur Block in the Kalahandi district of the state of Odisha. Due to the amalgamation of three streams, The River follows a westerly path and enters Jagadalpur in the state of Chhattisgarh. The river moves from here in a southern route, before eventually uniting with the Godavari at the borders of three states. They are the state of Chhattisgarh, Maharashtra and Telangana. The river at a variety of stages of its course forms the boundary between Chhattisgarh and Maharashtra. The river Indravati is also known as the oxygen of the Bastar district of state of Chhattisgarh. This district is one of the greenest and eco-friendly districts, found in the whole of India. A total number of five hydroelectric projects were planned on the river Indravati. They were namely the Kutru I, the Kutro II, the Nugru I, Nugru II and the Bhopalpatnam. However, the plan misfired and did not see the light of the day due to ecological reasons. The Indravati is sometimes known as the \\"lifeline\\" of the Kalahandi, Nabarangapur, of Odisha & Bastar district of Chhattisgarh, one of the greenest districts in India. Most of the river course is through dense forests of Nabarangapur & Bastar. The river flows for and has a drainage area of . == Mythology behind origin of Source == There is a Hindu mythological story behind the formation of Indravati River. Once upon a time the place was full of Champa and Chandan trees, which fragranced the whole forest. Due to such a beautiful place on earth, Lord Indra and Indrani went down from Heaven to stay here for a while. They deeply enjoyed the beauty of nature; while wandering in the jungle Indra went to a small village Sunabeda (Nuapada district), where he met with a beautiful girl Udanti. At first meet, they fall in love with each others; and Indra disagreed to get back. On other side, due to disband or separation Indrani cried sorrowfully and expressed her pain to the people, where gathered there. People knew well about the Indra and Udanti; they informed the same to Indrani and suggested to stay there. Indrani got irate over Indra and pour scorn on Indra and Udanti so that they never meet again and she stayed there as Indravati River, which flows till date. And, Indra and Udanti rivers are also flowing there separately, without meeting each other due to offense of Indrani. ==Source and flow== The river Indravati rises at an elevation of in the Kalahandi district of Odisha on the western slopes of the Eastern Ghats. It flows west-ward through the Kalahandi, Nabarangapur and Koraput districts for and after forming the boundary between Odisha and Chhattisgarh states for , enters the Bastar district of Chhattisgarh. After flowing in Chhattisgarh, it turns south and flows along the boundary of Chhattisgarh and Maharashtra for about and joins Godavari River at the junction of the boundaries of Maharashtra, Chhattisgarh and Telangana states. The Indravati sub-basin covers a total area of about . Indravati has a catchment area of in Odisha.

During its total course of the river drops by . Its bed level at its junction with the Godavari River is of the order of R.L. 82.3 m compared to the level in Kalahandi from where it takes off is 914.4m.

The important left bank tributary is Nandiraj. === Indravati Dam === Indiravati Dam Indravati Dam or Upper Indravati Hydro Power Project built near Mukhiguda, Kalahandi is one of the largest Dam in India as well as Asia. It is the largest dam in eastern India which produces 600MW of electricity. The Upper Indravati Project envisages diversion of water, of the Indravati river in its upper reaches into the Mahanadi valley for power generation and irrigation. ==Other Dam proposals== A total of five hydroelectric projects (Kutru I, Kutru II, Nugur I, Nugur II and Bhopalpatnam) were planned on the stretch of Indravati River at various points in time. But none could see the light of the day due to ecological concerns raised in various fora.

All three members sang and composed. Their sound was a complex filter of their favorite music, including early Pink Floyd, the Krautrock movement and early SST Records artists like Meat Puppets and The Minutemen. ==Releases== Their first release was on the Nur Scheiss record label (Austria) and was titled He Went There So Why Don‚Äôt We Go?

Acceleration 0- for the 4-cylinder models is improved (around the mid-9-second mark), with comparable fuel efficiency to its predecessor: /city and /hwy for LX and EX models with automatic transmissions. Emissions of Non-Methane Organic Gases (NMOG), also known as unburned hydrocarbons, produced during engine warm-up are considerably lower. The LX and EX engines produce less than 0.075 grams per mile, qualifying them for California LEV (Low-Emission Vehicle) status. In California, the Accord EX with the available automatic transmission will produce less than 0.03 grams per mile of NMOG, qualifying it as the first gasoline-powered vehicle to reach ULEV (Ultra-Low Emission Vehicle) status. The five-main bearing block is high-pressure die-cast from aluminum alloy. The walls of the block extend below the centerline of the crankshaft, which helps stiffen the bottom end. FEM (Finite Element Method) computer analysis was used to arrive at optimum thicknesses for the block ribs and walls in order to minimize engine vibration. Additional bottom-end rigidity comes from a larger, stronger bearing-cap beam that ties directly into the cylinder-block skirt. An aluminum-alloy stiffener has been added between the transmission case and the block, just behind the bearing carrier. The stiffener serves to tie the block and transmission together into a single, reinforced unit. FEM was also used to design this stiffener so that it would not only stiffen the area, but also help minimize high-frequency engine vibration. Finite-element analysis of the Accord's piston design by Honda engineers yielded a new ultra-short, lightweight skirt design, which is very rigid and resistant to vibration and piston slap. Like the V-6 engine the pistons are gravity-cast aluminum alloy and utilize full-floating wrist pins in order to minimize noise. The engine's drop-forged single-plane steel crankshaft and connecting rods have been designed to be stronger and operate with less friction, much like the V-6 components. The I-section, drop-forged steel connecting rods have a completely new design and are considerably lighter than their predecessors (475 g vs. 578 g), which helps to minimize vibration. Big end-bearing journal diameter has been reduced from . Rod thickness is down from and the bolt size is smaller. Like the V-6 rod bolts, those of the 4-cylinder engine are torqued to the plastic region of the bolt material in order to ensure a solid union between the bearing cap and the connecting rod. The engine block incorporates the Honda-designed second-order balance system that cancels the inertial forces common to large-displacement 4-cylinder engines. The system consists of two parallel shafts on either side of the crank-shaft, above its centerline. Driven by a toothed belt, the balance shafts rotate in same directions at twice engine speed. Eccentric weights built into the shafts generate inertial forces that counteract the second-order forces created by the motion of the pistons and connecting rods. This Honda system minimizes vibration in the entire rpm range. Cylinder Head The 16-valve, single-overhead-camshaft cylinder head features four valves per cylinder and pentroof combustion chambers. Individual valves are smaller and lighter in 4-valve heads, which allows the engine to be revolved to a higher rpm, helping to extend the engine's power range. Valve actuation is via rocker arms and a hollow, belt- driven single overhead camshaft. The single-over-head-camshaft design requires less under-hood space than the more conventional dual overhead camshafts normally used with 16-valve, 4-cylinder engines. The adoption of a sophisticated knock control system optimizes ignition timing and allows for a higher compression ratio (9.3:1 from 8.8:1). Unleaded regular fuel is specified. Revised Intake System The intake system was simplified in shape to reduce induction resistance and noise. A larger twin-chambered air box designed to dampen resonant intake tract noise replaces the previous Accord's smaller, single-chamber damper. The new box is 10.7 liters in capacity, compared to the older unit's 8.2 liters. The larger box also eliminates the need for a second resonant-frequency damper and an additional side branch. The 2.3-liter Accord 4-cylinder engine intake manifold has been redesigned to add more power and lower emissions. The individual cast-aluminum runners have revised dimensions to better take advantage of the different air-flow characteristics of the 2.3-liter engine. A larger plenum chamber reduces induction noise and the incorporation of exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) ports into the plenum, upstream of the throttle plates, eliminates the need for a separate fitting and port in each intake runner. Low Speed Operation During low-rpm operation, only one intake valve opens, allowing air and fuel into the combustion chamber. The other intake valve has only a slight amount of lift and its timing is staggered. As a result, the air-fuel charge drawn through the open intake valve undergoes a swirl effect. The swirl creates a stratified charge with a rich mixture near the spark plug for good light-off, and a progressively leaner mixture toward its periphery. This stratified charge, combined with improved EGR control, results in lower emissions especially during the critical warm-up period, and better fuel economy. Low-friction, roller-bearing rocker arms are used to help reduce friction and improve engine efficiency.

The concept came from France's Maginot Line, built after World War I. The British believed the line could protect the colony from Japanese invasion for at least six months and even called it the \\"Oriental Maginot Line\\" (). The Japanese generals also believed the line would stop their advance until the scouts found out the line was very weak. For example, only 30 soldiers defended Shing Mun Redoubt in the Battle of Hong Kong. It had a capacity of 120 men. == Geographical location == The Line's name originated from Gin Drinkers Bay, a former bay in nearby Kwai Chung, New Territories (now reclaimed and part of Kwai Fong). It passed through Kam Shan, the Shing Mun Reservoir, Beacon Hill, Lion Rock, and Tate's Cairn, ending at Port Shelter in Sai Kung District. Its total length was 18 kilometers. Its key points were the stretch between Beacon Hill and Sha Tin Pass, and the Shing Mun Redoubt, the latter of which also housed command HQ for the Line. The Line made use of the mountains north of the Kowloon Peninsula and was strategically important in preventing any southward invasion from the New Territories. == Construction == Construction lasted from 1936 to 1938. The Line was not a solid defensive line, but rather a series of defensive positions linked together by paths.The Defence of Hong Kong - Shing Mun Redoubt and the Gin Drinker's Line; by John Cartwright Bunkers, concrete fortified machine gun posts, trenches, and artillery batteries were built along the line: however, this artillery support may have been insufficient. === Shing Mun Redoubt === Map of Shing Mun Redoubt Defensive headquarters were located at Shing Mun Redoubt ( or ), which had an observation post (acting as headquarters of the redoubt) that could call artillery support from Mount Davis battery and Stonecutters Island Fort, and four pillboxes (PB400-403) fitted with Vickers machine guns and Bren LMGs. There were 1.5 metre deep defensive channels or trenches, named after the roads of London such as Charing Cross, to aid the British soldiers of the Middlesex Regiment. == The Battle of Hong Kong  8 December 1941: initial contact === On the morning of 8 December 1941, Japanese forces bombed Kai Tak Airport, wresting control of the skies from the British and initiating the Battle of Hong Kong. At noon, the Japanese advance guard crossed the Shenzhen River to invade the New Territories. The northern garrison fell back to the Gin Drinkers Line, destroying roads and bridges on the way to make it more difficult for the invaders. By dusk, the Japanese had taken Tai Po. There were only three British Army battalions manning the Gin Drinkers Line: the 2nd Battalion, Royal Scots in the west, the 2/14th Battalion, Punjab Regiment in the centre and the 5/7th Battalion, Rajput Regiment in the east. It was hoped that they could hold for at least three weeks and inflict casualties on the Japanese. === 9 December: Japanese sneak attack === Battle of Shing Mun Redoubt On 9 December, Japanese advance scouts of the 228th Regiment headed towards Tai Mo Shan, and discovered that British defences were weak at \\"225 High Ground\\" near Shing Mun Redoubt and Shing Mun Reservoir. The high ground dominated all positions of the western portion of the Line. Therefore, the Japanese advanced a sneak attack. At 21:00 that evening, the lieutenant in charge and ten elite soldiers began the sneak attack. Combat engineers successfully breached the barbed wire and destroyed bunkers. By 07:00 on 10 December, they had taken the high ground and 27 POWs, opening a breach in the Line. The success surprised Japanese commanders who had thought at least a month was required to break the British defences, and thereby diverted more forces from mainland China to boost manpower. They also thought that a premature breakthrough would lead to rear forces and artillery troops falling behind, but ultimately agreed to launch a general assault. === 10 December: general assault === Japanese forces then opened a two-pronged assault on the Gin Drinkers Line. By the next day, they had already claimed Kam Shan and Tate's Cairn. Major General Christopher Maltby knew that the position was untenable and at noon decided to withdraw the garrison to Hong Kong Island to preserve its strength, signalling the defeat of the Line. Defenders to the west of the Line began retreating towards the island at 20:00. The Rajput Battalion stayed behind as a rear guard, only retreating on the morning of 13 December towards Devil's Peak and Lei Yue Mun towards Hong Kong Island. This was also the final retreat of British forces from the Kowloon Peninsula. == Reasons for failure == Shing Mun Redoubt in 2018 The Gin Drinkers Line was and still is considered to be a complete failure. The line and the whole of Kowloon were abandoned by the British troops in just two days. There can be said to be three main reasons: # Insufficient troops: although their weaponry was sound, there were not enough British soldiers to maximise the Line's potential. For example, the Shing Mun Redoubt could have garrisoned over 120 men, but was garrisoned by just 30 troops. # Insufficient training: most of the Hong Kong Garrison was composed of new recruits lacking field experience and proper training. # Underestimation of the Japanese: the British assumed that the Japanese did not wage night battles and relaxed their guard. They were also overconfident in the Line's capabilities and believed that the Japanese could be easily repulsed. == Today == Most of the Line's remains cannot be found. There are still some defensive structures left at Shing Mun Redoubt, and bunkers at Lion Rock, Tate's Cairn, and Port Shelter. ==See also== *Japanese Occupation of Hong Kong *Battle of Hong Kong == References == Category:British World War II defensive lines Category:World War II sites in Hong Kong Category:Subterranean Hong Kong Category:Battle of Hong Kong Category:Military of Hong Kong under British rule Category:Monuments and memorials in Hong Kong Category:Shing Mun ","title":"Gin Drinkers Line"},{"id":"2224397","text":"The Muva is a term coined by E.H.

Economic Geology, 25, 783-801. y-f-qw-c.tumblr.com The sequence is interpreted as a 1.8 billion year old shallow marine to coastal sequence which includes dunal deposits (aeolian), beach sands, offshore sand deposits and deeper water pelitic sediments. The alternation of quartzite- pelite successions was interpreted to record transgressive and regressive phases of a coastline along the southern margin of the Bangweulu Block. The presence of these type of rocks is also seen in areas that have undergone marine transgression. In the western coastline of the Indian peninsula the Jurassic strata show this character of undergoing a submergence owing to crustal disturbance on the surface of the ocean floor and lead to the presence of marl with limestone in shallow water areas. Such effects are widely observed along the western coastline of India in parts of Saurashtra (Gujarat) and the Salt Range of Rajasthan. ==References== Category:Geography of Zambia Category:Geology of Zambia ","title":"Muva"},{"id":"2224400","text":"Richard Marvin DeVos Jr. (born October 21, 1955) is an American businessman and author. The son of Amway co-founder Richard DeVos, he served as CEO of the multi-level marketing company from 1993 to 2002. In 2006, DeVos ran for Governor of Michigan, but lost to the then-incumbent Democrat Jennifer Granholm. In 2012, Forbes magazine listed his father as the #351 richest person in the world, with a net worth of approximately $5.4 billion. DeVos is the husband of Betsy DeVos, the 11th and current United States Secretary of Education. ==Family and early life== DeVos was born in Grand Rapids, Michigan, the son of Helen June (Van Wesep) and Richard Marvin DeVos. DeVos is a graduate of the Forest Hills public school system. He was involved in the family business, Amway, even as a child. \\"I still remember when it was in the basement of our home when I was growing up,\\" he later said. \\"I remember the offices being down there and people working down there.\\" As boys, he and his brother Doug were \\"tapped as mini-hosts\\", assigned to greet attendees at Amway's annual conventions, and they \\"helped out with everything from clearing plates during gatherings to ferrying guests to play tennis or waterski. That evolved to speaking in front of groups and even giving product demonstrations.\\" DeVos later said that \\"It was kind of like a Junior Achievement atmosphere contained inside of Amway. ... We just hung around the company. It was your social activity.\\" DeVos received a bachelor's degree in business administration from Northwood University. He later paid to attend, but did not complete, the Harvard Business School and the Wharton School's Executive Study Programs. DeVos has received honorary doctorates from Grove City College, Central Michigan University and Northwood University, as well as distinguished alumni recognition from Northwood University. His wife, Betsy DeVos, is the former chairperson of the Michigan Republican Party and the Secretary of Education. ==Business activitiesAmway=== :Main articles: Amway DeVos began working with Amway Corporation in 1974, holding positions in various divisions, including research and development, manufacturing, marketing, sales, and finance. In 1984, he became one of Amway's vice presidents, with overall responsibility for the company's operations in 18 countries. Under his leadership, the company opened numerous new markets and tripled foreign sales to exceed domestic sales for the first time in company history. According to one source, \\"When Dick DeVos became vice president of Amway's foreign operation in 1986, sales outside of the U.S. accounted for about 5 percent of overall sales. When he left the position six years later, they had grown to 50 percent of annual sales.\\" ===Orlando Magic=== When the DeVos family acquired the National Basketball Association's Orlando Magic basketball franchise in 1991, DeVos's father, Richard DeVos became President and CEO of the team. On October 21, 2005, it was announced that DeVos would become part owner as his father split ownership evenly between his children. Larry Guest of the Orlando Sentinel wrote in a September 1991 column that \\"civic and business leaders in Grand Rapids\\" considered DeVos \\"admirable, amicable, compassionate, honorable, community-conscious, intelligent\\", but that they wondered whether DeVos, who was about to begin running the Orlando Magic, was \\"strong enough...to make the tough decisions necessary as the chief operating officer overseeing... an NBA franchise?\\" Guest answered yes, calling DeVos \\"a business and political specialist experienced far beyond his 35 years on this globe\\" and noting that he had \\"recently attracted more than a million votes, more than any other Republican on a statewide basis, to win a seat on Michigan's Board of Education.\\" Guest quoted DeVos as saying that in making business decisions, he hopes \\"to be seen as tough, but also fair.... I'm not a control-oriented individual, but I expect results and I expect meticulous, detailed management.\\" ===Amway/Alticor=== DeVos left his positions as President and CEO of the Orlando Magic in January 1993 to rejoin Amway as its President, succeeding his father, Amway co-founder Rich DeVos. Under Dick Devos, the firm expanded operations to more than 50 countries and territories on six continents. In 2000, DeVos oversaw a significant corporate restructuring that created Alticor, the new parent company of predecessor Amway, as well as other subsidiary companies. In a 20-month span, Alticor cut over 1,300 jobs (primarily in Michigan) during this restructuring, with 400 of them being buyouts and early retirement. Job cuts were one of several cut backs made during the corporate restructuring of Amway in order to expedite the return to profitability and prevent further downsizing or the possible loss of the company. DeVos and his brother, Doug DeVos, are \\"credited with taking the company global, and setting industry standards as they moved into those markets.\\" DeVos retired as president of Alticor in August 2002. In that fiscal year, Alticor reported sales of $4.5 billion, primarily through its more than 3.5 million part-time sales force and its complementary e-commerce channel. After retiring from Alticor, DeVos returned to become president of The Windquest Group. ==The Windquest Group== The Windquest Group is a privately held investment management firm with holdings in technology, manufacturing, and other sectors. A 2010 article reported on a Windquest venture called The Green Machine, which \\"converts waste heat that's the byproduct of a manufacturing process ‚Äì in liquid or gaseous form ‚Äì into electricity.\\" DeVos explained that \\"Some time ago Windquest brought on a specialist in alternative energy. ... We knew this was going to be an important part of our future, but also an opportunity.\\" He explained that sustainability is \\"not just an environmental concept, it's also an economic one. If a particular business approach is not economically viable it will not be sustainable.\\" Windquest was not interested in \\"glitzy and glamorous\\" ideas, he said, but in \\"technologies that were environmentally sound and economically sustainable\\" and thus more likely to be widely adopted. He expressed concern \\"that some of the new products in the marketplace are either too dependent on tax incentives or subsidies\\" and not genuinely \\"viable and ...competitive\\". The Green Machine is produced by the ElectraTherm Company and distributed by Windquest in collaboration with Pro Services. \\"It's a three-legged stool\\", DeVos explained. \\"ElectraTherm provides the core technology, Pro Services provides the installation ability and the knowledge of the customers' needs and Windquest then provides both financing and high-level business acumen.\\" ==Political activities and activismPolitical activities prior to 2006=== In 1990, DeVos won election to the Michigan State Board of Education, and resigned two years into his eight-year term, citing his return to Amway as CEO as the reason. In 1996, DeVos was appointed by Governor John Engler to the Grand Valley State University Board of Control. ===School vouchers=== DeVos and his wife became co-chairs of the Education Freedom Fund in 1993. The Fund provides private scholarships to low-income families in Michigan with wishes to attend schools of their choice. When the Children's Scholarship Fund provided $7.5 million to the Education Freedom Fund, the DeVos matched the grant, and their foundation covers all of the administrative costs of the organization. In 2000, DeVos was the co-chairman of the \\"Kids First! Yes!\\" campaign committee, which sponsored a ballot-initiative that would have amended the Michigan constitution to allow vouchers and tuition tax credits for private K-12 education. The initiative lost, with 69% of voters opposing the measure. The Dick and Betsy DeVos Foundation has also given money to groups like the American Education Reform Council, Choices for Children, and Children First America, in addition to funding Christian schools in the West Michigan area. ==2006 gubernatorial candidacy== On June 2, 2005, at Mackinac Island, DeVos announced his candidacy for governor of Michigan. He is still considered to be the wealthiest man to run for statewide office in Michigan's history. As of October 27, 2006, the DeVos campaign had spent $39 million, of which nearly $35 million was DeVos's own money. An article published on August 3, 2005, quoted DeVos as saying that the main issue for Michigan voters was the state's economy. \\"We're fighting with Mississippi for the highest unemployment rate in the country. We have the lowest personal income growth, the lowest business start-ups in the country. We are the only state that has not moved to positive ground when it comes to actual numbers of jobs in the marketplace,\\" he said. He also suggested that tourism \\"is one of the businesses and industries that has a bright future for Michigan, and is exciting.\\" Criticizing Granholm's economic policies, he said that in her place \\"I would have sent a very different signal to the entire regulatory infrastructure of the state, and would have taken steps to make this state more business friendly.\\" Granholm, he said, \\"has talked about wanting business, but all of her actions and the actions of all the regulatory agencies and government agencies in this state have continued to create difficulties for business. I hear it from business people everywhere I go in this state.\\" In an interview given during the campaign, DeVos said: \\"It's all about jobs. Jobs are the number one issue in Michigan right now. Our state does not have a climate for job creation. Job-killing taxes like the SBT (Single Business Tax) punish job makers for creating jobs, providing their employees with benefits, and investing in new technology. Taxes like the SBT and Michigan's personal property tax hurt manufacturers more than any other tax. They've got to go if we want to help manufacturing and bring jobs back to Michigan.\\" He also spoke of the need to \\"work on trade issues to make sure that Detroit's automakers can compete fairly both here in the United States and around the world.\\" Thomas Bray of RealClearPolitics reported on June 21, 2006, that incumbent Jennifer Granholm was \\"in deep trouble,\\" with DeVos surging \\"to a 48‚Äì40 lead...in a Detroit News/WXYZ-TV poll.\\" In other polls, the two candidates were \\"in a dead heat,\\" and, to some observers' surprise, DeVos was leading \\"48‚Äì40 among union households.\\" Bray's conclusion was that \\"the DeVos ads are striking home with their message: that the Michigan economy is in a shambles, that Granholm has failed to develop a strategy to resurrect the state and that a hard-nosed businessman who owes nothing to anybody is just the guy to sort things out.\\" An October 2006 article in Human Events argued that the Michigan governor's race was \\"shaping up as a classic style vs. substance confrontation,\\" with Granholm, \\"a charismatic and attractive former aspiring actress who can deliver a speech and charm a crowd with the best of them,\\" representing style, and DeVos representing substance. While lacking Granholm's \\"flashier qualities,\\" DeVos's \\"business background...ideally suits him to address the state's most vexing economic issues.\\" The article noted that DeVos was interested in job creation in what was \\"perhaps the least business-friendly state in the country.\\" While Granholm argued that jobs had been moved to China and India, DeVos pointed out that \\"Michigan jobs have...gone to Ohio, Indiana, and other states with less punitive tax policies, and this governor fails to recognize that.\\" A November 3, 2006, article noted that DeVos's plan for turning around Michigan's \\"economic stagnancy and increasing unemployment\\" was called the TurnAround Plan. It called for action on four fronts: \\"creating an attractive job climate, overhauling state government, diversifying the economy, and conquering the international marketplace.\\" DeVos planned to create \\"a pro-jobs tax structure while supporting small business growth to increase jobs,\\" and described his credentials as follows: \\"I've made tough decisions, I've turned around a struggling business, and I've helped an entire city turn around.\\" He also called for an increase in \\"funding for secondary and higher education,\\" for a streamlined health-care system \\"that utilizes technology to reduce hospital errors by making medical records more efficient,\\" and for \\" strong anti-crime measures, specifically against child predators.\\" The article noted that debates between DeVos and Granholm had \\"done little to help either's cause, though they did have an effect on the polls,\\" with support for both candidates dropping and the number of undecided voters increasing. \\"Whether it has been Granholm's campaign morphing images of DeVos into President Bush, or DeVos's ads including compromising footage of the governor's speeches, neither candidate has found a way to gain an advantage.\\" The article also pointed out that \\"newspapers have divided their support along party lines, with the Detroit Free Press endorsing Granholm and The Grand Rapids Press siding with DeVos.\\" Among DeVos's supporters was Lee Iacocca, who had been actively campaigning for him. He had also received endorsements from the Michigan Chamber of Commerce and the Michigan Farm Bureau. On November 7, 2006, DeVos was defeated by Democratic incumbent Jennifer Granholm by a 14-point margin. He congratulated the re-elected Granholm via phone after the results were in. Granholm was quoted as saying she \\"admired his tenacity and his passion for Michigan\\". According to a CBS reporter, DeVos's loss was widely attributed to his performance in his first televised debate with Granholm. \\"Granholm went for the jugular talking about an investment he had in a nursing home,\\" and \\"DeVos's lackluster response opened the door that led to his eventual loss.\\" Years later, DeVos said: \\"I learned I needed to be better at expressing my opinions more directly and forcefully....My mother taught me to be respectful and polite, but sometimes I took that advice too far.\\" ===Post-2006 political activity=== DeVos speaking in 2010 In October 2008, DeVos donated $200,000 to the PAC opposing Michigan State Proposal ‚Äì 08-2 (2008). He is a major backer of the America First Action PAC.https://www.cnbc.com/2020/01/31/pro-trump- america-first-raise-50-million-42-million-on-hand-in-2020.html ==Right to work== In October 2012, DeVos engaged in a series of public debates with Teamsters president James Hoffa, son of that union's legendary leader Jimmy Hoffa. They argued about the role of unions, with DeVos taking the position that \\"Workers and job creators, through hard work, ingenuity, sweat and risk- taking, literally made the strongest economy in the world and the greatest standard of living in history...The greatest generation...did not just win a World War, they labored shoulder-to-shoulder with fellow workers to create and sustain value-added enterprises.\\" By contrast, \\"big union bosses have engaged in cozy deals and political backroom dealings in order to advance their personal agendas, not those of their members,\\" They focused especially on Michigan's Proposition 2, which would protect collective bargaining. \\"The unintended consequences of Proposal 2 will result in a $1.6-billion annual tax hike,\\" said DeVos. \\"Since collective bargaining is a federally protected right, Proposal 2 is really about special interests.\\" In a New York Times article published in December 2012, Nicholas Confessore and Monica Davey reported that after President Obama's re-election, DeVos \\"began dialing up state lawmakers in Lansing,\\" telling them that it was time to pass a right-to- work law. \\"If the lawmakers later found themselves facing recalls or tough re- election fights, Mr. DeVos told them, he would be there to help.\\" The legislators and Republican governor Rick Snyder \\"rapidly approved the legislation and delivered a body blow to the labor movement.\\" The Times article noted that the Devos family had given over $1 million to the Michigan GOP in 2012 and at least $2 million to a successful effort to defeat a proposal for a pro-union constitutional amendment. After that defeat, the DeVos family helped form the Michigan Freedom Fund to promote a right-to-work law. A Reuters article published in December 2012 noted that the Michigan right-to-work campaign had \\"gathered momentum\\" thanks to the involvement of DeVos and \\"Ronald Weiser, former chairman of the Michigan Republican Party and ambassador to Slovakia under President George W. Bush...The wealthy businessman and the political guru both worked to persuade wavering Republican lawmakers by assuring them they would have financial support if they faced recall elections over right-to-work, as happened in Wisconsin.\\" In a talk given in Washington, D.C., in January 2013, under the auspices of the Heritage Foundation, DeVos discussed the passage of so-called \\"Right to Work\\" legislation in Michigan. \\"Freedom to Work was simply the right thing to do,\\" he said. \\"By casting off the practice of forced unionization; Michigan now publicly declares to other states and in fact the world, that we embrace freedom for our workers, true equality in the workplace and that we are ready to compete with anyone, anywhere to create economic opportunity for our Michigan families.\\" In his talk, he explained how the legislation was passed, praising Michigan's business community, certain legislators, and Mackinac Center for Public Policy for their role in its passage, and noting that it was important to propose the legislation at the right time, to give it the right name, to be prepared for backlash, and to bring it to a vote quickly. MSNBC reported in December 2012 that the Mackinac Public Policy Center, which had played a major role in the passage of right-to-work in Michigan, was funded mainly by the Charles G. Koch Foundation and the Dick and Betsy DeVos Foundation. Despite the national fame of the Koch brothers, noted MSNBC, \\"among Michigan power brokers, DeVos might well be the bigger name.\\" Since losing his 2006 run for governor, he had \\"worked to exert influence from the outside.\\" ==PhilanthropyFoundation activity=== Dick DeVos is President of the Dick and Betsy DeVos Foundation, a Grand Rapids-area foundation that has donated millions of dollars to civic, artistic, religious, educational, community and free-market economic organizations since 1990. Among its grantees are Kids Hope USA; the Helen DeVos Children's Hospital; the West Michigan Aviation Academy; the Regional Air Alliance of West Michigan; Mars Hill Bible Church; Potter's House; Grand Rapids Christian Schools; the Thunderbird School of Global Management; Willow Creek Association; ArtPrize Grand Rapids; the Education Freedom Fund; the Hugh Michael Beahan Foundation; Children First America; Florida P.R.I.D.E; New Urban Living; Rehoboth Christian School; Calvin College; Princeton University; Davenport University; Grove City College; Hope College; Little Star Inc.; the American Education Reform Council; and Choices for Children. In the fall of 2010, DeVos opened the West Michigan Aviation Academy, the nation's first aviation public charter high school. A March 2010 article reported that the idea for the school had been Betsy DeVos's. \\"DeVos said she was thinking about the couple's interest in education and her husband Dick's love of flying. 'I said, \\"Why don't you combine both of these passions‚Äîa passion for education, for kids and a passion for flying‚Äîin a school.\\"'\\" The academy is located on the grounds of the Gerald R. Ford International Airport. \\"There are aviators all over this community,\\" Dick DeVos told a reporter. \\"It's fascinating how many aviators there are who have already expressed a desire to be involved with this program and to bring the aviation component to it. That is going to be a big job to weave aviation throughout the entire basic curriculum. We've made a commitment to do that.\\" In answer to the question of why it was a charter school, DeVos explained that \\"Charter schools are available to everyone.... A charter school is a public school and therefore there's no tuition. So every student would have the possibility of going to this school at no cost and we think that's very, very important‚Äîto reach across the entire West Michigan community to be sure that every child has an opportunity to attend this school.\\" He added that \\"This is the kind of school that I would have loved to have had if I was a kid.\\" He told a reporter for the Grand Rapids Press: \\"If you're the kind of person who can't help but look up when you hear a plane overhead, then you're exactly the kind of person who will love this school....I have just a joy of flying....The world is such a different place when you can see it from 5,000 feet. I want young people to experience something that might broaden their world.\\" ===Arts funding=== The Dick and Betsy DeVos Foundation has supported ArtPrize, an art competition in Grand Rapids, since 2009. In 2010 Betsy and Dick DeVos committed $22.5 million to the Kennedy Center Institute of Arts Management, which was thereupon renamed the DeVos Institute of Arts Management at the Kennedy Center. It offers \\"practical training to arts managers and board members on stages of professional development in the United States and around the world\\"; its centerpiece is the \\"Capacity Building programs, which offer technical assistance to arts managers and their boards through seminars, web chats, and on-site consultations.\\" The gift was the largest private donation in the Kennedy Center's history and part was to be spent on arts groups in Michigan hit hard by the recession. ===Free-market economics=== The foundation has also given money to organizations that promote free-market economics, such as the Grand Rapids-based Acton Institute; the Heritage Foundation; and the Hudson Institute. Also the DeVos family has contributed much to Northwood University in Midland, Michigan. This includes various donations of scholarships, buildings and uncountable financial donations. ===Scholarships=== The Dick & Betsy DeVos Scholarship was established in 2008 by DeVos and his wife to support entering MA, MS, or MBA students at the Thunderbird School of Global Management, particularly those from developing nations. The DeVoses have also established an annual scholarship, called the Betsy and Dick DeVos Scholars for Free Enterprise and Entrepreneurship Scholarship, which is awarded to students who wish to earn a BBA or combined BBA/MBA at Northwood University. ===Grand Action=== An account of the Grand Action project explains that while authorities in Detroit kept initiating \\"one master project after another\\" that was supposed to solve that city's problems, and that never did, Grand Rapids was different, because its \\"business leaders painstakingly set goals, aligned with government officials, generated support, and empowered key players.\\" DeVos was at the center of this effort. In 1991, he \\"convened a group of more than 50 community and civic leaders to begin the process of revitalizing downtown\\" under the name of Grand Vision, later Grand Action. Plans were made \\"for an entertainment and sports arena and the expansion of local convention facilities.\\" After conducting \\"a feasibility and economic-impact analysis,\\" DeVos worked with two local bankers to set the plan in motion. Among the fruits of this effort were a new sports arena, a new convention center, a new J.W. Marriott Hotel, the renovation of the Civic Theater (renamed the Meijer Majestic Theater), a new art museum, and a new civic gardens and sculpture park, two new satellite campuses for Grand Valley State University, and a new institute for biomedical research. \\"It's this kind of planning, a continual reinvention with clear goals,\\" wrote a CNN journalist, \\"that has been lacking in Detroit.\\" ===Pollution study=== DeVos and his wife contributed money to help fund a $500,000, 18-month private study of Lake Macatawa pollution sources, according to a June 2011 article. The study would \\"use DNA fingerprinting technology pioneered recently at Michigan State University to identify specific sources of E. coli in different areas of the lake. A second part of the study will look at sources of sediment and the contaminants it carries.\\" \\"We are fortunate to have skilled scientists, committed conservationists and highly qualified academicians in West Michigan addressing this problem,\\" DeVos told the Sentinel. \\"Threats to water quality are threats to public health and safety, and the people of Holland cannot afford to wait until 2017 for action.\\" ==Rediscovering American Values== DeVos is the author of the 1998 book Rediscovering American Values. Published by E.P. Dutton, it contains a foreword by former President Gerald R. Ford. Publishers Weekly described it as follows: \\"Drawing on inspirational anecdotes taken from a cross section of the population, he describes how people have bettered themselves both morally and in their careers by practicing such values as honesty, compassion, self-discipline, initiative, hard work, charity and forgiveness. An unrelenting optimist, DeVos is convinced that people can solve most of their problems by taking personal responsibility.\\" The book was a New York Times best seller. ==Honors and awards== In September 2010, the Spectrum Health Foundation presented DeVos with its Art of Giving Award at its annual celebration of philanthropy. ==Current posts and board memberships== * President, the Windquest Group * Chairman, Board of Directors, Spectrum Health System, 2010 ‚Äì present * Member, Board of Trustees, Health Care Foundation; 1990‚Äì2010 (Chairman, 1994‚Äì2010) * Member, Board of Directors, Michigan State Chamber of Commerce, 2010 ‚Äì present * Member, Board of Directors, The Stow Company of Michigan * Founder and Chairman, West Michigan Aviation Academy (a charter high school), 2010 ‚Äì present * Chairman, Board of Directors, RDV Corporation * Governing Board, Orlando Magic, 1994‚Äìpresent * Member, Board of Trustees, Thunderbird School of Global Management, 2003‚Äìpresent * Member, Board of Directors, Willow Creek Association, 1997‚Äìpresent * Co-Chairman, Grand Action Committee, 1992‚Äìpresent (Chairman, Grand Vision Committee, 1991‚Äì1992) * Founder and Chairman, Regional Air Alliance of West Michigan, 2010‚Äìpresent * Member, FAA Management Advisory Council, September 2017‚Äìpresent. ==Personal life== Betsy, in 2006 DeVos and his wife have four children: Richard Marvin (Rick) III, Elisabeth (Elissa), Andrea, and Ryan, and eight grandchildren. Their son, Rick, is the founder and chairman of ArtPrize, a world-renowned art competition in Grand Rapids, Michigan. DeVos and his wife have homes in Grand Rapids and Ada, Michigan. They also own three houses in Windsor, Florida, a development at the northern end of Vero Beach, 80 miles north of Palm Beach. They bought a lot there in 1997 and bought another one later. They now have a compound consisting of two houses, plus another house elsewhere in Windsor, where they spend several weeks a year. In addition, they have a vacation home in Holland, Michigan, on the shore of Lake Macatawa. DeVos bought the property from his father in 2009. ==References * Dick DeVos.com * West Michigan Aviation Academy * Regional Air Alliance of West Michigan * Category:1955 births Category:American businesspeople Category:American people of Dutch descent Category:Amway people Category:American philanthropists Category:American anti-abortion activists Category:Christians from Michigan Dick Category:Harvard Business School alumni Category:Intelligent design advocates Category:Living people Category:Michigan Republicans Category:Northwood University alumni Category:Businesspeople from Grand Rapids, Michigan Category:The Heritage Foundation Category:Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania alumni ","title":"Dick DeVos"},{"id":"2224408","text":"Schorndorf is a town in Baden-W√ºrttemberg, Germany, located approximately 26 km east of Stuttgart.

The Sikh Gurus (Punjabi: ‡®∏‡®ø‡©±‡®ñ ‡®ó‡©Å‡®∞‡©Ç) are the spiritual masters of Sikhi, who established this religion over the course of about two and a half centuries, beginning in 1469. The year 1469 marks the birth of Guru Nanak, the founder of Sikhism. He was succeeded by nine other gurus until, in 1708, the Guruship was finally passed on by the tenth guru to the holy Sikh scripture, Guru Granth Sahib, which is now considered the living Guru by the followers of the Sikh faith. ==Guru: Etymology and Definition== Guru (, ; , Punjabi: ‡®ó‡©Å‡®∞‡©Ç, IAST: guru) is a Sanskrit term for a \\"teacher, guide, expert, or master\\" of certain knowledge or field.Stefan Pertz (2013), The Guru in Me - Critical Perspectives on Management, GRIN Verlag, , pages 2-3 Bhai Vir Singh, in his dictionary of Guru Granth Sahib describes the term Guru as a combination of two separate units: \\"Gu;(‡®ó‡©Å)\\" meaning darkness and \\"R≈´;(‡®∞‡©Ç)\\" which means light. Hence, Guru is who brings light into darkness or in other words, the one who enlightens. Bhai Vir Singh's definition provides further insight about Sikhi itself and explains why Guru Granth Sahib is considered the living Guru. The word Sikh is derived from the Sanskrit term shishya(Punjabi: ‡®∏‡®ø‡©±‡®ñ) which means a disciple or a student. Thus, Sikhs have a student-teacher relationship with their Gurus since their teachings, written in Guru Granth Sahib, serve as a guide for the sikhs. ==The Gurus== {  - ! # ! Name ! Date of birth !

Roman victories. Cimbri and Teutons victories. The Battle of Aquae Sextiae (Aix-en-Provence) took place in 102 BC. After a string of Roman defeats (see: the Battle of Noreia, the Battle of Burdigala, and the Battle of Arausio), the Romans under Gaius Marius finally defeated the Teutones and Ambrones. The Teutones and the Ambrones were virtually wiped out, with the Romans claiming to have killed 200,000 and captured 90,000,Livy Ep. 68 including large numbers of women and children who were later sold into slavery. Some of the surviving captives are reported to have been among the rebelling gladiators in the Third Servile War. Local lore associates the name of the mountain, Mont St. Victoire, with the Roman victory at the battle of Aquae Sextiae, but Fr√©d√©ric Mistral and other scholars have debunked this theory. ==Background== According to ancient sources, sometime around 120‚Äì115 BC, the Germanic tribe of the Cimbri left their homeland around the North Sea due to climate changes. They supposedly journeyed to the south-east and were soon joined by their neighbours the Teutones. On their way south they defeated several other Germanic tribes, but also Celtic and Germano-Celtic tribes. A number of these defeated tribes joined their migration. In 113 BC the Cimbri-Teutones confederation, led by Boiorix the Cimbric king and Teutobod of the Teutones, defeated the Scordisci. The invaders then moved on to the Danube, arriving in Noricum, home to the Roman-allied Taurisci people. Unable to hold back these new, powerful invaders on their own, the Taurisci appealed to Rome for help.Lynda Telford, Sulla: A Dictator Reconsidered, p. 40; Theodore Mommsen, A History of Rome, IV. The Senate commissioned Gnaeus Papirius Carbo, one of the consuls, to lead a substantial Roman army to Noricum to force the barbarians out. An engagement, later called the battle of Noreia, took place, in which the invaders, to everyone's surprise, completely overwhelmed the Legions and inflicted a devastating loss on Carbo and his men.Lynda Telford, Sulla: A Dictator Reconsidered, p. 41. After the Noreia victory, the Cimbri and Teutones moved westward towards Gaul. A few years later, in 109 BC, they moved along the Rhodanus River towards the Roman province in Transalpine Gaul. Another consul, Marcus Junius Silanus, was sent to take care of the renewed Germanic threat. Silanus marched his army north along the Rhodanus River in order to confront the migrating Germanic tribes. He met the Cimbri approximately 100 miles north of Arausio, a battle was fought and the Romans suffered another humiliating defeat. The Germanic tribes then moved to the lands north and east of Tolosa in south-western Gaul.Lynda Telford, Sulla: A Dictator Reconsidered, p. 42. To the Romans, the presence of the Germanic tribes in Gaul posed a serious threat to the stability in the area and to their prestige. Lucius Cassius Longinus, one of the consuls of 107, was sent to Gaul at the head of another large army. He first fought the Cimbri and their Gallic allies the Volcae Tectosages just outside Tolosa, and despite the huge number of tribesmen, the Romans routed them. Unfortunately for the Romans, a few days later they were ambushed while marching on Burdigala. The battle of Burdigala destroyed the Romans hope of finishing off the Cimbri and the Germanic threat continued to exist.Lynda Telford, Sulla: A Dictator Reconsidered, pp. 42-43. In 106 the Romans sent their largest army yet; the senior consul of 106, Quintus Servilius Caepio, was authorized to use eight legions in an effort to end the Germanic threat once and for all. While the Romans were busy getting their army together the Volcae Tectosages had quarrelled with their Germanic guests, and had asked them to leave the area. When Caepio arrived he only found the local tribes and they sensibly decided not to fight the newly arrived legions. In 105 Caepio's command was prorogued and a further six legions were raised in Rome by Gnaeus Mallius Maximus, one of the consuls of 105, he led them to reinforce Caepio who was near Arausio. Unfortunately for the Romans, Caepio who was a patrician and Mallius Maximus who was a 'new man' did not get along. Caepio refused to take orders from Mallius Maximus who as consul outranked him. All this led to a divided Roman force with the two armies so far apart they could not support each other when the fighting started. Meanwhile, the Germanic tribes had combined their forces. First, they attacked and defeated Caepio's army and then, with great confidence, took on Mallius Maximus's army and defeated it too. The battle of Arausio was considered the greatest Roman defeat since the slaughter suffered at the battle of Cannae during the Punic Wars.Lynda Telford, Sulla: A Dictator Reconsidered, pp. 45-51. In 104 BC the Cimbri and the Teutones seemed to be heading for Italy. The Romans sent the senior consul of 104, Gaius Marius, a proven and capable general, at the head of another large army. The Germanic tribes never materialized so Marius subdued the Volcae Tectosages capturing their king Copillus.Lynda Telford, Sulla: A Dictator Reconsidered, p. 58. In 103, Sulla, one of Marius's lieutenants, succeeded in persuading the Germanic Marsi tribe to become friends and allies of Rome; they detached themselves from the Germanic confederation and went back to Germania.Lynda Telford, Sulla: A Dictator Reconsidered, pp 57-58. In 102 BC the Teutones and Ambrones moved into Gallia Transalpina (the Roman province in the south of Gaul) while the Cimbri moved into Italy. Marius, as senior consul (consul prior), ordered his junior partner Quintus Lutatius Catulus (the consul posterior) to keep the Cimbri out of Italy while he marched against the Teutones and Ambrones.Lynda Telford, Sulla: A Dictator Reconsidered, pp. 61-62. ==Prelude== A quarter of a million Germanic and Gallic tribesmen, led by King Teutobod of the Teutones, had crossed the Durance river, east of where it entered the Rh√¥ne. They spread out for miles: there were about 130,000 warriors, as well as wagons, cattle, horses, and their women and children. With the Teutones, who made up the bulk of the invaders, were the Ambrones, who had around 30,000 warriors, making them second most numerous tribe in the coalition under Teutobod. Gaius Marius and his army had arrived some time earlier, Marius had used his time wisely; he had constructed a heavily fortified camp on a hill close to the river and stocked it with enough supplies to withstand a lengthy siege. The tribesmen tried to get the Romans to come out of their fort and fight them on even ground; they shouted insults and challenges, which Marius ignored. He was unwilling to give up a strongly defended position for a battle with an uncertain outcome. Marius let it be known throughout his camp that he intended to fight the barbarians, but on his terms, not theirs. The catcalls and challenges continued.Marc Hyden, Gaius Marius, pp 125-130; Lynda Telford, Sulla: A Dictator Reconsidered, p. 62 A Teuton warrior even issued a challenge directly to Marius. The barbarian invited the general to join him in single combat. Marius mocked him by advising him that if the warrior desired death he should find a rope, fashion a noose and hang himself. The Teuton did not give up so Marius produced a veteran gladiator and explained to the barbarian that if he still lusted for blood he could try and slay the trained fighter for it was beneath Marius's station as a consul to reduce himself to a common brawler.Frontinus, Stratagems, 4.7.5. After they failed to lure the Romans out they tried to wait them out, but Marius had anticipated this and his fortress was well stocked. Frustrated the tribesmen attacked the fort for three days. Assault after assault was launched at the Roman defense works, but the fortifications held and from these the Romans released a barrage of missiles, killing many barbarians and repulsing the rest. Still, the Romans did not come out and the tribal coalition decided to move on south toward Massilia, which they intended to plunder. It took several days for their entire wagon train to clear the area but, once they were out of sight, Gaius Marius followed, dogging them and waiting for an opportune moment to strike. Marius now started trailing the tribal coalition and camped alongside them, when ending each day's march he ordered his men to build a fortified camp with impressive defense works. After all the losses they took trying to take Marius's fortress on the Rhone the Teutones and Ambrones never tried to storm Marius's camp again. Marius was biding his time waiting for the barbarians to make a mistake. Fortunately for Marius, he was presented with a chance to take on part of the tribal horde when they entered the area of Aquae Sextiae.Marc Hyden, Gaius Marius, pp. 131-132; Plutarch, Marius, 18.1-2. ==The battle== Several days after crossing the Rhone, Marius's army camped near the Ambrones, who for some reason had decided to camp separately from their Teutonic allies, when a couple of army servants, fetching water from the river, ran into an unknown number of Ambrones bathing in the river. The bathing Ambrones, caught by surprise, called for their fellow tribesmen who were eating dinner and drinking in their camp on their side of the river. The Romans, working on their camp, heard the commotion and quickly grasped the situation. Marius's Ligurian auxiliaries, without orders from Marius, dropped their tools, took up their weapons and sprinted to their servants' aid. The Ambrones now formed a battle line and awaited the Ligurians. Many tribesmen were weighed down by food, half-naked from bathing or intoxicated.Marc Hyden, Gaius Marius, pp. 132-133; Plutarch, Marius, 19.1-5. After forming their battle lines, the Ambrones started beating their swords and spears against their shields and chanting their battle cry: 'Ambrones!'. The Ligurians who were charging towards them had once been called Ambrones as well and also started to shout 'Ambrones!'. After reaching the Ambrones, the Ligurians also formed battle lines. They continued their shouting match for a while and then the battle finally ensued. While these events were taking place, Marius had formed up his legions and marched to reinforce his Ligurian auxiliaries. When the legionaries arrived at the battle, they cast their pila (the Roman throwing spear) into the Ambrones, killing several warriors or rendering their shields useless, unsheathed their gladius (the Roman short sword) and waded in. After the legions' arrival, the battle quickly turned into a rout. Marius's heavily armed, expertly trained soldiers easily overpowered the Ambrones and pushed them toward the river. The Ambrones suffered terrible losses while on the Roman side losses were very low.Marc Hyden, Gaius Marius, pp 133-134; Lynda Telford, Sulla: A Dictator Reconsidered, p. 62; Plutarch, Marius, 19.3-6; Orosius, Against the Pagans, 5.16; Florus, Epitome of Roman History, 1.38.9.Plutarch mentions (Plutarch, Marius, 10.5-6) that during the battle, the Ambrones began to shout \\"Ambrones!\\" as their battle-cry; the Ligurian troops fighting for the Romans, on hearing this cry, found that it was identical to an ancient name in their country which the Ligurians often used when speaking of their descent (), so they returned the shout, \\"Ambrones!\\". Marius did not allow a victory celebration, because he knew the Teutones were still in the field and feared a counter-attack. By the time the fighting ended, it was too late in the day to finish their fortified camp, leaving the Romans vulnerable. Marius sent a detachment of troops into the woods to create a great noise to disorientate the barbarians and keep them from sleeping. This would also cause his enemies to be sluggish because of lack of sleep the next day.Frontinus, Stratagems, 2.9.1. However, the night and the succeeding few days passed without incident, much to Marius' relief.Plutarch, Marius, 20.3. While waiting, Marius sent one of his legates, Claudius Marcellus, with 3,000 troops some distance away and ordered him to remain undetected until a determined time when he would appear at the enemy rear.Marc Hyden, Gaius Marius, pp 136-137. Since the Teutones were waiting for him on the plain near Aquae Sextiae, Marius had the opportunity to reconnoiter the area and select a suitable site for the upcoming battle. Four days after slaughtering the Ambrones, Marius marched his army onto the plain and took position on the high ground. He instructed his legionaries to stand their ground on the hill, launch javelins, draw their swords, guard themselves with their shields and thrust the enemy back. He assured his men that, since the barbarians would be charging uphill, their footing would be unsure and they would be vulnerable.Marc Hyden, Gaius Marius, pp 136-137; Plutarch, Marius, 20.4-6. Marius ordered his camp servants and all other non-combatants to march with the army. He also ordered his beasts of burden to be fashioned as cavalry horses. All of this was to create the illusion his forces were larger than they really were. He wanted the barbarians to hold back more of their warriors in reserve so his real forces would not be overwhelmed by the tribesmen's numbers.Frontinus, Stratagems, 2.4.6. The surviving Ambrones and the Teutones, bent on revenge, eagerly awaited the upcoming confrontation and, when the Romans finally showed themselves on the Aquae Sextiae plain, charged uphill. The Romans unleashed a barrage of javelins, killing or maiming many tribesmen, then stood in close order, drew their swords and awaited the enemy at the top of the hill. Roman strategy, discipline and training asserted itself and the tribesmen were unable to dislodge the legions from their superior position. The battle continued for much of the morning, with neither side gaining the upper hand. However, the well-conditioned and disciplined legionaries slowly and systematically forced the tribal horde down the hill until both the Romans and barbarians were on level ground. This was when Claudius Marcellus and his 3,000 men loudly and viciously attacked the enemy rear. The Ambrones and Teutones were now being attacked on two fronts and confusion set in. They broke ranks and started to flee, but most failed to escape. The Romans pursued them relentlessly. By the end of the afternoon, most of the barbarian warriors were dead or captured. Estimates vary from 100,000 to 200,000 being slain or captured. Teutobod, the Teutonic king, and 3,000 warriors escaped the battle only to be caught by the Sequani, who handed them over to Marius.Marc Hyden, Gaius Marius, pp 139-140; Plutarch, Marius, 21.1-2; Orosius, Against the Pagans, 5.16; Florus, Epitome of Roman History, 1.38.10. Marius sent a Manius Aquillius with a report to Rome. It said that 37,000 superbly trained Romans had succeeded in defeating over 100,000 Germans in two engagements. ==Aftermath== There were around 17,000 surviving warriors and many thousands of women and children who were to be sold into slavery. Roman historians recorded that 300 of the captured women committed mass suicide, which passed into Roman legends of Germanic heroism (cf Jerome, letter to Ageruchia cxxiii.8, 409 AD ): ::By the conditions of the surrender three hundred of their married women were to be handed over to the Romans. When the Teuton matrons heard of this stipulation they first begged the consul that they might be set apart to minister in the temples of Ceres and Venus; and then when they failed to obtain their request and were removed by the lictors, they slew their little children and next morning were all found dead in each other's arms having strangled themselves in the night. The proceeds from the sale of slaves usually went to the commanding General, but in this case, Marius decided to donate the profits from the sale to his soldiers and officers. This, of course, made him even more popular than he already was with his men.Lynda Telford, Sulla: A Dictator Reconsidered, p. 63. Upon hearing the news, Rome went wild with relief. Finally one of their generals had defeated the Germans. Gaius Marius, as an act of gratitude, was again voted Senior Consul in absentia, with his legate Manius Aquillius as his Junior Consul. The Senate also voted for a three-day Thanksgiving; the people voted him two days more.Lynda Telford, Sulla: A Dictator Reconsidered, p. 64. The following year (101) Marius and the proconsul Catullus Caesar defeated the Cimbri at the battle of Vercellae, ending the German threat. The inhabitants of Massalia, some 23 Roman miles, 30 kilometres, distant, used the bones of the fallen tribesmen to erect fences to protect their crops. The decaying corpses left the soil enriched, and for years to the region experienced extraordinary harvests largely thanks to thousands of rotting bodies fertilizing the farmers' lands.Marc Hyden, Gaius Marius, p. 140; Plutarch, Marius, 21.3. ==Modern Sources== * Marc Hyden, Gaius Marius: The Rise and Fall of Rome's saviour, 2017. * Lynda Telford, Sulla: A Dictator Reconsidered, 2014. ==Ancient Sources== * Plutarch, Parallel Lives: Life of Marius. * Frontinus, Stratagems. * Orosius, Against the Pagans. * Florus, Epitome of Roman History. * Livy, Epitome of Roman History. ==In fiction== * Colleen McCullough describes the battle in her novel The First Man in Rome, the first book in her Masters of Rome series. ==Notes and References * Theodor Mommsen's history of the battle, written in the late 1800s Category:102 BC Category:100s BC conflicts Aquae Sextiae 102 Aquae Sextiae 102 Aquae Sextiae 102 Category:Aix-en-Provence ","title":"Battle of Aquae Sextiae"},{"id":"2224429","text":"Stephen J. Bisciotti (born April 10, 1960) is an American business executive and the current majority owner of the Baltimore Ravens of the NFL. He founded Aerotek, the largest privately owned staffing and recruiting company in the U.S. based in Hanover, Maryland, and cofounded Allegis Group, an international talent management firm headquartered in Hanover, Maryland that owns Aerotek; TEKsystems; MarketSource; Major, Lindsey & Africa; Aston Carter; and Allegis Global Solutions. ==Background== Bisciotti was born on April 10, 1960 in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, the youngest of three children in a middle class Italian-American family. In 1961, his parents, Bernard and Patricia Bisciotti, moved the family to Severna Park, Maryland, a suburb of Baltimore, for his father's job as a construction sales executive. As a child, Bisciotti often went with his family to Baltimore Orioles and Colts games. When he was 8 years old, his father died of leukemia. After his father's death, his maternal grandfather, C. Gordon Johnston, a retired regional district salesman for Ford Motor Co., supported the family. Bisciotti attended the Severn School but left after two years and transferred to Severna Park High School. In his senior year, he played on the football team, though he has said \\"I wasn‚Äôt much of a high school athlete, but played football, baseball, and basketball all the time when I was growing up\\". In 1982, Bisciotti graduated from Salisbury State University in Maryland with a degree in liberal arts. A year later, at 23, he and his cousin Jim Davis started Aerotek, a staffing company in the aerospace and technology sectors. Running the company out of a basement office with secondhand equipment, Bisciotti and Davis produced $1.5 million in sales in the first year. Aerotek grew into the Allegis Group, which is now the largest privately held staffing firm in the world. Bisciotti's involvement in the sports business has brought more attention to his once low-profile company. ==Sports ownership== On March 27, 2000, NFL owners approved the sale of 49% of the Ravens to Bisciotti. In the deal, he had an option to purchase the remaining 51% for $325 million in 2004 from Art Modell. On April 9, 2004 the NFL approved his purchase of the majority stake in the club. One of the first projects Bisciotti directed as owner of the Ravens was to build the team's state-of-the-art training and practice facility, dubbed \\"The Castle,\\" which opened in October 2004. Bisciotti fired Brian Billick after the 2007 season, although Billick's eight years as the Ravens' head coach included the team's win in Super Bowl XXXV. He then surprised many observers by selecting John Harbaugh as his new coach, despite Harbaugh's peak of previous experience being a single year as a defensive backs coach after several successful years as the special teams coach for the Philadelphia Eagles. In 2012, the Baltimore Ravens capitalized off a 10-6 season to go on to win Super Bowl XLVII against the San Francisco 49ers on February 3, 2013.nfl.com In 2005, Bisciotti ranked 378 among the Forbes 400, a list of the richest Americans. ==Aerotek lawsuit== In 2009, Aerotek, the company Bisciotti co-founded, reached a $1.2 million settlement in a class-action lawsuit filed on behalf of more than 1,000 Aerotek workers who worked at a Verizon Internet Services call center in Martinsburg, West Virginia, which was closed in December 2006.

Each is intended to serve as a single person's full daily food supply, and contain somewhat over 2,200 calories. They have shelf-lives of about 3 years, and their contents are designed to be acceptable to a variety of religious and ethnic groups. The meals cost approximately one-fifth of the cost of a Meal, Ready-to-Eat (MRE). The rations were first used in Bosnia in 1993. From the time they were created and used in 1993 until November 2001, HDRs were packaged with a bright yellow outer plastic covering; this choice of color, however, proved to be problematic in areas of the world where cluster bombs were being used, as the bombs were the exact same shade of yellow and recipients of the rations sometimes confused the ration package for undetonated cluster bombs, often spotting the bright color from a distance and making an incorrect assumption; this prompted the United States Federal Government to reissue the packages with a deep salmon pink outer covering to distinguish them from the bombs (this color has been used in the HDR manufacturing process ever since). The meals are designed to be able to survive being air-dropped without a parachute.. This is safer for refugees than parachuting large pallets of rations, as well as preventing meal hoarding by those able to seize a single, large delivery. HDRs are also made available through organizations such as The Salvation Army to aid victims of poverty in the United States, and were distributed during Hurricane Katrina and Hurricane Rita to victims of the disasters by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA). ==Packaging and distribution== A leaflet, dropped in Afghanistan, announcing a program to drop humanitarian daily rations.

HDRs are typically air-dropped into the disaster area on large pallets. The HDRs initially dropped in Afghanistan were yellow before it was realized that the packages were the same color as the bomblets in American cluster bombs, which were also dropped in Afghanistan. Later packages were covered in salmon colored foil. HDRs produced by the United States are manufactured by the same companies that produce MREs designed for the United States Armed Forces. Like MREs, the food components are designed so they can be consumed without requiring additional preparation, including cooking. They do not, however, include flameless ration heaters, which are found in MREs. ==Typical contents== * Main entr√©e, two of: ** Lentil or barley stew ** Yellow or herb rice ** Red beans and rice ** Beans and rice with tomato sauce ** Peas in tomato sauce ** Beans with potatoes * Shortbread * Fig bar * Vegetable crackers * Peanut butter * Strawberry jam * Fruit pastry (much like a Pop-tart) * Accessory Pack containing: ** Book of matches (unprinted) ** Salt, pepper and sugar packets ** Packet of crushed red pepper ** Moist towelette (alcohol-free) ** Paper napkin ** Plastic spoon ==Specifications== {  + Specifications -  Shelf life  36 months at -  Weight  -  Kilocalories  at least 2200 per package -  Protein content  10-13 percent -  Fat content  27-30 percent -  Carbohydrate content  60 percent -  Prohibited contents  The HDR is designed to \\"provide the widest possible acceptance from the variety of potential consumers with diverse religious and dietary restrictions from around the world\\".

Bancks left school at the age of 14 and found employment with a finance company. His first illustrations were accepted and published by The Comic Australian in 1913, followed by The Arrow in 1914. This encouraged Bancks to submit work to The Bulletin, where he was offered a permanent position, which he accepted and remained until 1922. Throughout this period he was studying art under Dattilo Rubbo and Julian Ashton and supplying freelance cartoons to the Sunday Sun. He created Ginger (later Ginger Meggs) for the Sunday Sun and Sun News-Pictorial. Bancks created The Blimps for the Melbourne Sun in 1923, and this daily strip ran until 1925, the year when he launched Mr. Melbourne Day by Day for the Melbourne Sun- Pictorial. ==Personal== On 15 October 1931 Bancks married Jessie Nita Tait (daughter of theatrical entrepreneur, Edward Joseph 'E.J.' Tait) at Darling Point. She first worked as fashion adviser to her father's enterprise, since 1933 she published the column \\"Fashion Parade\\" in The Australian Women's Weekly. Jessie died in childbirth on 22 November 1936. In 1938 he married Patricia Quinan in Yuma, Arizona in the United States. They adopted a daughter, the artist Sheena Bancks, who married the actor Michael Latimer. Bancks died on 1 July 1952 from a heart attack at his home in Point Piper, New South Wales.Jim Bancks at AustLit On 26 July 1997 the Mayor of Hornsby, New South Wales formally named a park in Hornsby after Bancks's character Ginger Meggs.

It is also done to keep the store appearing neat and organized. The workers who perform this task normally have jobs doing other things in the store such as customer service, stocking shelves, daytime cleaning, bagging and carry outs (in grocery stores), etc. In some stores, however, facing is done only by the stockers. Facing is generally done near closing time when there are fewer customers and also while the store is completely closed. In busier stores it may be done constantly. In department stores it may be referred to as recovery, as in the store is recovering from the rush of customers that affect the model appearance the store wants to portray. Merchandise may be put in the wrong area, or customers may leave debris on the floor. Correcting these issues is a part of the recovery process. Facings also refer to the amount of shelf space a particular product is given. A lot of facing generally increases sales of a particular product, therefore manufacturers often pay more money to get more facings for their products. This can lead to situations in which the largest manufacturers end up with the most shelf space because they have the greatest ability to pay. ==The Value of Facing to Businesses== Facing tends to have the benefit of making products more accessible to customers, especially in situations in which it can be difficult to see what products are on the top and bottom shelves. Additionally, it is speculated that neater and fuller looking shelves have desirable psychological effects on customers for businesses. It is thought that if a customer sees disorganized shelves, they will get the impression that the store is poorly run or understaffed, and consequentially will be disinclined to shop there again. It is also thought that shoplifters will tend to be emboldened if they see disorganized shelves, because they may perceive the disorganization as a sign of a lack of employee supervision over the store. Although facing is a common practice in retail, it's unclear as to exactly how much value it adds to a business, or whether it is worth the cost of labor needed to do it although facing is generally done at less busy times when staff would otherwise have not much else to do. Proper studies are lacking to quantify the value of facing. Another issue that many businesses have to grapple with regarding facing is the highly ephemeral nature of properly faced shelves. A perfectly faced cereal aisle in a grocery store for example will be returned to its former state of disarray within an hour in any moderately busy store. Businesses have to decide what priority to give to the Sisyphean task of maintaining faced shelves, when employees could be engaging in other tasks like stocking which have a more obvious value-add to the business. ==See also== *Go-backs ==External links== *Description of facing Category:Customer experience Category:Retail display ","title":"Facing (retail)"},{"id":"2224469","text":"Antrak Air was a Ghanaian scheduled airline based in the Airport Residential Area of Accra, Ghana.\\"Contact Us.\\" Antrak Air. 4 August 2010.

Written by Sidney Gilliat and Frank Launder, based on the novel Report on a Fugitive by Gordon Wellesley, the film is about an inventor and his daughter who are kidnapped by the Gestapo after the Nazis march into Prague in the prelude to the Second World War. A British secret service agent follows them, disguised as a senior German army officer pretending to woo the daughter over to the Nazi cause. ==Plot== As German forces take over Czechoslovakia in March 1939, Axel Bomasch (James Harcourt), a Czechoslovak scientist working on a new type of armour- plating, is flown to Britain. Bomasch's daughter, Anna (Margaret Lockwood), is arrested before she can reach the airport and sent to a concentration camp, where she is interrogated by Nazis who are after her father. Anna refuses to cooperate. Soon she is befriended by a fellow prisoner named Karl Marsen (Paul Henreid), who says he is a teacher imprisoned for his political views. Together they are able to escape and make their way to London. Anna does not know that Marsen is in fact a Gestapo agent assigned to gain her trust and locate her father. Following Marsen's suggestion, Anna places a cryptic newspaper advertisement to let her father know she is in the country. Soon after, she gets an anonymous phone call with instructions to go to the town of Brightbourne. There, Anna contacts Dickie Randall (Rex Harrison), a British intelligence officer working undercover as an entertainer named Gus Bennett. Randall takes Anna to her father, who is now working for the Royal Navy at the fictional Dartland naval base. Anna argues with Randall over her attempt to post a letter to Marsen (with an informative postmark). It does not matter, as Dr. John Fredericks (Felix Aylmer), Marsen's undercover superior in London, had tailed her to Brightbourne. Soon after, Marsen arranges the kidnapping of Anna and her father, and brings them back to Germany by U-boat. Their captors threaten to put her in a concentration camp if Bomasch refuses to work for the Nazis. Meanwhile, Randall's proposal to rescue the Bomasches is (unofficially) accepted. He travels to Berlin and infiltrates the building where the Bomasches are being held, posing as Major Ulrich Herzog of the Corps of Engineers. He dupes Captain Prada and Admiral Hassinger into believing he was Anna's lover years ago and can persuade her to get her father to co-operate. Randall spends the night with Anna in her hotel room to maintain the pretense. When the Bomasches are ordered sent to Munich, he plans to accompany them and arrange their escape. However, Marsen shows up just as they are about to leave the hotel; he has been assigned to escort them to Munich. Randall's situation is further complicated at the railway station, where he is recognised by a former classmate named Caldicott (Naunton Wayne), who is leaving Germany with his friend Charters (Basil Radford). Randall denies knowing Caldicott, but Marsen's suspicions are aroused. When the train makes an unscheduled stop (brought to a halt by a railway station guard played by Irene Handl in an early uncredited bit part) to take on troops, as war has just been declared between Britain and Germany, Marsen takes the opportunity to telephone his headquarters to have Herzog investigated. When Marsen's superiors call back to confirm there is no Major Herzog, Charters, attempting to use another telephone, overhears that Randall will be arrested when they reach Munich. The two Englishmen barely manage to reboard the train before it leaves. Caldicott slips a warning to Randall, who is thus prepared when Marsen pulls out a gun as they near Munich. Charters and Caldicott overpower first the two guards, then Marsen. After swapping uniforms with Marsen, Randall commandeers a car. They speed up a mountain road, with Marsen and his men in hot pursuit. They reach an aerial tramway; at the other end is neutral Switzerland. Randall manages to shoot all of their pursuers except Marsen, while Anna and the others escape on the tram. Randall then boards the other tram and exchanges shots with Marsen. Marsen reverses the direction of Randall's tram, but he manages to jump to the other tram as it passes. When he hits Marsen in the leg, the latter is either unable, or unwilling, to reach the controls and stop Randall from reaching safety. Randall and Anna embrace. ==Cast== * Margaret Lockwood as Anna Bomasch * Rex Harrison as Gus Bennett / \\"Dickie Randall\\" * Paul Henreid as Capt.

Prior to the film's initial release, a review by Variety noted that \\"[m]uch of the film‚Äôs merit obviously stems from the compact, propulsive screenplay ... and the razor-edge direction\\", adding that \\"[t]here are countless touches of atmosphere and comedy that add immeasurable flavor and zest to the picture\\". Simon Abrams of Slant Magazine wrote of the film: \\"Come for Carol Reed's name, stay for Rex Harrison's performance and a few good cheap shots at the Nazis\\". Stephen Mayne of PopMatters wrote that the film is \\"more than just a rerun of The Lady Vanishes\\", stating that it \\"overcomes wobbly moments by being so persistently fun\\". ===Home media=== The film was released on VHS on 11 February 1997 by Kino Video. It was released on DVD and Blu-ray by the Criterion Collection on 29 June 2010 and 6 September 2016, respectively. ==Comparison to The Lady Vanishes== The film has been compared to The Lady Vanishes, with the Princeton academic Michael Wood describing it as an \\"ironic remake\\"; the publicity at the time of release erroneously claimed it is a sequel.Michael Wood \\"At the Movies: Odd Man Out\\", London Review of Books, 28:20, 19 October 2006, p.16Trevor Hogg \\"A Great Reed: A Carol Reed Profile (Part 1)\\", Flickering Myth, 21 October 2009 It has a similar situation in a war-torn continental Europe and both have scripts by Launder and Gilliat.

It was released in February 1985 by Verve Records. ==Composition and collection== When the Velvet Underground moved from Verve Records (who had released their first two albums) to parent company MGM Records, they signed a two-album deal, releasing their third and eponymous album The Velvet Underground in March 1969. Later that same year there was a management change and MGM Records' new CEO, Mike Curb, was brought in to try to rescue the financially struggling label. He decided to purge the record company of its unprofitable acts. The Velvet Underground quickly became one of the groups targeted and were released from their contract. The band had in the meantime recorded 14 tracks for possible release as their second MGM album. All of these were shelved and forgotten by their record company until the early 1980s. As Verve (by then an imprint of Polygram) prepared to re-release the band's three Verve/MGM albums on vinyl and CD, they found nineteen previously unreleased tracks: five Cale-era tracks and the 14 \\"lost album\\" tracks, some of them in two-track mixdown format, some of them even on multitracks. The cream of the nineteen tracks was released in 1985 as VU; the rest was released as Another View in 1986. VU is a selection from the 1969 tracks as well as two previously unreleased Cale-era songs‚Äî\\"Temptation Inside Your Heart\\" and \\"Stephanie Says\\". Since most of the material was available on multitrack (only \\"Ocean\\" is included in its original 1969 mix), engineers were able to clean up and remix the tracks. As the Velvet Underground moved from MGM to Atlantic, they re-recorded two of the songs on VU, \\"Ocean\\" and \\"I'm Sticking with You\\", for possible inclusion on Loaded. Neither made the cut, but six of the VU songs were recycled by Lou Reed during his solo career: \\"I Can't Stand It\\", \\"Lisa Says\\" and \\"Ocean\\" on Lou Reed, 1972; \\"Andy's Chest\\" on Transformer, 1972; \\"Stephanie Says\\" (as \\"Caroline Says II\\") on Berlin, 1973; and \\"She's My Best Friend\\" (which was originally sung by Doug Yule), was included on Coney Island Baby, 1976.

The name Zoran is derived from the Hebrew word for silicon. Zoran was incorporated in the state of Delaware and had offices in Canada, China, England, Germany, India, Israel, Japan, Korea, Taiwan, and the US. Zoran had strong ties with Israel, with a strong R&D; presence and being the beneficiary of incentives from organizations such as Israel's Ministry of Industry and Trade. After an early focus on filter and signal processors for military, industrial and medical applications, Zoran started focusing on data compression products for emerging multimedia applications and became better known in the late 1990s as a supplier of Motion JPEG codec chips used on PC add-in cards for video capture and video editing applications. After the turn of the millennium, sales increased substantially as Zoran became a leading provider of chips for DVD players, which it continued to be until about 2007, covering a period during which the production volume of DVD players increased strongly and the semiconductor value in this segment reached its peak. Starting from 2005, Zoran also supplied chips for a substantial portion of the worldwide production of digital cameras. Around 2008 and 2009, Zoran was successful as a supplier of cost-effective integrated chips for LCD TVs supporting the ATSC standards used for HDTV broadcast in the US. In 2011, Zoran merged with UK-based CSR and is now represented by the CSR brand and stock. After the merger, CSR executed substantial layoffs of former Zoran employees. ==HistorySupplier of signal processing ICs=== Zoran was founded in 1981 by Yuval Almog and Dr. Levy Gerzberg, with a focus on DSP technology. Due to the similarity between the Zoran Corporation's name and services and those of Max Zorin's fictional company in the James Bond film A View to a Kill, which was released in 1985, a disclaimer had to be added to the film stating that the name Zorin was not related to a real-life company \\\\- none of the films producers had been aware of the Zoran Corporation's existence when selecting a name for the villainous Max Zorin (Christopher Walken) and his fictional organisation. Until 1991, Zoran derived the substantial majority of its revenues from digital filter processors and vector signal processors used principally in military, industrial and medical applications. In 1989, it repositioned its business to develop and market data compression products for emerging multimedia applications and discontinued development of digital filter processor and vector signal processor products. ===Supplier of multimedia chips, success in DVD player market=== Zoran became better known through PC video products incorporating Motion JPEG technology, which until 2001 were a significant contributor to Zoran's revenues. The ZR3606x and ZR3650x (with USB interface) family of devices was widely used in PC-based video capture and editing devices. Zoran also offered digital audio products such as the ZR38601, a single-chip digital audio processor designed to support the PC and home theater digital speaker market. Zoran also offered to third parties chip design IP (intellectual property) cores for decoding and encoding NTSC, PAL or SECAM television signals. In 1997 Zoran acquired CompCore Multimedia, a provider of software-based compression products and a designer of IP cores for video and audio decoder integrated circuits. Beginning in 1997, Zoran established itself as a leading provider of MPEG-2 technology for DVD and Super Video CD applications. Although, unlike some competitors, the company had not participated in the first major revenue opportunity for high-volume MPEG-decoding chips, the Chinese Video CD player boom of the late 1990s based on MPEG-1 decoding technology, increasing sales of chips for DVD player applications launched Zoran into a period of strong revenue growth and expansion. For several years starting from 2001, Zoran derived a substantial majority of its product revenues from the sale of DVD player chips. ===Prominence and product diversification through acquisitions and turning point of DVD business=== In October 2000, Zoran acquired Nogatech, Inc., a manufacturer of integrated circuits that establish connections between video devices and computers as well as connections between video devices across a variety of networks, in exchange for Zoran common stock with a fair value of $154 million. In 2003, Zoran purchased Oak Technology in a deal valued at $358 million, thereby expanding its product portfolio with chips used in digital televisions (originally from TeraLogic which Oak had earlier acquired), as well as chips and software used in inkjet printers, laser printers, multi-function printers, and industrial imaging equipment. Zoran also acquired IP related to optical storage technology, which it intended to utilize in chips targeting DVD recorders. DVD chip sales reached a climax in Q2 2004, after which a significant inventory correction in China greatly affected Zoran. Thereafter, revenues from DVD products declined from a substantial majority of revenues until the middle of 2004 to 8% of revenues by 2010. DVD chip revenues were affected by significant declines in average selling prices and associated commoditization of DVD player chips, resulting in lower revenues and profit margins, and market share loss due to competition from low-cost competitors. ===Growth in non-DVD product lines === By 2005, its COACH product line for digital cameras, which built on its earlier JPEG expertise, had started to become significant and would be the largest revenue contributor in Zoran's later years. The printer/imaging business acquired from Oak also consistently contributed in the region of 20% of revenues. Targeting the mobile phone market, Zoran acquired Emblaze Semiconductor (based in Israel close to a large part of Zoran's own R&D; facilities) in 2004 for $54 million in cash. The resulting mobile phone multimedia processor product line eventually achieved limited success with production for LG camera phones in 2008, but could not sustain growth and Zoran discontinued development on this product line in Q3 2009. Zoran's revenues and net income peaked in 2007, with revenues reaching $507 million and non-GAAP net income of $71 million. In 2008, revenues declined to $439 million, with non-GAAP net income declining to $8 million. The DTV product line for flat-panel TVs and set-top boxes became successful for Zoran for a period, being the largest revenue contributor with 35% in Q3 2008. After expectations of a significant revenue decline for the company in Q1 2009, an unexpected recovery of its DTV business in Q1 2009 allowed Zoran to maintain its revenue level with DTV reaching 40% of revenues in Q2 and Q3 2009 based on Zoran's leading position in low to mid-range LCD TVs for the US market. ===Decline in final years as independent company=== For 2009, Zoran reported revenues of $380 million, declining from $439 million in the previous year, with a non-GAAP net loss of $13 million. TV revenues increased by 40% over the previous year on market share growth for DTV in the US, with market share reported to have reached 30%. However, by Q2 2010 the DTV business began to see challenges and the outlook for this business was significantly reduced. Around this time frame the market for DTV and digital camera chips started to suffer from increased competition and a trend towards commoditization, which had earlier affected Zoran's DVD chip business, resulting in reduced average selling prices and reduced profit margins. Zoran's last acquisition was that of silicon RF tuner company Microtune Inc. in 2010, for a transaction price of approximately $166 million. Microtune's tuner chips targeted cable set-top box, broadband cable modem, digital TV, and automotive entertainment markets. Zoran posted a non-GAAP net loss of $21.5 million for the year 2010, on revenues of $357 million, with a loss of $15 million for Q4 2010 alone. Despite a material revenue run-rate contributed by the Microtune acquisition (based on quarterly revenues of $24 million in Q2 2010), Zoran reported revenues of $85 million for Q1 2011, with a non-GAAP net loss of $21 million. The company reported a reduced outlook for its digital camera business for the remainder of the year due to Cisco's exit from the video camcorder business. For Q2 2011, its last quarter as an independent company, revenues declined to $83 million with a non-GAAP net loss of $18 million, although it forecast revenue growth to between $100 million and $105 million for the seasonally stronger third quarter of 2011. ===CSR plc merger=== On 21 February 2011, Zoran announced it was merging with CSR, a global leader in wireless connectivity (including WLAN and Bluetooth) and location chip technology such as GPS based in the UK. At the time of the merger agreement, Zoran's board of directors was agitated by hedge fund Ramius LLC, which had said in a letter to the board that it believed Zoran's shares were undervalued. Due to Zoran's decreased business outlook, the offer for Zoran was reduced to about $484 million in June from the originally agreed offer value of about $679 million (based on an all-stock transaction) under mutual agreement, although a significant cash component was introduced. The merger was completed on 31 August 2011, and Zoran now trades under the CSR banner with little mention of the original company name. Zoran described the transaction as a merger, but actually, it is a takeover according to CSR management. After the merger, CSR executed substantial layoffs involving former Zoran employees. The discontinuation of the DTV and silicon tuner divisions was announced at the end of 2011, involving the layoff of 800 employees, which some say caused CSR's share price to jump up substantially. Other divisions were cut as well, and as of the end of 2012, only the COACH (camera-on-a-chip) and Quatro (printer/imaging) product lines still existed. In December 2013 CSR announced it would discontinue development of the COACH platform, with around 200 people being laid off. As of 30 June 2014, CSR had sold the COACH and related camera/video IPs to Qualcomm. Finally, Qualcomm acquired CSR. ==Products== Zoran SupraHD chip Zoran developed and marketed chips that were used in a wide range of consumer and professional electronics devices featuring image compression or video compression, including PC-based video capture and video editing devices, DVD players, DVD recorders, LCD TVs and digital CRT TVs, digital cameras, security cameras, digital TV set-top boxes, printers and related imaging devices, and mobile phones. As is common in the semiconductor industry, Zoran was a fabless semiconductor company that outsourced the actual manufacturing of chips to independent foundries such as TSMC. Apart from semiconductor chips, Zoran also commonly provided customers with associated reference designs including a printed circuit board layout and a bill of materials with required components for common configurations, as well associated firmware and software tools, allowing a customer to bring an end product (for example, a DVD player or digital camera) to market faster with a reduced amount of investment while requiring less technical expertise. Examples of successful chip families sold by Zoran include the Vaddis product line that was widely used in DVD players, especially in earlier brand-name models with upscaled HDMI output (using Zoran's HDXtreme upscaler chip) and by numerous low-cost manufacturers in China, the COACH image processor/video processor product line for digital cameras that saw widespread adoption among both major brands and lower cost manufacturers in Asia and shipped hundreds of millions of units, and the SupraHD product line of integrated SoC solutions for LCD TVs, primarily supporting the ATSC and NTSC standards for the US market. Other specific target applications included set-top boxes for digital TV deployment in Asia, converter boxes facilitating the transition away from analog terrestrial television in the US, DVD recorders with the Activa product line featuring MPEG-2 encoding, and high-end camera phones with APPROACH camera multimedia processors. Prominent customers and products using Zoran chips included DVD players from brands such as Samsung, LG, Sharp and Toshiba, digital cameras sold under major brands such as Casio, Kodak, Nikon, Olympus, Pentax, Samsung and Sony, LG Viewty camera phones using APPROACH camera processors, budget LCD TVs sold in the US under brands including Insignia, Magnavox, Vizio and Westinghouse using SupraHD DTV processors, and single- function and multi-function printers (involving SoCs as well as software licenses) from brands such as Canon, Epson, HP, Lexmark, and Samsung. ==References * http://www.csr.com - Company website of CSR plc, which acquired Zoran in 2011 Category:Companies established in 1983 Category:Fabless semiconductor companies Category:Companies based in Sunnyvale, California Category:Defunct semiconductor companies of the United States ","title":"Zoran Corporation"},{"id":"2224480","text":"MonoUML is a CASE tool based on the Mono framework.

Set in 1964, it is a coming-of-age story about loss and betrayal. It received critical acclaim and was a New York Times bestseller. It won the 2004 Book Sense Book of the Year Awards (Paperback), and was nominated for the Orange Broadband Prize for Fiction. The book was later adapted into a film directed by Gina Prince- Bythewood. ==Plot== Set in 1964 in the fictitious town of Sylvan, South Carolina, The Secret Life of Bees tells the story of a 14-year-old white girl, Lily Melissa Owens, whose life has been shaped around the blurred memory of the afternoon her mother was killed. She lives in a house with her abusive father, whom she refers to as T. Ray. They have a no-nonsense maid, Rosaleen, surrogate mother for Lily. The book opens with Lily's discovery of bees in her bedroom. Then, after Rosaleen is arrested for pouring her bottle of \\"snuff juice\\" on three white men, Lily breaks her out of the hospital and they decide to leave town. They begin hitch-hiking toward Tiburon, SC, a place written on the back of an image of the Virgin Mary as a black woman, which Deborah, her mother, had owned. They spend a night in the woods with little food and little hope before reaching Tiburon. There, they buy lunch at a general store, and Lily recognizes a picture of the same \\"Black Mary\\" but on the side of a jar of honey. They receive directions to the origin of that honey, the Boatwright residence. They are introduced to the Boatwright sisters, the makers of the honey: August, May, and June, who are all black. Lily makes up a story about being an orphan. Lily and Rosaleen are invited to stay with the sisters. They learn the ways of the Boatwrights, as well as the ways of bee keeping. With a new home and a new family for the time being, Lily learns more about the Black Madonna honey that the sisters make. She begins working as August's bee keeping apprentice to repay her for her kindness, while Rosaleen works around the house. Lily finds out that May had a twin sister, April, who committed suicide with their father's shotgun when they were younger.Kidd, p. 97 She watches June's ongoing flirtations with, and refusals of marriage to, her boyfriend Neil. Lily and Rosaleen also get to see the sisters' form of religion. They hold service at their house which they call \\"The Daughters of Mary.\\" They keep a statue of \\"Black Mary\\", or \\"our lady of chains\\", which was actually a figurehead from the bow of an ancient ship, and August tells the story of how a man by the name of Obadiah, who was a slave, found this figure. The slaves thought that God had answered their prayers asking for rescue, and \\"to send them consolation\\" and \\"to send them freedom\\".(Kidd, pg. 108) It gave them hope, and the figure had been passed down for generations. Lily meets Zach, August's godson. They soon develop intimate feelings for each other. They share goals with each other while working the hives. Both Lily and Zach find their goals nearly impossible to meet but still encourage each other to attempt them. Zach wants to be the \\"ass-busting lawyer\\", which means he would be the first black lawyer in the area.Kidd, p. 121 Lily wants to be a short story writer. Lily attempts to tell August the truth but is interrupted by Zach, who takes her for a honey run. They stop at a store to pick up a few things. Zach gets arrested after one of his friends, who they had met at the store, throws a coke bottle at a white man and none of them will tell who did it. Zach and his friends are arrested and put in jail. The Boatwright house decides not to tell May in fear of an unbearable emotional episode. The secret does not stay hidden for long and May becomes catatonic with depression.(Kidd, pg. 186) May leaves the house and August, June, Lily and Rosaleen find her lying dead in the river with a rock on her chest, an apparent suicide. A vigil is held that lasts four days. In that time, Zach is freed from jail with no charges, and black cloth is draped over the beehives to symbolize the mourning. May's suicide letter is found and in it she says, \\"It's my time to die, and it's your time to live. Don't mess it up.\\"Kidd, pg. 222 August interprets this as urging June to marry Neil. May is later buried. Life begins to turn back to normal after a time of grieving, bringing the Boatwright house back together. June, after several rejections, agrees to give her hand in marriage to Neil. Zach vows to Lily that they will be together someday and that they will both achieve their goals.Kidd, pg. 231 Lily finally finds out the truth about her mother. August was her mother's nanny, and helped raise her. After her marriage to T. Ray began to sour, Deborah left and went to stay with the Boatwrights. She eventually decided to leave him permanently and returned to their house to collect Lily. While Deborah was packing to leave, T. Ray returned home. Their ensuing argument turned into a physical fight during which Deborah got a gun. After a brief struggle, the gun fell to the floor, which Lily picked up and the gun accidentally discharged, killing Deborah. While Lily is coming to terms with this information, T. Ray shows up at the pink house to take her back home. Lily refuses, and T. Ray flies into an enraged rampage. He has a violent flashback which brings him around. August steps in and offers to let Lily stay with her. T. Ray gives in and agrees. However, right before T. Ray leaves the Boatwright house, Lily asks him what really happened the day her mother died. T. Ray confirms that she did do it. ==Characters== * Lily Melissa Owens: the 14-year-old narrator of the story. Lily is the only child of Deborah and T. Ray Owens. Lily loves to read and write. * T.

This can take many forms including slogans, hand signs and colored clothing. Many of these, especially slogans and hand signs, have become part of popular culture.

With symbols, graffiti is a large symbol displayed on walls or trains. ==Hand signs== \\"Throwing up\\" a gang sign (e.g., \\"Stacking\\", \\"page\\", \\"gang walk\\") with the hands is one of the most known and obvious forms of \\"claiming\\" or stating the gang one is affiliated with. It is used in many situations where other identifiers may not be possible or appropriate, and it can also show that a gang member is in the area to \\"do business\\" as opposed to just passing through. Usually these signs are made by formation of the fingers on one or both hands to make some sort of symbol or letter.Gang Signs It can also serve to relay more specific information, such as what set they represent within a larger gang or in which activities they are currently taking part. Individual letters can be used to tell stories when flashed in rapid succession, each representing a word beginning with that letter. These signs, because they are displayed only when wanted (as opposed to the types of identifiers above), are usually the most consistent across various areas. Many of these hand signals are quite close to other common hand signs, and this can cause confusion among gang members, non-gang members, and anti-gang authorities. Another identifier that can be displayed only when desired is a gang handshake, which usually includes some component of the gang hand signs and/or other hand and finger symbols.

The clothing gangs wear allows rival gangs to identify who is friend and who is foe. For example, the uniforms for many Hispanic gangs are standard and easily recognizable. Gangs such as the Latin Kings would wear long yellow T-shirts, baggy pants, and either a bandana or a hat, sometimes both. Black gang members are generally more individualistic with their clothing. The gang would wear a specific clothing and certain accessories that would match their crew's colors. Examples include the Bloods, whose gang colour is red, and the Crips, who wear blue. Most gang members wear brands such as Pro Club, Dickies, & Levi's. == Bandanas == Bandanas can be worn in various types of colors and ways. This is done by gang members to signify which gang they are affiliated with. The most popular bandana colors are red, blue, black, white, grey, and yellow.

The church was established in the Apostolic Age, the earliest period of Christianity, and is probably best known for being one of the Seven churches of Asia addressed by name in the Book of Revelation (Rev. 3.14-22). Warm followers, those who believe but do not walk according to the Spirit of the Lord ==References in Colossians== The Christian community in Laodicea seems to have been closely connected with that of nearby Colossae (also in the Lycus valley, distant).James Strahan, ‚ÄúLaodicea,‚Äù ed. James Hastings, Dictionary of the Apostolic Church (2 Vols.) (New York: Charles Scribner‚Äôs Sons, 1916‚Äì1918), 684.M. J. S. Rudwick, Hemer C. J., ‚ÄúLaodicea,‚Äù ed. D. R. W. Wood et al., New Bible Dictionary (Leicester, England; Downers Grove, IL: InterVarsity Press, 1996), 672. Laodicea is mentioned four times in the New Testament's epistle to the Colossians (Col. 2:1; 4:13,15,16). In writing to the Colossians, Paul the Apostle sends greetings to them through a Laodicean named Nymphas and the church at their house (Col 4:15). He additionally greets Archippus, who might also be from Laodicea (4:17), and he instructs the Colossians to exchange his letter with one he has written to the Laodiceans (4:16). If the Colossian epistle is genuinely by Paul, then this would indicate a Christian presence in Laodicea as early as the 50s CE. It would also indicate that Laodicea (like Colossae) was not evangelized by Paul, but possibly by his disciple Epaphras (). In Colossians 4:16, Paul states: > \\"And when this epistle hath been read among you, cause that it be read also > in the church of the Laodiceans; and that ye also read the epistle from > Laodicea.\\" This reference to a letter which the Colossians were to obtain \\"from Laodicea\\" has created a puzzle which has not yet received a generally accepted solution.Charles P. Anderson, ‚ÄúLaodiceans, Epistle to the,‚Äù ed. David Noel Freedman, The Anchor Yale Bible Dictionary (New York: Doubleday, 1992), 231. Various alternatives have been suggested: *the epistle in question has been lostJoseph Barber Lightfoot, Saint Paul‚Äôs Epistles to the Colossians and to Philemon, 8th ed., Classic Commentaries on the Greek New Testament (London; New York: Macmillan and Co., 1886), 276. *the wording of Col 4:16 indicates that the letter was not written to but from Laodicea *Tertullian suggested that Marcionite heretics changed the title of the canonical epistle to the Ephesians *an apocryphal Epistle to the Laodiceans has had some supporters at times, but modern scholars now regard it as a forgery *it is actually one of the other canonical epistles, such at the Letter to Philemon or the Epistle to the Hebrews No general agreement currently exists as to whether the letter is extant under another name or was lost prior to the formation of the canon.Charles P. Anderson, ‚ÄúLaodiceans, Epistle to the,‚Äù ed. David Noel Freedman, The Anchor Yale Bible Dictionary (New York: Doubleday, 1992), p. 231-233. ==The Laodicean Church in the Revelation of John (Revelation 3:14‚Äì22)== In John's vision, recorded in the book of Book of Revelation, Christ instructs John to write a message to the seven churches of Asia Minor. The message to Laodicea is one of judgement with a call to repentance. The oracle contains a number of metaphors. ===\\"I wish that you were cold or hot\\" (Revelation 3:15‚Äì16)=== The traditional view has been that the Laodiceans were being criticized for their neutrality or lack of zeal (hence \\"lukewarm\\").Matthew Henry's Commentary on the Whole Bible, Revelation chapter 3 One problem with this is that Christ‚Äôs desire that they be either ‚Äúcold or hot‚Äù implies that both extremes are positive. The traditional view saw ‚Äúcold‚Äù as a negative, the idea apparently being that Jesus either wants the readers to be either zealous (‚Äúhot‚Äù) for him or completely uncommitted (‚Äúcold‚Äù), but not middle-of-the-road.G. K. Beale, The Book of Revelation: A Commentary on the Greek Text, New International Greek Testament Commentary (Grand Rapids, MI; Carlisle, Cumbria: W.B. Eerdmans; Paternoster Press, 1999), 303. A middle- of-the-road stance was thought to pollute the pure representation of the faith and create misconceptions about the church and its ideals. However, a more recent interpretation has suggested that this metaphor has been drawn from the water supply of the city, which was lukewarm, in contrast to the hot springs at nearby Hierapolis and the cold, pure waters of Colossae.Robert H. Mounce, The Book of Revelation, The New International Commentary on the New Testament (Grand Rapids, MI: Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing Co., 1997), 109. The archaeology shows Laodicea had an aqueduct that probably carried water from hot mineral springs some five miles south, which would have become tepid before entering the city (see main Laodicea article).Gordon D. Fee, Revelation, New Covenant Commentary Series (Eugene, OR: Cascade Books, 2011), 58. The imagery of the Laodicean aqueduct suggests not that \\"hot\\" is good and \\"cold\\" is bad, but that both hot and cold water are useful, whereas lukewarm water is emetic. ===\\"Poor, blind, and naked\\" (3:17‚Äì18)=== The words attributed to the Laodiceans may mark an ironic over-confidence in regard to spiritual wealth; they are unable to recognize their bankruptcy. However the image may also be drawing on the perceived worldly wealth of the city. The city was a place of great finance and banking. In 60 A.D the city was hit by a major earthquake. The city refused help of the Roman empire and rebuilt the city itself. The reference to the \\"white raiment\\" may refer to the cloth trade of Laodicea. The city was known for its black wool that was produced in the area. The reference to eye medication is again often thought to reflect the historical situation of Laodicea. According to Strabo (12.8.20) there was a medical school in the city, where a famous ophthalmologist practiced. The city also lies within the boundaries of ancient Phrygia, from where an ingredient of eye-lotions, the so-called \\"Phrygian powder\\", was supposed to have originated. ===\\"Behold, I stand\\" (3:20)=== Holman Hunt's painting The Light of the World inspired by Rev 3:20's metaphor of Christ knocking at the door of the Laodicean Church. This is among the most famous images of the Revelation, and is the subject of the famous painting The Light of the World by Holman Hunt. It bears similarities to a saying of Jesus in Mark 13:33‚Äì37, and Luke 12:35‚Äì38. The door in the painting has no handle, and can therefore be opened only from the inside.Hunt, W.H., Pre-Raphaelitism and the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood, London: Macmillan, 1905, vol.1 p.350 Commentators variously view it as a metaphor of intimate fellowship, and/or a reference to the eschatological parousia of Christ. The theme of divine invitations to eat are found both in the New Testament (e.g., the Parable of the Wedding Feast) and in Graeco-Roman religion. Commentators have also suggested that Revelation 3:20 is the only New Testament reference to the Old Testament book of Song of Solomon, linking this verse with Song of Solomon 5:2. Various papyri, such as \\"POxy 3693\\", include invitations to attend a dinner with gods such as Sarapis, but these are issued by specified individuals to feasts at a temple of a god and do not suggest the visitation of the home by the divinity. ==Later Christian Laodicea== There was a Council in Laodicea, A.D. c.363-64, although the date is disputed. The Council of Chalcedon in 451 approved the canon of this council, making these canon ecumenical.

Tanweer was named by Scotland Yard as the man who detonated a bomb while travelling eastbound on the Circle Line between Liverpool Street and Aldgate, killing both himself and seven of the 52 killed in the attacks. The other three men were identified as Hasib Hussain, Germaine Lindsay, and Mohammad Sidique Khan. All four homegrown terrorists were killed in the explosions. == Biography == Tanweer was born in St Luke's maternity hospital, Bradford to Parveen Akhtar, whose husband, Mohammed Mumtaz Tanweer, was originally from the Faisalabad region of Pakistan. In 1984, the family moved to the Beeston area of Leeds, then to Colwyn Road (also in Beeston) when Tanweer was seven. Known as Kaka (little one) by his family, he attended Wortley High School, where he was described as politically moderate by his friends, who knew him as an outstanding sportsman, excelling at cricket, triple jump, long-distance running, football, and ju-jitsu. He then attended Leeds Metropolitan University, where he studied sports science before leaving for Pakistan in 2004 to attend a course in Islamic studies. At the time of his death, Tanweer is believed to have worked occasionally in his father's fish and chip shop. His father had previously owned a curry takeaway and a butcher's shop and was respected locally as a prominent businessman. Tanweer attended several mosques including Bengali and Stratford Street mosque in Beeston, where two of the other London bombers, Mohammad Sidique Khan and Hasib Hussain, are also believed to have worshipped. He also frequented the Hamara Youth Access Point, a drop-in centre for teens, alleged to have been used as a recruitment centre by Khan. Police have confirmed that Khan and Tanweer went on a two-hour rafting trip together on 4 June 2005 at the National Whitewater Centre in Snowdonia National Park in Wales. Forensic evidence found in rucksacks after the abortive 21 July London attacks has linked those attacks to a second group of young men of Asian appearance who booked a rafting trip there on the same day as Tanweer and Khan Relatives in Pakistan have said that Tanweer had boasted of wanting to die as a \\"holy warrior\\" and that he was enamoured with Osama bin Laden. They noted that incidents such as the Qur'an desecration controversy of 2005 had \\"always been in his mind\\".Cousin listened to boasts about suicide mission by Daniel McGrory and Zahid Hussain, The Times, 22 July 2005 Tanweer's body was buried at the shrine of a local Islamic saint in Tanweer's ancestral village in Samundari, Pakistan on 27 October 2005. ==Trip to Pakistan== After completing the hajj earlier in the year, Tanweer travelled to Pakistan for a course in Islamic studies at a madrasa. The Pakistani government has released footage of Tanweer arriving at Karachi International Airport with Mohammad Sidique Khan, believed to be the ringleader of the London bombers, on Turkish Airlines Flight TK 1056 on 19 November 2004. Tanweer and Khan stayed in Pakistan until 8 February, then flew back to London together. The youngest of the London cell, Hasib Hussain, arrived in Karachi from Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, on 15 July 2004 on Saudi Arabian Airlines Flight SV 714. Intelligence sources say the school was located in Muridke, Pakistan, 20 miles outside Lahore, named Jamia Manzoorul Islam and is believed to be connected with Lashkar-e-Tayyaba, a banned militant Islamist group. The madrasa has denied any connection with Tanweer. It is believed there was a meeting in Faisalabad between Tanweer and Osama Nazir, a suspected member of Jaish-e-Mohammed, who has since been arrested for his role in a grenade attack on a church in Islamabad that killed five. Investigators also believe that Tanweer may have met Zeeshan Siddiqui, who is associated with a number of militant groups and who was arrested in Pakistan two months ago. ==London bombing== A few days before the bombing, Tanweer rented a red Nissan Micra from a local car-rental agency, and at around the same time, dyed his hair and eyebrows light brown, according to friends; this was due to the strong bleaching effect given off by the bombs' ingredients . On 7 July, Tanweer, Khan, Hussain, and Lindsay are believed to have picked up the bombs from a house in the Burley area of Leeds, hiding them in large rucksacks, then to have driven to Luton, Bedfordshire in the red Nissan, which he left parked in Luton railway station car park. In Luton, the men boarded the 07.48 Thameslink train, arriving at King's Cross in London at 08.20 hours, where they went their separate ways and detonated their bombs. London Underground Ltd has confirmed that the three underground bombs exploded within 60 seconds of each other at 8:50 a.m. Tanweer travelled eastbound on the Circle line from Kings Cross, detonating his bomb on train number 204 between Liverpool Street and Aldgate stations, also killing at least seven people. He was identified from body parts found in the carriage he blew up. After the bombings, police found 16 other bombs in Tanweer's car, several of them so- called \\"initiators\\" for the rucksack bombs: plastic bottles turned into nail bombs, containing a detonator attached to an electrical cable. Felt-roofing nails were fixed to the outside of the bottles with their tips pointing outwards, apparently intended to cause maximum soft-tissue damage. The devices would then have had cakes of high explosive packed around them. == Video statement == On 6 July 2006, a video statement by Tanweer was broadcast by Al- Jazeera. In the video, which included remarks by al-Qaeda leader Ayman al- Zawahiri, Tanweer said: \\"What have you witnessed now is only the beginning of a string of attacks that will continue and become stronger until you pull your forces out of Afghanistan and Iraq. And until you stop your financial and military support to America and Israel.\\" Tanweer argued that the non-Muslims of Britain deserve such attacks because they voted for a government which \\"continues to oppress our mothers, children, brothers and sisters in Palestine, Afghanistan, Iraq and Chechnya\\" Tanweer's statement was therefore clearer in making this link with British foreign policy than that of Mohammad Sidique Khan, the presumed lead bomber. The video has also served to solidify speculation that both Khan and Tanweer had contact with Ayman Al-Zawahiri and other senior figures in the Al-Qaeda organisation while in Dubai. The video also featured a segment by Adam Yahiye Gadahn. ==Assets== Tanweer left behind ¬£121,000, but left no will. A spokesman for the probate department at the High Court said: ‚ÄúThe net amount figure of ¬£121,000 is the realisable figure which is what is left after taxes and debts on the estate have been deducted.\\"Tube suicide bomber left mystery ¬£121,000 ==Girlfriend== Tanweer's religious credentials as a serious Islamic extremist were cast in a questionable light when, in 2011, evidence emerged that he had a 'secret girlfriend' with whom he had been intimately involved until the very end, for a period of three years beginning in 2002. This evidence seems to cast Tanweer in a somewhat contradictory light, as sex outside of marriage is deeply frowned upon in even the most liberal Islamic circles, being assigned the label of a major sin in traditional Islamic Jurisprudence.\\" ==See also== *Mohammad Sidique Khan, Edgware Road underground train *Hasib Hussain, No. 30 Transport for London omnibus *Germaine Lindsay, Piccadilly Line underground train *21 July 2005 London bombings ==References== *\\"From cricket-lover who enjoyed a laugh to terror suspect\\" by Sandra Laville and Ian Cobain, The Guardian, 13 July 2005 *\\"Chemist denies any role in London attacks\\" by Brian Murphy, The Guardian, 15 July 2005 *\\"Investigators reveal London bomber's links to al-Qaeda\\" by Gethin Chamberlain, The Scotsman, 16 July 2005 *\\"Warren Street bomb suspect held\\" by James Sturcke and agencies, The Guardian, 27 July 2005 *Images obtained by ABC News *\\"A life torn apart by terror: one woman's story of survival\\" by Sandra Laville, The Guardian, 24 September 2005 == Further reading == *Profile of Shehzad Tanweer Category:1982 births Category:2005 deaths Category:English Islamists Category:Alumni of Leeds Beckett University Category:English people of Pakistani descent Category:Islamic terrorism in England Category:Pakistani Islamists Category:People from Beeston, Leeds Category:Perpetrators of the July 2005 London bombings Category:21st-century British criminals Category:Criminals from Yorkshire Category:Male suicides Category:English mass murderers Category:Murderers who committed suicide ","title":"Shehzad Tanweer"},{"id":"2224526","text":"The church tower in Bj√§lbo from the 12th Century.

He currently wrestles for Montreal's Northern Championship Wrestling (NCW), the Ontario-based Blood Sweat and Ears (BSE) promotion, as well as other independent promotion. He also has made occasional appearances for Ring of Honor. In NCW, he has held both the NCW Inter-Cities Heavyweight Championship and the NCW Quebec Heavyweight Championship on three occasions, the NCW Tag Team Championship five times, and the NCW Television Championship once. While competing for IWS, he won the IWS Heavyweight Championship and the IWS Tag Team Championship on one occasion each. He held the BSE Suicide Six-Pack Championship on one occasion in 2007. He has previously worked for Combat Zone Wrestling, where he is a former CZW Iron Man Champion. He also made appearances for Pro Wrestling Guerrilla, Canadian Championship Wrestling, Pro Wrestling Xtreme, and Elite Wrestling Revolution. ==Professional wrestling careerNorthern Championship Wrestling=== On October 11, 1997, Franky won the NCW Television Championship by defeating Daniel L√©on, but only held it for a week, before dropping it to Black Eagle on October 18. On December 18, 1999, Franky won the NCW Carlos Cup Championship by defeating Chakal, and held the championship until February 12, 2000, when he was defeated by Eric Shelley. Franky defeated Shelley the following month to regain the championship, but lost it to Steven the Sweet Boy less than a month later on April 1. In May, Franky won the championship for the third time, by defeating both Steven and Shelley in a three-way match. The championship was later vacated on September 9, due to Franky not defending it. On January 13, 2001, Franky won his first NCW Quebec Championship by defeating Piranah. He held the championship for almost two months, before losing it to Guy Williams. He won the Quebec Championship for a second time a year later, by defeating Chakal on March 10, 2002. He lost it to Chakal two months later in May 2002. He won the championship for the third time on February 21, 2004, by defeating Manuel Vegas, but lost it to Chakal on April 3. ===International Wrestling Syndicate=== Franky began competing regularly for the International Wrestling Syndicate (IWS) in 2004. He made his first IWS appearance on July 2 at Mid Summer Madness, by defeating Excess69. He continued competing for them over the next few months, both in singles and tag team competition. In August, he teamed with Kevin Steen to defeat Green Phantom and El Generico, and he went on to defeat Beef Wellington in October. On November 24, at Born to Bleed, he defeated Steen, Generico, Excess, Kurt Lauderdale and Pierre Carl Ouellet to win the IWS Heavyweight Championship. He had successful defenses against Ouellet, Steen and SeXXXy Eddy, before losing the championship to SeXXXy Eddy in a cage match also involving The Arsenal and Evil Ninja on July 9, 2005. He attempted to regain the championship on several occasions, but was unsuccessful. He continued competing sporadically for the IWS for the next several years, facing wrestlers including Beef Wellington, Excess, Sofirios, Jake Matthews, Shane Matthews, Jagged, Brick Crawford, Pierre Carl Ouellet, and Eddie Kingston. At Know Your Enemies on March 28, 2008, Franky teamed up with Twiggy to defeat 2.0 (Jagged and Shane Matthews), The Super Smash Brothers (Player Uno and Stupefied) and The Untouchables (Dan Paysan and Jimmy Stone) in a four-way tag team match to win the IWS Tag Team Championship. Franky and Twiggy dubbed themselves \\"The Rock 'n Roid Express\\" and went on to successfully defend the championship against 2.0. At Hardcore Heat in August 2008, Up in Smoke (Cheech and Cloudy) won the Tag Team Championship by defeating Twiggy and El Generico, who was a replacement for Franky. ===American independent promotions=== Franky began competing for the Philadelphia-based promotion Combat Zone Wrestling (CZW) in 2005. On February 2, 2005, Franky won the CZW Iron Man Championship by defeating B-Boy at Only The Strong. He held the championship for over six months, having successful championship defenses against Adam Flash at Liberated and Coming Full Circle in March, Beef Wellington in April at Trifecta 3, and Chris Hero in July at High Stakes 3. He eventually lost the championship to Kevin Steen at Deja Vu 3 on August 13. Following the loss of his championship, he did not appear in CZW again until December 2005, when he teamed up with Larry Sweeney to defeat Team Masturbation (Excalibur and Beef Wellington) at Cage of Death 7. His next and final appearance in CZW was in August 2006 at Trapped, when he competed in a three-team All Out War match as a member of The Canadian Team, alongside Kevin Steen, LuFisto, and El Generico against The Forefathers of CZW (Nick Gage, Justice Pain, and Eddie Kingston) and The Blackout (Ruckus, Sabian, Joker, and Robby Mireno), which The Forefathers of CZW won. On March 10, 2007, Franky appeared at Pro Wrestling Guerrilla's Album of the Year show, where he teamed up with Kevin Steen as \\"Frank N' Steen\\" to lose to the team of Chris Bosh and Scott Lost. In 2009, Franky began competing for Ring of Honor (ROH). He made his ROH debut at The Hunt Begins in Montreal on April 17, when he lost to Chris Hero. At Death Before Dishonor VII Night 1 in Toronto on July 24, Franky lost to D'Lo Brown. He won his first match in ROH at Death Before Dishonor VII Night 2 on July 24, when he defeated Bison Smith by disqualification. ===Other promotions=== Franky has made various appearances for Canadian independent promotions. He wrestled for the Apocalypse Wrestling Federation in 2002, and has appeared for the Quebec-based promotion Elite Wrestling Revolution on several occasions. One of his most notable matches for EWR occurred on April 5, 2005, when he defeated Homicide in a singles match. On August 23, 2007, Franky made an appearance for Pro Wrestling Xtreme, when he unsuccessfully challenged Derek Wylde for the PWX X Championship. On August 26, 2007, Franky won the Suicide Six-Pack Championship, by defeating the defending champion Ash, as well as Cody 45, Pierre Shadows, Vane, and Xtremo at Scorched Earth. He held the championship until May 10, 2008, when he lost it to Xtremo in a match also involving Bang Bang Pete, Johnny Devine, Kaz, and Akira Raijin. On December 20, 2008, NCW announced that Franky The Mobster was in Toronto, Ontario trying out for World Wrestling Entertainment. In 2012, Franky won the TOW Championship, after defeating Sylvain Grenier and Darkko in a triple- threat match. In 2017, at WCPW Pro Wrestling World Cup - Canadian Qualifying Round Franky was defeated by Davey Boy Smith Jr. in the first round of the First Round of the Canada Leg. ==Championships and accomplishments== *Blood Sweat and Ears **BSE Suicide Six-Pack Championship (1 time) *Canadian Championship Wrestling **CCW Heavyweight Championship (2 times) *Combat Zone Wrestling **CZW Iron Man Championship (1 time) *International Wrestling Syndicate **IWS World Heavyweight Championship (1 time) **IWS World Tag Team Championship (2 times) *Northern Championship Wrestling **NCW Inter-Cities Heavyweight Championship (3 times) **NCW Quebec Heavyweight Championship (3 times) **NCW Tag Team Championship (5 times) \\\\- with Raiden (4) and Nightmare (1) **NCW Television Championship (1 time) *Northern Shore Pro Wrestling **Standing 8 Tournament (2015)http://www.cagematch.net/?id=1&nr;=140271 * Top of the World Wrestling **ToW Heavyweight Champion (1 time) *Pro Wrestling Illustrated **PWI ranked him #356 of the top 500 singles wrestlers in the PWI 500 in 2010 ==References * Blood Sweat and Ears profile * Online World of Wrestling profile Category:Canadian male professional wrestlers Category:Living people Category:Professional wrestlers from Quebec Category:Sportspeople from Montreal Category:Year of birth missing (living people) ","title":"Franky The Mobster"},{"id":"2224532","text":"Lovely Music (full name: Lovely Music Ltd.) is an American record label devoted to new American music.

A steam turbine locomotive is a steam locomotive which transmits steam power to the wheels via a steam turbine. Numerous attempts at this type of locomotive were made, mostly without success. In the 1930s this type of locomotive was seen as a way both to revitalize steam power and challenge the diesel locomotives then being introduced. ==Advantages== * High efficiency at high speed. * Far fewer moving parts, hence potentially greater reliability. * Conventional piston steam locomotives give a varying, sinusoidal torque, making wheelslip much more likely when starting. * The side rods and valve gear of conventional steam locomotives create horizontal forces that cannot be fully balanced without substantially increasing the vertical forces on the track, known as hammer blow. ==Disadvantages== * High efficiency is ordinarily obtained only at high speed (though some Swedish and UK locomotives were designed and built to operate with an efficiency equal to or better than that of piston engines under customary operating conditions). Gas turbine locomotives had similar problems, together with a range of other difficulties. * Peak efficiency can be reached only if the turbine exhausts into a near vacuum, generated by a surface condenser. These devices are heavy and cumbersome. * Turbines can rotate in only one direction. A reverse turbine must also be fitted for a direct-drive steam turbine locomotive to be able to move backwards. ==Drive methods== There are two ways to drive the wheels: either directly via gears, or using generator-driven traction motors. ===Direct drive=== Argentina The route from Tucum√°n to Santa Fe in Argentina goes through mountainous terrain with few opportunities to take on water. In 1925 the Swedish firm NOHAB built a turbine locomotive similar to Fredrik Ljungstr√∂m's first design. The condenser worked quite well - only 3 or 4% of the water was lost en route and due only to leakage from the tank. The locomotive had reliability problems and was later replaced by a condenser-equipped piston steam locomotive. France Two attempts were made in France. One effort, the Nord Turbine, resembled the LMS Turbomotive in both appearance and mechanical layout. The project was canceled and the locomotive was built as a compound piston steam locomotive instead. The second attempt, SNCF 232.Q.1, was built in 1940. It was unusual in that its driving wheels were not connected by side rods. Each of its three driving axles had its own turbine. It was heavily damaged by German troops in World War II and was scrapped in 1946. Germany Henschel T38-2555, with the steam turbine tender Multiple attempts at this type were made by German locomotive builders. In 1928 Krupp-Zoelly built a geared steam turbine locomotive. The exhaust of the turbine was fed to a condenser which both conserved water and increased the thermal efficiency of the turbine. Draught for the fire was provided by a steam-driven fan in the smokebox. In 1940, this locomotive was hit by a bomb. It was withdrawn from service and not repaired. A similar machine was built by Maffei in 1929. Despite having a higher-pressure boiler, it was less efficient than the Krupp-Zoelly locomotive. It was hit by a bomb in 1943 and removed from service. Henschel converted a normal DRG Class 38 steam locomotive to use a steam turbine in 1927. The locomotive itself was little modified, the major changes being to the tender which was fitted with coupled driving wheels in a 2-4-4 layout, driven by separate forward and reverse turbines. Both turbines were driven by intermediate pressure exhaust steam from the original cylinders. A condenser in the tender provided a vacuum for the turbine exhaust, increasing thermal efficiency. As the final exhaust was at negligible pressure, the original smokebox blastpipe had to be replaced by an electric draught fan in the smokebox. Performance was disappointing, and the turbine tender was removed in 1937. Italy Giuseppe Belluzzo of Italy designed a number of experimental turbine locomotives.Giuseppe Belluzzo, Steam Turbine Locomotive, , granted August 9, 1927.Giuseppe Belluzzo, Steam Turbine Locomotive, , granted April 17, 1928. None were ever tested on main lines. His first was a small locomotive with four wheels, each fitted with its own small turbine. Reverse movement was accomplished by feeding steam into the turbines via a backwards-facing inlet. Steam turbines are designed to rotate in only one direction, making this method very inefficient. No one else appears to have attempted it. Belluzzo contributed to the design of a 2-8-2 locomotive built by Ernesto Breda in 1931. It used four turbines in a multiple expansion arrangement. Belluzzo's US patent from that period shows the turbine driving a jackshaft through a gearbox in front of the locomotive's drivers.Giuseppe Belluzzo, Turbine Locomotive, , granted November 8, 1932. This locomotive was never completely fitted out. In 1933, a FS 2-6-2 Class 685 locomotive was the object of a curious experiment, in which the piston engine was removed and a turbine fitted in its place, leaving the locomotive otherwise completely unchanged. Tests run were however a failure, as its performance proved to be well below that of a normal 685; the turbine soon broke up, and that signalled the end of the attempt. In 1936 the locomotive was refitted with a normal piston engine. Sweden Ljungstr√∂m locomotive of 1921 Swedish engineer Fredrik Ljungstr√∂m designed a number of steam turbine locomotives, some of which were highly successful. His first attempt in 1921 was a rather odd- looking machine. Its three driving axles were located under the tender, and the cab and boiler sat on unpowered wheels. As a result, only a small portion of the locomotive's weight contributed to traction. In the mid-1920s, Ljungstr√∂m filed a patent on a quill drive for a steam turbine locomotive.Fredrik Ljungstr√∂m, Turbine-Driven Locomotive and Similar Vehicle, , granted June 14, 1927. The second design was a 2-8-0 similar to a successful freight design. Built in 1930 and 1936 by Nydqvist & Holm AB, these locomotives replaced conventional ones on the Gr√§ngesberg-Oxel√∂sund Railway. No condenser was fitted, as its complexity outweighed its thermodynamic advantages. The wheels were driven by a jackshaft. These engines were not retired until the 1950s when the line was electrified. Three engines of this type were built, all three of which have been preserved. These can currently be seen in the Railway Museum of Gr√§ngesberg, two (71 and 73) being owned by the Gr√§ngesbergbanornas J√§rnv√§gsmuseum (GBBJ) and the third (72) by the Swedish Railway Museum. Switzerland SBB Nr. 1801 The Swiss firm Zoelly built a turbine locomotive in 1919. It was a 4-6-0 locomotive fitted with a condenser. It was fitted with a cold-air blower feeding into the firebox grate rather than a suction fan in the smokebox. This avoided the complexity of building a fan that could withstand hot, corrosive gases, but introduced a new problem. The firebox was at positive pressure, and hot gases and cinders could be blown out the firebox doors if they were opened while the blower was operating. This potentially dangerous arrangement was eventually replaced with a smokebox fan. United Kingdom ; Turbomotive One of the more successful turbines operated in the United Kingdom, the LMS Turbomotive, built in 1935, was a variation of the Princess Royal 4-6-2 large passenger express locomotive. There was no condenser. Although a disadvantage for thermal efficiency of the turbine, it allowed the turbine exhaust to still be used through a blastpipe to draw the fire, as for a conventional steam locomotive and avoiding the separate draught fans that caused so much trouble for other turbine locomotives. See paper by Roland Bond J. Instn Loco. Engrs., 1946, 36 (Paper 458) via Despite this limitation, it had greater thermal efficiency than conventional locomotives. The high efficiency mainly resulted from the fact that there were six steam nozzles directed into the turbine which could be turned on and off individually. Each nozzle could thus be allowed to operate, or not, at full power, rather than being inefficiently throttled to a lower pressure. A certain amount of inspiration appears to have come from Fredrik Ljungstr√∂m's turbines in Sweden. The main turbine failed after eleven years in heavy service. The Turbomotive was converted to piston drive in 1952, renamed \\"Princess Anne\\" and shortly after entering service was withdrawn following the deadly Harrow and Wealdstone railway accident in 1952. ; Other designs Beyer-Ljungstr√∂m locomotive Another locomotive was built by Beyer- Peacock, using the Ljungstr√∂m turbine by Fredrik Ljungstr√∂m. Like one of Ljungstr√∂m's early designs, the driving wheels were under the tender. Performance was disappointing, however, partly because of poor heating of the boiler. Another unit was rebuilt by the North British Locomotive Company. In its first incarnation (described below) it had an electrical transmission. Only a few tests were done before it was abandoned due to mechanical failures. United States The single S2, #6200, in a PRR promotional image. In the waning years of steam, the Baldwin Locomotive Works undertook several attempts at alternative technologies to diesel power. In 1944, Baldwin built the sole example of the S2 class, c/n 70900, for the Pennsylvania Railroad, delivering it in September 1944. It was the largest direct-drive steam turbine locomotive in the world and had a 6-8-6 wheel arrangement. It was originally designed as a 4-8-4, but due to shortages of lightweight materials during World War II, the S2 required additional leading and trailing wheels. Numbered 6200 on the PRR roster, the S2 had a maximum power output of 6,900 HP (5.1 MW) and was capable of speeds over . With the tender, the unit was approximately long. The steam turbine was a modified marine unit. While the gearing system was simpler than a generator, it had a fatal flaw: the turbine was inefficient at slow speeds. Below about 40 mph (64 km/h) the turbine used enormous amounts of steam and fuel. At high speeds, however, the S2 could propel heavy trains almost effortlessly and efficiently. The smooth turbine drive put far less stress on the track than a normal piston-driven locomotive. However, poor efficiency at slow speeds doomed this turbine, and with diesel-electrics being introduced, no more S2s were built. The locomotive was retired in 1949 and scrapped in May, 1952. ===Electric transmission=== United Kingdom Armstrong Whitworth Turbo Electric Locomotive catalogue image The Reid-Ramsey turbine, built by the North British Locomotive Company in 1910, had a 2-B+B-2 (4-4-0+0-4-4) wheel arrangement. Steam was generated in a standard locomotive boiler, with superheater, and passed to a turbine generator. Exhaust steam was condensed and recirculated by small auxiliary turbine pumps. The armatures of the motors were mounted directly on the four driving axles. It was later rebuilt as a direct-drive turbine locomotive as seen above. The Armstrong- Whitworth turbine, built in 1922 (image right), had a 1-C+C-1 (2-6-6-2) wheel arrangement. It was fitted with a rotary evaporative condenser, in which the steam was condensed by passing it through a rotating set of tubes. The tubes were dampened and cooled by the evaporation of water. The loss of water from evaporation was far less than what it would have been with no condenser at all. The airflow in the condenser had to take a convoluted path, reducing the condenser's efficiency. The locomotive was overweight and a poor performer. It was returned in 1923 and scrapped. United States ;General Electric Photo of the Union Pacific GE steam turbine locomotives, April 1939. General Electric built two steam turbine-electric locomotives with a 2+C-C+2 (4-6-6-4) wheel arrangement for the Union Pacific Railroad in 1938. These locomotives essentially operated as mobile steam power plants and were correspondingly complex. They were the only condensing steam locomotives ever used in the United States. A Babcock & Wilcox boiler provided steam, which drove a pair of steam turbines which powered a generator, providing power to the electric traction motors that drove the wheels, as well as providing head-end power for the rest of the train. Boiler control was largely automatic, and the two locomotives could be connected together into a multiple unit, both controlled from a single cab. The boiler was oil-fired, and the fuel was \\"Bunker C\\" heavy fuel oil, the same fuel used in large vessels, and also the fuel which was later used in Union Pacific's gas turbine-electric locomotives. Union Pacific accepted the locomotives in 1939, but returned them later that year, citing unsatisfactory results. The GE turbines were used during a motive power shortage on the Great Northern Railway in 1943, and appear to have performed quite well. However, by the end of 1943, the wheels of both locomotives were worn to the point of needing replacement, and one of the locomotive's boilers developed a defect. The locomotives were returned to GE and dismantled. ;C&O; Railway The first of the three locomotives, #500. In 1947‚Äì1948 Baldwin built three unusual coal-fired steam turbine-electric locomotives for passenger trains on the Chesapeake and Ohio Railway (C&O;). Their designation was M1, but because of their expense and poor performance they acquired the nickname \\"Sacred Cow\\". The units, which had Westinghouse electrical systems, had a 2-C1+2-C1-B wheel arrangement. They were 106 feet (32 m) long. The cab was in the center with a coal bunker ahead of it and a backwards-mounted conventional boiler behind it (the tender only carried water). These locomotives were intended for a route from Washington, D.C. to Cincinnati, Ohio but could never travel the whole route without some sort of failure. Coal dust and water frequently got into the traction motors. While these problems could have been fixed given time, it was obvious that these locomotives would always be expensive to maintain and all three were scrapped in 1950. ; Norfolk & Western locomotive 2300-\\"Jawn Henry\\" In May 1954 Baldwin built a steam turbine- electric locomotive for freight service on the Norfolk and Western Railway (N&W;), nicknamed the Jawn Henry after the legend of John Henry, a rock driller who famously raced against a steam drill and won, only to die immediately after. Length including tenders was 161 ft 1-1/2 inches, probably the record for a steam locomotive; engine-only length was 111 ft 7-1/2 inches, perhaps the record for any single unit. The Norfolk & Western Info Page C-C+C-C TE1. The unit looked similar to the C&O; turbines but differed mechanically; it was a C+C-C+C with a Babcock & Wilcox water-tube boiler with automatic controls. The boiler controls were sometimes problematic, and (as with the C&O; turbines) coal dust and water got into the motors. The Jawn Henry was retired from the N&W; roster on January 4, 1958. == References == * ==External links== * Locomotives Category:Experimental locomotives Category:Steam locomotive types ","title":"Steam turbine locomotive"},{"id":"2224545","text":"Arsenius (Latinized form) and Arsenios (Greek form) is a male first name.

In a literary context, a wheel of fire may refer to the chain of tortuous or dire consequences that result from a single action. ==In mythology== The Wheel of Fire originates in Greek mythology as the punishment for Ixion, who was bound to a wheel of fire for lusting after Zeus's wife, Hera. ==In literature== The Wheel of Fire is part of the Aristotelian reading of a tragedy (e.g., plays), which includes the central flaw within a character. In Shakespeare's tragedy Othello, the flaw in Othello himself is his vulnerability to jealousy and his tendency to believe Iago, who is manipulating Othello into believing his wife is unfaithful. As a result of this flaw Othello loses a loyal friend, murders his wife, and is driven insane before eventually committing suicide. In this scenario the Wheel of Fire begins with the action of Othello trusting Iago and consequently the other events occur. The Wheel of Fire is most commonly applied to the protagonist within a tragedy (i.e. the hero) and may aim to provoke sympathy from the audience when the hero falls from grace (this purging of emotions is known as catharsis), though it also adds dramatic interest to the performance. The Wheel of Fire is also the title of G. Wilson Knight's book on Shakespearean tragedy. In Shakespeare's King Lear, Lear states: \\"But I am bound upon a wheel of fire, / That mine own tears do scald like molten lead\\".Act 4, Scene 7 ===In Tolkien=== In J. R. R.

Bitrate Peeling is similar in overall effect to RealNetworks' technology called \\"SureStream\\", which basically creates a single media clip that contains multiple bitrates. The purpose is to provide access to the clip for people with slower Internet connections, and yet still allow people with faster connections to enjoy the higher quality content. The server automatically chooses which stream to deliver to the user, depending on user's connection speed. , Ogg Vorbis bitrate peeling existed only as a concept as there was not yet an encoder capable of producing peelable datastreams . An experimental implementation of bitrate peeling can be found here. However, re- encoding files at a lower bitrate will preserve more quality than this experimental bitrate peeler. ==Difference from other technologies== The difference between SureStream and Bitrate Peeling is that SureStream is limited to only a handful of pre-defined bitrates, with significant difference between them, and SureStream encoded files are big because they contain all of the bitrates used, while Bitrate Peeling uses much smaller steps to change the available bitrate and quality, and only the highest bitrate is used to encode the file/stream, which results in smaller files on servers. A related technique to the SureStream approach is hierarchical modulation, used in broadcast, where severally different streams at different qualities (and bitrates) are all broadcast, with the higher quality stream used if possible, with the lower quality streams fallen back on if not. ===Lossy + Correction=== A similar technology is to feature a combination of a lossy format and a lossless correction; this allows stripping the correction to easily obtain a lossy file. Such formats include MPEG-4 SLS (Scalable to Lossless), WavPack, DTS-HD Master Audio and OptimFROG DualStream. ===SureStream example=== A SureStream encoded file is encoded at bitrates of 16 kbit/s, 32 kbit/s and 96 kbit/s. The file will be about the same in size as three separate files encoded at those bitrates and put together, or one file encoded at the sum of those bitrates, which is about 144 kbit/s (16+32+96). When a dial-up user has only about 28 kbit/s of bandwidth available, the Real server will serve the 16 kbit/s stream. If the dial-up connection is of higher quality, and maybe about 42 kbit/s is available, the server will automatically switch to the 32 kbit/s stream. A DSL or cable Internet user will be served the 96 kbit/s stream. This looks good, but even though the user with 28 kbit/s can use a higher bitrate / higher quality stream (maybe 22 to 24 kbit/s), such thing can't be done with SureStream, unless the encoded file contains such a bitrate. This is where Bitrate Peeling comes into play. ===Bitrate Peeling example=== Contrary to SureStream, Bitrate Peeling requires only the highest bitrate to be used when encoding a file/stream, which is 96 kbit/s in this case. The obvious benefit is much smaller space on a server required by such a file. An additional feature of Bitrate Peeling is a much finer tuning of available bitrate/quality. If a dial-up user with 28 kbit/s available bandwidth connects to an Ogg Vorbis file/stream, the server will \\"peel\\" the original 96 kbit/s file/stream down to just below available bandwidth (in this case it would be around 20-24 kbit/s). This \\"peeling\\" process is different from transcoding because transcoding uncompresses the file and recompresses it (a computing- intensive process), whereas the peeling process \\"cuts the fat\\" by removing excess bits from the stream without using much processor time. Aside from the obvious space-saving advantage Bitrate Peeling allows for smaller steps in the delivery bitrate (the end user will see the file in the highest quality possible for their bandwidth). These benefits are only theoretical, as the only Vorbis peeler available is still in experimental state and produces file qualities inferior to what transcoding the higher bitrate file to a lower bitrate would. ==Comparison with other progressive encodings== Bitrate peeling is theoretically possible, and is implemented in some other formats, notably JPEG 2000, JPEG progressive encoding, and Scalable Video Coding. The reason that it is not available in Ogg Vorbis is that current encoders do not organize the code-stream to have progressive accuracy, thus peelers cannot tell which data is more or less important.

The name \\"folkung\\" does appear as early as in 12th century sources, but is then usually not applied to members of the family. In an effort to avoid confusion with the Folkunge Party some modern historians have argued that \\"House of Bj√§lbo\\" would be a better name because Birger Jarl lived there and it is the family's oldest known manor. Bj√§lbo is located in √ñsterg√∂tland, outside of Sk√§nninge in the present-day commune of Mj√∂lby. In any case the members of this dynasty never used a name to refer to themselves since family names were not widely adopted in Sweden until the 16th century, thus neither name is more \\"correct\\" for the dynasty, apart from the potential for confusion. Folkunga√§tten (Nordisk familjebok. 1908) == Jarls and bishops == The House of Bjelbo produced most of the jarls in Sweden in the 11th, 12th and 13th centuries until the title was abolished in 1266. Different branches of the family were often rivals for the office of jarl. Most of the kings during that time were also from √ñsterg√∂tland. Around 1100, Folke the Fat became the first known Bjelbo jarl, and probably the first jarl of all Sweden, under king Inge I of Sweden. He was married to a daughter of king Canute IV of Denmark. According to legends, he was the first of his family so elevated. Nothing is known of any of Folke's collateral relatives, though it is well- established that several of his sons' descendants were important lords. Other notable jarls from the family were Birger Brosa, Charles the Deaf, Ulf Fase, and Birger jarl. In the early 13th century, some members of the family moved to Norway, and held the office of jarl there. Noteworthy is that regardless of the ruling royal family, Bjelbos continued to hold the position of the jarl in the kingdom. Several members of the family were also Bishops of Link√∂ping at least in the 13th century. Diocese covered the area of √ñsterg√∂tland. Bishop of Link√∂ping was often involved in the eastern activities. Early Dukes of Finland were from the House of Bjelbo and used the traditional coat of arms with a rampant lion. This developed later to the current Coat of arms of Finland during the reign of Johan as Grand Duke of Finland, the lion from which serves as the symbol of the state and in stylized forms various authorities. == Rise to royalty == Valdemar, a son of Birger jarl, was elected as the King of Sweden in 1250. House of Bjelbo had gradually married to all rival royal dynasties in Sweden eventually producing an heir related to them all. When the previous king Eric had died without an heir apparent, his sister's son, and also Birger's son, was the most suitable option to hold the royal office. Members of the house reigned as kings Sweden until 1364. From 1319 to 1387, they were also kings of Norway. Almost all subsequent monarchs of Sweden, Norway and Denmark trace cognatic descent from the House of Bjelbo. == Uncertainties in genealogy == Particularly, several persons conventionally assigned as sons and grandsons to Benedict Snivel, son of Folke the Fat, may actually be related to him in a different way. Conventional assignments stretch two generations to cover a hundred years, which is probably not realistic, and three generations over 150 years. == See also == * List of Swedish monarchs * List of Norwegian monarchs * Jarl in Sweden * Bishop of Link√∂ping ==Sources== This article is fully or partially based on material from Nordisk familjebok (1908). ===Other sources=== *Lindkvist, Thomas with Maria Sj√∂berg (2006) Det svenska samh√§llet 800-1720.

He grew up in rural New South Wales during the Great Depression. At age nineteen Piper enrolled in the Australian Army, serving in the 2nd/2nd Australian Field Regiment in New Guinea from 1942 until 1946, he was discharged in November 1946. Following his war service he completed a Rehabilitation Training course and moved to Sydney. Piper illustrated comic strips including Catman and Kalar the Caveman for Frew Publications' comic book, Super Yank Comics. Catman was a feline-styled caped crusader who, unlike the original American version of the character, had no secret identity or powers. The other noticeable difference was that Catman's sidekick was changed from a young girl, Kitten, to a young boy, Kit. Catman ran for 19 issues, between 1951 and 1952. According to Jim Shepherd (the late publisher and managing director of Frew Publications), \\"[Frew co-founder], Ron Forsyth had an almost strange habit of changing things in the imported titles he published. He didn't like females having or sharing top billing, hence his request to replace Kitten with Kit ‚Äì but he probably also thought it might be some sort of plug for the young Phantom character, also known as Kit.\\" Piper also created Steel Barr for OPC's Hurricane in 1946 and Lemmy Loo as a filler strip for K.G Murray's Captain Triumph Comics (October 1949 ‚Äì February 1950). Steel Barr was resurrected by Young's Merchandising in 1950, under the title Steel Barr and The Phantom Man. Australian comic book researcher, Kevin Patrick, describes Steel Barr as being \\"a granite-jawed District Commissioner who patrolled the African jungles, battling myriad threats while searching for his elusive opponent, The Phantom Man.\\" Piper subsequently became an advertising layout artist, working in the advertising industry for the next twenty two years. He also taught Graphic Design part-time, from 1970 until 1983, at the National Art School. In October 1972 the Sunday Telegraph commissioned Piper to draw a comic strip, Wolfe, for which ran for six years before it was dropped in favour of a syndicated American superhero. Wolfe was a wandering adventurer. According to John Ryan, in his Australian Comic anthology, Panel by Panel, \\"Wolfe's strength was its strong story line and the fact Piper restricted his wanderings to Australia, giving readers an opportunity to identify with the various suburbs and country towns ‚Äì and it was these aspects that attracted a large following for the strip.\\" Following the death of Ron Vivian Piper was invited by Jimmy Bancks's family to take over the role of writing and illustrating Ginger Meggs, which was also published by the Sun Telegraph. Piper was the first of Bancks' successors permitted to sign his name to the strip. On 27 August 1977 the Ginger Meggs strip moved back to Sun Herald replacing long time rival comic strip, Fatty Finn. Piper claimed he kept as close as he could to the Bancks style with Ginger Meggs, and in an interview in 1983, stated \\"I have worked 30 years in advertising. I understand all the aspects of other peoples wants. I have striven to maintain Bancks' character, but admit that his sense of humour was so individual, his successors can hope for, but never really match it.\\" He also told friends it was \\"just a job\\", and that \\"they don't pay me much and they get what they pay for\\". ==Personal life== In 1953 Piper married Essie Gwendoline 'Gwen' Armstrong and they had one son, John William Piper (b. 1956).

Massai and a Tonkawa named Gray Lizard agreed to join Geronimo, who instructed them to lay in supplies of arms, food, and ammunition.Ball, pp. 249‚Äì252 Other sources state that Massai also served the United States government on two separate occasions, once in 1880 and the other in 1885, as an Apache Scout.Begay, pp. 89‚Äì90 Upon traveling to meet Geronimo's forces, the two were informed that Geronimo had been arrested. Both men were arrested by Chiricahua Apache Scouts and disarmed. Massai was placed onto a prison train as a prisoner of war along with Gray Lizard, who voluntarily agreedBegay, p. 90: As a Tonkawa, Gray Lizard was not compelled to join the Chiricahuan prisoners being deported. to accompany Massai, together with the remaining Chiricahua Apache who had either been captured or had surrendered to the army. This included the Apache Scouts, who were now deemed expendable and undesirable. Massai and Gray Lizard later escaped from the prison train near Saint Louis, Missouri. The two men walked some 1,200 miles back to the Mescalero Apache tribal area, crossing the Pecos River, and Capitan Gap. Near Sierra Blanca, New Mexico, the two men encountered a group of Mescalero Apache. Several days later, the two parted at Three Rivers, never to see each other again. Gray Lizard departed for Mescal Mountain and the San Carlos Indian Reservation near present-day Globe, Arizona, while Massai stayed on the run, raiding along what is today the New Mexico-Arizona border, and periodically taking refuge across the border in Mexico. His name appeared in San Carlos Agency reports from 1887 to 1890.Begay, p. 94 He later kidnapped and married (c.1887) a Mescalero Apache girl named Zan-a-go-li-che and took her home to his family at Mescal Mountain. Massai and Zanagoliche had six children together.Begay, pp. 96‚Äì97 Massai's later life and death are the subject of some dispute. One account states that in 1906, Massai, after contracting tuberculosis, took his wife and their children back to their home with the Mescaleros in New Mexico. Along the way he was killed by a posse, west of the town of San Marcial, New Mexico, between Socorro and Hot Springs, though no evidence of Massai's death was ever produced.Ball, pp. 257‚Äì258Begay, pp. 101‚Äì102 Some believed the Apache Kid was actually the man who died that day so the area was later named the Apache Kid Wilderness.Soldiers vs. Apaches: One Last Time at Guadalupe Canyon Another account states that Massai escaped over the border to Mexico, eventually settling in the Sierra Madre mountains with a group of rebellious Chiricahuas who had refused to surrender with Geronimo. Massai was portrayed by Burt Lancaster in the 1954 film Apache. ==Literature== * Massai: The Last Apache Outlaw, by Grady McCright, iUniverse (June 10, 2008), .

They were eventually acquired by Namco (who then made the arcade version in 1999) to create karaoke machines. In 2001, they resurfaced with a web-based subscription product named Music Playground, allowing the user to purchase the instrument tracks for already-owned audio CDs and play along with them. The service failed to attract a sufficient number of users and was finally shut down in August 2003. ==The game== Quest for Fame is a simulation adventure game where the player becomes a rock guitarist, working his way up from lonesome bedroom rehearsals to becoming a garage band member, playing clubs and ultimately becoming a rock legend. The game is based on tunes by Aerosmith and is played by a special device called \\"V-Pick\\" that's included in the box. The device is connected to the PC via the parallel port. It contains simple vibration sensing electronics so that the player can simulate playing a guitar by strumming it along a tennis racket, a baseball bat or just the thigh. Virtual Music also sold a more realistic virtual guitar device that could be connected to the computer's serial port. Additional buttons permitted adjusting the player's guitar volume and feedback effects in the game. Instead of being equipped with full strings, there was only a small part of the guitar with exposed nylon strings or one metal string on the body. The game contains cartoon-ized artwork consisting of drawn backgrounds with embedded video sequences played by actors. The game includes a helpful display called the \\"Rhythm EKG\\" (short \\"REKG\\"), indicating the guitar activity of the currently playing song in the upper half and the player's input in the lower half. If the EKG peaks of both categories are closely matching, the player is playing well. The rhythm and lead guitar tracks vary in difficulty as the game progresses. ==More information== Quest for Fame was the successor to pretty similar earlier games called Born To Rock and Welcome To West Feedback (bundled with the Virtual Guitar). These games included a variety of music instead of primarily Aerosmith tunes. A very limited game engine was included on a CD-ROM track on Aerosmith's Nine Lives, but it also included drum tracks for the first time in a Virtual Music title. A virtual drumpad input device called \\"V-Stix\\" was introduced by the company with the Nine Lives game engine.

Hussain detonated a bomb on the No. 30 bus that exploded in Tavistock Square, killing 13 of the 52 people killed in the suicide bombings, and himself. Investigators found his body and personal effects on the bus. At the age of 18, he was the youngest of the group of four. The other men were Shehzad Tanweer, Germaine Lindsay, and Mohammad Sidique Khan. == Biography == Hussain was born in Leeds General Infirmary and raised in Holbeck, West Yorkshire, Leeds, England, the youngest of four children. His father, Mahmood, of Pakistani origin, worked in a factory, while his mother, Maniza, was an interpreter for British Pakistani families at Leeds General Infirmary. At the time of the bombing, Hussain was living with his brother Imran and sister-in-law Shazia. Hussain received his primary education at Ingram Road Primary School, Holbeck. In September 1998, he began his secondary education at South Leeds High School ‚Äî formerly the Matthew Murray High School. Maintaining a good attendance record, he received GCSEs in English language, English literature, maths, science, Urdu, and design technology and a GNVQ in business studies in 2003. Hussain went on to attend Thomas Danby College in Leeds, earning a Vocational Certificate of Education (AVCE) in business the same year as the attacks. He was a member of the Holbeck Hornets football team and the local cricket team. When he left Matthew Murray High School, teachers who knew him described him as \\"a slow gentle giant\\" who \\"did not spread leaflets of hate-mail\\". In the latter half of 2003, Hussain met Mohammed Sidique Khan and Shehzad Tanweer. The three frequented the Stratford Street mosque in Beeston, and were also intimately associated with the Hamara Youth Access Point, a drop-in centre for teens. Hussain was cautioned by police for shoplifting in 2004. == London bombings == There were media reports that Hussain had travelled to Pakistan in February 2004, but these appear to be a case of mistaken identity. In mid-June 2005, Magdi Asdi el-Nashar, an Egyptian lecturer at the University of Leeds, rented a flat from Dr. Adnan Shukir. Hussain played the role of el-Nashar's purportedly foreign friend. Sources differ, but either Hussain's brother or the police examined Hussain's mobile phone, which had Dr. Shukir's number in its memory. Police raided the flat, finding kilos of explosives and other evidence of a bomb-making operation. Before Hussain went to London with Khan and Tanweer, all three men had travelled to 18 Alexandra Grove, Hyde Park, Leeds where the homemade explosive devices were assembled. The bombs were placed into a refrigerated box to maintain stability overnight. In the morning they travelled south towards Luton railway station, where they joined Germaine Lindsay, the fourth bomber, at around 7:20 am. They then made the trip towards King's Cross station. On the day of the attacks, Hussain is believed to have intended to take the Northern line train. However, it was temporarily suspended on 7 July and so Hussain left the London Underground system. He was captured on CCTV in a Boots store on the concourse of King's Cross after the other bombs had gone off. Mobile phone records indicate that he had tried to telephone the other bombers. About 50 minutes after the other bombs had detonated, Hussain appears to have boarded the number 30 bus, his bomb exploding shortly thereafter: driving licence and credit cards were found in the wreckage of the bus in Tavistock Square. Hussain's parents contacted the Scotland Yard emergency helpline at about 10:20 pm on 7 July to report that their son had been travelling to London with three friends and had not been heard from since. Hussain's body was buried in a Muslim cemetery in Leeds on 2 November 2005. ==See also== *Shehzad Tanweer, Aldgate train *Germaine Lindsay, Piccadilly line train *Mohammad Sidique Khan, Edgware Road train == References  Further reading == *Profile of Hasib Hussain Category:1986 births Category:2005 deaths Category:English Islamists Category:English people of Pakistani descent Category:People from Holbeck Category:Perpetrators of the July 2005 London bombings Category:People educated at Cockburn John Charles Academy Category:Male suicides Category:Criminals from Yorkshire Category:21st-century British criminals Category:English mass murderers Category:Murderers who committed suicide ","title":"Hasib Hussain"},{"id":"2224602","text":"James Lawrence Kemsley OAM (15 November 1948 - 3 December 2007) was an Australian cartoonist who was notable for producing the comic strip Ginger Meggs (originally created by Jimmy Bancks) between 1984 and 2007. ==Early life== James Kemsley was born in the Sydney suburb of Paddington, but lived for a few years with his parents and sister in New Guinea where his father served as mastor of patrol boats. He then attended the Roman Catholic boarding schools, Our Lady of the Sacred Heart College (1958‚Äì60) and Chevalier College (1961‚Äì62), both located in Bowral, New South Wales. He also attended the Christian Brothers College at Rose Bay (1962‚Äì63). Afterwards he lived for a while with his father in Traralgon, Victoria.Allen, Peter (2007) Jack of all trades, mast of Meggs, James Kemsley, 1948-2007 (Obituary) ==Early TV and acting career== Kemsley attended the Independent School of Dramatic Art, North Sydney (1968‚Äì71) as well as a National Institute of Dramatic Art Playwright Forum in 1973 and a RADA Professional Workshop in London in 1979. Kemsley's background was in acting and television. In the late 1960s and early 1970s, Kemsley was known to television audiences as \\"Skeeter the Paperboy\\", an on- screen cap-wearing persona (who once said his full name was Amos Skeeter - a play on \\"a mosquito\\") that he portrayed as a cast member of The Super Flying Fun Show, and then as host of Skeeter's Cartoon Corner in Sydney and Melbourne, both on the Nine Network. The daily afternoon program offered a mix of US-based cartoons (such as Wacky Races, Scooby-Doo and The Archies), with viewer competitions. One of his tag lines on the telephone with viewer contestants who were unsuccessful was \\"golly gosh\\". When Kemsley left in 1973, Daryl Somers took over the time slot. In 1973 Kemsley compered a variety program on the Nine Network titled Junior Cabaret. He also appeared in the ABC TV mini-series The Cousin From Fiji and Seven Little Australians. Kemsley studied acting at the Independent Theatre of Dramatic Art from 1969‚Äì1972 under Doris Fitton and attended the Playwright Forum at the National Institute of Dramatic Art (NIDA) in 1973 under the directorship of David Whittaker.

Kemsley left Channel Nine and then studied in England at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Arts (RADA) in 1979. ==Cartoonist== In 1984 Kemsley was invited to take over the syndicated comic strip, Ginger Meggs, and several comic books featuring the character have since been published. He has also contributed to The Traralgon Journal, Adelaide's Sunday Mail, Sydney's The Sun-Herald, The Sydney Morning Herald and The Daily Telegraph. Kemsley twice served as President of the Australian Cartoonists' Association. Awards include the 2001 Stanley Award for Cartoonist of the Year, presented by the Australian Cartoonist's Association. In 1990 & 2004, Kemsley received the Stanley for Comic Strip Artist, as voted by his peers. Under Kemsley's pen and Atlantic Syndication's marketing, \\"Ginger Meggs\\" now appears in newspapers in over 120 newspaper in 30 countries.

Khan bombed the Edgware Road train killing himself and six other people. On 1 September 2005, a videotape emerged featuring Khan. The videotape, shown by Al Jazeera Television, also shows Ayman al-Zawahiri, who is the highest leader of al- Qaeda. The two men do not appear together, and the British government says that al-Qaeda was not connected with the bombing. The Home Office believes the tape was edited after the suicide attacks and dismisses it as evidence of al- Qaeda's involvement. In the film, Khan declares, \\"I and thousands like me have forsaken everything for what we believe\\" and refers to his expectation that the media would already have painted a picture of him in accordance with government \\"spin\\". He goes on to say, \\"Your democratically elected governments continually perpetrate atrocities against my people all over the world. Your support makes you directly responsible. We are at war and I am a soldier. Now you too will taste the reality of this situation.\\" == Biography == Born in St James's University Hospital, Leeds, Khan grew up in Beeston but moved to Lees Holm in Dewsbury, near Leeds in early 2005. His father, Tika Khan, a foundry worker, was born in Pakistan. His mother is Mamida Begum. He received his secondary education at South Leeds High School, formerly the Matthew Murray High School, which was also attended by Hasib Hussain, 7 July bus bomber. After completing his secondary education, he attended Leeds Metropolitan University to complete a degree in business. It was during this time that he met his wife Hasina Patel, and first became interested in extremist Islam. Khan had a daughter. https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-12621381 In 1999 he came under the influence of radical cleric Abdullah el-Faisal. Khan worked at Hillside Primary School in Leeds as a \\"learning mentor\\" with the children of immigrant families who had just arrived in Britain. Khan's colleagues commented that he was a quiet individual who did not talk about his religious or political beliefs. Khan was also involved in the community-run Hamara Healthy Living Centre in Beeston, and worked at its youth outreach project, the Hamara Youth Access Point (HYAP). Staff at the centre have confirmed that two of the London bombers, Shehzad Tanweer and Hasib Hussain, frequented the HYAP. Khan used the outreach project as a recruitment centre, according to a friend of his who spoke to The Guardian. His mother-in-law, Farida Patel, is also involved in education and works as a council liaison officer at a school in Dewsbury. In 1998 she was the first Asian woman to be invited to a Buckingham Palace garden party, meeting the Queen and other members of the royal family, in recognition for her work amongst the Muslim community in Dewsbury, and again in 2004. She was said to have been \\"devastated\\" by the actions of her son-in-law. Mohammad Sidique Khan reportedly postponed the event from 6 July 2005 because he had to take his pregnant wife to the hospital.https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/london-bombs-were- meant-for-a-different-day-ndash-and-different-locations-2103979.html == London bombings == On the morning of 7 July 2005, Khan travelled by car with his three accomplices to Luton in Bedfordshire, where the four men caught a train to London King's Cross railway station. From there, Khan entered the London Underground and boarded a Circle Line train heading west, travelling four stops to Edgware Road. The bomb detonated at 8.50 a.m., just as the train was pulling out of Edgware Road station, killing six British victims.https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-33259919 Personal documents of Khan's were found on the train. ==Intelligence assessments== Khan is alleged to have travelled regularly to Dubai to attend military training camps, and is also believed to have spent time in Israel. In 2001 Khan was alleged to have learned bomb-making at the Malakand training camp. He is also alleged to have trained with Indonesian terror group Jemaah Islamiyah and to be directly involved with the 2002 Bali bombing. According to the Israeli newspaper Maariv, Khan travelled to Israel on 19 February 2003, staying only one night and leaving the next day. Maariv reports that he was suspected of having helped to plan the 30 April 2003 suicide bombing of the Mike's Place bar in Tel Aviv which killed three Israelis, carried out by two British citizens of Pakistani descent. The Israeli government allegedly played down the report. According to Ron Suskind's The One Percent Doctrine, the NSA had been monitoring phone calls and emails between Khan and several Islamic radicals from the United States and England, including Ahmed Omar Abu Ali. Just prior to Khan's planned trip to the US, NSA intercepted email exchanges between him and some of his associates discussing a desire to \\"blow up synagogues on the East Coast\\". According to Suskind, the CIA wanted to let Khan into the US so that the FBI could put him under surveillance, but the FBI resisted on grounds that, as one FBI case agent stated, \\"We just can't take the risk ... he goes up and blows up a temple in Washington.\\" US government officials put Khan on a no-fly list to prevent him from entering the country. Suskind was critical of the decision, which the author suggested tipped him off to the fact that he was known to US authorities and might have caused him to be more cautious with his communication to avoid further surveillance. British intelligence sources and circumstantial evidence suggested that this theory may have resulted from a confusion between two different Mohammed Khans, although it seems that Suskind stood by his claim. According to David Leppard in The Sunday Times, Khan was assessed by MI5 in 2004, after his name appeared during an investigation into a plan to detonate a 600-lb truck bomb in London. MI5 concluded that Khan's link to the plotters was indirect, and he was not placed under surveillance. MI5 was later criticised for failing to follow up leads relating to Khan. The service responded to the criticisms. Channel 4 News published what it said were excerpts from the transcript of the tape. US intelligence officials have said that Khan was known to Mohammed Junaid Babar, who has pleaded guilty in the US to providing material support to al-Qaeda. Babar, who told investigators that he worked on a plan to blow up pubs, railway stations, and restaurants in the UK, identified Khan as someone he had met in Pakistan. On 18 July 2005, the Pakistani government released video footage of Khan arriving at Dubai airport on 19 November 2004 with Shehzad Tanweer, another of the London bombers. Khan and Tanweer stayed in Pakistan until 8 February 2005, then flew back to London together. A third member of the London group, 18-year-old Hasib Hussain, arrived in Karachi on 15 July 2004 from Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, on flight SV714. ==See also== *Shehzad Tanweer, Aldgate train *Hasib Hussain, No. 30 bus *Germaine Lindsay, Russell Square train *Dubai ==Notes *London bombers tied to Al Qaeda plot in Pakistan, by Brian Ross, ABC News, 14 July 2005 *\\"Mentor to the young and vulnerable\\", by Sandra Laville and Dilpazier Aslam, The Guardian, 14 July 2005 *\\"London bomber video aired on TV\\", BBC News, last updated 2 September 2005, 8:29 GMT ( with a short excerpt from the video ) *Full text of the segment of the tape shown on Al-Jazeera, not necessarily the full text of the entire tape.

Maalouf studied at the Conservatoire de Paris with the great French trumpeter Maurice Andr√©, graduating in 1970. While he had by that time mastered the European classical trumpet repertoire he had for some time felt restricted by being able to play only in the major and minor scales. Although he wished to interpret the numerous Arabic modes (known as maqamat, singular maqam) on his instrument, he nevertheless found this quite difficult, as the necessary \\"half-sharps\\" and \\"half-flats\\" could only be obtained via the unreliable method of modulating lip pressure. Finally, Maalouf realized that adding to his trumpet a fourth valve half the length of the second valve would allow for the production of quarter tones. Maalouf worked for two years with the craftsman Michel Wikrikaz of the Henri Selmer company in Paris to produce his design of a \\"quarter-tone\\" trumpet and flugelhorn, both suitable for performing Arabic maqamat throughout the full chromatic range of the instrument. Maalouf uses his right hand to play the first three valves and the index finger of his left hand to depress the fourth valve. Maalouf's quarter-tone trumpet was not the first such instrument, however; the American jazz trumpeter Don Ellis and others had earlier created similar instruments. In addition to his career as trumpet soloist, Maalouf has also taught at the National Conservatory in Beirut.

It consists of a set of words written out in a square grid, such that the same words can be read both horizontally and vertically. The number of words, which is equal to the number of letters in each word, is known as the \\"order\\" of the square. For example, this is an order 5 square: { style=\\"font-family: monospace; margin: 0 0 0 0; line-height:90%\\" style=\\"padding-left: 2em;\\"H E A R T - style=\\"padding-left: 2em;\\"E M B E R - style=\\"padding-left: 2em;\\"A B U S E - style=\\"padding-left: 2em;\\"R E S I N - style=\\"padding-left: 2em;\\"T R E N D } A popular puzzle dating well into ancient times, the word square is sometimes compared to the magic square, though apart from the fact that both use square grids there is no real connection between the two. ==Early history== Sator Square in Corinium (Cirencester), England ===Sator Square=== The Sator Square is a famous word square in Latin. Its canonical form reads as follows. { style=\\"font-family: monospace; margin: 0 0 0 0; line-height:90%\\" style=\\"padding-left: 2em;\\"S A T O R - style=\\"padding-left: 2em;\\"A R E P O - style=\\"padding-left: 2em;\\"T E N E T - style=\\"padding-left: 2em;\\"O P E R A - style=\\"padding-left: 2em;\\"R O T A S } In addition to satisfying the basic properties of word squares, the Sator Square spread widely due to several other attributes: it is palindromic; it can be read as a sentence of obscure meaning; and additional meaning such as reference to the Christian Paternoster prayer can be derived from its letters. However, the word \\"Arepo\\" appears nowhere else in Latin literature; most of those who have studied the Sator Square agree that it is to be taken as a proper name, either an adaptation of a non-Latin word or, more likely, a name invented specifically for this sentence. Thus the square consists of a palindrome (\\"tenet\\"), a reversal (\\"sator\\" and \\"rotas\\"), and a word (\\"opera\\") which can be reversed into a passably coined name (\\"Arepo\\"). ===Abramelin the Mage=== If the \\"words\\" in a word square need not be true words, arbitrarily large squares of pronounceable combinations can be constructed. The following 12√ó12 array of letters appears in a Hebrew manuscript of The Book of the Sacred Magic of Abramelin the Mage of 1458, said to have been \\"given by God, and bequeathed by Abraham\\". An English edition appeared in 1898. This is square 7 of Chapter IX of the Third Book, which is full of incomplete and complete \\"squares\\". { style=\\"font-family: monospace; margin: 0 0 0 0; line-height:90%\\" style=\\"padding-left: 2em;\\"I S I C H A D A M I O N - style=\\"padding-left: 2em;\\"S E R R A R E P I N T O - style=\\"padding-left: 2em;\\"I R A A S I M E L E I S - style=\\"padding-left: 2em;\\"C R A T I B A R I N S I - style=\\"padding-left: 2em;\\"H A S I N A S U O T I R -\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ style=\\"padding-left: 2em;\\"A R I B A T I N T I R A - style=\\"padding-left: 2em;\\"D E M A S I C O A N O C - style=\\"padding-left: 2em;\\"A P E R U N O I B E M I - style=\\"padding-left: 2em;\\"M I L I O T A B U L E L - style=\\"padding-left: 2em;\\"I N E N T I N E L E L A - style=\\"padding-left: 2em;\\"O T I S I R O M E L I R - style=\\"padding-left: 2em;\\"N O S I R A C I L A R I - } No source or explanation is given for any of the \\"words\\", so this square does not meet the modern standards for legitimate word squares. Modern research indicates that a 12-square would be essentially impossible to construct from indexed words and phrases, even using a large number of languages. However, equally large English-language squares consisting of arbitrary phrases containing dictionary words are relatively easy to construct; they too are not considered true word squares, but they have been published in The Enigma and other puzzle magazines as \\"Something Different\\" squares. ==Modern English squares== A specimen of the order-six square (or 6-square) was first published in English in 1859; the 7-square in 1877; the 8-square in 1884; and the 9-square in 1897. Here are examples of English word squares up to order eight: { style=\\"font-family: monospace; margin: 0 0 0 0; line-height:90%; white-space: nowrap;\\" - style=\\"padding- left: 2em;\\"A style=\\"padding-left: 1em;\\"N O style=\\"padding-left: 1em;\\"B I T style=\\"padding-left: 1em;\\"C A R D style=\\"padding-left: 1em;\\"H E A R T style=\\"padding-left: 1em;\\"G A R T E R style=\\"padding-left: 1em;\\"B R A V A D O style=\\"padding-left: 1em;\\"L A T E R A L S - style=\\"padding-left: 2em;\\" style=\\"padding-left: 1em;\\"O N style=\\"padding-left: 1em;\\"I C E style=\\"padding-left: 1em;\\"A R E A style=\\"padding-left: 1em;\\"E M B E R style=\\"padding-left: 1em;\\"A V E R S E style=\\"padding-left: 1em;\\"R E N A M E D style=\\"padding-left: 1em;\\"A X O N E M A L - style=\\"padding-left: 2em;\\" style=\\"padding-left: 1em;\\" style=\\"padding-left: 1em;\\"T E N style=\\"padding-left: 1em;\\"R E A R style=\\"padding-left: 1em;\\"A B U S E style=\\"padding-left: 1em;\\"R E C I T E style=\\"padding-left: 1em;\\"A N A L O G Y style=\\"padding-left: 1em;\\"T O E P L A T E - style=\\"padding-left: 2em;\\" style=\\"padding-left: 1em;\\" style=\\"padding-left: 1em;\\" style=\\"padding-left: 1em;\\"D A R T style=\\"padding-left: 1em;\\"R E S I N style=\\"padding-left: 1em;\\"T R I B A L style=\\"padding-left: 1em;\\"V A L U E R S style=\\"padding-left: 1em;\\"E N P L A N E D - style=\\"padding-left: 2em;\\" style=\\"padding-left: 1em;\\" style=\\"padding-left: 1em;\\" style=\\"padding-left: 1em;\\" style=\\"padding-left: 1em;\\"T R E N D style=\\"padding-left: 1em;\\"E S T A T E style=\\"padding-left: 1em;\\"A M O E B A S style=\\"padding-left: 1em;\\"R E L A N D E D - style=\\"padding-left: 2em;\\" style=\\"padding-left: 1em;\\" style=\\"padding-left: 1em;\\" style=\\"padding-left: 1em;\\" style=\\"padding-left: 1em;\\" style=\\"padding- left: 1em;\\"R E E L E D style=\\"padding-left: 1em;\\"D E G R A D E style=\\"padding-left: 1em;\\"A M A N D I N E - style=\\"padding-left: 2em;\\" style=\\"padding-left: 1em;\\" style=\\"padding-left: 1em;\\" style=\\"padding- left: 1em;\\" style=\\"padding-left: 1em;\\" style=\\"padding-left: 1em;\\" style=\\"padding-left: 1em;\\"O D Y S S E Y style=\\"padding-left: 1em;\\"L A T E E N E R - style=\\"padding-left: 2em;\\" style=\\"padding-left: 1em;\\" style=\\"padding-left: 1em;\\" style=\\"padding-left: 1em;\\" style=\\"padding- left: 1em;\\" style=\\"padding-left: 1em;\\" style=\\"padding-left: 1em;\\" style=\\"padding-left: 1em;\\"S L E D D E R S - } The following is one of several \\"perfect\\" nine-squares (all words in major dictionaries, uncapitalized, and unpunctuated): { style=\\"font-family: monospace; margin: 0 0 0 0; line-height:90%\\" style=\\"padding-left: 2em;\\"A C H A L A S I A - style=\\"padding-left: 2em;\\"C R E N I D E N S - style=\\"padding-left: 2em;\\"H E X A N D R I C - style=\\"padding-left: 2em;\\"A N A B O L I T E - style=\\"padding-left: 2em;\\"L I N O L E N I N - style=\\"padding-left: 2em;\\"A D D L E H E A D - style=\\"padding-left: 2em;\\"S E R I N E T T E - style=\\"padding-left: 2em;\\"I N I T I A T O R - style=\\"padding-left: 2em;\\"A S C E N D E R S } ===Order 10 squares=== A 10-square is naturally much harder to find, and a \\"perfect\\" 10-square has been hunted since 1897. It has been called the Holy Grail of logology. Various methods have produced partial results to the 10-square problem: ;Tautonyms Since 1921, 10-squares have been constructed from reduplicated words and phrases like \\"Alala! Alala!\\" (a reduplicated Greek interjection). Each such square contains five words appearing twice, which in effect constitutes four identical 5-squares. Darryl Francis and Dmitri Borgmann succeeded in using near-tautonyms (second- and third-order reduplication) to employ seven different entries by pairing \\"orangutang\\" with \\"urangutang\\" and \\"ranga-ranga\\" with \\"tanga-tanga\\", as follows: { style=\\"font-family: monospace; margin: 0 0 0 0; line-height:90%\\" style=\\"padding-left: 2em;\\"O R A N G U T A N G - style=\\"padding-left: 2em;\\"R A N G A R A N G A - style=\\"padding-left: 2em;\\"A N D O L A N D O L - style=\\"padding-left: 2em;\\"N G O T A N G O T A - style=\\"padding-left: 2em;\\"G A L A N G A L A N - style=\\"padding-left: 2em;\\"U R A N G U T A N G - style=\\"padding-left: 2em;\\"T A N G A T A N G A - style=\\"padding-left: 2em;\\"A N D O L A N D O L - style=\\"padding-left: 2em;\\"N G O T A N G O T A - style=\\"padding-left: 2em;\\"G A L A N G A L A N } However, \\"word researchers have always regarded the tautonymic ten-square as an unsatisfactory solution to the problem.\\" ;80% solution In 1976, Frank Rubin produced an incomplete ten-square containing two nonsense phrases at the top and eight dictionary words. If two words could be found containing the patterns \\"SCENOOTL\\" and \\"HYETNNHY\\", this would become a complete ten-square. ;Constructed vocabulary From the 1970s, Jeff Grant had a long history of producing well-built squares; concentrating on the ten-square from 1982 to 1985, he produced the first three traditional ten-squares by relying on reasonable coinages such as \\"Sol Springs\\" (various extant people named Sol Spring) and \\"ses tunnels\\" (French for \\"its tunnels\\"). His continuing work produced one of the best of this genre, making use of \\"impolarity\\" (found on the Internet) and the plural of \\"Tony Nader\\" (found in the white pages), as well as words verified in more traditional references: { style=\\"font-family: monospace; margin: 0 0 0 0; line-height:90%\\" style=\\"padding-left: 2em;\\"D I S T A L I S E D - style=\\"padding-left: 2em;\\"I M P O L A R I T Y - style=\\"padding-left: 2em;\\"S P I N A C I N E S - style=\\"padding-left: 2em;\\"T O N Y N A D E R S - style=\\"padding-left: 2em;\\"A L A N B R O W N E - style=\\"padding-left: 2em;\\"L A C A R O L I N A - style=\\"padding-left: 2em;\\"I R I D O L I N E S - style=\\"padding-left: 2em;\\"S I N E W I N E S S - style=\\"padding-left: 2em;\\"E T E R N N E S S E - style=\\"padding-left: 2em;\\"D Y S S E A S S E S } ;Personal names By combining common first and last names and verifying the results in white-pages listings, Steve Root of Westboro, Massachusetts, was able to document the existence of all ten names below (total number of people found is listed after each line): { style=\\"font-family: monospace; margin: 0 0 0 0; line-height:90%\\" style=\\"padding-left: 2em;\\"L E O W A D D E L L 1 - style=\\"padding-left: 2em;\\"E M M A N E E L E Y 1 - style=\\"padding-left: 2em;\\"O M A R G A L V A N 5 - style=\\"padding-left: 2em;\\"W A R R E N L I N D 9 - style=\\"padding- left: 2em;\\"A N G E L H A N N A 2 - style=\\"padding-left: 2em;\\"D E A N H O P P E R 10+ - style=\\"padding-left: 2em;\\"D E L L A P O O L E 3 - style=\\"padding-left: 2em;\\"E L V I N P O O L E 3 - style=\\"padding-left: 2em;\\"L E A N N E L L I S 3 - style=\\"padding-left: 2em;\\"L Y N D A R E E S E 5 } ;Geographic names Around 2000, Rex Gooch of Letchworth, England, analyzed available wordlists and computing requirements and compiled one or two hundred specialized dictionaries and indexes to provide a reasonably strong vocabulary. The largest source was the United States Board on Geographic Names National Imagery and Mapping Agency. In Word Ways in August and November 2002, he published several squares found in this wordlist. The square below has been held by some word square experts as essentially solving the 10-square problem (Daily Mail, The Times), while others anticipate higher-quality 10-squares in the future. { style=\\"font-family: monospace; margin: 0 0 0 0; line- height:90%\\" style=\\"padding-left: 2em;\\"D E S C E N D A N T - style=\\"padding-left: 2em;\\"E C H E N E I D A E - style=\\"padding-left: 2em;\\"S H O R T C O A T S - style=\\"padding-left: 2em;\\"C E R B E R U L U S - style=\\"padding-left: 2em;\\"E N T E R O M E R E - style=\\"padding-left: 2em;\\"N E C R O L A T E R - style=\\"padding-left: 2em;\\"D I O U M A B A N A - style=\\"padding-left: 2em;\\"A D A L E T A B A T - style=\\"padding-left: 2em;\\"N A T U R E N A M E - style=\\"padding-left: 2em;\\"T E S S E R A T E D } There are a few \\"imperfections\\": \\"Echeneidae\\" is capitalized, \\"Dioumabana\\" and \\"Adaletabat\\" are places (in Guinea and Turkey respectively), and \\"nature- name\\" is hyphenated. Many new large word squares and new species have arisen recently. However, modern combinatorics has demonstrated why the 10-square has taken so long to find, and why 11-squares are extremely unlikely to be constructible using English words (even including transliterated place names). However, 11-squares are possible if words from a number of languages are allowed (Word Ways, August 2004 and May 2005). ==Vocabulary== It is possible to estimate the degree of difficulty of constructing word squares. 5-squares can be constructed with as little as a 250-word vocabulary. Roughly, for each step upwards, one needs four times the number of words. For a 9-square, one needs over 60,000 9-letter words, which is practically all of those in single very large dictionaries. For large squares, the vocabulary prevents selecting more \\"desirable\\" words (i.e. words that are unhyphenated, in common use, without contrived inflections, and uncapitalized), and any resulting word squares use exotic words. The opposite problem occurs with small squares: a computer search will produce millions of examples, most of which use at least one obscure word. In such cases finding a word square with \\"desirable\\" (as described above) words is performed by elimination of the more exotic words or by using a smaller dictionary with only common words. Smaller word squares, used for amusement, are expected to have simple solutions, especially if set as a task for children; but vocabulary in most eight-squares tests the knowledge of an educated adult. ==Variant formsDouble word squares=== Word squares that form different words across and down are known as \\"double word squares\\". Examples are: { style=\\"font-family: monospace; margin: 0 0 0 0; line-height:120%; white-space: nowrap\\" - valign = \\"top\\" style=\\"padding- left: 2em\\"T O O U R N B E E style=\\"padding-left: 2em\\"L A C K I R O N M E R E B A K E style=\\"padding-left: 2em\\"S C E N T C A N O E A R S O N R O U S E F L E E T style=\\"padding-left: 2em\\"A D M I T S D E A D E N S E R E N E O P I A T E R E N T E R B R E E D S } The rows and columns of any double word square can be transposed to form another valid square. For example, the order 4 square above may also be written as: { style=\\"font-family: monospace; margin: 0 0 0 0; line-height:120%; white-space: nowrap\\" - valign = \\"top\\" style=\\"padding-left: 2em;\\"L I M B A R E A C O R K K N E E } Double word squares are somewhat more difficult to find than ordinary word squares, with the largest known fully legitimate English examples (dictionary words only) being of order 8. Puzzlers.org gives an order 8 example dating from 1953, but this contains six place names. Jeff Grant's example in the February 1992 Word Ways is an improvement, having just two proper nouns (\\"Aloisias\\", a plural of the personal name Aloisia, a feminine form of Aloysius, and \\"Thamnata\\", a Biblical place-name): { style=\\"font- family: monospace; margin: 0 0 0 0; line-height:90%; white-space: nowrap\\" style=\\"padding-left: 2em;\\"T R A T T L E D - style=\\"padding-left: 2em;\\"H E M E R I N E - style=\\"padding-left: 2em;\\"A P O T O M E S - style=\\"padding- left: 2em;\\"M E T A P O R E - style=\\"padding-left: 2em;\\"N A I L I N G S - style=\\"padding-left: 2em;\\"A L O I S I A S - style=\\"padding-left: 2em;\\"T E N T M A T E - style=\\"padding-left: 2em;\\"A S S E S S E D } ===Diagonal word squares=== Diagonal word squares are word squares in which the main diagonals are also words. There are four diagonals: top-left to bottom-right, bottom- right to top-left, top-right to bottom-left, and bottom-left to top-right. In a Single Diagonal Square (same words reading across and down), these last two will need to be identical and palindromic because of symmetry. The 8-square is the largest found with all diagonals: 9-squares exist with some diagonals. This is an example of a diagonal double square of order 4: { style=\\"font- family: monospace; margin: 0 0 0 0; line-height:120%\\" - valign = \\"top\\" style=\\"padding-left: 2em;\\"B A R N A R E A L I A R L A D Y } ===Word rectangles=== Word rectangles are based on the same idea as double word squares, but the horizontal and vertical words are of a different length. Here are 4√ó8 and 5√ó7 examples: { style=\\"font-family: monospace; margin: 0 0 0 0; line-height:120%\\" - valign = \\"top\\" style=\\"padding-left: 2em;\\"F R A C T U R E O U T L I N E D B L O O M I N G S E P T E T T E style=\\"padding-left: 2em;\\"G L A S S E S R E L A P S E I M I T A T E S M E A R E D T A N N E R Y } Again, the rows and columns can be transposed to form another valid rectangle. For example, a 4√ó8 rectangle can also be written as an 8√ó4 rectangle. ===Other forms=== Numerous other shapes have been employed for word-packing under essentially similar rules.

Davidovo cemetery (Guslitsa), Moscow region Te Deum. Russian Orthodox Old-Rite Church. Elizarovo (Guslitsa), Moscow region, May 2008 The Russian Orthodox Old-Rite Church (or Russian Orthodox Oldritualist Church, Russian Orthodox Old-Ritualist Church) () is an Eastern Orthodox Church of the Old Believers tradition, which rejected the liturgical and canonical reforms of Patriarch Nikon in the second half of 17th century (Old Believers). It is one of the two Old Believers churches that belong to the Belokrinitskaya Hierarchy - together with the Orthodox Old-Rite Church, sometimes also called Lipovan Orthodox Old-Rite Church. Since the 18th century until the Council of 1988, the official self-designation of this Church was the Old Orthodox Church of Christ (–î—Ä–µ–≤–ª–µ–ø—Ä–∞–≤–æ—Å–ª–∞–≤–Ω–∞—è –¶–µ—Ä–∫–æ–≤—å –•—Ä–∏—Å—Ç–æ–≤–∞) which should not be confused with Russian Old-Orthodox Church, another church of the Old Believers. Drevlepravoslavie (\\"Old/Ancient Orthodoxy\\") was the common self-designation of the Old Believers and their cause since the 17th century. The head of the Church carries the title of Metropolitan of Moscow and all Russia (since 1988), with residence at the Rogozhskoye cemetery in Moscow. The current head of the Church, Metropolitan Korniliy (Titov) (formerly, the archbishop of Kazan and Vyatka) was elected by the Most Holy Council on October 18, 2005. He was installed as Metropolitan on October 23, 2005. == History (Belokrinitskaya Hierarchy in Russia, end of 19th century‚Äìpresent) == The conversion of Met. Amvrosii caused a bitter reaction of Russian Imperial authorities and he was soon pressed to leave his see, but not before he consecrated another bishop for his new Church - archbishop Kiril (Timofeev). The activity of the Belokrinitskaya Hierarchy on the territory of the Russian Empire met with numerous obstructions from Russian imperial authorities, as well as with an internal schism (see Okruzhniki, Neokruzhniki). The situation was radically changed with the publication in 1905 of the Emperor's Ukaz \\"On Religious Tolerance\\", soon followed by the \\"unsealing\\" of the altars at the important religious and cultural center of Old Believers, the Rogozhskoye cemetery. After the coming of the Bolsheviks to power in 1917 and the Civil war, the Old-Rite Church was subjected to innumerable sufferings and persecutions, just as its former rival, the \\"Nikonian\\" Russian Orthodox Church. In 1940, the only bishop who was not imprisoned by the Soviet atheistic authorities was Bishop Sava of Kaluga who, in the same year, single-handedly elevated another bishop - Irinarch - to the see of the Archbishop of Moscow. The period of persecution was followed by the period of relative stability, under a tight control from the Soviet secret services. However, the time of perestroika and subsequent changes in the country's political, cultural and economic life had a little effect on the position of the Old-Rite Church in the Russian society - the 17-year tenure of Metropolitan Alimpiy (Gusev) is by some considered a time of \\"recollection\\". His follower, Metropolitan Andrian (Chetvergov) in the February 2004, showed himself as a charismatic and talented leader, concerned with formulating and propagating the cultural and religious \\"message\\" of the Old Believers for the modern Russian society. While declaring himself as traditionalist and conservative in his public statements, Andrian took a significant step forward in initiating some form of a dialogue with the Russian Orthodox Church and Russian political establishment. Unfortunately, many such plans were cut short with the unexpected death of Metropolitan Andrian on August 10, 2005 during pilgrimage in one of the remote regions of Russia (he had a chronic heart condition). Many questioned the willingness of the church leadership to continue on the \\"new course\\" chosen by Andrian. However, the new Metropolitan Korniliy, elected on October 18, 2005, confirmed that he will continue on the policy of openness to the Russian society, started by his predecessor. == Organization == The head of the Church is the Metropolitan of Moscow and All Russia (archbishop in 1846‚Äì1988), residing at the Rogozhskoye cemetery in Moscow. He is elected by the highest representative body of the Church - the Holy Council (–û—Å–≤—è—â–µ–Ω–Ω—ã–π –°–æ–±–æ—Ä). The Council also appoints the members of the Council of the Metropolitanate. The Church has five local bishops and more than 250 parishes in Russia, Ukraine, Belarus and Kazakhstan. Since several years ago, there have been attempts to restore theological schools for training priests for the Old-Rite Church. The Russian Orthodox Old-Rite Church belong to the Belokrinitskaya Hierarchy and was until the 16/29 May 2008 in full ecclesiastical and canonical communion with the Lipovan Orthodox Old-Rite Church. == First Hierarchs of the Belokrinitskaya Hierarchy, 1846‚Äìpresent == ;In Hungary and Romania (Belaya Krinitza, temporarily in BrƒÉila, Romania) {  style=\\"text-align:center;\\" - !Name !Portrait !colspan=\\"2\\"Period !Notes - Ambrosios (Amvrosij) 80px 28 October 1846 26 July 1848 Died on 30 October 1863 - Kirill (Timofeev) 80px 4 January 1849 2 December 1873 - Afanasii (Makurov)  9 May 1874 1 October 1905  - Makary  10 September 1906 ?  - Silouyan  1936  1941  - Innokenty (Usov)  colspan=\\"2\\"1942  - Tikhon (Kachalkin)  1943 4 March 1968  - Ioasaph  1972 1982 Died on 2 January 1985 - Timon (Gavrilov)  1985 21 August 1996  - Leonty (Izotov)  24 October 1996 Incumbent  - } ;In Russia {  style=\\"text- align:center;\\" - !Name !Portrait !colspan=\\"2\\"Period !Notes - Sophrony  3 January 1849 1853  - Antony (Shutov) 80px 18 February 1863 8 November 1881  - Savaty (Levshin) 80px 10 October 1882 19 March 1898  - Ioann (Kartushin) 80px 16 October 1898 24 April 1915  - Melety (Kartushin) 80px 30 August 1915 4 June 1934  - Vikenty (Nikitin) 80px February 1935 13 April 1938 Locum tenens; imprisoned - Sava  1938 1940  - Irinarch (Parfenov) 80px 1941 7 March 1952  - Flavian (Slesarev) 80px 16 March 1952 25 December 1960  - Iosif (Morzhakov) 80px 19 February 1961 3 November 1970  - Nikodim (Latyshev)  24 October 1971 11 February 1986  - Alimpy (Gusev)  6 July 1986 31 December 2003  - Andrian (Chetvergov)  9 February 2004 10 August 2005  - Korniliy (Titov) 80px 18 October 2005 Incumbent  } #Deposed and excommunicated in 1853, repented in 1858, defrocked in 1863. #Retired; died 8 September 1898. #The only Old-Rite bishop who was not imprisoned in the beginning of the 1940s; Single-handedly elevated bishop Irinarch of Samara and Ufa to the Archbishop of Moscow in 1940.

It is located 15 miles (24 km) west of Towner, North Dakota. The forest contains about 30 species of woody plants, labeled and planted in a park-like setting, including Scots pine, ponderosa pine, Siberian larch, Black Hills spruce, Elaeagnus, and Rocky Mountain juniper. Wildlife includes deer, wild turkeys, porcupines, elk, and sometimes moose. The forest is also popular with birdwatchers. The forest was established in 1931 on a site extensively over-plowed and overgrazed during the early part of the 20th century, leaving wind-blown sand dunes and economic hardship. It was originally envisioned as part of a grand plan by President Franklin Delano Roosevelt to plant a 100-mile (160 km) wide \\"shelterbelt zone\\" from North Dakota to north Texas to reduce wind erosion and eliminate dust storms, as well as provide local employment in the Great Depression via a jobs program. Proponents envisioned a forest as large as 480,000 acres (1900 km¬≤) around the forest's current site. This grand vision never came to pass, and the forest was established with the more modest goals of determining which types of shelterbelt trees would grow well in the northern Great Plains, which seed sources within species are best adapted for the region, and which methods of tree establishment are most effective for shelterbelts. The Forest Service acquired of the 636 in 1931, and the State of North Dakota retained control of the other 596 acres (2.4 km¬≤). In 1971, the Forest Service acquired the entire tract. The entire section has been managed as one unit for experimental purposes since 1931, however. More than 40 species were planted from throughout the United States, Europe, and Asia, of which about 30 species have survived. The forest has also been used cooperatively by the Custer National Forest, North Dakota Forest Service, Agricultural Research service, and North Dakota State University, Fargo. It is no longer being used for research, although it currently provides approximately 500,000 seedlings per year for wind protection of crops and communities throughout the United States and Canada. The forest is now in the process of being de-commissioned and returned to the administrative control of the Custer National Forest. ==See also== *List of botanical gardens in the United States Category:Arboreta in North Dakota Category:Botanical gardens in North Dakota Category:Protected areas of McHenry County, North Dakota Category:Research forests Category:Custer National Forest ","title":"Denbigh Experimental Forest"},{"id":"2224672","text":"Admiral Castex Raoul Victor Patrice Castex (27 October 1878, Saint-Omer - 10 January 1968, Villeneuve-de-Rivi√®re) was a French Navy admiral and a military theorist. == Naval career == Castex joined the Navy in 1896, becoming the best student of his promotion at the √âcole Navale. He became professor at the √âcole de Guerre Navale. In 1919, he was tasked with reorganising the historical services of the French Navy, and in 1928, he was promoted to contre-amiral. On 2 July 1936, he was made a grand officer of the Legion of Honour. The same year, he founded the Institut des hautes √©tudes de la d√©fense nationale, which he headed until 1939. He rose to vice-amiral in 1937>and finished his career heading the naval forces of the Northern fleet. ==Institut des Hautes √âtudes de la D√©fense Nationale== One of his main achievements was the creation of the Institut des Hautes √âtudes de la D√©fense Nationale (IHEDN, Institute of Higher Studies of National Defence), which aimed to reduce the intellectual gap between civilian and military officials. ==Theories== Between 1929 and 1939, Castex wrote Th√©ories strat√©giques, which analysed the link between land and naval warfare and argued for a national \\"gravity centre\\", which, in the case of France, would be situated outside Europe. He argued that the \\"gravity centre\\" should have been displaced to Northern Africa before 1939, with installation of main armament factories and government centres. In 1939, Castex suggested granting independence to French Indochina, which he deemed indefensible against the Japanese Empire, and to Syria and Lebanon, which were then under French mandate, to make allies out of them. In 1955, Castex published an article in the Revue de la d√©fense nationale (\\"Review of National Defence\\"), La Russie, rempart de l'Occident (\\"Russia, Wall of the West\\"). There, he seemed to predict the rise of China and its upcoming rivalry with the West, including Russia. ==Works== * Le Grand √âtat-major naval, question militaire d'actualit√© (1909) * Les Id√©es militaires de la marine du XVIIIe.

The song was written by John Carter and his wife Gill.Liner notes Measure for Measure The John Carter Anthology 1961-1977, RPM Records, RPMD368 Carter also sang all the vocals and played the guitar on the record. The song was released by the British record producer on the Penny Farthing Records label. Although the record was unsuccessful in the UK, it reached the #2 in Germany, spent six months on the charts there, and sold a million copies. ==John Kincade== \\"Dreams Are Ten a Penny\\" eventually got on the charts in Australia, Scandinavia, the Netherlands, and South Africa. In order to promote the hit, Penny Farthing Records recruited John Knowles as the frontman for Kincade since Carter was reluctant to tour as the performing artist. Knowles was successful as the frontman for Kincade and went on to change his name to John Kincade. Consequently, Larry Page launched John Kincade as a solo artist, which resulted in several hit songs on the German charts from 1973 to 1975. ==Kincade (the group)== In December 1972, Paul Griggs had a call from Larry Page to form a touring band for Kincade, and Griggs recruited his brother Nigel and Rick Williams. A month later, they made a promotional trip to Spain, performing on a couple of television programmes, undertaking press interviews and making several personal appearances. By this time another single, \\"Do You Remember Marilyn\\", and a Kincade album had been released. They had been recorded by Carter using session musicians. The assembled group continued promoting material for the rest of 1973, making several visits to Germany. Their last appearance as Kincade was on the German TV show, Disco 73 in December 1973, with a song called \\"Big Hand For Annie\\". This song failed to chart and eventually the three musicians never had to go on stage as Kincade again.

As the school is unzoned, it attracts students from all across the Adelaide metropolitan area as well as some regional and interstate locations, in addition to international students. The goal of the school is to prepare its students for university, particularly in the fields of mathematics and science. The ASMS is unconventional in its approach to education, emphasising a love of learning in both students and teaching staff; students are given the freedom to take control of their own education. ASMS aims to make students aware of their own learning and for them to become self-directed in the way they complete academic tasks. ==Overview== The Australian Science and Mathematics School was opened in 2004 and has a total of around 380 students. As the school is designed to provide an adult environment for senior school students, there is no school uniform policy, which promotes a variety of culture and social styles and structures. A key feature of the ASMS is the productive relationship between the school and the Flinders University, on which the campus is located; the ASMS shares many resources with the university, including the library, cafeteria, student services, transport, recreational areas and car parks, in addition to booked access to lecture theatres and specialist science and support facilities. Furthermore, students at the ASMS in collaboration with Flinders University's Science and Technology Enterprise Partnership (STEP) may be involved in research projects in the business, industry and university sectors. ==Curriculum== The ASMS is a specialist science and mathematics school, however it offers a comprehensive curriculum which covers all learning areas necessary for students to achieve their South Australian Certificate of Education (SACE) qualification. The Year 10/11 curriculum is organised into interdisciplinary Central Studies; these alternate every year to ensure that a student will not do the same subjects twice. The Year 12 curriculum consists of standard SACE Stage 2 subjects, such as the various Mathematics, Science, English and Humanities subjects. ==Adventure Space== The ASMS also provides special activities for Year 10 and 11 students in the form of Adventure Space. Examples of these include Dance, Cryptography, Robotics, Aviation, Australian Space Design Competition, Paramedical Pathways, Electronics, Creative Writing, and Palaeontology. While not assessed, they do provide an opportunity to interact with university life, as well as an opportunity to take part in learning focused productive extra- curricular activities. ==References *Flinders University website Category:Public schools in South Australia Category:Educational institutions established in 2003 Category:Gifted education Category:Special interest high schools in South Australia Category:Mathematics education Category:Science education ","title":"Australian Science and Mathematics School"},{"id":"2224758","text":"Tetra Brik Aseptic, 1960s Tetra Brik is a brand name for a carton package produced by the Swedish packaging company Tetra Pak.

Ballard (July 8, 1931 ‚Äì February 9, 2007) was a Native American composer, educator, author, artist, and journalist. ==Life== Louis Wayne Ballard was born on July 8, 1931, in Devil's Promenade near Miami, Oklahoma. He was Quapaw and Cherokee. On his mother's side, he was related to a prominent medicine chief of the Quapaw Tribe, and on his father's side he was related to a principal chief of the Cherokee Nation. His Quapaw name, Honganozhe, translates to \\"One Who Stands With Eagles.\\" Ballard's education began at the Seneca Indian Training School when he was six years old. The Seneca Indian Training School, a boarding school located in Wyandotte, Oklahoma, was established in the early 1870s and was initially a mission school supported by a local group of Quakers and government subsidies. Over time, the school came under control of the government. The mission of the Seneca Indian Training School and other institutions like it can be best explained by the following message delivered by Thomas J. Morgan, the former Commissioner of Indian Affairs, in 1889: \\"[American Indian children] should be taught to look upon America as their home and upon the United States Government as their friend and benefactor. They should be made familiar with the lives of great and good men and women in American history, and be taught to feel a pride in all their great achievements. They should hear little or nothing of the 'wrongs of the Indians,' and of the injustice of the white race. If their unhappy history is alluded to, it should be to contrast it with the better future that is within their grasp.\\" Ballard considered these schools to be institutions that would brainwash American Indian children. Despite the efforts of the Seneca Indian Training School in discouraging him from practicing his family's customs, Ballard continued to speak in his native language and engage in tribal dances; he was constantly persecuted for doing so. This was not unlike the treatment that his mother received at a school similar to the Seneca Indian Training School where on occasion, she was beaten, handcuffed, and submitted to solitary confinement when she was caught speaking Quapaw. These disciplinary tactics were commonplace at such institutions throughout the United States and resulted in a dramatic loss of language and culture. After leaving boarding school, Ballard's parents divorced, and he and his brother, Charles Ballard, lived with their mother and step-father for part of the year, and with their grandmother for the other part of the year. During this period of his life, Ballard struggled with his identity. With his mother, he lived what could have been described as a typical American life-style with little spiritual or cultural guidance. In school, he was often forced to draw tom-toms and tomahawks by the teacher, and the other students would often taunt, harass, and throw stones at him. While living with his grandmother, though, he attended Baptist Mission School and took part in powwows as well as other community festivals. It is not surprising that he felt more comfortable living with his grandmother. There seems to be some speculation as to who first taught the young Louis Ballard to play piano at the Baptist Mission Church. One source states that it was his mother who first taught him, but another source claims that his grandmother paid an unnamed private tutor to instruct him. According to the latter, his grandmother's property contained zinc and lead, and as a result, had the financial means to purchase a piano as well as pay for piano and voice lessons. By the time he had finished high school, he had a number of achievements to his name. He was the captain of both the football team and the baseball team, he was named valedictorian and outstanding graduate of the class of 1949, and he performed in a piano recital that took place at the University of Oklahoma. Although Ballard was trained in the style of Western music, he was deeply rooted in the music and dance traditions of his culture. As a child, he often participated in powwows, and he would continue to participate in powwows into his years as a young adult. He eventually became a member of the War Dance Society of the Quapaw tribe. After high school, Ballard continued to pursue music while at college. He began studying at the University of Oklahoma in 1949, and then transferred to Northeastern Oklahoma A&M; in 1951. In 1954 he received a bachelor's degree in music theory and a bachelor's degree in music education at the University of Tulsa. There, he studied piano with Stefan Bardos and composition with Bela Rosza. Ballard met his first wife, Delores Lookout, on a blind date at the University of Tulsa in 1953. They were, then, married in January of the following year in Pawhuska, Oklahoma. Their first son, Louis Anthony Ballard, was born on October 30, 1954. Louis had two additional children with Delores. Their daughter, Anne Marie Quetone, was born on March 7, 1956, and their second son, Charles Christopher Ballard, was born August 10, 1957. During his undergraduate studies, Ballard began exploring ways in which he could combine his passion for his Quapaw music traditions with Western music practices. Taking inspiration from Bela Bartok's use of Hungarian folk themes, one of Ballard's first attempts at unifying these two musical practices was a compositional exercise in which he arranged a Ponca Indian melody in the styles of both Chopin and Rachmaninoff. Ultimately, he was dissatisfied with the outcome because he wanted his American Indian-influenced music to be assessed for its own unique qualities. He felt that for it to be truly original, it needed to feature American Indian music traditions without being in the style of another composer. He would later explain, \\"Dvorak, in 1893, predicted that America should have a form of nationalistic music built upon Indian music and Black slave songs. So I felt that I was in good company when I took up my pen to express the sufferings of my people, their regeneration and hopes for a better future life‚Ä¶\\" While Ballard was pursuing his undergraduate degrees, he sang with the Tulsa University Radio Choir in order to support himself. After graduating, Ballard taught music at various schools throughout Oklahoma, including Marquette High School in Tulsa and Nelagoney Consolidated Schools in Osage. He was also the music director for Memorial Baptist Church and Madelene Catholic Church in Tulsa, and First Presbyterian Church in Pawhuska. Later, Ballard ultimately left his music director positions and supported himself by teaching private piano lessons. Louis Ballard returned to the University of Tulsa to pursue a master's degree in composition in 1960, and continued his studies with Bela Rosza. He graduated in 1962, and was distinguished by being the first American Indian to receive a graduate degree in music composition. After graduating, Ballard frequently attended the Aspen Music Festival and studied composition privately with notable musical figures such as Darius Milhaud, Mario Castelnuovo-Tedesco, Carlos Surinach, and Felix Labunski. He also studied applied percussion with George Gaber. During the summer, as a faculty member at the Aspen Music Festival from 1957 through 1972, he taught private lessons in percussion performance and participated in various concerts held during the festival. Louis Ballard met his second wife, Ruth Dor√© at the Aspen Music Festival in 1963. She too was a concert pianist, and would later become Ballard's manager and publicist. At this time, both Louis Ballard's marriage to Delores Lookout and Ruth Dor√©'s marriage to her husband, Robert Sands, were rapidly deteriorating. By 1965, Louis Ballard divorced Delores Lookout, and was soon remarried to Ruth Dor√©. Dor√© came from a family with wealth, and with her personal and financial support, Ballard was able to pursue composition on a full-time basis. In addition to spending his summers at the Aspen Music Festival, Ballard also served as the music director for the Institute of American Indian Arts based in Santa Fe, New Mexico, from 1962 to 1968. In 1966, the Ballard family hired Lydia Talache as a housekeeper and babysitter for their three children. While she worked for them, Lydia became very close to the family. She frequented the Ballard residence twice a week until 1970. According to Lydia Talache, Louis Ballard was well liked in the American Indian community, and his music was very well received by the community at large. She recounted that the vast majority of Pueblo people favored the music that Ballard had composed and were enthusiastic about Ballard's depiction of American Indian culture in his music. Ballard was also respected as a musician and composer among the non-American Indian music community in Santa Fe. Michael Udow, the principal percussionist of the Santa Fe Opera orchestra from 1968 until his retirement in 2009, personally attested to the respect that Ballard garnered among the other musicians and by the local community in general. From 1968 until 1979, Ballard was appointed as the National Curriculum Specialist for the Bureau of Indian Affairs. During this time, he worked with over three hundred and fifty schools nationwide, and was exposed to the cultures and musical traditions of many different tribes. During his time with the Bureau of Indian Affairs, he made one of his most valuable contributions as a music educator and champion of American Indian music and culture. In 1973, Ballard wrote and published American Indian Music for the Classroom, a curriculum complete with recordings for teachers who wanted to incorporate American Indian music in classroom instruction. Throughout his career, Louis Ballard composed a large number of musical works for a variety of different instruments and ensembles. Many of Ballard's works have been premiered at major venues and have garnered awards and accolades nationally and internationally. \\"Scenes from Indian Life\\" was originally a three movement orchestral work which premiered in Rochester, New York, and was conducted by Howard Hanson in 1964. The same piece with an added a fourth movement, \\"Feast Day,\\" was performed by the San Jose Symphony as a part of its \\"Voices of America\\" program in 1994 along with Aaron Copland's \\"Lincoln Portrait\\" and Leonard Bernstein's Symphony no. 2, \\"The Age of Anxiety.\\" In 1969, Ballard's Ritmo Indio, a three movement work for woodwind quintet, won the first Marion Nevins McDowell Award for American Chamber Music, and was featured as the opening work at the Gala Quintet of the Americas concert, \\"Discovering the New World: A Quincentennial Event,\\" at Carnegie Hall on January 9, 1992. The first movement of Ritmo Indio, \\"The Soul,\\" was also recorded on two of the Quintet of the Americas' albums: Souvenirs, and Discovering the New World. Ballard began experimenting with other mediums and ventured outside the chamber ensemble format when he composed two works for ballet. The Four Moons, written in honor and celebration of Oklahoma's sixtieth year of statehood in 1967, was performed both in Tulsa and in Oklahoma City. It was also featured at the Tulsa Ballet's New York debut performance in 1983. His second ballet, Desert Trilogy, was nominated for a Pulitzer Prize in 1971. Another popular and critically acclaimed composition is his chamber orchestral work, Incident at Wounded Knee. Incident at Wounded Knee was inspired by a stream of daily newspaper reports that were covering the court proceedings related to the 1973 conflict that occurred between the FBI and members of the American Indian Movement on the Sioux reservation in Pine Ridge, South Dakota. This was also the site of a massacre of three hundred Oglala Sioux by the United States military in 1890. Commissioned and conducted by Dennis Russell Davies, the director of the St. Paul Chamber Symphony Orchestra in 1974, it was performed in New York at Carnegie Hall in 1999 at the American Composer's Orchestra's opening concert of the season, \\"Protest.\\" While Incident at Wounded Knee is not a programmatic work, it represents the customs and emotions of the American Indian peoples. In 1976, Portrait of Will Rogers, Ballard's choral cantata, was premiered by the Kansas City Symphony with Will Rogers, Jr. as the narrator. Ballard's works have also been premiered at prestigious venues such as the Lincoln Center, the Kennedy Center, and the Smithsonian Institution. In 1999, he was the first American composer to have a complete concert dedicated to his music at Beethovenhalle in Bonn, Germany, and he was featured as a guest artist, in 2000, at the Salzburg Mozarteum. In 2004, Louis Ballard was inducted into the Oklahoma Music Hall of Fame making it the first time that a symphonic composer was inducted in tandem with pop music artists. His music has been featured on radio networks around the world including National Public Radio, Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, British Broadcasting Corporation, Radio France, Deutsche Welle, and Saarl√§ndischer Rundfunk. Ballard, himself, has been awarded with two honorary doctoral degrees, one from the College of Santa Fe, and the other from William Jewel College, and he has received the National Indian Achievement Award four times. In addition, he was awarded with several more awards in honor of his contributions which include: the Distinguished Service Award from the U.S. Central Office of Education, a citation in the U.S. Congressional Record, a Lifetime Musical Achievement Award by the First Americans in the Arts, and the Cherokee Medal of Honor. He was also awarded with several grants that allowed him to continue his work. In addition to a Rockefeller Foundation Grant in 1969, and a Ford Foundation Grant a year later, he has received a total of five grants from the National Endowment for the Arts. In the years following 1990, Ruth Ballard was diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease, and her mental health was declining. As a result, she had to relinquish her responsibilities as Louis Ballard's manager and publicist. In 2001, Ruth was institutionalized due to her progressing condition remaining under the guardianship of Louis W. Ballard. While working on a newly commissioned piano concerto, Louis W. Ballard died at the age of seventy-five on February 9, 2007, in Santa Fe, New Mexico, after a five-year-struggle against cancer. His body was cremated, and his ashes were placed on his mother's grave in Miami, Oklahoma. After Louis W. Ballard's death, guardianship of Ruth Ballard went to his son, Louis A. Ballard. She would later pass away on January 30, 2015 in Santa Fe, New Mexico. She is buried in the Jewish section of Rivera Cemetery in Santa Fe, New Mexico. Regardless of the fact that she was not observant, nor was she affiliated with any synagogue, Louis A. Ballard felt that, because of her Jewish ancestry, she deserved a burial ceremony that was as close to a traditional Jewish burial ceremony as possible. Ballard left behind the following credo: \\"It is not enough to acknowledge that Native American Indian music is merely different from other music. What is needed in America is an awakening and reorienting of our total spiritual and cultural perspectives to embrace, understand, and learn from the Aboriginal American and what motivates his musical and artistic impulses.\\" His music has been celebrated with three concerts at the National Museum of the American Indian in Washington, D.C. in 2006 as well as a memorial concert held at the same venue on November 10, 2007. ==Awards and recognition== Ballard graduated in 1962 from the University of Tulsa, and was distinguished by being the first American Indian to receive a graduate degree in music composition. In 1969, Ballard's Ritmo Indio, a three movement work for woodwind quintet, won the Marion Nevins McDowell Award for American Chamber Music. Ballard's Desert Trilogy, his second work for ballet, was nominated for a Pulitzer Prize in 1971. In 1999, he was the first American composer to have a complete concert dedicated to his music at Beethovenhalle in Bonn, Germany. He has also received the National Indian Achievement Award four times. In addition, he was awarded with several more awards in honor of his contributions which include: the Distinguished Service Award from the U.S. Central Office of Education, a citation in the U.S. Congressional Record, and the Cherokee Medal of Honor. Ballard was also the recipient of grants from the Rockefeller Foundation, Ford Foundation, and National Endowment for the Arts. In February 1997 he received a Lifetime Musical Achievement Award from the First Americans in the Arts in Beverly Hills, California. The College of Santa Fe and William Jewell College awarded him honorary Doctor of Music degrees. In 2004 he was inducted into the Oklahoma Music Hall of Fame. ==Filmography== *1971: Discovering American Indian Music. Directed by Bernard Wilets.

Kirk sessions and presbyteries may also style the chairperson as moderator. Presbyterian churches are ordered by a presbyterian polity, including a hierarchy of councils or courts of elders, from the local church (kirk) Session through presbyteries (and perhaps synods) to a General Assembly. The moderator presides over the meeting of the court, much as a convener presides over the meeting of a church committee. The moderator is thus the chairperson, and is understood to be a member of the court acting . The moderator calls and constitutes meetings, presides at them, and closes them in prayer. The moderator has a casting, but not a deliberative vote. During a meeting, the title moderator is used by all other members of the court as a form of address, but this may not be continued outside the meetings. Thus this convention expresses deference to the authority of the court rather than an honour for the moderator as an individual. Many moderators act as ambassadors for their general assembly when it is not sitting, and visit many of the local churches in their denomination. ==United churches== In each of the united churches of South India, of North India, of Pakistan and of Bangladesh (which all have Presbyterian roots), one of the diocesan bishops is elected Moderator of the Synod (i.e. the national governing body) for a fixed term ‚Äî another is elected Vice-Moderator.

It was founded by Alfred Gray Parker and Arthur Hale. ==History== Alfred Gray Parker founded a rifle manufacturing company in 1890. In 1910, he invited his nephew, Alfred Thomas Corbyn Hale, to become a partner in the limited liability company, with the shares being taken up by members of both the Parker and Hale families. A first catalogue was issued of arms and shooting accessories and, though limited in its range, clearly showed the company's growing trend for the development of accessories. By 1914 the company's small manufacturing plant was well established and the Ministry of Munitions ordered training equipment from Parker-Hale. The \\"Parkerifling\\" process, coupled with the Hiscock-Parker magazine, enabled service rifles to be converted to .22 Long Rifle (.22 LR) for use as training rifles, and demand was such that the Parker-Hale factory was soon working to full capacity. In 1924, Hale's son, Arthur, joined the business, and in 1926 a family record was set up when Hale and his two eldest sons took part in the \\"King's Prize\\" at Bisley. This event was eclipsed two years later when Arthur Hale succeeded in winning the coveted prize itself. He was appointed Director of the Company in 1928. With the outbreak of the Second World War, the available resources of the gun trade had been mobilised to recondition a reserve of Pattern 1914 Enfield rifles, and in 1940 the Parker-Hale Arms Company was founded. Additional premises were acquired \\"for the duration\\" of the war and, under the management of Arthur Hale, a large reconditioning programme was rapidly carried through. A wide range of additional war contract work followed, principally with the manufacture of .30-06 Springfield and .303 British drill cartridges in large quantities. After the close of hostilities, with a fall in production contracts and no permanent premises, the company had little choice but to invest in a small factory unit, erected under the Government's emergency programme to re-house bombed-out manufacturers. Meanwhile, the Parker-Hale Arms Company was transferred to the Birmingham Proof House, where it continued with the reconditioning of .22 LR weapons for junior training organisations. The company ceased to exist upon completion of the contracts. The immediate post-war years can best be described as a period of frustrated opportunity, since overseas markets were opened but materials of all sorts were in short supply. Nevertheless, by 1948 business abroad far exceeded the home trade. Positioned alongside the BSA factory sportsground and Sparkbrook, from which the local area gets its name, the Parker-Hale factory headquarter building echoes the traditions of the Birmingham gunmaking industry, since it occupies the very site that the Proof House located their testing range. Business at Parker-Hale remained relatively stable throughout the 1960s and into the 1980s, with sales of target and sporting rifles, handguns, shotguns and ammunition sitting comfortably alongside the company's comprehensive range of rifle scopes, knives, gun care accessories and cleaning kits. The company received a temporary setback in 1985 when the Chairman and Managing Director, John le Breton, who had been instrumental in consolidating the company's success in world markets, retired from the board. The founder's grandson, Roger Hale, then took over as Managing Director, and proved an influential figure in successfully re-positioning the company in what was to prove a constantly changing industry. Lacking the investment necessary to enable the company to compete effectively in newly emerging markets, Parker-Hale was eventually sold to the Midlands engineering group, Modular Industries Ltd. In 1992 it was purchased by Navy Arms and spun off as Gibbs Rifle Company, Inc. ==Rifles== A Parker-Hale L81A2.

The molasse deposits accumulate in a foreland basin, especially on top of flysch-like deposits, for example, those that left from the rising Alps, or erosion in the Himalaya. These deposits are typically the non-marine alluvial and fluvial sediments of lowlands, as compared to deep-water flysch sediments. Sedimentation stops when the orogeny stops, or when the mountains have eroded flat. Stanley, Steven M., Earth System History, New York: W.H. Freeman and Company, 1999, p.243 The molasse can sometimes completely fill a foreland basin, creating a nearly flat depositional surface, that nonetheless remains a structural syncline. Molasse can be very thick near the mountain front, but usually thins out towards the interior of a craton; such massive, convex accumulations of sediment are known as clastic wedges. ==See also== * * ==ReferencesFurther reading== * Sinclair, H.

He is also part of the All Japan Board of Directors. He has worked in New Japan Pro Wrestling (NJPW), Pro Wrestling Noah (Noah) and Pro Wrestling Zero1 (Zero1). ==Professional wrestling careerAll Japan Pro Wrestling (1992‚Äì2000)=== After being trained by Animal Hamaguchi, Omori debuted in All Japan Pro Wrestling, initially languishing in the mid-card and only able to get some recognition in 1995, when he and Jun Akiyama captured the All Asia Tag Team Championship. In 1998, he and newcomer Yoshihiro Takayama formed the NO FEAR tag team. The team soon won both the All Asia Tag Team Championship and the World Tag Team Championship, becoming the first team to win both titles at the same time. When Mitsuharu Misawa formed Pro Wrestling Noah, they followed him and dyed their hair blond to match the change of environment. ===World Wrestling Federation (1996)=== Omori's first American venture was in the World Wrestling Federation, where he competed in the 1996 Royal Rumble. He was eliminated by the returning Jake Roberts. ===Pro Wrestling Noah and other promotions (2000‚Äì2004)=== For an undisclosed reason, Omori called for an early ending to his singles bout with Shinya Hashimoto in the middle of their singles match at Noah's Great Voyage 2000 event, which was the company's most important event up to that point. Because of this, Omori was immediately in Misawa's doghouse, and after the NO FEAR team broke up (so Takayama could pursue mixed martial arts matches) Omori was sent abroad to Harley Race's World League Wrestling promotion in the American Midwest, where he won the company's heavyweight title. During his excursion, Misawa continued to deny that Omori had been sent abroad by Noah, and Omori was not welcomed back to Noah when he returned from the excursion. As a result, Omori joined Fighting World of Japan Pro Wrestling, where he feuded with Riki Choshu, Genichiro Tenryu and Kensuke Sasaki. ===Pro Wrestling Zero1-Max (2004‚Äì2008)=== In 2004, he joined Pro Wrestling ZERO1-MAX, where he was one of the strong native competitors along with (fellow Hamaguchi Dojo classmate) Shinjiro Otani. He has feuded with old team mate Yoshihiro Takayama, resulting in many bloody battles and disqualifications. On March 8, 2007, he and Manabu Nakanishi lost the ZERO1-MAX Intercontinental Tag Team Championship to Yoshihiro Takayama and Kohei Sato. On March 31, 2007, he defeated Steve Corino for the AWA Superstars of Wrestling World Heavyweight Championship, becoming a three-time champion. Nearly seven months to the day Omori won the AWA World Heavyweight championship, he would lose the title to Masato Tanaka. On August 16, 2008 Omori announced that he was leaving ZERO1-MAX and taking a break from pro wrestling. ===New Japan Pro Wrestling (2009‚Äì2010)=== This break would not last long, as Omori appeared at a New Japan Pro Wrestling show on March 15, 2009 to revive his team with Manabu Nakanishi. He also participated in the 2009 G1 Climax, pulling off two impressive victories in his first two matches by defeating both IWGP Heavyweight Champion Hiroshi Tanahashi and eventual tournament winner Togi Makabe. In January 2010 Omori announced his semi- retirement. ===Freelancing (2010‚Äì2011)=== Since semi-retiring, Omori had been wrestling select shows in various promotions, both mainstream and independent. In 2011, he has been wrestling semi-regularly with All Japan Pro Wrestling. Following the 2011 World's Strongest Tag Determination League, Omori appealed to Keiji Mutoh to officially join All Japan and Mutoh granted the request, officially rejoining All Japan. ===Return to AJPW (2011‚Äìpresent)=== Omori in December 2012 Omori's first match back as an official member of the AJPW roster took place on December 25, 2011, teaming up with Manabu Soya and Seiya Sanada in a loss to Akebono, Keiji Mutoh, and Super Delfin. On March 20, 2012, Omori and Soya defeated Dark Cuervo and Dark Ozz for the World Tag Team Championship. After losing the title to Joe Doering and Seiya Sanada on May 20, Omori and Soya, known collectively as \\"Get Wild\\", regained the title on June 17. They vacated the title on October 30, in time for the 2012 World's Strongest Tag Determination League. On November 30, Get Wild won the tournament to regain the title. On December 11, Soya unsuccessfully challenged Masakatsu Funaki for the Triple Crown Heavyweight Championship. As a result, Get Wild was forced to disband, despite still holding the World Tag Team Championship. Get Wild went on to lose the title to Burning (Go Shiozaki and Jun Akiyama) on March 17, 2013. Following Soya's resignation from AJPW, Omori revived his team with Akiyama, naming it \\"Wild Burning\\" in January 2014. On February 8, Wild Burning unsuccessfully challenged Evolution (Joe Doering and Suwama) for the World Tag Team Championship. On April 27, Omori won his first Champion Carnival, defeating Jun Akiyama in the finals. On June 15, Omori defeated Akiyama in a rematch to win the vacant Triple Crown Heavyweight Championship for the first time. On June 28, Omori became only the sixth \\"Quintuple Crown Champion\\" in All Japan history, when he and Akiyama defeated Joe Doering and Suwama to win the World Tag Team Championship. However, the next day, Omori lost the Triple Crown Heavyweight Championship to Suwama, ending his reign at just 14 days. After successfully defending the World Tag Team Championship against Akebono and Yutaka Yoshie on October 22, Omori and Akiyama vacated the title the following day in time for the 2014 World's Strongest Tag Determination League. They regained the title by winning the tournament on December 6, defeating Go Shiozaki and Kento Miyahara in the finals. Wild Burning's second reign ended on March 22, 2015, when they were defeated by Akebono and Yutaka Yoshie. On January 1, 2016, Omori was appointed to the All Japan Board of Directors. On December 18, the reunited Get Wild defeated Jake Lee and Kento Miyahara in the finals to win the 2016 World's Strongest Tag Determination League. ==Championships and accomplishments== *All Japan Pro Wrestling **All Asia Tag Team Championship (2 times) ‚Äì with Jun Akiyama (1) and Yoshihiro Takayama (1) **Triple Crown Heavyweight Championship (1 time) **World Tag Team Championship (7 times) ‚Äì with Yoshihiro Takayama (1), Manabu Soya (3) and Jun Akiyama (3) **F-1 Tag Team Championship (1 time) ‚Äì with Kannazuki1 **Asunaro Tag Team Cup (1998) - with Jun Akiyama **Champion Carnival (2014) **January 2 Korakuen Hall Heavyweight Battle Royal (1997, 2014, 2017) **World's Strongest Tag Determination League (2012, 2016) - with Manabu Soya **World's Strongest Tag Determination League (2014) - with Jun Akiyama *DDT Pro-Wrestling **GAY World Anal Championship (1 time, inaugural) *European Wrestling Association **EWA World Heavyweight Championship (1 time) *New Japan Pro Wrestling **IWGP Tag Team Championship (1 time) ‚Äì with Manabu Nakanishi **Interim IWGP Tag Team Championship (1 time) - with Manabu Nakanishi *Nikkan Sports **Best Tag Team Award (2012) with Manabu Soya *Pro Wrestling Illustrated **Ranked No. 66 of the top 500 singles wrestlers in the PWI 500 in 2000 *Pro Wrestling Noah **GHC Tag Team Championship (1 time) ‚Äì with Yoshihiro Takayama *Pro Wrestling Zero1-Max **AWA World Heavyweight Championship (3 times) **NWA Intercontinental Tag Team Championship (3 times)2 ‚Äì with Shiro Koshinaka (1), Shinjiro Otani (1), and Manabu Nakanishi (1) **NWA United National Heavyweight Championship (1 time)3 *Tokyo Sports **Best Tag Team Award (2012) ‚Äì with Manabu Soya *World League Wrestling **WLW Heavyweight Championship (1 time) 1Championship not officially recognized by All Japan Pro Wrestling. 2Although the title still uses the NWA initials, it is not recognized or sanctioned by the National Wrestling Alliance since the promotion withdrew from the NWA in 2004. 3This title shouldn't be confused with the NWA United National Championship, a defunct NWA singles championship that is currently one of the three championships used to comprise the Triple Crown Heavyweight Championship. ==References Category:Living people Category:Japanese male professional wrestlers Category:1969 births ","title":"Takao Omori"},{"id":"2224814","text":"A protolith is the original, unmetamorphosed rock from which a given metamorphic rock is formed (proto-: first; lithos: rock; both Greek).protolith, at The Free Dictionary For example, the protolith of a slate is a shale or mudstone.

The series shares a producer (Richard P. Rubinstein) with Tales from the Darkside, and in some ways succeeded the show (which ended the same year Monsters began). It differed in some respects nonetheless. While Tales sometimes dabbles in stories of science fiction and fantasy, this series is more strictly horror. As the name implies, each episode (with very few exceptions) features a different monster which the story concerned, from the animatronic puppet of a fictional children's television program to mutated, weapon-wielding lab rats. The series has featured cameos from celebrities including: Anne Meara and Jerry Stiller, Laura Branigan, Troy Donahue, Linda Blair, Deborah Harry, Kaye Ballard, Imogene Coca, Farley Granger, Pam Grier, Wil Wheaton, and Meat Loaf. ==Synopsis== The introduction of the show begins with an aerial view of a middle class suburban neighborhood, drawing closer to what seems to be a typical Cape Cod style house. The camera enters this innocent setting as a father and daughter sit before an old television. The mother enters, revealing herself to be a horned cyclops, pushing a cart and remarking, \\"Honey, it's family hour, there must be something on.\\" The daughter rushes to the cart, also a horned cyclops with green, molting hands, exclaims as she uncovers the dish, \\"Oh wow, Candied Critters!\\" As the mother and daughter make themselves comfortable, the father, a potato-like humanoid with one hand mostly root-shaped and molting green (a literal \\"couch potato\\"), makes a noise of surprise as the mother exclaims, \\"It's Monsters, our favorite show!\\" The daughter quietly replies, \\"Shh, it's starting.\\" As the camera zooms in on the father's face, his low chuckle morphs into a high pitched giggle as the title fills the screen. Each episode is a stand-alone tale, none of the episodes connect with each other, and feature a variety of monsters from vicious man eating plants to friendly aliens from outer space. The series was well known for its guest stars, many of whom went on to become famous. These included Lili Taylor (in \\"Habitat\\"), David Spade (in \\"Small Blessings\\"), Tony Shalhoub (in \\"Leavings\\"), Steve Buscemi (in \\"Bed and Boar\\"), Gina Gershon (in \\"Jar\\"), Matt LeBlanc (in \\"Shave and a Haircut, Two Bites\\"), Tori Spelling (in \\"The Match Game\\") and Chris Noth (in \\"Satan in the Suburbs\\") . ==Directing and writing== A number of directors helmed more than one episode.

Farino each directed four episodes; Gerald Cotts (directing as \\"Jerry Smith\\") and Jeffrey Wolf each directed three episodes; and Warner Shook, Theodore Gershuny, Brian Thomas Jones, Allen Coulter, and Tom Noonan each directed two episodes. Several writers also wrote more than one episode. Edithe Swensen wrote six scripts, and the writing team of Peg Haller and Bob Schneider wrote five scripts. Michael Reaves and Benjamin Carr (writing as \\"Neal Marshall Stevens\\") each wrote four episodes. Jule Selbo, Joseph Anderson, Michael Kimball, D. Emerson Smith, and Haskell Barkin each wrote three scripts, while Harvey Jacobs, David Misch, Paul Dini, Michael McDowell, David Odell, and Dan Simmons each wrote two. Three stories by noted fantasy and horror author Robert Bloch were used for the series. Theodore Gershuny contributed two stories to the series (and a script). Four individuals both wrote and directed the same episode: Bruce Feirstein, Robert T. Megginson, Scott Alexander, and Tom Noonan. Director Allen Coulter also contributed a story. ==Notes on episodes== Monsters is generally considered a horror anthology. But the show was about monsters, whether in a horror context or not. Although \\"New York Honey\\" (the third episode aired) is the first episode to mix humor and horror, \\"My Zombie Lover\\" (the fifth episode to air) was played strictly for laughs (\\"black comedy\\") and was not meant to be taken seriously (e.g., to horrify). Eleven episodes were played for laughs rather than horror. The show is also well known for its \\"twist endings\\". This occurs many times in the series: An ally turns out to be a secret enemy, a villain's victory turns sour in the final seconds of the show, a wish is revealed to have a negative downside. However, more than a quarter of the show's episodes had no twist ending, and were straightforward horror stories. \\"The Vampire Hunter\\" is one example of this. Others include \\"Sleeping Dragon\\", \\"The Match Game\\", \\"The Mandrake Root\\", \\"Cellmates\\", and \\"Household Gods.\\" The series used special effects, makeup, costuming, and other theatrical tricks to create believable monsters. Particularly good effects or makeup occurred in \\"My Zombie Lover\\" (the zombie boy's makeup), \\"Mannikins of Horror\\" (the mannequins are well-animated), \\"Love Hurts\\" (the zombie's makeup), \\"Jar\\" (the swamp monster is visually effective), \\"The Offering\\" (the giant cancer-inducing bugs are visually effective), \\"Stressed Environment\\" (the anthropomorphic rats are well-animated), \\"The Hole\\" (the zombie makeup), and \\"The Moving Finger\\" (the finger is well-animated). But poor special effects were just as common. They occurred in \\"New York Honey\\" (the queen bee visible at the end of the episode), \\"Glim-Glim\\" (the alien, Glim-Glim), \\"Their Divided Self\\" (the conjoined twins), \\"Half as Old as Time\\" (the exceptionally poor make-up on Leif Garrett), \\"Mr. Swlabr\\" (the reptilian title character), \\"Micro Minds\\" (the enlarged monstrous virus visible at the end), \\"Murray's Monster\\" (a particularly poor monster suit), and \\"The Space-Eaters\\" (a giant glowing eye). The series also included a number of sexually explicit episodes. Among the episodes which included risqu√© love-making scenes were \\"The Cocoon\\", \\"Love Hurts\\", \\"Jar\\", \\"The Mandrake Root\\", \\"Museum Hearts\\", \\"Desirable Alien\\", \\"Bug House\\", and \\"The Young and the Headless\\". Bare breasts were seen twice in the third season. In \\"Stressed Environment\\", a real woman's breast is seen on screen for several seconds as a character dresses. In \\"Leavings\\", the camera lingers on a fake woman's breast for several seconds. In one shot, the fake breast fills the screen. The series focused on a wide variety of monsters. Among the most popular were aliens (featured in eight episodes) and demons (featured in six episodes). Vampires and zombies were the focus of four episodes each, while ghosts, reptilian creatures, and witches figured strongly in three episodes each. Cursed Native American objects, giant spiders or spider-like people, and werewolves were also common. A mummy was depicted only once. ==Adaptations== Short stories such as The Moving Finger from well-known authors like Stephen King were also adapted into episodes of the series. ==Episodes== There were 72 episodes of the series produced over three seasons. There were 24 episodes per season. ==Home media== On February 25, 2014, eOne Entertainment released the complete series on DVD in Region 1.A Press Release for 'The Complete Series' Comes Out of Entertainment One's Closet ==References* *Overview of Tales from the Darkside - Discusses the production of both TV series.

The Encantadia franchise, consisting of four series Encantadia (2005), Etheria (2005‚Äì06), Encantadia: Pag-ibig Hanggang Wakas (2006), and Encantadia (2016), is primarily focused on Danaya's journey to save the realm against the invaders. Danaya is portrayed by actress Diana Zubiri on the first 3 series, while Sanya Lopez portrayed her in the 2016 series of the same name. In Encantadia, Danaya is the youngest daughter of Mine-a, the Queen of Lireo to a diwata named Enuo. She was known as the Keeper of the Gem of Earth. She is known for her bravery and her loyalty to laws and orders in Encantadia. She really wants to be with Aquil for the rest of her life In the end, she ascended the throne of Lireo after Lira, Amihan's daughter, refused to succeed her mother. She continued her reign until Etheria (2006). She was then succeeded by her niece Cassandra, Lira's daughter in Encantadia: Pag-ibig Hanggang Wakas (2006). ==Concept and creation== Encantadia is a spin-off of Mulawin. In Mulawin, a similar character named Florona (portrayed by Bettina Carlos) was Encantadia's diwata of the earth and could be considered as the first version of the character. The name Danaya may be a play on \\"Diana\\", which is the name of the actress Diana Zubiri who first played the role. It is also linked with the Roman goddess Diana, goddess of the hunt, the moon, and nature being associated with wild animals and woodland, and having the power to talk to and control animals.Larousse Desk Reference Encyclopedia, The Book People, Haydock, 1995, p. 215. The story unfolds in Lireo, the kingdom where Queen Mine-a lives with her daughters Amihan, Alena, Danaya, and Pirena. The four Sangg'res are tasked to be the new keepers of the brilyantes. Their skills in war and their powers as the royalty of the diwatas are believed to be the strength of Lireo. As long as the gemstones are kept properly, the balance of nature in Encantadia remains. ===Background=== Danaya is the fourth and the youngest daughter of Mine-a and her second daughter with Enuo. Her father is a \\"diwata\\" who knows much about Encantadia's flora and fauna. She is also excellent in healing diseases or wounds with the help of the Earth gem. The youngest of Minea's daughters, Danaya is a determined fighter whose loyalty to the throne and laws of her Kingdom is absolute. She was described as just, fearless and prudent among the four sisters. She knows her kingdom‚Äôs laws by heart, and while she may be extremely stubborn, she‚Äôs one to do things by the book. Because of her relative youth, she is prone to playfulness and argue most of the time especially with her niece Lira and sister Pirena. Though Danaya can use swords and other arsenals as shown in \\"Etheria\\", her weapon of choice is an arnis stick (kali) called \\"eskrima\\". Aside from her weapon, she can also shape-shift into any animals or things she wish to. ==AppearancesEncantadia (2005)=== When her sister Pirena stole the Gem of Fire, her mother Mine-a handed her the Brilyante ng Lupa for safe keeping. With this, she is tasked to take care of nature and environment in Encantadia. Danaya was one of her mother's choice to ascend the throne of Lireo, but was defeated during the challenge. When her sister Amihan gave birth to Lira, as the wisest of the Sang'gres, she gave a magical gift to Lira, that she will never be harmed by Pirena. This happened when Pirena, a defector of Lireo, came back to ask for their forgiveness, Danaya was not convinced and did not bestowed her full trust to her. As part of Pirena's plan to overthrow Amihan from her throne, Danaya was attacked by Pirena and made an attempt on Amihan's life disguised as Danaya, leading to her exile in the mortal world. This would make easier for Pirena to penetrate the forces of Lireo. In the mortal world, she accidentally met Milagros, the true daughter of Amihan guarded by a lambana named Muyak. Danaya had several failed attempts to convince Mila about her origin. She was then followed by the Hathors including Hagorn and succeeded in killing her niece, Mila. She was later helped by Mulawin's Dakila and Bagwis and went to Halconia to look for Mercurios to bring Mila back to life. They went back to Encantadia and reunited with her sisters. She helped Amihan reclaim the throne of Lireo. When the war is over and Amihan had to pass on her crown to Lira, she refused and rather chose to go back to the mortal world to be with Anthony. Renouncing the throne, her mother and the other Sang'gres chose Danaya as the new Queen of Lireo after Pirena refused, and Alena be crowned as the future Queen of Sapiro. ===Etheria (2005‚Äì06)=== A prophecy by Ether was established a long time ago that if the last kin of the diwatas was born, the fallen Kingdom of Etheria will rise again. When Cassandra, granddaughter of Amihan was born, the prophecy became true and the fallen Kingdom poses a threat to now peaceful Encantadia. Danaya with her three sisters went back to the past to revert the prophecy by changing the history. Danaya headed their fight against the four Herans of Etheria in which they gain victory with the help of the \\"Inang brilyante\\". This became Danaya's way to revert the past and bring back the life of Aquil, head of Lirean army and her love interest. ===Encantadia: Pag-ibig Hanggang Wakas (2006)=== Because of the defeat of the Etherians, Ether flew around her kingdom which was all destroyed to find the Four herans. She found them all and kept their spirits in a crystal ball and brought them to the future. The Crystal ball broke and their spirits became free. They practiced fighting and planned to steal the four gems so Etheria may once again rise back in glory. Danaya fought against the Etherians once again to keep the gems in their territory. During the last war of Encantadia, she faces her \\"gabay-diwa\\", Sari-a. In a few years, she descended her throne and was succeeded by Cassandra, Lira's daughter. Legend says she settled with Aquil in the forest of Lireo and eventually vanished together with her other sisters. ===Encantadia (2016)=== The 2016 series is a reboot (often called as requel or retelling-sequel) to the 2005 fantasy series with the same name. It is the fourth series of the Encantadia franchise and is 11 years apart from the third one. It features the same character and story of Danaya with the 2005 series. It was portrayed by actress Sanya Lopez who underwent vigorous training and repeated audition call backs. ==References== Category:Encantadia Category:Fictional Filipino people Category:Fictional queens Category:Fictional fairies and sprites ","title":"Danaya"},{"id":"2224836","text":"The Bangweulu Block is a cratonic unit that forms part of the Congo craton of central Africa.

Its identified radicals were proponents of democratic reform in what subsequently became the parliamentary Radicals in the United Kingdom. During the 19th century in the United Kingdom, continental Europe and Latin America, the term radical came to denote a progressive liberal ideology inspired by the French Revolution. Historically, radicalism emerged in an early form with the French Revolution and the similar movements it inspired in other countries. It grew prominent during the 1830s in the United Kingdom with the Chartists and Belgium with the Revolution of 1830, then across Europe in the 1840s‚Äì1850s during the Revolutions of 1848. In contrast to the social conservatism of existing liberal politics, radicalism sought political support for a radical reform of the electoral system to widen suffrage. It was also associated with republicanism, civic nationalism, abolition of titles, rationalism and the resistance to a single established state religion, redistribution of property and freedom of the press. In 19th-century France, radicalism had emerged as a minor political force by the 1840s as the extreme left of the day (in contrast to the socially-conservative liberalism of the Moderate Republicans and Orl√©anist monarchists and the anti-parliamentarianism of the Legitimist monarchists and Bonapartists). By the 1890s, the French radicals were not organised under a single nationwide structure, but rather they had become a significant political force in parliament. In 1901, they consolidated their efforts by forming the country's first major extra- parliamentary political party, the Republican, Radical and Radical-Socialist Party which became the most important party of government during the second half (1899 to 1940) of the French Third Republic. The success of the French Radicals encouraged radicals elsewhere to organise themselves into formal parties in a range of other countries in the late 19th and early 20th century, with radicals holding significant political office in Bulgaria, Denmark, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Netherlands, Portugal, Romania, Russia, Spain, Sweden and Switzerland. During the interwar period, European radical parties organised the Radical Entente, their own political international. As social democracy emerged as a distinct political force in its own right, the differences that once existed between historical left-wing radicalism and conservative liberalism diminished. Between 1940 and 1973, radicalism became defunct in most of its European heartlands, with its role and philosophy taken on by social-democratic and conservative-liberal parties. == Overview  Radicalism and liberalism === The two Enlightenment philosophies of liberalism and radicalism both shared the goal of liberating humanity from traditionalism. However, liberals regarded it as sufficient to establish individual rights that would protect the individual while radicals sought institutional, social/economic, and especially cultural/educational reform to allow every citizen to put those rights into practice. For this reason, radicalism went beyond the demand for liberty by seeking also equality, i.e. universality as in Libert√©, √âgalit√©, Fraternit√©. In some countries, radicalism represented a minor wing within the Liberal political family as in the case of England's Radical Whigs. Sometimes, the radical wing of the liberals were hardline or doctrinaire and in other cases more moderate and pragmatic. In other countries, radicalism had had enough electoral support on its own, or a favourable electoral system or coalition partners, to maintain distinct radical parties such as in Switzerland and Germany (Freisinn), Bulgaria, Denmark, Italy, Spain and the Netherlands,See for more information the section on Liberale und radikale Parteien in Klaus von Beyme: Parteien in westlichen Demokratien, M√ºnchen, 1982. but also Argentina (Radical Civic Union), Chile and Paraguay.Compare page 255 and further in the Guide to the Political Parties of South America (Pelican Books, 1973) Victorian era Britain possessed both trends: In England the Radicals were simply the left wing of the Liberal coalition, though they often rebelled when the coalition's socially conservative Whigs resisted democratic reforms, whereas in Ireland Radicals lost faith in the ability of parliamentary gradualism to deliver egalitarian and democratic reform and, breaking away from the main body of liberals, pursued a radical-democratic parliamentary republic through separatism and insurrection. This does not mean that all radical parties were formed by left- wing liberals. In French political literature, it is normal to make a clear separation between Radicalism as a distinct political force to the left of Liberalism but to the right of Socialism. Over time, as new left-wing parties formed to address the new social issues, the right wing of the Radicals would splinter off in disagreement with the main Radical family and became absorbed as the left wing of the Liberal family‚Äîrather than the other way around, as in Britain and Belgium. The distinction between Radicals and Liberals was made clear by the two mid-20th-century attempts to create an international for centrist democratic parties. In 1923-4, the French Radicals created an Entente Internationale des Partis Radicaux et des Partis D√©mocratiques similaires: it was joined by the centre-left Radical parties of Europe, and in the democracies where no equivalent existed‚ÄîBritain and Belgium‚Äîthe liberal party was to allowed attend instead. After the Second World War the Radical International was not reformed; instead, a centre-right Liberal International was established, closer to the conservative-liberalism of the British and Belgian Liberal parties.Internacional LiberalMovimento Liberal Social ‚Äì Liberalismo em Portugal, Social Liberal Movement official website.Internationale Lib√©rale, Europe Politique  europe-politique.eu.See page 1 and further of A sense of liberty by Julie Smith, published by the Liberal International in 1997. This marked the end of Radicalism as an independent political force in Europe, though some countries such as France and Switzerland retained politically-important Radical parties well into the 1950s‚Äì1960s. Many European parties that are nowadays categorised in the group of social-liberal parties have a historical affinity with radicalism and may therefore be called \\"liberal-radical\\". == By country  United Kingdom === According to Encyclop√¶dia Britannica, the first use of the term radical in a political sense is generally ascribed to the English parliamentarian Charles James Fox, a leader of the left wing of the Whig party who dissented from the party's conservative-liberalism and looked favourably upon the radical reforms being undertaken by French republicans, such as universal male suffrage. In 1797, Fox declared for a \\"radical reform\\" of the electoral system. This led to a general use of the term to identify all supporting the movement for parliamentary reform. Initially confined to the upper and middle classes, in the early 19th century \\"popular radicals\\" brought artisans and the \\"labouring classes\\" into widespread agitation in the face of harsh government repression. More respectable \\"philosophical radicals\\" followed the utilitarian philosophy of Jeremy Bentham and strongly supported parliamentary reform, but were generally hostile to the arguments and tactics of the \\"popular radicals\\". By the middle of the century, parliamentary Radicals joined with others in the Parliament of the United Kingdom to form the Liberal Party, eventually achieving reform of the electoral system.  Origins  The Radical movement had its beginnings at a time of tension between the American colonies and Great Britain, with the first Radicals, angry at the state of the House of Commons, drawing on the Leveller tradition and similarly demanding improved parliamentary representation. These earlier concepts of democratic and even egalitarian reform had emerged in the turmoil of the English Civil War and the brief establishment of the republican Commonwealth of England amongst the vague political grouping known as the Levellers, but with the English Restoration of the monarchy such ideas had been discredited. Although the Glorious Revolution of 1688 had increased parliamentary power with a constitutional monarchy and the union of the parliaments brought England and Scotland together, towards the end of the 18th century the monarch still had considerable influence over the Parliament of Great Britain which itself was dominated by the English aristocracy and by patronage. Candidates for the House of Commons stood as Whigs or Tories, but once elected formed shifting coalitions of interests rather than splitting along party lines. At general elections, the vote was restricted to property owners in constituencies which were out of date and did not reflect the growing importance of manufacturing towns or shifts of population, so that in many rotten borough seats could be bought or were controlled by rich landowners while major cities remained unrepresented. Discontent with these inequities inspired those individuals who later became known as the \\"Radical Whigs\\". William Beckford fostered early interest in reform in the London area. The \\"Middlesex radicals\\" were led by the politician John Wilkes, an opponent of war with the colonies who started his weekly publication The North Briton in 1764 and within two years had been charged with seditious libel and expelled from the House of Commons. The Society for the Defence of the Bill of Rights which he started in 1769 to support his re-election, developed the belief that every man had the right to vote and \\"natural reason\\" enabling him to properly judge political issues. Liberty consisted in frequent elections and for the first time middle-class radicals obtained the backing of the London \\"mob\\". Middlesex and Westminster were among the few parliamentary constituencies with a large and socially diverse electorate including many artisans as well as the middle class and aristocracy and along with the county association of Yorkshire led by the Reverend Christopher Wyvill were at the forefront of reform activity. The writings of what became known as the \\"Radical Whigs\\" had an influence on the American Revolution. Major John Cartwright also supported the colonists, even as the American Revolutionary War began and in 1776 earned the title of the \\"Father of Reform\\" when he published his pamphlet Take Your Choice! advocating annual parliaments, the secret ballot and manhood suffrage. In 1780, a draft programme of reform was drawn up by Charles James Fox and Thomas Brand Hollis and put forward by a sub-committee of the electors of Westminster. This included calls for the six points later adopted in the People's Charter (see Chartists below). The American Revolutionary War ended in humiliating defeat of a policy which King George III had fervently advocated and in March 1782 the King was forced to appoint an administration led by his opponents which sought to curb Royal patronage. In November 1783, he took his opportunity and used his influence in the House of Lords to defeat a Bill to reform the British East India Company, dismissed the government and appointed William Pitt the Younger as his Prime Minister. Pitt had previously called for Parliament to begin to reform itself, but he did not press for long for reforms the King did not like. Proposals Pitt made in April 1785 to redistribute seats from the \\"rotten boroughs\\" to London and the counties were defeated in the House of Commons by 248 votes to 174.  Popular agitation  In the wake of the French Revolution of 1789, Thomas Paine wrote The Rights of Man (1791) as a response to Burke's counterrevolutionary essay Reflections on the Revolution in France (1790), itself an attack on Richard Price's sermon that kicked off the so-called \\"pamphlet war\\" known as the Revolution Controversy. Mary Wollstonecraft, another supporter of Price, soon followed with A Vindication of the Rights of Woman. They encouraged mass support for democratic reform along with rejection of the monarchy, aristocracy and all forms of privilege. Different strands of the movement developed, with middle class \\"reformers\\" aiming to widen the franchise to represent commercial and industrial interests and towns without parliamentary representation, while \\"Popular radicals\\" drawn from the middle class and from artisans agitated to assert wider rights including relieving distress. The theoretical basis for electoral reform was provided by \\"Philosophical radicals\\" who followed the utilitarian philosophy of Jeremy Bentham and strongly supported parliamentary reform, but were generally hostile to the arguments and tactics of the \\"popular radicals\\". In Ireland, the United Irishmen movement took another direction, adding to the doctrine of a secular and parliamentary republic inspired by the American and French republican revolutions, another doctrine of the French Revolution: civic nationalism. Dismayed by the inability of British parliamentarianism to introduce the root- and-branch democratic reforms desired, Irish Radicals channelled their movement into a republican form of nationalism that would provide equality as well as liberty. This was pursued through armed revolution and often with French assistance at various points over the late eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. Popular Radicals were quick to go further than Paine, with Newcastle schoolmaster Thomas Spence demanding land nationalisation to redistribute wealth in a penny periodical he called Pig's Meat in a reference to Edmund Burke's phrase \\"swinish multitude\\". Radical organisations sprang up, such as the London Corresponding Society of artisans formed in January 1792 under the leadership of the shoemaker Thomas Hardy to call for the vote. One such was the Scottish Friends of the People society which in October 1793 held a British convention in Edinburgh with delegates from some of the English corresponding societies. They issued a manifesto demanding universal male suffrage with annual elections and expressing their support for the principles of the French Revolution. The numbers involved in these movements were small and most wanted reform rather than revolution, but for the first time working men were organising for political change. The government reacted harshly, imprisoning leading Scottish radicals, temporarily suspending habeas corpus in England and passing the Seditious Meetings Act 1795 which meant that a license was needed for any meeting in a public place consisting of fifty or more people. Throughout the Napoleonic Wars, the government took extensive stern measures against feared domestic unrest. The corresponding societies ended, but some radicals continued in secret, with Irish sympathisers in particular forming secret societies to overturn the government and encourage mutinies. In 1812, Major John Cartwright formed the first Hampden Club, named after the English Civil War Parliamentary leader John Hampden, aiming to bring together middle class moderates and lower class radicals. After the Napoleonic Wars, the Corn laws (in force between 1815 and 1846) and bad harvests fostered discontent. The publications of William Cobbett were influential and at political meetings speakers like Henry Hunt complained that only three men in a hundred had the vote. Writers like the radicals William Hone and Thomas Jonathan Wooler spread dissent with publications such as The Black Dwarf in defiance of a series of government acts to curb circulation of political literature. Radical riots in 1816 and 1817 were followed by the Peterloo massacre of 1819 publicised by Richard Carlile, who then continued to fight for press freedom from prison. The Six Acts of 1819 limited the right to demonstrate or hold public meetings. In Scotland, agitation over three years culminated in an attempted general strike and abortive workers' uprising crushed by government troops in the \\"Radical War\\" of 1820. Magistrates powers were increased to crush demonstrations by manufacturers and action by radical Luddites. To counter the established Church of England doctrine that the aristocratic social order was divinely ordained, radicals supported Lamarckian Evolutionism, a theme proclaimed by street corner agitators as well as some established scientists such as Robert Edmund Grant.  Political reform  Economic conditions improved after 1821 and the United Kingdom government made economic and criminal law improvements, abandoning policies of repression. In 1823, Jeremy Bentham co-founded the Westminster Review with James Mill as a journal for \\"philosophical radicals\\", setting out the utilitarian philosophy that right actions were to be measured in proportion to the greatest good they achieved for the greatest number. Westminster elected two radicals to Parliament during the 1820s. The Whigs gained power and despite defeats in the House of Commons and the House of Lords the Reform Act 1832 was put through with the support of public outcry, mass meetings of \\"political unions\\" and riots in some cities. This now enfranchised the middle classes, but failed to meet radical demands. The Whigs introduced reforming measures owing much to the ideas of the philosophic radicals, abolishing slavery and in 1834 introducing Malthusian Poor Law reforms which were bitterly opposed by \\"popular radicals\\" and writers like Thomas Carlyle. Following the 1832 Reform Act, the mainly aristocratic Whigs in the House of Commons were joined by a small number of parliamentary Radicals as well as an increased number of middle class Whigs. By 1839, they were informally being called \\"the Liberal party\\".  Chartists  From 1836, working class Radicals unified around the Chartist cause of electoral reform expressed in the People's Charter drawn up by six members of Parliament and six from the London Working Men's Association (associated with Owenite Utopian socialism), which called for six points: universal suffrage, equal-sized electoral districts, secret ballot, an end to property qualification for Parliament, pay for Members of Parliament and Annual Parliaments. Chartists also expressed economic grievances, but their mass demonstrations and petitions to parliament were unsuccessful. Despite initial disagreements, after their failure their cause was taken up by the middle class Anti-Corn Law League founded by Richard Cobden and John Bright in 1839 to oppose duties on imported grain which raised the price of food and so helped landowners at the expense of ordinary people.  Liberal reforms  The parliamentary Radicals joined with the Whigs and anti- protectionist Tory Peelites to form the Liberal Party by 1859. Demand for parliamentary reform increased by 1864 with agitation from John Bright and the Reform League. When the Liberal government led by Lord Russell and William Ewart Gladstone introduced a modest bill for parliamentary reform, it was defeated by both Tories and reform Liberals, forcing the government to resign. The Tories under Lord Derby and Benjamin Disraeli took office and the new government decided to \\"dish the Whigs\\" and \\"take a leap in the dark\\" to take the credit for the reform. As a minority government, they had to accept radical amendments and Disraeli's Reform Act 1867 almost doubled the electorate, giving the vote even to working men. The Radicals, having been strenuous in their efforts on behalf of the working classes, earned a deeply loyal following‚ÄîBritish trade unionists from 1874 until 1892, upon being elected to Parliament, never considered themselves to be anything other than Radicals and were labeled Lib-Lab candidates. Radical trade unionists formed the basis for what later became the Labour Party. === Belgium === The territories of modern Belgium had been merged into the Kingdom of the Netherlands in 1815. Aside from various religious and socioeconomic tensions between the Dutch north and proto-Belgian south, over the 1820s a young generation of Belgians, heavily influenced by French Enlightenment ideas, had formulated criticisms of the Dutch monarchy as autocratic. The monarch enjoyed broad personal powers, his ministers were irresponsible before parliament; the separation of powers was minimal; freedom of press and association were limited; the principle of universal suffrage was undermined by the fact that the largely Catholic south, despite possessing two-thirds of the population, received as many seats to the Estates-General (parliament) as the smaller Protestant north; and the Dutch authorities were suspected of forcing Protestantism onto Catholics. These concerns combined to produce a pro- Catholic Radicalism distinct from both the anticlerical Radicalism of France, and the Protestant Liberalism of the Dutch north. Following the political crisis of 1829, where the Crown Prince was named prime minister, a limited reform was introduced establishing constitutional rights, similar to the charter of rights of France's autocratic Restoration Monarchy; the Belgian Radicals, like their French counterparts, regarded such a charter of rights as insufficient, potentially revocable by a whim of the monarch. Belgian Radicals closely followed the situation in France when, on 26 July to 1 August 1830, a conservative-liberal revolution broke out, overthrowing the autocratic monarchy for a liberal constitutional monarchy. Within a month a revolt had erupted in Brussels before spreading to the rest of the Belgian provinces. After Belgian independence, the Constitution of 1831 established a constitutional monarchy and parliamentary regime, and provided a list of fundamental civil rights inspired by the French Declaration of the Right of Man. As in Britain, Radicals in Belgium continued to operate within the Liberal Party, campaigning throughout the 19th Century for the property- restricted suffrage to be extended. This was extended a first time in 1883, and universal male suffrage was achieved in 1893 (though female suffrage would have to wait until 1919). After this Radicalism was a minor political force in Belgium, its role taken over by the emergence of a powerful social-democratic party. === France === During the nineteenth century, the Radicals in France were the political group of the far-left, relative to the centre-left \\"opportunists\\" (Gambetta: conservative-liberal and republican), the centre- right Orl√©anists (conservative-liberal and monarchist), the far-right Legitimists (anti-liberal monarchist), and the supporters of a republican military dictatorship,the Bonapartists. Following the Napoleonic Wars and until 1848, it was technically illegal to advocate republicanism openly. Some republicans reconciled themselves to pursuing liberalism through the socially- conservative monarchy‚Äîthe 'opportunists'. Those who remained intransigent in believing that the French Revolution needed to be completed through a republican regime based on parliamentary democracy and universal suffrage therefore tended to call themselves \\"Radicals\\" ‚Äì a term meaning 'Purists'. Under the Second Republic (1848‚Äì52), the Radicals, on a platform of seeking a \\"social and democratic republic\\", sat together in parliament in a group named The Mountain. When Louis-Napol√©on Bonaparte launched his military coup, Radicals across France rose up in insurrection to defend the democratic republic. This experience would mark French Radicalism for the next century, prompting permanent vigilance against all those who ‚Äì from Marshall Mac-Mahon to General De Gaulle ‚Äì were suspected of seeking to overthrow the constitutional, parliamentary regime. After the return to parliamentary democracy in 1871, the Radicals emerged as a significant political force: led by Georges Clemenceau, they claimed that the socially-conservative liberal republicanism of L√©on Gambetta and Jules Ferry had drifted away from the ideals of the French Revolution, and that the Radicals were the true heirs to 1791. In 1881, they put forward their programme of broad social reforms: from then on, the tactic of the main Radical Party was to have 'no enemies to the left' of the Republic, allying with any group that sought social reform while accepting the legality of the parliamentary republic. The Radicals were not yet a political party as they sat together in parliament out of kinship, but they possessed minimal organisation outside of parliament. The first half of the Third Republic saw several events that caused them to fear a far-right takeover of parliament that might end democracy, as Louis-Napol√©on had: Marshall Mac-Mahon's self-coup in 1876, the General Boulanger crisis in the 1880s, the Dreyfus Affair in the 1890s. The Radicals were swept to power first in a coalition government (1899) then in governments of their own from 1902. They finally managed to implement their long-standing programme of reforms, such as the separation of Church and State, or the introduction of secret ballotting. In order to ensure that their legacy would remain unreversed, they unified the local Radical committees into an elector party: the Radical- Socialist Party, the first major modern political party in French history. Intellectuals played a powerful role. A major spokesman of radicalism was √âmile Chartier (1868-1951), who wrote under the pseudonym \\"Alain.\\" He was a leading theorist of radicalism, and his influence extended through the Third and Fourth Republics. He stressed individualism, seeking to defend the citizen against the state. He warned against all forms of power ‚Äì military, clerical, and economic. To oppose them he exalted the small farmer, the small shopkeeper, the small town, and the little man. He idealized country life and saw Paris as a dangerous font of power.Patrick H. Hutton, ed. Historical Dictionary of the Third French Republic, 1870-1940 (1986) vol 1 pp 12-13. The Radical‚ÄìSocialist Party was the main governmental party of the Third Republic between 1901 and 1919, and dominated government again between 1924‚Äì26, 1932‚Äì33 and 1937‚Äì40; the centre-right governments dominated by the conservative- liberal centre-right often gave a portfolio to a Radical, who would join cabinet in a personal capacity as the most left-leaning minister. The party itself was discredited after 1940, due to fact that many (though not all) of its parliamentarians had votedto establish the Vichy regime. Under the dictatorship several prominent Radicals, such as the young left-leaning former education minister Jean Zay, and the influential editorialist Maurice Sarraut (brother to the more famous Radical party leader Albert), were assassinated by the regime's paramilitary police, while others, notably Jean Moulin, participated in the resistance movement to restore the Republic. The Democratic and Socialist Union of the Resistance was established after World War II to combine the politics of French Radicalism with credibility derived from members' activism in the French resistance. In the 1950s, Pierre Mend√®s- France attempted to rebuilt the Radical Party as an alternative to both the Christian-democratic MRP, while also leading the opposition to Gaullism which he feared to be another attempt at a right-wing coup. During this period the Radicals frequently governed as part of a coalition of centrist parties, spanning from the Socialists to the Christian-democrats. Ultimately the installation of the Fifth Republic in 1958, and the subsequent emergence of a two-party system based on the Socialist and Gaullist movements, destroyed the niche for an autonomous Radical party. The Radical Party split into various tendencies. Its leading personality, Mend√®s-France himself, left in 1961 in protest at the party's acceptance of De Gaulle's military coup and joining the small social-democratic Unified Socialist Party. A decade later, a second faction advocated maintaining an alliance with the Socialist-dominated coalition of the left; it broke away in 1972 to form the Radical Party of the Left, which maintains close ties to the Socialist Party. The remainder of the original Radical Party became a de facto liberal-conservative party of the centre-right: renamed as the 'Valoisien' Radical Party, it advocated alliances with the rest of the liberal centre-right, participating first in the pro- Giscard d'Estaing Union for French Democracy (1972), then with the conservative Union for a Popular Movement (2002). === Continental Europe and Latin America === In continental Europe and Latin America, as for instance in France, Italy, Spain, Chile and Argentina (Radical Civic Union), Radicalism developed as an ideology in the 19th century to indicate those who supported at least in theory a republican form of government, universal male suffrage and, particularly, anti-clerical policies. In German-speaking countries, this current is known as Freisinn (literally \\"free mind\\", or \\"freethought\\"), as in German Freeminded Party from 1884 to 1893, then Eugen Richter's Freeminded People's Party; and the Free Democratic Party of Switzerland. The Freethinker parties, located mainly in the Netherlands, Scandinavia and German-speaking countries, included: * In Switzerland: ** The Radical movement (or \\"Free- thinking\\" movement in the German-speaking cantons), not yet a political party, emerged during the period of Regeneration, starting 1830 (coincident with the French July Revolution). It became the dominant political force under the 1848 Constitution, holding all seven posts in the Federal Council until 1891. ** The Radical-Democratic Party (PRD; in French-speaking Switzerland), also known as the Free-minded Democratic Party (FDP; in German-speaking Switzerland) existed from 1894 to 2009. It started as a centre-left party but gradually moved to the centre-right in the course of time. It was still by far the strongest party until the 1940s, holding at least four of seven posts in the Federal Council. Under the 1959 \\"magic formula\\" it held two of seven posts in the Federal Council. ** The Radical-Liberal Party (PLR), or FDP.The Liberals (in the German-speaking regions), was formed in 2009 by the merger of PRD/FDP with the smaller, more right-leaning Liberal Party of Switzerland. * In the Netherlands: ** Free-minded Democratic League, a political party in the Netherlands from 1901 to 1946 * In Germany, a succession of Radical parties existed: ** The German Free-minded Party (1884 to 1893), which split into two successors: ** The left-leaning Free-minded People's Party (1893 to 1910) ** The centre-leaning Free-minded Union (1893 to 1910) ** These merged as the Progressive People's Party (1910 to 1918) ** This was reformed as the German Democratic Party (DDP; 1918 to 1930) ** The Radical Democratic Party formed by left-leaning and pacifist members of the DDP (1930 to 1933) * In Denmark: ** The current Liberal Party began as a radical party in 1870, hence its name in Danish (Venstre, meaning 'Left'). When it became more conservative, the Radical wing split in 1905 to form a new party, known as Radikale Venstre ('Radical Left'). In Mediterranean Europe, Radical parties were often labelled 'Democratic' or 'Republican' parties: * In France, during the nineteenth and the first half of the twentieth century, radicalism was intertwined with republicanism to the point that radical parties were often simply labelled 'republicans'. The election of Alexandre Ledru-Rollin in 1841 is generally considered the start of the radical-republican movement as a political force in France. Over the next century a pattern emerged of Radicals forming a party on the left of the parliamentary spectrum (but to the right of socialists), only for the party to drift to the centre, which would cause the party's left to splinter off and re-establish a new main Radical party while the weakened parent party was eventually absorbed by the liberal centre. This meant that there were generally two rival Radical parties at any one time, one leaning relatively towards socialism, and the other relatively towards liberalism. ** La Montagne (The Mountain) (1848-51) was the first parliamentary group to provide a home for France's miscellaneous radical republicans. Its official name, the Socialist Democrat group, signalled its two tendencies: the more socialist-leaning tendency of Louis Blanc, and the more middle-class democratic-reformist tendency of Alexandre Ledru-Rollin. At that time it represented a very small political current situated on the far-left of the parliamentary spectrum. ** The Republican Union (1871-84), led by L√©on Gambetta, was the Mountain's spiritual successor during the transition to democracy; its members included former parliamentarians of the Montagne such as Louis Blanc, and prominent Radical intellectuals like Victor Hugo. A minor force at first, by 1876 it had grown in parliamentary strength but begun to drift towards centrist cooperation with liberal Catholics; this prompted the party's more fervent radicals to splinter off in several waves and form new Radical parties (Georges Clemenceau in 1876; Ren√© Goblet's Radical Left in 1881; Isambart's Progressive Union in 1894). ** The Progressive Union (1894-1902) was originally a splinter of the Republican Union by left-leaning radicals during the Dreyfus Affair. In 1902 the formation of the major new Radical-Socialist Party to its immediate left forced it to pick a political family, and it chose to ally then merge with other centrist parties to form the politically-liberal Republican Democratic Alliance. ** Radical Left (1881-1940), a parliamentary group initially formed by hardline anticlerical radicals dissatisfied with the Republican Union's centrism. It was a major political force in centre-left and centrist governments between 1898 and 1918, and regularly provided ministers in centrist and right-wing governments between 1918 and 1940; the importance of this current was underlined by its leader, the veteran Radical Georges Clemenceau, being called to lead the war government during the First World War. The foundation of the PRRRS to its left in 1901 pushed it one space towards the centre and it increasingly drifted into alliance with the liberal republican centre-right. By 1918 it was de facto a party of the centre-right, and from 1936 was essentially absorbed by the liberal right, its old political niche taken over by the PRRRS. ** The Radical-Socialist Party (officially the Radical, Republican and Radical- Socialist Party or PRRRS), the most famous of France's many radical parties. It was the dominant political force in France from 1901 to 1919, and a major force from 1920 to 1940. Due to its central political role it could alternate in and out of alliance with both socialists and with conservative-liberals; this prompted several splinters by the party's most left- and right-wing members: ** Centrist and centre-right Radical splinters: The Social and Unionist Radical Party (1928-37) was a small splinter of anti-socialist radicals from the PRRRS, led by Henry Franklin-Bouillon, who preferred to ally with the centrist Radical Left and other liberal rifhtwing parties. The French Radical Party (1937-38) was a similar small anti-communist splinter, led by Andr√© Grisoni. These two small groups merged in 1938 as the short-lived Independent Radical Party, which was itself restored after the Second World War and was a founding organisation of the Alliance of Left Republicans. ** Independent Radical Party (1937-40), a merger of the Unionist Radical Party and the French Radical Party. ** Social-democratic Radical splinters: The Republican-Socialist Party (1911-1935) and the French Socialist Party (1923-35) were two small parties formed of left-wing Radicals philosophically close to social-democracy or rightwing social-democrats philosophically close to Radicalism, but unable or unwilling to join either the official socialist party or the PRRRS. Although electorally small, they were a significant political force as they regularly provided ministers and heads of government in left-wing and centrist coalitions. They merged with other social-democratic parties and independents in 1935 as the Socialist Republican Union. ** The Camille Pelletain Radical Party, a small splinter of anti-fascists from the PRRRS that briefly existed between 1934-36. The party opposed the willingness by the PRRRS's party leaders during 1934-35 to prefer cooperation with the right and far-right rather than with other left-wing parties. Its name was a reference to a leading historical figure of left-wing Radicalism, Camile Pelletain, as a way to lay claim to an authentic Radical tradition felt to have been abandoned by the official party. Once the PRRRS returned to allying with the rest of the left in 1936, the Pelletanist Radicals returned to the old party. ** After the Second World War, the pre-war Radical-Socialist Party, Radical Left party and their smaller counterparts were left discredited and weakened as communism, social-democracy, Christian-democracy and Gaullism exploded in popularity. The remaining Radicals mostly banded together with the remnants of other pre-war liberal parties to form a centre-right umbrella party named the Rally of the Republican Left: this was no longer distinctly Radical in ideology, but espoused laissez-faire parliamentary liberal- democracy. * In Spain, Radicalism took the form of various 'democratic', 'progressive', 'republican' and 'radical' parties. ** The Progressive Party (1835-69), formed by former participants in the radical Revolution of 1820; ** The Democratic Party (1849‚Äì69), split from the Progressive Party, a progressive party of Jacobin inspiration, mainly active in the 1850s. It split into two successor parties: ** The Federal Democratic Republican Party (1868‚Äì1910) or \\"Federal Party\\" for short, whose leaders Estanislao Figueras, Francesc Pi i Margall and Emilio Castelar were Presidents during the First Republic (1873‚Äì74), and ** The Radical Democratic Party (or just \\"Radical Party\\") (1869/71‚Äì76), whose leader Manuel Ruiz Zorrilla was Prime Minister for two short periods in 1871 and 1872‚Äì73; later known as the Republican Reformist Party (1876‚Äì80). It was refounded as the Progressive Republican Party (1880‚Äì1912), whose majority merged into the Republican Union Party (1903‚Äì10) ** The Democratic Party (1876‚Äì79), split from the Federal Democratic Republican Party, reformed as the Possibilist Democratic Party (1879‚Äì90) ** The Radical Republican Party (1908‚Äì36), a splinter of the Republican Union Party, becoming the major radical party of the Second Republic (1931‚Äì1936/39), moving to the centre-right under Alejandro Lerroux (Prime Minister from 1933 to 1935); ** Its leftist splinter, the Radical-Socialist Republican Party (1928‚Äì34). This merged with others to form the Republican Left (1934‚Äì59) ** A second splinter of the Radical-Republican Party formed the Republican Democratic Party and Republican Union (1934‚Äì59) ** Reformist Party (1912‚Äì24) and its successor Republican Action (1925‚Äì34) which was to the left of Radical Republican Party; merged into the Republican Left; its leader Manuel Aza√±a was two-time Prime Minister of the Second Republic (1931‚Äì33 and 1936) * In Italy: ** Action Party, formed by Risorgimento leaders around Giuseppe Mazzini, striving for a unitary, secular Italian republic with universal suffrage, popular sovereignty and freedom of speech (1848/53‚Äì1867) ** \\"Historical Far Left\\" also known as \\"Party of Democracy\\" (1867/77‚Äì1904) ** Italian Republican Party (founded in 1895) ** Italian Radical Party (1904‚Äì1922) ** Liberals‚ÄìDemocrats‚ÄìRadicals (1919‚Äì1921) ** Democratic Liberal Party (Italy) (1921‚Äì26) ** Action Party (1942‚Äì47) ** Radical Party (1955‚Äì1989) === Serbia and Montenegro === Radicalism had played a pivotal role in the birth and development of parliamentarism and the construction of the modern Serbian state leading to the Yugoslavian unification. The People's Radical Party formed in 1881 was the strongest political party and was in power in the Kingdom of Serbia more than all others together. The 1888 Constitution of the Kingdom of Serbia that defined it as an independent nation and formalised parliamentary democracy was among the most advanced in the entire world due to Radical contribution and it is known as The Radical Constitution. In 1902, a crack had occurred in which the Independent Radical Party left and \\"the Olde\\" remained in the party, leading the original People's Radical Party to stray far from progressivism and into right-wing nationalism and conservatism. In the Kingdom of Yugoslavia, the Independent Radicals united with the rest of the Serbian opposition and the liberal and civic groups in the rest of the new country, forming the Yugoslav Democratic Party, while several Republican dissidents formed a Republican Party. The NRS had promoted Serb nationalism and put itself as the defender of Serb national interests. Democrats and Radicals were the dominant political parties, especially since the exclusion of the Communists. In Montenegro, a People's Party was formed in 1907 as the country's first political party and remained the largest in the period of country's parliamentary history until the Yugoslavian unification. Later, a True People's Party was formed, which never got widespread popular support and whose bigger part had joined the original NS, but the difference was not ideological and instead was opposition and support of the Crown and sometimes in foreign relations to Serbia (the clubbists were the crown's dissidents and supporters of the people as well as Serbia as a regional power and brotherly ally‚Äîthe rightists were generally anti-democratic and autocratic monarchist and also distrustful to the Serbian government's acts on the national plan). == See also == * Cultural radicalism * Danish Social Liberal Party, literally The Radical Left * Industrial Radical Party, a fictional party in the British Empire in the novel The Difference Engine * Italian Radicals * Left- libertarianism * Progressivism (comparison) * Radical democracy * Radical Party (France) * Radical Party of the Left * Radicals (UK) * Transnational Radical Party == References  Further reading == * * == External links == * British History Online ‚Äì London Radicalism * Kramnick, \\"English middle-class radicalism in the eighteenth century\\" * London Chartism * Public & Republic ‚Äì The New English Radicals * Radical Reformers * Reformers ‚Äì William Cobbett * Scotland Guide ‚Äì Thomas Muir (and the 1820 Radical War: extracts from Steel's Scotland's Story) * The Transatlantic 1790s: Project: Loyalists ‚Äì Radical Activities * USA: Readers Companion to American History ‚Äì Radicalism * WWW-VL: History: US Radicalism Category:History of social movements Category:Liberalism Category:Radical parties Category:Social liberalism ","title":"Radicalism (historical)"},{"id":"2224861","text":"The Mporokoso Group is the name given to a sedimentary succession of fluvial, lacustrine and aeolian sandstones and minor siltstones occurring on the Bangweulu Block of northern Zambia.

His Austrian-Polish mother was a house pianist, introducing him to music at a young age. He began playing the piano between ages 5-6 and started studying music around age 10. His father was involved in business as a stockbroker. He did not approve of Suri√±ach pursing music and confided in their other son who followed in his footsteps of business. He said that he was never serious about music but always loved it. Taught by his mother through age 14, he studied piano and music theory at the Caminals Academy of Music. He held conducting posts at the Orquestra Simf√≤nica de Barcelona and the Gran Teatre del Liceu. He studied composition and orchestration under Enrique Morera, who is the director of Barcelona Conservatory. He then went to Madrid, followed by Germany where he studied in Berlin with Max Trapp and Richard Strauss, taking five of Strauss' seminars. In 1944 he returned to Barcelona as new conductor of the Barcelona Philharmonic Orchestra where his opera El mozo que cas√≥ con mujer brava and \\"Passacaglia-Sinfonia\\" was premiered. By his mid 20s, he transform from an inside composer to an outside composer, with the help of the opera house and conductor position. ==Career== In late 1950, Carlos Suri√±ach emigrated to the United States, in hopes of becoming a successful published composer. World War II just recently finished and European publishers were frantically republishing previous music of the greats: Beethoven, Mendelssohn, Chapin, etc. Full of ambition, he first stopped in New York to conduct an orchestra. In May of 1951, a concert featuring the New York's most elite artists was held at the Museum of Modern Art. Works of his, Martha Graham, Israel's Batsheva, Jose Lemon, Balanchine, Doris Humphrey, and many others were all featured in the concert. His first lively premiere of Ritmo Jondo, repeated itself as requested by the audience. The composition was 6 minutes in duration, written for the clarinet, trumpet, xylophone, timpani, and 3 hand clappers. Carlos Suri√±ach's work was unknown until this point. The performance pivoted his career to an upward hill. Only a week after the concert, Doris Humphrey and Jose Limon came to his apartment to request and discuss using his compositions in a ballet. The successful collaboration was showcased in April of 1953 at the Alvin Theatre. He wrote the 20 minute-long work for a broadway orchestra made of 23 musicians. Near after, he worked more closely with Doris Humphrey to create second version of the ballet. He conducted numerous recordings with MGM Records. Years following the premiere of \\"Ritmo Jondo\\", the modern dancer and choreographer, Martha Graham, approached Suri√±ach. She had purchased a record with one of his tracks, where she proceeded to choreograph an 8-minute piece to without Suri√±ach's knowledge. Although this was illegal, he turned a blind eye when he became hysterical from watching the piece. He was full of passion while watching the piece and admired Graham for her brilliance. In addition to using the single track, Graham requested to work with him, elongating the piece and adding more pieces of orchestra. He composed three ballet scores Martha Graham: Embattled Garden (1958), Acrobats of God (1960), and The Owl and the Pussycat (1978). Martha Graham was given a Capezio Prize for \\"Acrobats of God\\" and gave him a massive commission for his compositional work. It is also impressive that the production of \\"The Owl and the Pussycat\\" came together in a short 6 months. Another collaboration \\"Agathe's Tale\\", choreographed by Paul Taylor, was premiered in 1967. He also composed Feast of Ashes for the Joffrey Ballet. Showcased on numerous occasions by the Louisville Symphony and Orchestra, under Rockefeller, conductor's commissions were $1 million each. Reworking original electronic music, Suri√±ach composed \\"Chronic\\" the ballet, performed at the Mark Hellinger Theatre in 1973. His Harp Concerto was commissioned by Charles Royce for his daughter Maria. The premiere was in Grand Rapids, Michigan, in 1978, with Nicanor Zabaleta playing the solo part. The concerto was then performed by Maria Royce at Interlochen. The Surinach Harp Concerto has not been played since. Traditional elements of flamenco, spanish culture, and American-born music makes Suri√±ach a unique composer. He became a U.S. citizen in 1959. Surinach also orchestrated part of Isaac Alb√©niz's piano suite Iberia. His notable students include Louis W. Ballard. He worked with many choreographers including Doris Humphrey, Jose Limon, Martha Graham, Paul Taylor, Robert Coin, Antonio at the Ballets of Madrid, and more. Surinach died in New Haven, Connecticut, United States, on November 12, 1997. The BMI Foundation sponsors The Carlos Surinach Awards and Commissioning Programs, which recognizes talented emerging young musicians for their service to American music and funds the creation of new works by former winners of the BMI Student Composer Awards. The program was established by a bequest from Surinach. The final \\"ch\\" in Surinach's surname is pronounced \\"k\\", following ancient Catalan orthography (in modern orthography this phoneme is rendered with a \\"c\\"). The \\"ch\\" ending is commonly found in Catalan surnames, many of which retain this spelling. Also, before Surinach left Spain, his surname was spelled \\"Suri√±ach\\", with a tilde over the \\"n\\". He eventually dropped this tilde, but saw the original spelling used on concert posters whenever he visited Spain. ==Works== * Symphony No. 1, Sinfon√≠a Passacaglia (1945) * El mozo que cas√≥ con mujer brava (1948), opera * Symphony No. 2 (1949‚Äì50) * Sinfonietta Flamenca (1953) * Ritmo Jondo (1953), ballet * Hollywood Carnival (1954) * Fandango (1954) * Feria Magica (1956), overture * Concertino for Piano, Strings and Cymbals (1956) * Symphony No. 3, Sinfon√≠a Chica (1957) * Embattled Garden (1958), ballet * Paeans and Dances of Heathen Iberia (1959) * Sonatina (1959), for solo guitar * Acrobats of God (1960), ballet * Symphonic Variations for Orchestra (1962) * Feast of Ashes (1962), ballet * Cantata of St. John (1962) * Songs of the Soul (1964), for chorus * Drama Jondo (1965) * Melorhythmic Dramas (1966) * Flamenco Cyclothymia (1967) * Via Crucis: a cycle of fifteen saetas (1970), for chorus and guitar * Concerto for piano and orchestra (1973) * Prayers (1973), for solo voice * Chronique (1974), ballet * Celebraciones Medievales (1977), for chorus * Concerto for String Orchestra (1978) * The Owl and the Pussycat (1978), ballet * Harp Concerto (1978) * Violin Concerto (1980) * Melismas sinf√≥nicos (1985) * Quimera (1989), ballet * Double concerto for flute, double bass and chamber orchestra (1990) ==References== https://www.britannica.com/biography/Carlos-Surinach ==External links== https://www.britannica.com/biography/Carlos-Surinach * Carlos Surinach page from Schirmer site * Carlos Surinach Commissions page from BMI site * BMI Surinach collection, 1900s-1996 Music Division, The New York Public Library. * ===Interviews=== *Carlos Surinach interview, February 15, 1987 Category:1915 births Category:1997 deaths Category:20th-century classical composers Category:Spanish classical composers Category:Catalan composers Category:American male classical composers Category:American classical composers Category:American opera composers Category:Ballet composers Category:Spanish emigrants to the United States Category:Musicians from Barcelona Category:20th-century Spanish musicians Category:20th-century American composers Category:20th-century American male musicians ","title":"Carlos Surinach"},{"id":"2224877","text":"The District Court of New South Wales is the intermediate court in the judicial hierarchy of the Australian state of New South Wales.

The Chief Judge of the District Court, since 2014, is the Honourable Justice Derek Price . ==History== By 1850, the court system in the Colony of New South Wales consisted of: * The Supreme Court of New South Wales which, under the Third Charter of Justice sealed in 1823, had a criminal and civil jurisdiction similar to that of the superior Courts of England; * Courts of General and Quarter Sessions which could deal with ‚Äúcrimes and misdemeanours not punishable by death‚Äù; * Court of Requests in Sydney and the County of Cumberland, with a civil jurisdiction not exceeding 30; and * Courts of Petty Sessions, which dealt with criminal misdemeanours in a summary way and had a civil jurisdiction up to 10 (or 30 if the defendant consented). The population of NSW increased as a result of the gold rush of 1851 and became more dispersed. Litigation grew as the Colony prospered, and crime was not declining. The Supreme Court began to fall seriously into arrears, and this was not helped by the fact that it did not visit a lot of towns. Courts of Quarter Sessions were also few in number and had no civil jurisdiction. By the mid-1850s there were calls for a revision of the court system, to meet the growing needs of the Colony. As a result, the parliament passed the District Courts Act 1858 (NSW).. This Act established District Courts, which divided the Colony into Districts and created a court of record for each district with a civil jurisdiction up to 200, to replace the Courts of Requests. Judges of the District Courts were also appointed as Chairman of any Court of Quarter Sessions or General Sessions, to be held within the limits of that District. The purpose of the Act was briefly described as: > District Courts were established by the Legislature for the purpose of > simplifying legal proceedings in the recovery of amounts under ¬£200, and > lessening the expenses of attending such proceedings, as well as to > relieving the Supreme Court of some portion of the overwhelming civil > business which the rapid progress of the colony had lately engendered. The > Act providing for the institution of these Courts also extended the > jurisdiction of Courts of General and Quarter Sessions of the Peace, and > prepared the way for a great increase in their numbers, under the presidency > of District Court Judges as Chairmen, whereby criminal proceedings have been > much facilitated, especially in the more distant and outlying portions of > the country. The jurisdiction of the District Courts was increased from time to time. Incremental changes were introduced after World War II. The position of Chairman of the District Court Judges was introduced in 1950 to exercise administrative functions in relation to the courts similar to role of the Chief Justice in the Supreme Court. From 1955 instead of being appointed to a specific district, judges began to be appointed to \\"all district courts\\". The intermediate courts were reformed in 1973 by the District Court Act 1973, which abolished the Courts of Quarter Sessions and each of the District Courts and amalgamated their jurisdictions into a single District Court of New South Wales, with a statewide criminal and civil jurisdiction. ==Structure and jurisdictionCriminal jurisdiction=== The District Court deals with a wide range of criminal matters. The only charges that the District Court cannot deal with are murder or treason, which must be dealt with by the Supreme Court. The types of criminal matters dealt with by the District Court include: *offences against the person: including offences like manslaughter, malicious wounding to inflict grievous bodily harm and dangerous driving; *assaults: including offences like common assault, assault occasioning actual bodily harm and assault of police officers; *sexual assaults: including offences like sexual assault, indecent assault and carnal knowledge; *offences relating to property: including offences like robbery from the person, break, enter and steal, larceny (stealing) and embezzlement; *offences involving illicit drug use: including offences like the importation of heroin and other drugs into Australia, prohibited supply of drugs and possess prohibited drug; and *offences involving fraud: including offences like passing valueless cheques, obtaining money by deception and forgery. ===Civil jurisdiction=== In its civil jurisdiction the Court may deal with all motor accident cases, irrespective of the amount claimed and other claims to a maximum amount of 750,000, although it may deal with matters exceeding this amount if the parties consent. In addition, the Court may deal with equitable claims or demands for recovery of money or damages for amounts not exceeding A$750,000. The Court is also empowered to deal with applications under the Property (Relationships) Act 1984, the Succession Act 2006, that involve amounts, or property to the value of, not more than A$250,000. Jurisdiction in equity proceedings. ===Residual jurisdiction=== Most of the work in residual jurisdiction is handled by the Workers Compensation Commission. However, some matters that are handled by the District Court include: *the concerning police officers \\"hurt on duty\\" and the concerning the payment of superannuation benefits to police officers *payment under the Police Regulations (Superannuation) Act 1906 (NSW), paid to STC (the SAS Trustee Corporation continued under the ) and special risk benefits payable by the Commissioner of Police *the concerning workers in or about a coal mine *the *the Sporting Injuries Insurance Scheme *the ===Appellate jurisdiction=== The District Court has appellate jurisdiction for decisions made by the Local Court of New South Wales and the Children's Court of New South Wales, where a review of both sentencing and convictions may be heard before the Court. Appeals against District Court decisions are made to the Supreme Court, the Court of Appeal or the Court of Criminal Appeal. ==See also== *List of Judges of the District Court of NSW *List of New South Wales courts and tribunals ==References== Category:New South Wales courts and tribunals Category:1858 establishments in Australia Category:Courts and tribunals established in 1858 ","title":"District Court of New South Wales"},{"id":"2224881","text":"Urban planning in Singapore has formulated and guided its physical development from the day :Singapore was founded in 1819 as a British colony to the developed, independent country it is today. Urban planning is especially important due to land constraints and its high density. The Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA) is Singapore's national land-use planning authority. URA prepares long term strategic plans, as well as detailed local area plans, for physical development, and then co-ordinates and guides efforts to bring these plans to reality. Prudent land use planning has enabled Singapore to enjoy strong economic growth and social cohesion, and ensures that sufficient land is safeguarded to support continued economic progress and future development.About Us, Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA) ==History== Stamford Bridge, Singapore. ===Initial planning=== The founding of modern Singapore in 1819 by Sir Stamford Raffles was arguably a planning event in itself, as it involved the search for a deep, sheltered harbour suitable to establish a pivotal maritime base for British interests in the Far East. The location also needed to keep Britain's maritime trading routes on the East- West axis protected. The British allowed Chinese labourers to migrate in large numbers into the island to make it an immigrant majority country to safeguard their trade in the Far East. The settlers found the waters of Keppel Harbour suitable, and an entourage of eight ships anchored off the mouth of a small river on 28 January 1819. Raffles made landing on the north bank of the river and discovered favourable conditions for the setting up of a colony. The area on the side of the river's north bank was level and firm, but the southern bank was swampy. The settlers found abundant fresh water, and the river itself was a sheltered body of water protected by the curved river mouth. The river was to become the nexus from which the new colony would thrive, and the immediate surrounding areas would form the core of the island's business and civic areas.\\"Home, work, play\\" Sumiko Tan, Urban Redevelopment Authority, 1999 Upon its formal establishment with the signing of a treaty on 6 February the same year, Raffles left the settlement, leaving Colonel William Farquhar as the first Resident of Singapore. By the end of May, Raffles returned, and while noting the rapid development of the city, realised the need for a formal urban plan to guide its otherwise disorganised physical expansion. He left the colony again, instructing Farquhar to designate residential, commercial, and governmental land uses for the colony. When he returned more than two years later in October 1822, however, Raffles was dismayed by the way the colony had grown. He therefore formed a Town Committee headed by Lieutenant Philip Jackson to draw up a formal plan for the colony, which came to be known as the Jackson Plan. The plan was the first detailed city plan for Singapore. It laid the groundwork of the city's street and zonal layout, the essence of which continues today. For example, the allocation of civic institutions on the north bank of the Singapore River and the creation of the main commercial area in what was then known as \\"Commercial Square\\" on the south bank have today evolved into the Civic district and the CBD on either side of the river. The grid-like street patterns continue to exist. While the ethnically segregated residential zones are largely depopulated by now, they continue as the ethnic enclaves Chinatown, Little India, and Kampong Glam, attracting the attention of tourists. ===Post-Raffles=== Raffles's foresight and well-intended efforts to maintain orderliness in the city's growth started to spiral out of control just eight years after the Jackson Plan was drawn up. With no updates and no new plans drawn up by the British, the city soon outgrew itself, and the plan soon proved completely inadequate. When Raffles arrived in 1819, the population numbered about 150. By 1911, this figure had mushroomed to 185,000, resulting in severe overcrowding, particularly in the Chinatown area. The road system, planned for travel by foot and horse carts, also could not handle the exploding traffic, particularly when motorised vehicles came to Singapore en masse in the 1910s. The 842 private cars in 1915 had multiplied to 3,506 by 1920. With the severe overcrowding in the city centre, the population, particularly the better-off, started to move into the suburbs. The better-off families moved especially to the East Coast, where they often operated plantations and maintained large sea-side homes near the beach at Katong. Several wealthy Muslim families were to leave a legacy in the area through their family names, including those of Aljunied and Eunos. Less well-off families tended to move into the southern parts of the island as a natural extension of the Chinatown area. Subsequently, however, they also moved into other areas, including the East Coast, spreading the problems of overpopulation to the suburbs with the creation of squatters. This growth also resulted in suburban roads becoming congested by traffic, particularly along Geylang Road which leads to the East Coast. ===Public Housing=== In 1927, the colonial government attempted to arrest the situation by setting up the Singapore Improvement Trust (SIT), with the main aims of alleviating urban congestion and the provision and upgrading of public infrastructure, particularly in the widening of roads to accommodate rising and modernising traffic. Their efforts were evident only in localised areas, as the body did not have the legislative power to produce comprehensive plans or to control urban development. The Second World War also disrupted their efforts during the Japanese occupation from 1941 to 1945. Singapore emerged from the war in physical ruins and with a large number of homeless residents. A housing committee was thus formed quickly in 1947, and reported an acute housing shortage facing the city, where the population had already reached a million by 1950. With 25% of the population living in 1% of its land area, and with some shophouses housing over 100 people, the SIT's efforts were clearly inadequate in its attempts to rehouse the population into new multi-story apartment blocks. The formation of Housing Department Board (HDB) The SIT was replaced by the Housing Department Board (HDB) in 1960. It has been monitoring the whole public housing system, from land acquisition, resettlement, town planning, building design, to allocation and management of the completed units. To meet the housing demand in post independence era, HDB had completed 324000 units in 20 years and provided housing for 68.54% of the whole population . 50 years after the formation of HDB, HDB flats accommodate more than 80% of Singaporeans. The significance of public housing in Singapore a) To realise the national agenda of Singapore as a home country Home ownership was introduced as a national agenda in the 1960s by former prime minister Lee Kuan Yew. He encouraged people to buy public housing from HDB by setting the price lower than the market value to increase home ownership. Home ownership was not only a social agenda to him, but a political strategy at the same time. In his memoirs, he wrote \\"‚Ä¶If the soldier's family did not own their home, he would soon conclude he would be fighting to protect the properties of the wealthy. I believed this sense of ownership was vital for our new society which had no deep roots in a common historical experience.\\". He believed home ownership would help to develop people's sense of belonging to the country, which in turn achieve political and social stability. In 2016, Singapore remains a top destination for foreign investment in 2016, following United States and China and hence stability can enhance Singapore's attractiveness to overseas investors. b) Set up the housing ladder Around 88% of housings in Singapore are public housing built by HDB and 90% of the population own in their home. As HDB is the major housing provider in Singapore, they sell dwelling units to first time home buyer at a concessionary rate to encourage home ownership. People can accrue wealth through capital growth of the dwelling units when the property market grows and this would allow them to upgrade their residence through resale of their units. However, HDB owners cannot resale their units in 5 years to ensure the needs of different groups are met and minimise the interference to the second hand market. Since the property market is tightly controlled by the government by imposing restrictions on the eligibilities of buyers and heavy stamp duties, the price gap between the public housing and private units are not greatly significant and hence it is possible for people to upgrade the residence and thus the living environment. Hence public housing not only realises the national agenda of Singapore as a home country, it also sets up the housing ladder which allows people to improve the living environment. There are other housing options are condominium, private flats and landed housing. It is worth mentioning condominiums as some HDB regulations have to be followed, since the land is sold to the developer by the government at prices lower than the market. For example the eligibility of the owner and minimum of occupancy period before resale in the second hand market. (Han, 2005). On the other hand, landed housing value more than other types of housing in the same area due to its scarcity, better design and location. Unlike detached houses in Australia, land in Singapore are leased out rather than sold by the government. Hence when the lease is over, the ownership of the land could be returned to the government if the government decided not to extend the lease. For example, some leased land in Geylang will be expired in 10 years and the government has decided not to renew the lease and that area will be redeveloped into other uses. c) The core of planning strategy of Singapore The planning strategy of Singapore centres on public housing as a considerable number of population live in HDB units. HDB has flexibility and autonomy in planning amenities around public housing, such as public transportation, office, retail and recreational facilities. As Singapore has limited supply of land, it is important that spaces are being utilised efficiently while the living quality of people will not be compromised. A HDB hub provides retail, public transportation and recreational services in a compact area. It serves people living in HDB flats and also serves people living in other types of housing nearby. Thus people can access to the necessities at their door step. It is similar to activity centre in Victoria, but it is planned by HDB rather than the local council. And it shows the significance of public housing and the role of HDB in planning. ==Current policy== A view of a model of the land use in the Singapore city centre. The current policy of Singapore's urban planners who come under the Urban Redevelopment Authority is to create partially self-sufficient towns and districts which are then further served by four regional centres, each of which serves one of the four different regions of Singapore besides the Central Area. These regional centres reduce traffic strain on Singapore's central business district, the Central Area, by replacing some of the commercial functions the Central Area serves. Each town or district possesses a variety of facilities and amenities allocated strategically to serve as much as possible on at least a basic scale, and on the regional scale, an intermediate one. Any function of the Central Area not served then is allowed by the regional centre to be executed efficiently as the transport routes are planned to link up the regional centres and Central Area effectively. The Housing Development Board works with the Urban Redevelopment Board to develop public housing according to the national urban planning policy. As land is scarce in what is the most densely populated country, the goal of urban planners is to maximise use of land efficiently yet comfortably and to serve as many people as possible for a particular function, such as housing or commercial purposes in high rise and high density buildings. Infrastructure, environmental conservation, enough space for water catchment and land for military use are all considerations for national urban planners. Land reclamation has continued to be used extensively in urban planning, and Singapore has grown at least 100 square kilometres from its original size before 1819 when it was founded. The urban planning policy demands that most buildings being constructed should be high-rise, with exceptions for conservation efforts for heritage or nature. A pleasant side effect is that many residents have pleasant views. Allocating primary functions in concentrated areas prevents land wastage. This is noticeable in Tampines New Town in comparison to the housing blocks found in Dover. Housing blocks turned into complexes, which occupied a large area with thousands of apartments in each one as opposed to smaller high-rise blocks with hundreds. This allows for efficient land use without compromising the standard of living. ===Public transport system=== Singapore is a small nation with limited resources and land area (719.9 km2). There is no other way to meet the economic development without efficient use of land and resources. Since Singapore gained independence in 1965, decentralisation planning strategy has been adopted. Developments were extended all over the nation instead of concentrating in the central area, such as the western area as industrial estates and the north-western area as the recreational space to conserve the nature there. And Singapore's public transport system was designed to link different districts together without heavily relying on roads, to utilise the land efficiently. Public transport network as a strategy to use land efficiently Public transport network has been integrated with land use through careful co-ordination in physical planning. It is divided into macro and micro level. Macro level is the co-ordination between new towns and major railway network, while the micro level is the co-ordination around major transport hub. In \\"World Class Land Transport\\" issued by the Singapore government in 1995, it emphasised the integration of high density developments around major transport hub. Public housing estates should be integrated with public transport network, hence residents could access to services around the station within walking distances, or travel by public transportation. For example, at the Sengkang Town Centre Station, developments are built on top or around the station, while public transport network is available to link public housing and the station. A well-coordinated public transportation network provides a viable alternative travel choice to people and hence a major portion of trips could be carried by public transport and occupy a small amount of land. It shows how the Singapore government efficiently uses limited land resources to maximise the outcome. Prioritize railway network over bus network The Singaporean government has prioritised railway system over bus services as bus services could not be the solution for a compact city like Singapore. The efficiency and quality of bus services will deteriorate quickly once the demand exceeds the certain threshold. For instance, the efficiency of bus service is limited by the capacity of the road and the number of buses available. Since Singapore is a small nation, it is impossible to construct road endlessly to meet up with the demand. Hence there is a hierarchy for public transport network which prioritises the railway network over the bus network. Mass Railway Transit (MRT) is the top tier which serves heavy transit corridors, such as connecting the Central business district to different districts. Light Railway Transit (LRT) is the second tier to support the Mass Railway Transit networks by feeding commuters to the major railway stations. Bus services are to complement the MRT-LRT network and serve the less heavy transit corridor. Thus the railway network can be regarded as the backbone of the public transport network, and supported by the bus services. Improve the current public transport network Singaporean government keeps on improving the current public transport network to enhance public transport a viable choice as alternative to the car for a wider population. The railway coverage area has been expanding since it was introduced in the 1980s. In 2020, four new lines and extensions are scheduled to be complete, which are Thomson Line, The Eastern Region Line, The North-South Line extension and the new Tuas extension. More people will be served by the railway network and they will be able to get to more places. Also, there will be more rides available during morning and evening peak hours to carry the commuters. There will be less crowded trains and a reduction of waiting time during peak hours. These measures aim to increase the catchment area of MRT stations and encourage the usage of the railway network. Apart from improvement on railway network, the quality of bus services is closely monitored by the authority. The two main bus operators: the SBS Transit Ltd and Trans-Island Bus Services (TIBS) will be audited every year to ensure the service and efficiency meet the standard. For example, the commuter load during peak hours should not exceed 100% of the bus designated capacity. If the standards are not met, the contract could be terminated or revised with stricter terms. In short, public transport in Singapore aims to carry a maximum number of trips to in small area so land could be utilised more efficiently. As the population is increasing, the network has to be improved to meet the increase in demand and enhance public transport as a viable alternative to car. Post-independence Singapore government, with the exception of public housing in Chinatown¬ß, has largely shied away from allocating too much housing in the Central Area and especially the Downtown Core, but with increasing density and land reclamation in Marina South and Marina East, there are current plans for new public housing close to the Downtown Core. Singapore's land is increasingly crowded, and hence the placement of a district of one function that obstructs more infrastructure development in that area (such as building an expressway tunnel or a rail line), as opposed to the placement of a district of a different function that would accommodate future infrastructure, has become increasingly likely. A district of one function could be inefficient if it does not have proper access to another district of another function, or on the other hand, if it is too close. Public amenities have to be strategically placed to benefit the largest number of people possible with minimum redundancy and wastage. A major feature of urban planning in Singapore is to avoid such situations of land wastage. ==See also== *Geography of Singapore *Urban planning areas in Singapore *Singapore City Gallery *Urban renewal in Singapore ==NotesReferences== *Tan, Sumiko. \\"Home, work, play.\\" Urban Redevelopment Authority, 1999 *About Us, Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA) *Dale, O.J., Urban Planning in Singapore: The Transformation of a City. 1999, New York: Oxford University Press. *Lim, W.S.W., Cities for People: Reflections of a Southeast Asian Architect. 1990, Singapore: Select Books Pte Ltd. *Bishop, R., J.

This is the only species assigned to the genus Atelocynus. ==Other names== It has many names in the local languages where it is endemic, such as: cachorro-do-mato-de-orelha-curta in Portuguese, zorro de oreja corta in Spanish, nomensarixi in the Chiquitano language, and u√°laca in Yucuna. Other names in Spanish are zorro ojizarco, zorro sabanero, zorro negro. ==Evolution and systematics== After the formation of the Isthmus of Panama in the latter part the Tertiary (about 2.5 million years ago in the Pliocene), canids migrated from North America to the southern continent as part of the Great American Interchange. The short-eared dog's ancestors adapted to life in tropical rainforests, developing the requisite morphological and anatomical features. Apart from its superficial resemblance to the bush dog, the short-eared dog seems not to be closely related to any fox-like or wolf-like canid.(R. Burton; International Wildlife Encyclopedia, 2002). It is one of the most unusual canids. Two subspecies of this canid are recognized: *A. m. microtis *A. m. sclateri ==Occurrence and environment== thumbRare sight of short-eared dog The short-eared dog can be found in the Amazon rainforest region of South America (in Peru, Bolivia, Brazil, Colombia, Ecuador and possibly Venezuela). There is a single report of \\"three slender, doglike animals\\" of this species sighted in the Darien region of Panama in 1984 by German biologist Sigi Weisel and a native Embera nation Panamanian; this rare species' presence in Panama is possible because of \\"the continuous mass of forest habitat that covers this region\\". It lives in various parts of the rainforest environment, preferring areas with little human disturbance. It lives in both lowland forests known as Selva Amaz√≥nica and terra firme forest, as well as in swamp forest, stands of bamboo, and cloud forest. It is a solitary animal and prefers moving in trees away from human and other animal interactions. ==Appearance== Bundes-Pelzfachschule, Frankfurt/Main, Germany Short-eared dog skull The short-eared dog has short and slender limbs with short and rounded ears. It has a distinctive fox-like muzzle and bushy tail. It ranges from dark to reddish-grey, but can also be nearly navy blue, coffee brown, dark grey, or chestnut-grey to black, and the coat is short, with thick and bristly fur. Its paws are partly webbed, owing to its partly aquatic habitat. It moves with feline lightness unparalleled among the other canids. It has a somewhat narrow chest, with dark color variation on the thorax merging to brighter, more reddish tones on the abdominal side of the body. ==Diet== This wild dog is mainly a carnivore, with fish, insects, and small mammals making up the majority of its diet. An investigation led in Cocha Cashu Biological Station in Peru into the proportions of different kinds of food in this animal's diet produced the following results: fish 28%, insects 17%, small mammals 13%, various fruits 10%, birds 10%, crabs 10%, frogs 4%, reptiles 3%. ==Reproduction and behavior== This species has some unique behaviors not typical to other canids. Females of this species are about one- third larger than males. The excited male sprays a musk produced by the tail glands. It prefers a solitary lifestyle, in forest areas. It avoids humans in the natural environment. Agitated males raise the hairs on their backs.ebcc Lifespan and gestation period are unknown, although sexual maturity is reached at three years of age, which is relatively late compared to other canid species. ==Threats, survival, and ecological concerns== Feral dogs pose a prominent threat to the population of short-eared dogs, as they facilitate the spread of diseases such as canine distemper and rabies to the wild population. Humans also contribute to their extermination by degradation of the species' natural habitat and the destruction of tropical rainforests. Man√∫ National Park, Madre de Dios, Peru ==Status of conservation== The short-eared dog is currently considered near threatened by IUCN. No comprehensive ecological and genetic research has been carried out on the species. ==ReferencesFurther reading== *M.R.P Leite Pitman and R.S.R. Williams.

Formerly known as the Court of Petty Sessions and the Magistrates Court, there are more than 160 branches across New South Wales where the Local Court has jurisdiction to deal with the majority of minor civil and criminal matters. Matters are heard before a single magistrate sitting without a jury, addressed as \\"Your Honour\\" or \\"Sir\\" (but no longer \\"Your worship\\"). The Local Court has no jurisdiction for claims in equity. On appeal, matters may be heard by the District Court of New South Wales including appeals against the sentence or conviction decided in the Local Court. The Chief Magistrate of the Local Court is Judge Graeme Henson, appointed in 2006. ==History== In 1788, following the landing of the First Fleet and establishment of the Colony of New South Wales, the power and authority of the first criminal and civil courts in the Colony of New South Wales were vested by the Charter of Justice.Charter of Justice 2 April 1787 (UK) The first Court of Petty Session's courthouse was constructed in 1821 at Windsor, northwest of Sydney. ==Structure and jurisdiction== The Local Court of New South Wales hears civil matters of a monetary value of up to $100,000; mental health matters; family law and/or child care matters; adult criminal proceedings, including committal hearings, and summary prosecutions for summary offences (i.e., offences of a less serious nature) and indictable offences; licensing issues (as the Licensing Court); industrial matters; and mining matters. In addition to this, the Local Court, via its Small Claims Division, hears claims for less than $10,000 and also hears applications for Apprehended Violence Orders (AVOs). The local court has limited jurisdiction under the to hear and determine family law matters. The local court can deal with applications such as property settlements and residence orders. A magistrate can imprison offenders for no more than two years per sentence and no more than the maximum of five years for multiple sentences. The Children's Court is a division within the Local Court that hears matters involving minors, or those that have not yet reached the age of 18, and is a closed court (i.e., the general public may not attend). The press can attend but may not publish the identity of the offender. The Coroner's Court is another division within the Local Court that investigates violent or unnatural deaths, suspicious fires and/or explosions, but it cannot make orders to punish offenders. Coroners may, however, terminate their proceedings and pass on their findings onto state or federal Directors of Public Prosecutions for initiation of proceedings in another court at their discretion. ==See also== *Courthouses in New South Wales *List of New South Wales courts and tribunals *Victims Compensation Tribunal ==References * *Practice Notes - Local Courts New South Wales *Chief Magistrate - Local Courts New South Wales Category:New South Wales courts and tribunals ","title":"Local Court of New South Wales"},{"id":"2224896","text":"Archibald \\"Archie\\" Howie CBE HonFRMS FRS HonFRSE (born 8 March 1934) is a British physicist and Emeritus Professor at the University of Cambridge, known for his pioneering work on the interpretation of transmission electron microscope images of crystals.

Ballarat Asylum - Australian Psychiatric Care retrieved 5/5/12 later as Ballarat Hospital for the Insane and finally, before its closure, as Lakeside Psychiatric Hospital,University of Melbourne. Ballarat Hospital for the Insane - Australian Psychiatric Care retrieved 5/5/12 was an Australian psychiatric hospital located in the suburb of Wendouree, the north-western fringe of Ballarat, Victoria, Australia. The hospital first opened in 1877 but closed again soon after. A reformatory for boys also operated on the site, and some of its buildings were reused when the hospital was reopened in 1893. A brick building was converted into a ward to house 30 male patients. This was extensively damaged in a fire in 1917. A report in 1895 said that the patients did not have enough warm clothing, and that they were shivering during the cold Ballarat winter. Proposals to expand the asylum were mooted in 1909. Large scale extension and alteration were put forward by the state government in 1916.The Argus. 11 October 1916. pg. 6 The hospital at its peak employed about 600 staff and could hold 1500 patients. The site was 83 hectares, of which 40 hectares was used as a farm. Crops planted in 1910 included leeks, cauliflowers, onions, rhubarb, potatoes, pumpkins, carrots, tomatoes, celery, beetroot, peas, beans and parsnips. In 1907, a Dr. Cherry reported that the patients helped to compress green fodder crops for storage by dancing jigs and reels on them to the accompaniment of a fiddle. The site is now used for the Ballarat Aquatic Centre, a number of sporting facilities, and the Lake Gardens housing estate. Some original building are still standing and have been renovated and reused. ==Incidents== An outbuilding burned down in 1898.The Argus. 25 June 1898. p.10 In 1909, an incident between inmates resulted in the death of one by pick-axe.Benalla Standard. 29 January 1909 p 4 In 1917, a large fire destroyed one of the wings which was formerly the boys reformatory school. A patient committed suicide by drowning himself in Lake Wendouree in 1995 after it was announced by the Government that deinstitution would begin. The man was a long term patient. His disappearance was reported to the police, when staff took a group on a walk around the nearby lake. He was later found by a Lakeside nurse. ==See also== *List of Australian psychiatric institutions ==References * Category:Psychiatric hospitals in Australia Category:Defunct hospitals in Australia Category:Hospitals in Victoria (Australia) Category:Hospitals established in 1877 Category:1990s disestablishments ","title":"Lakeside Mental Hospital"},{"id":"2224900","text":"Aradale Mental Hospital was an Australian psychiatric hospital, located in Ararat, a rural city in south-west Victoria, Australia. Originally known as Ararat Lunatic Asylum, Aradale and its two sister asylums at Kew and Beechworth were commissioned to accommodate the growing number of 'lunatics' in the colony of Victoria. Construction began in 1864, and the guardhouses are listed as being built in 1866 though the list of patients extends as far back as the year before (1865). It was closed as an asylum in 1998 and in 2001 became a campus of the Melbourne Polytechnic (Previously known as NMIT) administered Melbourne Polytechnic's Ararat Training Centre. ==Construction== The asylum in 1880. The asylum was designed by G. W. Vivian and John James Clark (at this time Vivian's assistant), adapting Vivian's initial designs for a similar buildings in Kew and Beechworth. Building commenced at Kew (Kew Lunatic Asylum), Ararat and Beechworth (Beechworth Asylum) at roughly the same time, however Ararat was completed first. The building of Ararat was contracted to O'Grady, Glynn and O'Callaghan and not patients (or \\"inmates\\" as they were called) as many erroneously believe. The asylum was built as a town within a town with its own market gardens, orchard, vineyards, piggery and other stock kept on the grounds. At its height it had over 500 staff and as it stands today the complex is made up of 63 buildings ranging in age from the original wings built in the 1860s to the modern forensic unit which was built in 1991 - only two years before the facility closed. Despite being closed as an asylum the facility continued to house female prisoners during the building/renovation of Dame Phyllis Frost Centre right up until its current management took over in 2001. ==Distinctive features== The asylum complex is an example of the E-plan barracks type lunatic asylums based on the model 1850s asylum in Colney Hatch, England. Ararat is very similar in design to its sister asylums at Kew and Beechworth, however Ararat's use of linking bridges with an arcade on an arched gateways is unique. Kew is considered to be an example of Second Empire design, whereas Ararat and Beechworth are considered more typically Italianate, though both styles have similar characteristics. The buildings are constructed from oversize bricks, which were then rendered with cement. Two storeyed ward wings extend to each side, one for each sex. The ward wings were surrounded by courtyards lined with iron columned verandas, ===Ha-ha walls=== 280px Another distinctive feature of Ararat and other early Victorian asylums is the use of a variation on ha-ha walls around the patients' courtyards. They consisted of a trench, one side of which was vertical and faced with stone or bricks, the other side sloped and turfed. From the inside, the walls presented a tall face to patients, preventing them from escaping, while from outside the walls looked low so as not to suggest imprisonment. ===Grounds and landscaping=== In 1913 the landscape gardener Hugh Linaker was employed to layout the grounds of Mont Park. As landscape gardener for the State Lunacy Department he commenced a program of landscape improvements and tree plantings at asylums in Victoria. Linaker was already familiar with the area having previously laid out the grounds of Alexandra Park in Ararat. Unfortunately, only a few remnants of the Linaker's plantings remain. ==J Ward== In December 1886 the old gaol at Ararat was proclaimed as \\"J Ward\\" of the Ararat Asylum. It was to cater for those persons who were detained in any jail, reformatory or industrial school or other place of confinement who appeared to be insane. The ward was not a separate institution in its own right and has continued to function as a division of the Ararat Mental Hospital. \\"J Ward\\" was always regarded as a temporary measure. A new institution was to be built at Sunbury for the retention of the criminally insane. However, when the building was nearing completion it was decided that it would house females only and males would remain at \\"J Ward\\". In May 1988 the Minister for Health announced that \\"J Ward\\" was to be closed over the next year. ==Decommissioning== The decommissioning of Aradale began in the early 1990s, with patients transferred to community living and to other facilities. After December 1993 the Ararat Forensic Psychiatry Centre was the only remaining ward. In 1997, the remaining patients at AFPC were eventually transferred to Rosanna, until the new Thomas Embling Hospital in Fairfield was completed. ==Current use== Hospital building in 2017 In 2001 the Victorian Government provided $7.4 million to Melbourne Polytechnic to establish a campus of the Melbourne Polytechnic's Ararat Training Centre on the site of the hospital. 30 hectares of vineyard and 10 hectares of olive grove were planted in 2002 and an olive processing facility and winery were later built on site. The first planting at the Ararat campus was of 28 hectares of vines, which produced the first vintage in 2005. Since commencing training and research at Aradale in 2002, Melbourne Polytechnic also established a 250 tonne winery, a four hectare lavender farm and extensive training facilities. The Polytechnic campus was established to provide in Victoria a world-class wine and hospitality training facility.Lynne Kosky, 'State-of-the-Art Australian College of Wine , Budget statement from the Minister For Post Compulsory Education, Training & Employment, Victorian Government, 15 May 2001.

It is one of the most globally recognized food items of Spanish cuisine (along with other dishes such as gazpacho and paella). It is also regularly a component of tapas.Casas, P. (1985). Introduction. In Tapas, the little dishes of Spain (xv) [Introduction]. New York: Alfred A. Knopf. Most jam√≥n is commonly called jam√≥n serrano in Spain. Jam√≥n is the Spanish word for ham. As such, other ham products produced or consumed in Spanish-speaking countries may also be called by this name. thumb ==Description== Jam√≥n is typically consumed in slices, either manually carved from a leg on a jamonero stand using a sharp thin slicing knife, or cut from the deboned meat with a rotatory cold-cut slicer. It's also regularly consumed in any shape in small portions. As a product, Jam√≥n is similar to Portuguese presunto and to Italian prosciutto, but the production differs by a longer curing phase (up to 18 months), giving it a dryer texture, deeper color and stronger flavour than the former. A whole Jam√≥n leg is considerably cheaper by weight than its sliced counterpart because it includes the bone and non-edible fat. Once the external fat layers are removed and the meat is exposed, though, the product must be consumed as soon as possible since a progressive drying and deteriorating process starts. This is not an issue for restaurateurs and retailers, since they go through product much faster than an individual. Home users will typically choose sliced product, be it freshly cut from a deli stand, commercially pre-packaged or vacuum preserved. Jam√≥n is safe to consume for as long as is kept in its leg in a dry and cool environment and direct sunlight is avoided, but it must be kept refrigerated once cut away from the leg. Jam√≥n may also be smoked in some regions and it is consumed, mostly for personal use. This is common in the southern area of Castile and Le√≥n as well as parts of Extremadura. Such a jam√≥n has a harder texture and smoky-salty flavour. Though widely available (even if on the expensive side) in Spain and accessible in some of the European Union, import duties and trade or food safety restrictions that apply to foreign meat products in international markets may raise substantially the prices while creating a scarcity, often making jam√≥n a prohibitively costly product to import and offer overseas. There are two main commercial labels for jam√≥n, based on the pig breed and protected designations: * Jam√≥n ib√©rico, made from the black Iberian pig and may be consumed internationally as a delicacy * Jam√≥n serrano (meaning ham from the sierra), which includes most other varieties A jam√≥n serrano leg from Teruel in a cutting stand == Jam√≥n serrano == The term jam√≥n serrano (\\"serrano ham\\", ham from the sierra, or mountain range) is regularly applied as an umbrella culinary term for all dry- cured jam√≥n produced in Spain, as opposed to jam√≥n de York, which is baked or boiled in salted fluid. It is most precisely applied, though, to jam√≥n produced from white and/or non-Ib√©rico breeds of pig. This is the most commonly produced and consumed range of jam√≥n in Spain. The majority of jamones serranos are produced from a landrace breed of white pigs or from commercial breeds such as Duroc. Jam√≥n serrano, described variously as jam√≥n reserva, jam√≥n curado, and jam√≥n extra or any generic jam√≥n nomenclature, is produced from compound-fed white pigs. Jam√≥n serrano has TSG (Traditional Specialities Guaranteed) status.EC PDO/PGI/TSG List The TSG certification attests that a particular food product objectively possesses specific characteristics that differentiate it from all others in its category and that its raw materials, composition, or method of production have been consistent for a minimum of 30 years. === Production === Fresh hams are trimmed and cleaned, then stacked and covered with salt for about two weeks to draw off excess moisture and preserve the meat from spoiling. The salt is then washed off and the hams are hung to dry for about six months. Finally, the hams are hung in a cool, dry place for 6 to 18 months, depending on the climate, as well as the size and type of ham being cured. The drying sheds (secaderos) are usually built at higher elevations, which is why the ham is called \\"mountain ham\\". Retail jam√≥n ib√©rico in Barcelona == Jam√≥n ib√©rico == Pork products made from Iberian-breed pigs receive the ib√©rico/a denomination. As such, jam√≥n ib√©rico is the dry-cured jam√≥n produced from livestock of these breeds. Ib√©rico encompasses some of the most expensive ham produced in the world, and its fatty marbled texture has made it very popular as a delicacy, with a hard to fulfill global demand comparable to that of kobe beef. Since jam√≥n ib√©rico production and export is limited, buyer should beware and not fall victim of bait-and-switch or quality fraud similar to that of olive oil, since it has been estimated that a sizable portion of both local market and exports are not actually ib√©rico. Spain regulation defines trade labeling for all ib√©rico products. == European Union protected designation of origin == Traditional jamon marketed in Barcelona. Under the Common Agricultural Policy of the European Union (EU), certain well-established meat products, including some local jam√≥n and jam√≥n producers, are covered by a protected designation of origin (PDO) or protected geographical indication (PGI): * Jam√≥n de Teruel has PDO status. * Jam√≥n de Los Pedroches has PDO status. * Jam√≥n Dehesa de Extremadura has PDO status. * Jam√≥n de Guijuelo has PDO status. * Jam√≥n de Huelva has PDO status. * Jam√≥n de Trev√©lez has PGI status. A paletilla from alt= ==Paleta== The paleta de cerdo or paletilla is a product similar to jam√≥n; it is made from the front leg of a pig, instead of the hind leg used for jam√≥n, cured using the same process and consumed in the same way. Since whole legs are sold by weight and paletillas are lighter, they are often marketed towards home consumption. A paletilla may be described or marketed as Ib√©rica when produced from the same livestock as Jam√≥n Ib√©rico. ==See also== *Lac√≥n Gallego *Ham * *List of dried foods *Curing (food preservation) *Spanish cuisine ==References Category:Ham Category:Spanish cuisine ","title":"Jam√≥n"},{"id":"2224906","text":"GMA Pinoy TV is a Philippine pay television channel that was launched in March 2005 by GMA Network.

The Cottas were of noble Italian descent, and at the time of the Reformation the family was settled in Eisenach in Thuringia. Johann Georg Cotta (1631‚Äì1692), the founder of the publishing house of J. G. Cotta, married in 1659 the widow of the university bookseller, Philipp Braun, in T√ºbingen, and took over the management of his business, thus establishing the firm which was subsequently associated with Cotta's name. On his death, in 1692, the undertaking passed to his only son, also name Johann Georg; and on his death in 1712, to the latter's eldest son, also named Johann Georg, while the second son, Johann Friedrich, became a distinguished theologian. Although the eldest son of the third Johann Georg, Christoph Friedrich Cotta (1730‚Äì1807), established a printing-house to the court at Stuttgart, the business languished. == Life == It was reserved to the youngest son of Christoph Friedrich, Johann Friedrich, to restore the fortunes of the firm. Born in Stuttgart, he attended the gymnasium of his native place, and was originally intended to study theology. He, however, entered the university of T√ºbingen as a student of mathematics and law, and after graduating spent a considerable time in Paris, studying French and natural science, and mixing with distinguished literary men. After practising as an advocate in one of the higher courts, Cotta, in compliance with his father's earnest desire, took over the publishing business at T√ºbingen. He began in December 1787, and laboured incessantly to acquire familiarity with all the details. From 1793 to 1794, Orell F√ºssli in Z√ºrich published Marianne Ehrmann's Die Einsiedlerinn aus den Alpen, the first magazine that was published by a women in Switzerland; her early death stopped the further issues. Because the self- publishing could not handle the success of her former magazine, Marianne and her husband agreed on a takeover by Cotta, but in 1793 occurred irreconcilable conflicts; Cotta founded the journal Flora with the subscriber base, and Marianne Ehrmann continued the magazine Einsiedlerinn aus den Alpen. The house connexions rapidly extended; and, in 1794, the Allgemeine Zeitung, of which Schiller was to be editor, was planned. Schiller was compelled to withdraw on account of his health; but his friendship with Cotta deepened every year, and was a great advantage to the poet and his family. Cotta awakened in Schiller so warm an attachment that, as Heinrich D√∂ring tells us in his life of Schiller (1824), when a bookseller offered him a higher price than Cotta for the copyright of Wallenstein, the poet firmly declined it, replying ‚ÄúCotta deals honestly with me, and I with him.‚Äù In 1795 Schiller and Cotta founded the Horen, a periodical very important to the student of German literature. The poet intended, by means of this work, to infuse higher ideas into the common lives of men, by giving them a nobler human culture, and ‚Äúto reunite the divided political world under the banner of truth and beauty.‚Äù The Horen brought Goethe and Schiller into intimate relations with each other and with Cotta; and Goethe, while regretting that he had already promised Wilhelm Meister to another publisher, contributed the Unterhaltung deutscher Ausgewanderten, the Roman Elegies and a paper on Literary Sansculottism. Fichte sent essays from the first, and the other brilliant German authors of the time were also represented. In 1798 the Allgemeine Zeitung appeared at T√ºbingen, being edited first by Posselt and then by Huber. Soon the editorial office of the newspaper was transferred to Stuttgart, in 1803 to Ulm, and in 1810 to Augsburg; it is now in Munich. In 1799 Cotta entered on his political career, being sent to Paris by the W√ºrttemberg estates as their representative. Here he made friendships which proved very advantageous for the Allgemeine Zeitung. In 1801 he paid another visit to Paris, also in a political capacity, when he carefully studied Napoleon's policy, and treasured up many hints which were useful to him in his literary undertakings. He still, however, devoted most of his attention to his own business, and, for many years, made all the entries into the ledger with his own hand. He relieved the tedium of almost ceaseless toil by pleasant intercourse with literary men. With Schiller, Huber, and Gottlieb Konrad Pfeffel (1736‚Äì1809) he was on terms of the warmest friendship; and he was also intimate with Herder, Schelling, Fichte, Richter, Voss, Hebel, Tieck, Therese Huber, Matthisson, the brothers Humboldt, Johann M√ºller, Spittler and others, whose works he published in whole or in part. In the correspondence of Alexander von Humboldt with Varnhagen von Ense we see the familiar relations in which the former stood to the Cotta family. In 1795 he published the Politischen Annalen and the Jahrb√ºcher der Baukunde, and in 1798 the Damenalmanach, along with some works of less importance. In 1807 he issued the Morgenblatt, to which Schorn's Kunstblatt and Menzel's Literaturblatt were afterwards added. In 1810 he removed to Stuttgart; and from that time till his death he was loaded with honours. State affairs and an honourable commission from the German booksellers took him to the Vienna congress; and in 1815 he was deputy-elect at the W√ºrttemberg diet. In 1819 he became representative of the nobility; then he succeeded to the offices of member of committee and (1824) vice- president of the W√ºrttemberg second chamber. He was also appointed Prussian Geheimrat, and knight of the order of the W√ºrttemberg crown; King William I. of W√ºrttemberg having already revived the ancient nobility in his family by granting him the patent of Freiherr (Baron) Cotta von Cottendorf . Meanwhile, such publications as the Polytechnische Journal, the Hesperus, the W√ºrttembergische Jahrb√ºcher, the Hertha, the Ausland, and the Inland issued from the press. In 1828‚Äì1829 appeared the famous correspondence between Schiller and Goethe. Cotta was an unfailing friend of young struggling men of talent. In addition to his high standing as a publisher, he was a man of great practical energy, which flowed into various fields of activity. He was a scientific agriculturist, and promoted many reforms in farming. He was the first W√ºrttemberg landholder to abolish serfdom on his estates. In politics he was throughout his life a moderate liberal. In 1824 he set up a steam printing press in Augsburg, and, about the same time, founded a literary institute at Munich. In 1825 he started steamboats, for the first time, on Lake Constance, and introduced them in the following year on the Rhine. In 1828 he was sent to Berlin, on an important commission, by Bavaria and W√ºrttemberg, and was there rewarded with orders of distinction at the hands of the three kings. He died, on 29 December 1832 in Stuttgart, leaving a son and a daughter as coheirs. == Successors == His son, Johann Georg, Freiherr Cotta von Cottendorf (1796‚Äì1863), succeeded to the management of the business on the death of his father, and was materially assisted by his sister's husband, Freiherr Hermann von Reischach. He greatly extended the connexions of the firm by the purchase, in 1839, of the publishing business of G. J. G√∂schen in Leipzig, and in 1845 of that of Vogel in Landshut; while, in 1845, ‚ÄúBible‚Äù branches were established at Stuttgart and Munich. He was succeeded by his younger son, Karl, and by his nephew (the son of his sister), Hermann Albert von Reischach. Under their joint partnership, the before-mentioned firms in Leipzig and Landshut, and an artistic establishment in Munich passed into other hands, leaving on the death of Hermann Albert von Reischach, in 1876, Karl von Cotta the sole representative of the firm, until his death in 1888. In 1889 the firm of J. G. Cotta passed by purchase into the hands of Adolf and Paul Kroner, who took others into partnership. In 1899 the business was converted into a limited liability company. Cotta's publishing company survives today, although no longer owned by the family, under the name Klett-Cotta. Its contemporary offerings include German-to-Elvish dictionaries tied into the Lord of the Rings movies. == References == * Albert Sch√§ffle, Cotta (1895) * Verlags- Katalog der J. G.

The species is endemic to Australasia. ==Etymology== The specific name, mairii, is in honor of \\"Dr. Mair\\", an army surgeon with the 39th Regiment of Foot, who collected the holotype.Beolens, Bo; Watkins, Michael; Grayson, Michael (2011). The Eponym Dictionary of Reptiles. Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press. xiii + 296 pp. .

Ventrally, it is lighter. The subcaudals and often also the ventrals are edged with black. The dorsal scales are strongly keeled, and arranged in 15 rows at midbody.Boulenger GA (1897). \\"An account of the reptiles and batrachians collected by Dr. L. Loria in British New Guinea\\".

T. mairii resembles some Australian venomous snakes, the taipans (genus Oxyuranus) and the rough-scaled snake (Tropidechis carinatus). T. mairii rarely grows over in total length (including tail). ==Diet== Mair's keelback feeds mainly on amphibians and small lizards. It is one of the few snakes that can eat cane toads (Rhinella marina), up to a certain size, without being harmed. ==Reproduction== T. mairii is oviparous. ==ReferencesFurther reading== *Cogger HG (2014).

His chef d'≈ìuvre is The Crucifixion of St. Peter made for the cathedral of Notre Dame. The Finding of Moses, c. 1650 (National Gallery of Art, Washington) ==Biography== Bourdon was born in Montpellier, France, the son of a Protestant painter on glass. He was apprenticed to a painter in Paris. In spite of his poverty he managed to get to Rome in 1636; there he studied the paintings of Nicolas Poussin, Claude Lorrain and Caravaggio among his eclectic selection of models, until he was forced to flee in 1638, to escape a feared prosecution for his Reformed Protestant faith.Thierry Bayou, Bourdon, S√©bastien, Grove Art Online. He lived in Paris from 1637 to 1652. In 1648, Bourdon was one of the founders of the French Royal Academy of Painting and Sculpture and was elected as one of the original twelve elders in charge of its running.M√©moires pour servir √† l'histoire de l'Acad√©mie royale de Peinture et de Sculpture depuis 1648 jusqu'en 1664, Ed. Anatole de Montaiglon, Paris 1853, vol. I, p. 36. In 1652 he departed for Sweden and Queen Christina of Sweden made him her first court painter. Bourdon's facility rendered him adept at portraiture, whether in a dashing Rubens mannerQueen Christina on Horseback 1653, Museo del Prado, Madrid. or in intimate, sympathetic bust- length or half-length portraits isolated against plain backgrounds that set a formula for middle-class portraiture for the rest of the century,Queen Christina, Nationalmuseum, Stockholm; Unknown Man, Mus√©e Fabre, Montpellier; Corfitz Ulfeldt, Frederiksborg, Denmark landscapes in the manner of Gaspar Dughet or capricci of ruins, mythological \\"history painting\\" like other members of Poussin's circleThe Finding of Moses, c. 1650, National Gallery of Art, Washington; Bacchus and Ceres with Nymphs and Satyrs, Museum of Fine Arts, Budapest, etc or the genre subjects of the Dutch Bamboccianti who were working in Rome. His eclectic range of styles have given art historians exercise in tracing his adaptation of his models, while the lack of an immediately recognizable \\"Bourdon style\\" has somewhat dampened public appreciation. Some of his work was in the neoclassical style of Parisian Atticism. Bourdon spent most of his working career outside France, where, though he was a founding member of the Acad√©mie royale, he was for long largely dismissed as a pasticheur, a situation partly rebalanced by a comprehensive exhibition in 2000 of his work at the Mus√©e Fabre, where the collection includes a fine Lamentation painted in the last years of his life. His success required the establishment of an extensive atelier, where his pupils included Nicolas-Pierre Loir and Pierre Mosnier. He died in Paris in 1671.

It is a folktale possibly of the Diyala region as the later version seems to feature the god Ti≈°pak as its protagonist and may be an allegory representing his replacement of the chthonic serpent-god Ninazu at the top of the pantheon of the city of E≈°nunna. This part is played by Nergal in the earlier version. It was possibly a precursor of the En√ªma Eli≈°, where Labbu, meaning \\"Raging One\\" or \\"lion\\", was the prototype of Tiamat and of the Canaanite tale of Baal fighting Yamm. ==Synopsis== Extant in two very fragmentary copies, an Old Babylonian and a later Assyrian one from the Library of Ashurbanipal, which have no complete surviving lines, the Labbu Myth relates the tale of a possibly leonine certainly serpentine monster, a fifty-leagueCAD b p. 208b bƒìru A. long mu≈°ba-a≈°-ma: Ba≈°mu or sixty-league long MU≈†-·∏™U≈†:Mu≈°·∏´u≈°≈°u, depending on the version and reconstruction of the text.

The vast dimensions of Labbu are described. The sea, tƒÅmtuCompare the cognate Tiamat. has given birth to the dragon (line 6). The fragmentary line \\"He raises his tail...\\" identified him for Neil Forsyth as a precursor of a later Adversary, the dragon of Revelation 12:4, whose tail swept down a third of the stars of heaven, and cast them to the earth. In the later version, Labbu is created by the god Enlil who ‚Äúdrew [a picture of] the dragon in the sky\\", to wipe out humanity whose raucous noise has been disturbing this deity's sleep, a recurring motif in Babylonian creation epics. Whether this refers to the Milky Way (Heidel 1963) or a comet (Forsyth 1989) is not clear. The pantheon of Babylonian gods are terrified by this apparition and appeal to the moon god S√Æn or fertility goddess Aruru who conscripts Ti≈°pak/Nergal to counter this threat and ‚Äúexercise kingship‚Äù, presumably over E≈°nunna, as its reward. Ti≈°pak/Nergal raises objections to tangling with the serpent but, after a gap in the narrative, a god whose name is abraded provides guidance on military strategy. A storm erupts and the victor, who may or may not be Ti≈°pak or Nergal, in accordance with the advice given, fires an arrow to slay the beast. The epic fragments are not part of a cosmogony, Forsyth notes, as the cities of men already exist. F.A.M. Wiggerman found the myth's function as justifying Tishpak's accession as king, \\"as a consequence of his 'liberation' of the nation, sanctioned by the decision of a divine council.\\" ===Principal publications=== * plates 34-35 of tablet Rm 282 (line art) * plate 6 of tablet VAT 9443 (line art) * (translation) * (translation) * (translation) * (translation) * (transliteration and translation) * (translation) ==References== Category:Akkadian literature Category:Mesopotamian legendary creatures Category:Mythic aquatic creatures Category:Dragons ","title":"Labbu"},{"id":"2224957","text":"Guys 'n' Dolls were a UK pop group, initially comprising a three-girl/three- boy line-up and later becoming two-girl/two-boy. In the mid-1970s, they scored UK top-ten hits with the singles \\"There's a Whole Lot of Loving\\" and \\"You Don't Have to Say You Love Me\\". In the late 1970s they found further success in the Netherlands, where they had a number-one hit with \\"You're My World\\". ==Career== Guys 'n' Dolls were formed in November 1974, after Ammo Productions held auditions for three young men and three young women to perform as a vocal group. The six original members were Paul Griggs, David Van Day, Dominic Grant, Thereza Bazar, Martine Howard and Julie Forsyth (daughter of entertainer Bruce Forsyth). Guys 'n' Dolls released their first hit single, \\"There's a Whole Lot of Loving\\", in January 1975. The song was originally recorded in September 1974 by a group of session singers (including Tony Burrows and Clare Torry) for a TV advertisement for McVitie's biscuits. Guys 'n' Dolls were formed to cash in upon the popularity of the jingle and to present it as a single. However, the group was not ready in time to record an entirely new version for the single's hasty release and so the voices of the session singers remained on the single. The song became an immediate hit, rising to No. 2 in the UK singles chart, launching the group to overnight stardom. The following year, the group scored highly again as their cover of \\"You Don't Have to Say You Love Me\\" peaked at No.5. Other singles by the group charted more modestly and they only had one hit album, Guys 'n Dolls, released in 1975. In 1977, however, they scored a No.1 hit in both the Netherlands and Belgium with \\"You're My World\\", launching them on a new phase of their career. By mid-1977, Van Day and Bazar were unhappy with the direction of the group, and their complaints led to the management asking them to leave. By mutual agreement, publicity at the time showed leaving the group was their own decision, to concentrate on songwriting. The duo, as Dollar, had several hits in the late 1970s and 1980s. Guys 'n' Dolls continued as a quartet, with their third album Together (1977) depicting just the four remaining members. The group scored a final minor hit in the UK in 1978, and, after failing to renew their contract with Magnet Records, concentrated on their success in the Netherlands, where they continued having hits for the next few years. In late 1978, the group performed as the opening act for Frank Sinatra for a series of London concerts. In 1979, the group took part in the A Song For Europe contest, hoping to represent the UK in the Eurovision Song Contest with the song \\"How Do You Mend a Broken Heart?\\". The show was abandoned due to a BBC strike, but the song finished in tenth place of the 12 entries when the judges cast votes on the audio recordings of the songs. In 1980, Forsyth and Grant had their first child together, and Martine Howard and Guys 'n' Dolls' record producer Gerard Stellaard married and moved to the Netherlands. After marrying, Howard left the group, and was replaced by Forsyth's younger sister Laura early in 1981. The change was short-lived, as Laura was replaced by Rosie Hetherington, who had previously been a part of the dance troupe Legs & Co. Guys 'n' Dolls finished as a unit in December 1985, having spent 11 years together. Grant and Forsyth performed as the duo Grant & Forsyth, and had another five hits in the Netherlands. In 1988, Forsyth wrote the UK's Eurovision Song Contest entry \\"Go\\" performed by Scott Fitzgerald. Both Forsyth and Grant, with ex-Jigsaw member Des Dyer, sang backing vocals for the song's performance at the contest in Dublin, Ireland. The song finished second by a margin of one point behind Celine Dion's song for Switzerland, making it the closest-run contest ever.O'Connor, John Kennedy.

The department covers a large section of the Paran√° Delta and its low-lying islands. The main town of the division is Tigre; other towns include Don Torcuato, El Talar, General Pacheco, Benav√≠dez. The partido is bound to the north by the Paran√° de las Palmas River, to the northeast by the R√≠o de la Plata, to the southeast by San Fernando Partido, to the south by San Mart√≠n Partido, to the southwest by Malvinas Argentinas Partido and to the west by Escobar Partido. Its total area including the islands is 368 km¬≤ and its population was 376,381 as of 2010. The current mayor is Julio Cesar Zamora, from the Renewal Front within the Justicialist Party. The partido was originally named 'Las Conchas' after a local river (now known as the Reconquista River), but became popularly known as 'Tigre' in the 19th century. Tigre was also the name of a stream and is thought to derive from the tigres or jaguars seen in the area when it was first settled. In 1952, the name of the partido was officially changed to \\"Tigre Partido\\". A port was first built at the mouth of the Las Conchas river, which itself became known as Las Conchas. It served the islands and became an important strategic and smuggling point, targeted by Portuguese, English and Spanish invaders. The partido was officially founded in 1790, but the settlements were hit by floods and the town was moved to the present site of Tigre, at the mouth of the Luj√°n River by 1820. Argentine author Jorge Luis Borges said about Tigre: \\"no other city do I know that adjoins a secret group of green islands, which get lost at unknown waters of such a slow river that literature called it frozen...\\" Club de Regatas La Marina. == Colonial Times == The history of Tigre dates back to a port on the banks of Las Conchas River, which gave origin to Las Conchas Village. The port was used by the ships sailing the Paran√° River to or from Paraguay and also by those who carried wood, coal and firewood from the Delta to Buenos Aires. Las Conchas River (named after the sea shell debris that was abundant in the riverbed) is now called Reconquista and runs along Liniers street. The hamlet surrounding the port grew as its strategic importance increased, mostly since the 18th century. By 1780 a church had already been built and the parish was established at that time. Many river rises, floods and heavy rainstorms hit the area. One of the first historically registered catastrophes occurred in early June 1805, when Las Conchas village was almost devastated by a heavy rainstorm that made the river overflow its banks. Most of the people moved to higher nearby lands where San Fernando village was founded, and a channel was built to be used as a new port. The village was deserted and almost completely abandoned. In August 1820 it was destroyed by a tornado once again. The rising floodwaters trapped the port entrance. At the same time the outflow of water came out through a small stream called Tigre, causing the widening of its bed and turning it into a river. The port was then moved to its present location by the Tigre River and in time the village was named Tigre. == Promotion of the Paran√° River Delta in the 19th century == Supply barge in Tigre, still the easiest access to many points along the delta. During the second half of the 19th century the area became economically and socially more important, mainly due to Domingo F. Sarmiento, president of Argentina from 1868 to 1872. Sarmiento insisted on the favourable development possibilities of the islands and fought for the rights of settlers to own the land they were working on. His house on the island has been turned into a museum that lies on the bank of the river that bears his name. In those decades the country underwent a significant immigration process and many of those immigrants settled on the islands. The railway line to San Fernando, which arrived in 1863 and reached Tigre in 1865, improved communications with Buenos Aires and eased trade of Delta products, basically fresh fruit and its by-products such as fruit juice, jams and cider. Likewise, the train allowed one-day visits by city dwellers. This favoured the setting up of places to spend the day on the islands, called recreos, and aroused interest in rowing along the quiet waters. == Island dwellers == The earliest inhabitants of the islands were indigenous groups called guaran√≠es. In colonial times there was no stable population but nomadic hunters or firewood and coal seekers. Occasionally, it was also a smuggler's hiding place. From the moment Sarmiento encouraged development, new settlers came to the islands to live of the commercial exploitation of their products. Construction materials from the islands included sun-dried bricks, rush, straw and wood. The simple huts made from these materials were followed by houses made entirely of wood. == Delta economy == The early inhabitants lived mostly by hunting and fishing and on small palm coconuts (cocos australis). A few tribes sowed corn and peanuts, and grew fruit trees. In colonial times the area supplied Buenos Aires with firewood and coal. Later on, fruit growing prevailed up to 1940.That year a river rise spoiled most plants and the crisis provoked a mass departure of a large part of the population. The emergence of new fruit markets in other regions of the country hindered the recovery of this traditional economy resource. Other regional products are wicker baskets and pieces of furniture. The cultivation of osier (salix sp), which is native to European and Asiancold and temperate regions, was proposed by Sarmiento because it can resist floods. Another plant that adapts to floodable lands is New Zealand flax (phormium tenax), which was industrialised as from 1925 and is used in containers, burlap, cords, threads, runners and mats. By the end of the 20th century, the competence with synthetic fibres made New Zealand flax plantations anti-economic. Fishing and coypu breeding are other economic activities that are no longer attractive. Developments in the area include apiculture, camellia and azalea nurseries, handicrafts and timber. At the Delta Products Market of Tigre, various Delta products are sold. == Islanders' social life, tourism: The \\"Recreos\\" == Old Casino, today Tigre Art Museum. Moors on the delta, Tigre. Parque de la Costa Amusement Park, Tigre. Towards the end of the 19th century islanders became aware of their identity. They shared their common interest and troubles in the Delta journal, founded in 1933 by a Hungarian immigrant called Sandor Mikler. At that time 20,000 people lived on the islands and the population peaked at 40,000 in the following years. In 1936 local producers and entrepreneurs founded an association called \\"Consejo de Productores Isle√±os\\" (island producers board) and the following year they declared 31 October to be \\"islanders day\\". The celebration takes place every year with the attendance of local authorities and neighbours. There was an intense social activities on the islands with weekly meetings at the numerous clubs in the area. Weddings were celebrated either in the coastal villages, such as Campana or San Fernando, or in the island chapels. To facilitate religious service on the islands, a floating church to sail along the rivers was set up. As the service was rather expensive it was discontinued towards 1952. The bell tower is now exhibited at the Police Station in Paran√° de las Palmas and Carapachay, as a remembrance of those days. A procession by boat was made by the first time in 1923. Even today, this feast is celebrated on 8 December, the Immaculate Conception day. The procession is headed by the image of Virgin Mary on board of a boat of the \\"Prefectura Naval Argentina\\" (national coast guard) and is followed by all types of boats, big and small, commercial and private, all of them decked out for the event. A lot of spectators applaud the march from the banks of the Lujan River. == The golden years of Tigre == Rowing was one of the main attractions that fuelled the boom of the area. Rowing practice had started in the south of Buenos Aires and little by little was moved to the Luj√°n river due to the tranquility and beauty of the place. President Sarmiento was present at the first regatta organised on 8 December 1873. The event was so successful that the existing rowing clubs moved to Tigre, and new ones were founded by members of the various foreign communities residing in Buenos Aires. Yachting started to be practised in 1883, when the \\"Yacht Club Argentino\\", whose headquarters were later moved to San Fernando, was founded, and then at the \\"Tigre Sailing Club\\". The Tigre Hotel, was opened in 1890 on the bank of the Lujan River, and next to it the Tigre Club was opened in 1912. These elegant buildings became meeting places for the social elite of the \\"Belle √âpoque\\". The Hotel was demolished in 1940 but the Club is still there today and has been declared a National Historic Monument. ==Sports== The Delta Rugby Club is centered in Tigre Partido. ==Administrative subdivisions== Tigre Partido is divided into six divisions or localidades: *Benavidez *Rinc√≥n de Milberg *Don Torcuato *General Pacheco *Tigre, Buenos Aires *Troncos (Los Troncos del Talar) ==See also== * Paran√° Delta ==References *Municipality of Tigre *Art Museum of Tigre *Parque de la Costa *Via Tigre (tourism) *Photographs of Tigre *Club de Regatas La Marina (Rowing) Category:Partidos of Buenos Aires Province Category:Paran√° River ","title":"Tigre Partido"},{"id":"2224967","text":"Eckhart may be: ==People with the surname Eckhart== * Aaron Eckhart, an American film actor * Dietrich Eckart, a German journalist * Johann Georg von Eckhart, historian * Lisa Eckhart (born 1992), Austrian comedian and slam poet * Daniel Martin Eckhart, a Swiss screenwriter and author ==Other== * Eckhart Tolle (born 1948) is a German-born writer and public speaker living in Canada. * Eckhart von Hochheim, a German theologian and philosopher * Mason Eckhart, a comic book character * Eckhart (TV series), a Canadian animated children's show * Eckhart Branch Railroad, early short line railroad ==See also== * Eckart * Eckert (disambiguation) ","title":"Eckhart"},{"id":"2224968","text":"Denis Eugene Hurley (9 November 1915 ‚Äì 13 February 2004) was the South African Roman Catholic Vicar Apostolic of Natal and Bishop, and later Archbishop of Durban, from 1946 until 1992. He was born in Cape Town and spent his early years on Robben Island, where his father was the lighthouse keeper. In 1951, Hurley was appointed Archbishop of Durban and the youngest archbishop in the world at that time. Hurley was an active participant in the Second Vatican Council, which he described as \\"the greatest project of adult education ever held in the world\\". An outspoken opponent of apartheid, as chairman of the Southern African Catholic Bishops' Conference, Hurley drafted the first of the ground-breaking pastoral letters in which the bishops denounced apartheid as \\"blasphemy\\" and \\"intrinsically evil.\\" Upon his retirement as archbishop, he served as the Chancellor of the University of Natal. ==Life== Denis Hurley was born in Cape Town to Irish parents, spending his early years on Robben Island, where his father was the lighthouse keeper. Educated at St Charles College in Pietermaritzburg, Natal, he joined the Missionary Oblates of Mary Immaculate (OMI) in 1931 and in the following year was sent to Ireland for his novitiate. In 1933, Hurley was sent to the Angelicum University (now known as Pontifical University of Saint Thomas Aquinas) in Rome to study philosophy and theology. He received the degree Licentiate of Philosophy from the Angelicum in 1936 and started studying at the Gregorian University. Hurley was ordained as a priest in Rome on 9 July 1939 and was awarded his license in Theology in 1940. Later he was appointed curate at Emmanuel Cathedral, Durban, where he stayed until 1943 when he was appointed Superior at Saint Joseph's Scholasticate, then based in Prestbury, Pietermaritzburg. He stayed in this position until 12 December 1946 when, aged 31, was named Vicar Apostolic of Natal and Bishop of Durban. He was the youngest Roman Catholic bishop in the world at that time. He chose as his motto Ubi Spiritus, ibi libertas, which means \\"Where the Spirit is, there is liberty\\". Hurley was among the first church leaders to denounce apartheid, condemning the policy as an affront to human dignity.Shaw, Gerald. \\"Archbishop Denis Hurley\\" (obit), The Guardian, February 18, 2004 On 11 January 1951, the Vicariate Apostolic of Natal was elevated to the Archdiocese of Durban and Hurley became archbishop, also the youngest in the world at the time. In the following year, Hurley became the first president of the newly established Southern African Catholic Bishops Conference, a post he held until 1961. He was again President of this body from 1981 until 1987. Hurley is remembered for his contribution to the struggle against apartheid, his concern for the poor and his commitment towards a more just and peaceful society. In 1961, he was appointed to the Central Preparatory Commission for the Second Vatican Council. ==Second Vatican Council== In 1961, Hurley was appointed to the Central Preparatory Commission for the Second Vatican Council. He attributed this to Rome having out-of-date information stating he was still President of the Southern African Bishops Conference, when in fact Archbishop Owen McCann was President.Archbishop Hurley's Contribution To The Second Vatican Council At the council itself, Hurley was elected to the Commission for Seminaries, Studies and Catholic Education. During the council, he gave ten speeches and made four written submissions. During the council, Hurley wrote a series of anonymous articles for the South African Catholic weekly newspaper \\"The Southern Cross\\". In 2001 he wrote a 17-part series of memories of Vatican II for The Southern Cross. In recounting its informal cycle of lectures, workshops and long evenings of debates over dinner with interested members of the clergy and laity, Hurley observed that the presence of so many scholars who had been called to Rome to assist with the work of Vatican II had created \\"the greatest project of adult education ever held in the world.\\" Simmermacher, Gunther, \\"Hurley remembers Vatican II\\", The Southern Cross, April 2, 2005 These articles provided the basis for his posthumously published memoirs of the Council, Keeping the Dream Alive. Hurley was described as \\"...an eloquent and forceful preacher, ...mild-mannered and soft- spoken away from the pulpit. He was a man of formidable intellect, so much so that he was held in awe by his clergy. ==ICEL== Hurley took a special interest in the active participation of all the baptized in the church‚Äôs liturgy, especially the Mass. In 1975, Hurley was elected chair of the International Commission on English in the Liturgy (ICEL), a post to which he was re-elected until 1991. His work with Msgr. Frederick McManus of Catholic University in Washington led to a plan that a number of English speaking conferences would join together to prepare a single text for proposed use all over the world. In 1965 Pope Paul VI named Hurley to the Consilium for the Implementation of the Constitution on the Sacred Liturgy. In 1975 as ICEL chairman, he oversaw the completion of the four-volume breviary. Hurley frequently registered his disappointment at the reorganisation of ICEL under the auspices of the newly established Vatican office Vox Clara, as mandated by Pope John Paul II's instruction Liturgiam authenticam. ==Social justice== According to Anthony Egan, \\"Prohibited during Dutch rule, coolly tolerated by the British, and treated with intense suspicion after the Union of South Africa in 1910, the Church was (unsurprisingly) cautious in challenging apartheid. With the majority of its clergy foreign-born and thus vulnerable to deportation, it was encouraged even by the Vatican to ‚Äòplay it safe‚Äô after the 1948 National Party election victory. But Hurley, a white South African by birth, ... thought differently.\\" Hurley was an outspoken opponent of apartheid, and was a driving force in a 1957 declaration by the bishops of South Africa that described apartheid as \\"intrinsically evil\\". In the late 1970s Hurley held a daily silent protest, standing in front of the central Durban Post Office for a period each day with a placard expressing his opposition to apartheid and the displacement of people from their homes. In 1984 Hurley was charged with contravening the South African police act by publishing information which the government alleged to be untrue about atrocities committed in Namibia by the South African military unit known as Koevoet. He received many death threats and was at times subject to house arrest. On three occasions bombs went off near his residence. The state withdrew the charges later and settled a claim by the Archbishop for damages out of court, paying him R 25,000. Due to his commitment to social justice, the Denis Hurley Peace Institute, an associate body of the Southern African Catholic Bishops Conference, was named in his honour.Denis Hurley Peace Initiative Page Hurley also worked to assist young men who for reasons of conscience were opposed to joining the South African military. ==The Hurley Case== A lawsuit, known as The Hurley Case, managed to secure the release of Paddy Kearney, a political opponent of the ruling National Party detained under Section 29 of the Internal Security Act. According to South African law professor Tony Mathews, the case \\"Hurley and Another vs the Minister of Law and Order\\" became \\"the most important civil rights ruling for several decades\\" and is still taught in law schools today. Hurley became actively involved, turning up in black communities the day they were due to be forcibly removed. On hearing that children had died shortly after one such removal, Hurley counted their graves and recorded their names and ages. Then he released the details to the press, much to the fury of the state. In response to the weak response of South Africa's churches to apartheid, Hurley founded an ecumenical agency, Diakonia, dedicated to social justice. Hurley said his greatest struggle was convincing South African Roman Catholics that social justice was integral to their faith rather than an optional extra. Hurley was nicknamed Mehl'emamba (Eyes of the Mamba) by appreciative Zulus. ==Thomas More College== Hurley played a key role in supporting Chris Hurley (his brother) and Robin Savory in founding Thomas More College. His brother Chris later became the second headmaster of the school. Archbishop Hurley also wrote the school song, \\"God Our Maker\\". There is a memorial garden dedicated to him located on the school grounds. ==Last years== On retiring as Archbishop of Durban in 1992, Hurley became chancellor of the University of Natal from 1993 to 1998. He also served as a parish priest for ten years at Emmanuel Cathedral, Durban, where he had officiated so many years earlier as a curate. Hurley was seen by some as a \\"liberal\\". Many believe that his respectful and very careful questioning of Humanae Vitae in 1968 made the cardinalate an impossibility. In 2002 Hurley retired to write his memoirs. He also spent his time writing letters to The Times debating the finer points of cricket, and composing the words for new hymns. The final article to be published in his lifetime was a guest editorial in the Christmas 2003 edition of \\"The Southern Cross\\", headlined \\"God's special gift to us\\". Hurley died as he was being driven back to the Oblate retirement community in Durban after a celebration of the 50th anniversary of a school at whose dedication he had presided as a young archbishop.Page, John. \\"An appreciation of Denis Hurley, archbishop emeritus of Durban, South Africa\\", National Catholic Reporter, February 20, 2004 ==Honours== Hurley received the following honours during his lifetime: {  - !

Dawn grows impatient with Andrew's state of unconsciousness, but keeps researching at Buffy's request. Buffy asks for a book and her mother hands it to her. Joyce warns her that she needs to rest if she intends to defeat this evil, but Buffy knows the vision isn't real and then Xander wakes her up from her dream. The Ubervamp drags Spike further into a cave where the First has taken on Drusilla's form to watch Spike get tortured. At the Summers house, Dawn and Anya secretly try to force Andrew to wake and he does as Buffy walks in the room. They begin to interrogate him again about the First, but he takes some prompting before he's willing to help them. Andrew leads the gang to the school basement where the seal is still exposed on the ground, but no Spike or First Evil to be seen. Although they don't know what the seal did or does, the gang grab shovels and cover it with dirt again. On the way out, Buffy and Dawn run into Principal Wood, also carrying a shovel. Buffy and Dawn try to explain Buffy's surprising recovery from being sick and their own possession of a shovel while the principal explains himself and asks Buffy to return to work soon. At the house, Willow begins a spell to find the First, but it doesn't go the way she planned. Explosive bolts send Anya and Buffy flying while Willow is briefly possessed by the First Evil. Xander smashes a bowl used in the spell which breaks the effects and sends Willow crashing. She's fearful of the magic and hurting people and begs Buffy not to let her hurt anyone with magic. Buffy starts to leave to find the First herself, but is surprised to find Giles standing outside her front door. With him are three young girls ‚Äì Kennedy, Molly and Annabelle ‚Äì who are potential slayers that he's trying to protect. Giles informs the whole gang about the First's plans to destroy all slayers-in-training, their watchers and eventually the two active Slayers, Buffy and Faith. He breaks the news that the Council has been completely destroyed along with most of their records, except for the few books and references on the First he stole while there was still time. Giles goes over basic knowledge about the First Evil, explaining that it can only take on the appearance of the dead, but it's incapable of solid form. He informs Buffy that unfortunately, she's the only one strong enough to actually stand a chance of winning against the First. One of the Potentials, Kennedy, objects to the situation and wonders why they're hiding out on the Hellmouth of all places with only one person responsible for all their lives. In the cave, the Ubervamp tortures Spike by dunking his head under water while \\"Drusilla\\" lectures Spike about following the rules. Kennedy helps Willow make the sleeping arrangements around the house and ultimately, Kennedy ends up staying in Willow's room. The girls convene in the kitchen and start eating cookies after Dawn burns the meal she was trying to cook. Buffy and Giles walk and talk together as they search for an entrance to the cave Buffy remembers from the first time she encountered the First and its minions, the Bringers. Buffy unintentionally finds it as she falls through some old planks covering the ground. As she searches the caves, she's viciously attacked by the Ubervamp. She stakes the demon, but it doesn't kill him and he proceeds to beat her up badly. Buffy narrowly manages to escape the cave by climbing out and the vampire is kept at bay by the rising sun. Giles and Buffy return to the house to find the three potential slayers hanging out in the kitchen. Giles tells them all about the vampire Buffy fought, a Turok-Han. He explains that it's one of a prehistoric race of vampires that is far superior to and feared by the everyday vampires Buffy is used to. At work, Buffy researches \\"evil\\" on the Internet as Principal Woods stops to check on her. Again, in the cave, Spike is smacked around by the Ubervamp while Drusilla dances about and tries to convince Spike to decide to be on their side of the game. Spike doesn't fall for the mind tricks and earns himself more of a beating from the Ubervamp. Buffy reviews her wounds as her mother pays her another visit. Joyce talks to Buffy about evil and its constant presence in everyone and about the pressure Buffy's feeling to deal with this evil. She wakes up to find that she's still at work and had been in the middle of a meeting with a student. The student walks off and Principal Wood watches on from his office as a very tired Buffy tries to deal with the stress. Later that evening, the gang prepares for sundown and the potential danger it brings to them. The potential Slayers get weapons while Andrew tries unsuccessfully to convince Buffy and Xander to untie him. As Buffy watches for the sun to set, Giles reminds her that she's the one being depended on and then Molly interrupts, informing them that Annabelle ran off. The could-be Slayer runs through the streets of Sunnydale until she's captured by the Ubervamp and quickly killed. Buffy finds them both and is badly injured in a fight with the monster. The First in Drusilla's form gets angry with Spike as he continues to refuse to cooperate. A terribly wounded Buffy sits alone at home as she listens to Giles and Willow talk in another room. They worry about Buffy's condition and their ability to fight this thing that seems so much bigger than them all. Buffy finally comes downstairs and gives an inspirational speech about this huge challenge before them that is bigger than any evil they've ever faced. She tells the group that she's more scared than ever, but she's not about to back down now. There's a new plan: they're declaring war on this evil instead of waiting for it to make a move which Buffy says,\\"If they want an apocalypse, we'll give em one.\\" ==External links== * * Category:Buffy the Vampire Slayer (season 7) episodes Category:2002 American television episodes ","title":"Bring on the Night (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)"},{"id":"2224990","text":"\\"Shoplifters of the World Unite\\" is a song by the English rock band the Smiths.

Itacar√© has about 27,000 residents. Out of these, approximately 50% live in the rural interior. A mixture of races - Amerindian, black and white - can be seen in the features of the natives, called \\"na√ß√£o grapi√∫na\\", whom Jorge Amado affectionately referred to as \\"the captivating people of this land\\". The town was founded as a Portuguese colonial settlement, originally called S√£o Jorge dos Ilh√©us, in 1532. The town was a notorious hangout for Dutch and Portuguese pirates during the early colonial period and later became a hub for the cocoa planting and a port for whalers. It was officially given city status in 1881. The municipality contains 41% of the Serra do Conduru State Park, created in 1997. It also contains 14.88% of the Ba√≠a de Camamu Environmental Protection Area, created in 2002. ==Economy== After suffering a massive blight of Vassoura de Bruxa (Witch's broom) devastated the region's cocoa crops in the 1980s, Itacar√© has depended mostly upon tourism. It is a popular destination for surfers, hikers and ecotourists. The town has a series of beautiful small cove-type beaches as well as Itacarezinho and other picturesque beaches further along the coast. Itacar√© is on the edge of a national park, one of the last large expanses of Atlantic rain forest left in Brazil. The change from sleepy agrarian town to tourist hotspot has not been an easy one, however. Locals recently won a hard-fought campaign to stop land owners who wanted to charge for access to the beaches. Access to one of the most pristine beaches, Prainha, had been blocked by a hotel/condominium development called Sao Jose Eco Resort. Both Prainha and Sao Jose beaches are now accessible by foot, free of charge. Despite development in the area, it remains a hub of Bahian culture.

During World War II the line was adopted as a strategic route for freight avoiding London, and additional connections were made to nearby lines to improve the utility of the route. In fact the route was not greatly used for its intended purpose. After the war the line was again scheduled to be developed as a strategic route, but this scheme too was never fully implemented. Passenger services were withdrawn from most of the line on 1 January 1968, and only the Bletchley‚ÄìBedford section remained open for passenger traffic. In 1987, the section between Oxford and Bicester was reopened, followed in 2015 by a connection to the Chiltern Main Line at Bicester, enabling Chiltern Railways to operate an Oxford to London passenger service. There are funded plans for the entire line to be re- established by the \\"mid 2020s\\" (partly on a new route) under a new name East West Rail. ==History== The Oxford to Cambridge line, when completed, ran broadly west to east. In the early days there were five intersecting trunk lines running south to north: * The Great Western Railway at Oxford, with its northward allies; * the London and Birmingham Railway, forming part of the later West Coast Main Line; * the Midland Main Line, opened by the Midland Railway, crossing the route at Bedford; * the East Coast Main Line, opened by the Great Northern Railway, forming a connection at Sandy; and * the Eastern Counties Railway at Cambridge. Two other trunk routes, the Great Western Railway's Bicester cut-off and the Great Central Railway main line, were built later. Although a continuous line from Oxford to Cambridge was proposed from time to time, it was actually built by local schemes. From west to east, these were: * the Buckinghamshire Railway, from Oxford to Bletchley; * the Bedford Railway, from Bletchley to Bedford; * the Bedford and Cambridge Railway, between those points, which adopted the alignment of an earlier private scheme, the Sandy and Potton Railway. In time, these sections were all incorporated into the London and North Western Railway. ===First railway at Bletchley=== The London and Birmingham Railway opened on 9 April 1838 as far north as Denbigh Hall, about a mile north of Bletchley (which was then a minor village). Initially, passengers alighted here to take a stagecoach on Watling Street to during construction work on the intervening section, which opened on 17 September 1838,Robin Leleux, A Regional History of the Railway of Great Britain: volume 9: the East Midlands, David & Charles, Newton Abbot, 1976, , pages 17 to 27 and this temporary terminus was closed. Subsequently and for a time, (a few miles further north and on the main road between Oxford and Cambridge via Buckingham and Bedford) took over as an important stop on the line, as a point where engines were changed over and passengers rested. ===Bedford Railway=== Bedford Railway in 1846In 1836, proposals were put forward to build a line from Cambridge to join the L&BR; (still under construction) at Bletchley; the line would have passed through Bedford, but the scheme was not taken forward. The obvious enhancement to the prosperity of Aylesbury following that town's connection to the L&BR; changed attitudes, and as time passed, Bedford business interests sought a connection to the main line railway.Bill Simpson, Oxford to Cambridge Railway: volume two: Bletchley to Cambridge, Oxford Publishing Company, Poole, 1983, , pages 7 to 18 In 1844 George Stephenson visited Bedford to discuss the matter. At a meeting on 23 April 1844 he set out his proposed scheme, for a line to Bedford joining the L&BR; main line at Bletchley. Some opinions had preferred Wolverton as the junction, since Bletchley was not then a settlement of any significance.Bill Simpson, Oxford to Cambridge Railway: Volume One: Oxford to Bletchley, Oxford Publishing Co, Headington, 1981, , pages 7 to 15 A prospectus for the Bedford and London & Birmingham Railway was prepared; the capital was to be ¬£125,000.About ¬£ today. On 16 July 1846 the London and Birmingham Railway amalgamated with others, and formed the London and North Western Railway. A proposed extension of the Bedford line on to Cambridge through Hitchin was submitted to Parliament in the 1846 session but failed standing orders. David Gould, The London and Birmingham Railway, 150 years on, David & Charles, Newton Abbot, 1987, , page 15 The line to Bedford opened on 17 November 1846, when a ceremonial opening took 600 persons from Bedford to Bletchley in a special train. The new line had a connection to the River Great Ouse at Bedford, trailing from the Bletchley direction.It was soon made into a complete triangle, avoiding the necessity of providing a turntable for engine turning. The Bedford station was not yet ready at the time of opening. The commercial benefit to Bedford, already well served by coastal water-borne commerce over the River Great Ouse, is indicated by the immediate fall of coal prices, from 1s 9d to 11d per cwt. There were four passenger trains each way, Sunday excepted, but this was soon enhanced to five each way, one of which was limited-stop, and two Sunday trains. Immediately on opening the Bedford Railway was absorbed into the London and North Western Railway. The terms were 4% per annum on the capital, plus half of any surplus. The LNWR had subscribed 1,522 of the 2,500 shares. ==Buckinghamshire Railway== The Buckinghamshire Railway in 1851 Railways at Oxford north in 1854 The Oxford and Bletchley Junction Railway and the Buckingham and Brackley Junction Railway had both been authorised in 1846,Malcolm Reed, The London and North Western Railway: A History, Atlantic Transport Publishers, Penryn, 1996, , pages 45 and 46 and before construction the two schemes were amalgamated to form the Buckinghamshire Railway, authorised by Act of Parliament on 22 July 1847.The first sod of the Buckingham and Brackley Junction Railway had been cut at Buckingham on 20 April 1847. The new company would form a Y shape from Bletchley to both Oxford and Banbury. The 1847 powers also included an extension to Banbury, connecting to the Oxford and Rugby Railway there. and a southward extension from Verney Junction to join the Aylesbury branch. The scheme was encouraged by the London and North Western Railway, which wished to block northward encroachment from the Great Western Railway, whose area of influence at the time was further south. The junction that became Verney Junction was known at first as Claydon Junction; the name Verney Junction was given to the station that was later established there. When the World War II link from the Great Central Railway main line was made, the junction there was called Claydon LNE Junction to emphasise the distinction. Following authorisation of the Buckinghamshire company, the directors determined on 10 November 1847 to press ahead with the Banbury line in preference to the Oxford line. Work started on the last day of 1847. The line opened from Bletchley to Banbury on 1 May 1850 for passenger traffic, and goods trains started on 15 May 1850. Rewley Road station building (preserved and relocated) Opening of the Oxford line (from Claydon Junction, at first as a single track only) followed relatively swiftly: to Islip on 1 October 1850; on to Oxford Road on 2 December 1850. This station was at the crossing of the present-day A4165 road, and therefore near to the modern Oxford Parkway station. Horse omnibuses and carts connected the station with Oxford itself. The line was extended to the company's own station at Oxford on 20 May 1851. It was a single track west of Claydon Junction. The 1853 passenger timetable shows 4 trains each way daily except Sundays, the first trains each way divided and joined Buckingham portions at Winslow. The journey time Oxford to Bletchley was 75 minutes and a typical journey Oxford to London took about 2 hours 45 minutes.Bradshaw's Railway Guide, 1853, part reproduced in Simpson, volume 1, page 12 The company had its own station at Oxford. It was fortunate in finding a site: Rewley Abbey had long since fallen into ruins, and the site was made available. Approaching trains crossed a swing bridge over the Sheepwash Channel to reach it. The junction with Oxford and Rugby Railway at Banbury was not made by the company, and the southwards extension from Verney was abandoned for the time being. The LNWR provided more than half the capital and worked the line from the beginning, and leased it for 999 years from 1 July 1851 guaranteeing a 4% dividend to the other shareholders. The LNWR absorbed the Buckinghamshire Railway company on 21 July 1879. Early in 1854 the line from Verney Junction to Oxford was doubled, completing double track along the full length of the line. Verney was a junction, but no station was built until 1868, prompted by the construction of the Aylesbury and Buckingham Railway.Simpson, volume 1, pages 97 and 99 ==Wolverhampton to London via Bletchley== Railway lines at Bletchley in 1854 The Oxford, Worcester and Wolverhampton Railway was authorised as a broad gauge line on 4 August 1845. Its line was to be 89 miles in length, connecting to the Great Western Railway at Wolvercot Junction, just north of Oxford. The cost of the line was heavy, and the estimates fell considerably short, so that the company was constantly short of funds during the construction period. For some time it concentrated its resources on the northern part of the authorised line.John Boynton, The Oxford, Worcester and Wolverhampton Railway, Mid England Books, Kidderminster, 2002, Although the OW&WR; had originally been expected to be an ally of the GWR, the friendly relations cooled, and the London and North Western Railway (as owner of the Oxford to Bletchley line) developed good relations with the OW&WR.; The LNWR tried to negotiate a takeover of the OW&WR;, but this was rejected in Parliament; and in 1852 a direct connection between the LNWR Bletchley line and the OW&WR; was also thrown out. In 1853 however the proposed connection (later known as the Yarnton Spur) was approved, and on 4 June 1853 the OW&WR; had opened its line as far as Wolvercot Junction, its southern extremity. The Yarnton Spur was a short double-track line, in length, from Oxford Road Junction to Yarnton, and it was opened on 1 April 1854. The LNWR at once started operating through passenger services between Euston and Wolverhampton, via Bletchley, Yarnton Spur and the OW&WR.; The trains were worked by the LNWR as far as Hanborough, and also from Dudley to Wolverhampton LNWR station via the South Staffordshire curve at Tipton. The Buckinghamshire Railway connection at Bletchley left in a southward direction, and a west to south chord was brought into use there in October 1854 to permit direct running between Euston and the Buckinghamshire line. A west to south curve to the Yarnton Spur was opened, allowing direct access from the OW&WR; line to the LNWR Oxford station; this was used chiefly for goods traffic, but in the autumn of 1857 local passenger trains used it during a period of exceptionally strained relations between the OW&WR; and the GWR. The service to London over the LNWR ceased by 1 September 1861; the west to south curve at Yarnton was reduced to a through siding only shortly afterwards, and the west to south curve at Bletchley was closed and lifted in 1864.Reed, pages 65 and 66 Nevertheless, the goods and mineral traffic from the OW&WR; line remained considerable; Lawrence, writing in 1910, said that, \\"In March last, no fewer than 7,500 coal trucks made use of the loop.\\"J T Lawrence, From Oxford to Cambridge by the London and North Western Railway, Railway Magazine, October 1910, page 321 ==Verney Junction== There was a junction but no station at Verney Junction until 1868, when the Aylesbury and Buckingham Railway completed their line from Aylesbury to Verney. The Great Western Railway worked the A&BR; trains until the company was absorbed by the Metropolitan Railway in 1891, becoming the northern terminus of the Metropolitan Railway. Two Pullman cars worked to Baker Street daily. ==Joint station proposed for Bedford== The railways of Bedford in 1860 The Oxford to Cambridge line crossed under the Midland main line, and there were two separate passenger stations. In November 1855 officers of the Midland Railway and the LNWR met to consider the construction of a joint station at Bedford. It would have been a little to the west of the contemporary LNWR station. The scheme was agreed to be desirable and feasible, but the Midland Railway board declined to approve it, and it foundered.E G Barnes, The Rise of the Midland Railway, George Allen and Unwin Limited, London, 1966, page 153 ==Sandy and Potton Railway== The Sandy and Potton Railway in contextThe Great Northern Railway had opened its line from London to Peterborough on 7 June 1850, ultimately giving access to York, and running through Sandy.Awdry, pages 134-135 The Sandy and Potton Railway was planned by Captain Sir William Peel. He had settled in Potton, and conceived a railway running almost entirely over his own lands, connecting with the Great Northern Railway at Sandy. His objective was purely altruistic. The length of the line was miles, and an opening ceremony was held in June 1857. The line opened to public goods traffic on 23 June 1857. A Board of Trade inspection took place on 5 November 1857, and this was successful, enabling opening of the line to passengers on 9 November 1857. Peel acquired a locomotive for the line from George England and Co. of Hatcham; it was named Shannon, after the frigate commanded by Peel.There may have been a second engine: Simpson says (volume 2 page 15): Another engine, no 2, Little England, was bought by the LNWR for ¬£350. A locomotive was hired from the GNR on one or two occasions, and passenger rolling stock was supplied by the GNR.John Wrottesley, The Great Northern Railway: volume 1: Origins and Development, Harpur Collins, 1978, pages 143 and 144 The line had cost ¬£15,000 to build.Simpson, volume 2, pages 15 and 16Leleux, page 28 The GNR had allowed Captain Peel to terminate his line in their Sandy goods yard, on condition that he would remove his works if the GNR required the site. Captain Peel died in April 1858 in Cawnpore (now Kanpur), India. ==Bedford and Cambridge Railway== The Bedford and Cambridge Railway, 1862 In 1859 the Cambridge aspirations of several railway companies were competing for Parliamentary approval. A proposed Bedford, Potton and Cambridge Railway was thrown out, but the reverse showed that an alliance with the Great Northern Railway might prove fruitful. In the 1860 session of Parliament, the Bedford and Cambridge Railway (as it now styled itself) got the Royal Assent on 6 August 1860. The Great Northern Railway hoped to build from Shepreth to this new line near Lords Bridge and gain access to Cambridge, by-passing the hostile, and even spiteful, Eastern Counties Railway. The Bedford and Cambridge Railway was to take over the Sandy and Potton Railway and use its alignment. The route chosen entered the southern extremity of Cambridge alongside the Eastern Counties route from London, at Cambridge being permitted to use a platform at the ECR station. There was to be a separate LNWR goods station west of Hills Road.Reed, pages 80 to 82 In fact the construction significantly overran cost estimates, and the company had to confer with the LNWR (as prospective lessee) about how to raise the extra cash. The authorised capital had been ¬£240,000, and this had never fully been subscribed, and after opening the estimated cost to complete had risen to ¬£370,175. This at last proved to be accurate. There was acrimony between the companies, but the LNWR underwrote the extra capital, and after considerable further negotiation, the LNWR absorbed the Bedford and Cambridge Railway Company by a share conversion, equating to 4% on the ¬£240,000 original capital. It opened on 7 July 1862 for passengers, and for goods in October 1862. The Sandy and Potton Railway had been purchased for ¬£20,000. On 1 July 1862 the Eastern Counties Railway was restructured into the Great Eastern Railway.Leleux, page 28D I Gordon, A Regional History of the Railways of Great Britain,: volume 5: the Eastern Counties, David and Charles, Newton Abbot, 1968, revised 1977, , page 147 Potton Station in 1967The May 1864 working timetable shows four passenger trains running throughout from Cambridge to Bletchley, and one early train from Bedford to Bletchley, and three goods trains. One Sunday passenger train is shown. Most of the passenger trains appear to continue to Oxford and London, probably by through coach attached to other trains.Simpson, volume 2, page 28 Working arrangements were made with the LNWR, authorised by Act of 23 June 1864. The company was absorbed by the LNWR on 5 July 1865. The line as constructed was single; double track was later constructed between Sandy and Gamlingay on 20 October 1870, and on to Cambridge on 10 July 1871.Simpson, volume 2, page 18 ==Flat crossing at Bedford== The Midland Railway's London extension opened in 1857, at this stage to Hitchin. It crossed the LNWR line at Bedford by a (nearly) 90-degree flat crossing; although it was undesirable, it was considered an appropriate economy measure as compared with a bridge crossing.In fact the western apex of the engine turning triangle was crossed by the Midland line, forming a complex permanent way construction. On 12 March 1875 a collision took place at the location, as an LNWR train was struck by a Midland train. The signals protecting the crossing were not of a modern description; the LNWR train started from the station and approached the crossing, fouling it against the stop signal at danger. One passenger died of injuries, and six persons were injured.Barnes, page 148Board of Trade accident Report dated 18 March 1875, available at ==Railmotors== Railmotor at Bicester Town railway station In the early twentieth century, railways sought lower-cost methods of operating passenger trains. The LNWR experimented with a steam railmotor. This was a single passenger coach, designed at Wolverton, with a small integrated steam locomotive. A railmotor was brought to Oxford for trials with a service to Bicester. However, during a trial run on 5 October 1905 the vehicle developed a hot axlebox, and the opening was deferred to the 9th. It was found to be capable of a top speed of 45 mph, and was timed for 30 minutes for the twelve miles to Bicester. The vehicle had seats for 48 passengers in two saloons, smoking and non-smoking; the transverse seating had reversible backs, to allow passengers to face the direction in which they were going. They were considered by users to be very comfortable at the time. Woodwork was framed teak and the coach was lit electrically. Alighting and departing the vehicle at the ground level platforms of the halts was effected by a set of steps that swung out from the body of the vehicle. The steps were interlocked with the brakes. In 1905 there were six workings between Oxford and Bicester, with one additional on Thursday and Saturday, in each direction.Simpson, volume 1, pages 60 and 62; original timetable reproduced on page 62 To facilitate the new service a number of small timber platform halts were built. The halts were unstaffed, as tickets were issued by a Conductor on the train. The first was Summertown Halt, opened on 20 August 1906; by the following January the name had been changed to Port Meadow. The remainder of the halts were opened on 9 October 1905. From 1 December 1905 a steam railmotor was operated between Bedford and Bletchley also, and several new halts were opened here too. There were three vehicles, one being kept as a maintenance spare. Simpson, volume 2, pages 33 to 35 The six halts were closed from 1 January 1917 because of the war, and reopened on 5 May 1919. The railmotors had limitations: they were underpowered and had limited accommodation, and suffered from reliability problems. They were replaced by auto trains about 1921; in this type of train, a conventional locomotive operated with a coach, specially adapted for the driver to control the train when being propelled from the coach. The auto trains and the halts west of Bicester were finally withdrawn during the General Strike on 25 October 1926; competition from road omnibuses had led to seriously declining usage. Further east, the system continued: in 1959, the auto-trains were replaced by diesel multiple units, and at this time the remaining stopping points were given raised platforms.Simpson, volume 2, pages 33 to 35 The railmotor halts were, from Oxford to Islip: Summertown Halt, soon to be renamed Port Meadow; Wolvercote; Oxford Road, and between Islip and Bicester: Oddington, Charlton and Wendlebury Halt near Bicester. The eastern section halts were Bow Brickhill, Aspley Guise, Husborne Crawley, Wootton Pillinge, Wootton Broadmead, Kempston Hardwick, and Kempston & Elstow.Simpson, volume 2, pages 33 to 35 ==Grouping of the railways== At the beginning of 1923, the main line railways of Great Britain were \\"grouped\\" into one or other of four new, large companies, in compliance with the Railways Act 1921. The LNWR and the Midland Railway were constituents of the new London Midland and Scottish Railway. The Great Western Railway absorbed a number of other concerns and continued under the same name. The Great Northern Railway and the Great Eastern Railway were constituents of the new London and North Eastern Railway.D C Robinson, Railway Amalgamation in Great Britain, The Railway Gazette, 1923 The whole of the Oxford to Cambridge line was thus part of the new LMS. In the 1930s, the major railways adopted a novel form of collaboration in the interest of reducing operating expenses. In 1934 the Stationmaster of the GWR's Oxford General station took over the management of the LMS's Rewley Road station. Cartage lorries in Oxford carried the initials of both companies.Simpson, volume 1 page 24 ==The Micheline railcar== In 1931, the Michelin Tyre Company was trying to market an internal combustion (petrol) railcar, which it named the Micheline. It was a ten-wheel articulated vehicle, with pneumatic rubber tyres. It was tried on the line in 1932. Carrying only 24 passengers and with uncertain reliability, it had many of the disadvantages of the steam railmotors, and the trial did not lead to adoption of the system.Simpson includes a note implying earlier trials of petrol railcars on the line, but does not elaborate: \\"The text on page 38 is taken from a Micheline Tyre Company booklet selling the idea of the new type of internal combustion railcar. An idea not new to the Oxford line since the LNWR experiment early in the century.\\"Simpson, volume 1, pages 37 and 38Colin G Maggs, Branch Lines of Buckinghamshire, Sutton Publishing, Stroud, 2000, , page 110 ==Diesel railcar== On 12 September 1938, a new diesel railcar design started work on the line. It was a three-car articulated unit, powered by six 125 hp diesel engines; the design was stylish and futuristic, and included central control of sliding passenger doors by the guard. The train was designed at Derby LMS. Three journeys throughout the Oxford to Cambridge line were undertaken daily, with some short fill-in trips. The journey time Oxford to Cambridge, with three stops, (Bletchley, Bedford and Sandy) was 1 hour 45 minutes, comparing favourably with the 3 hour steam train journey. The runs were not advertised in the ordinary timetables, but only by handbills locally. The outbreak of World War II prevented further development of this experimental system.Simpson, volume 2, pages 80 to 82 ==Strategic route during the 1939 ‚Äì 1945 war== In September 1939, war on Germany was declared by the United Kingdom. Aerial bombardment of UK cities and industrial sites was expected, and it was considered essential to create a trunk route for goods traffic avoiding London, which was expected to be the principal target of bombing. The Cambridge to Oxford route was selected to be the core of this route, because of its intersections with several trunk routes. Where existing connections between railways on the route were inadequate, relatively simple enhancements would resolve the difficulty. Wragg describes the situation: > The solution was to build what amounted to a railway by-pass of London. Of > necessity this was some distance from the capital, both to avoid disruption > from heavy air raids, and also to utilise existing lines as far as possible. > The start of this massive loop was the old London and North Western line > from Cambridge to Oxford‚Ä¶ > There were good existing connections in and out of this line at Bedford and > Bletchley, but at Sandy and at Oxford time-consuming shunting movements > would be necessary, so here again new connections were hastily installed and > opened during 1940. There was no link at all at Calvert so a completely new > link was created.David Wragg, Wartime on the Railways, History Press, > Stroud, 2006, new edition 2012, So in November 1940 Oxford North Junction was created, enabling through running from the Bletchley line towards Oxford GWR station.Simpson, volume 1, page 132R T Munns, Milk Churns to Merry-go-round: A Century of Train Operation, David and Charles, Newton Abbot, 1986, A south-to-east chord line was constructed at Claydon across an area called Shepherd's Furze, connecting the former Great Central Main Line with the line from Bletchley. This link proved a useful connection in addition to its emergency value, and it saw much traffic during the war. At Bletchley, the old west-to-south curve, removed in 1864, was reinstated, opening on 31 August 1942. . The Bicester Military Railway was built; it served a very large depot for ordnance and equipment. The civilian railway authorities protested at the adverse impact the railway movements to and from the depot would have on the ordinary war effort of the LNWR line, and the Ministry of War Transport agreed to the building of a new 660 wagon capacity yard at Swanbourne, about miles west of Bletchley.Ernest R Lawton and Maurice W Sackett, Bicester Military Railway, Oxford Publishing Company, 1992, , page 17Simpson, volume 1, pages 18 and 19 Sandy North CurveThe Railway Executive also constructed a west-to-north connection at Sandy; it opened in 1942. However it did not prove to have a strategic value in peacetime and was removed after the war.Norman Crump, By Rail to Victory: The Story of the LNER in Wartime, published by the LNER, York, 1947R T Munns, Milk Churns to Merry-go-round: A Century of Train Operation, David and Charles, Newton Abbot, 1986, Crump explains the strategic significance: > The combined length of [the Sandy and Claydon curves] cannot have been much > more than a mile, but in conjunction with a link joining the Great Western > and Southern lines at Staines they provided a route for trains from the > Great Northern to run via Sandy, Bletchley, Calvert, High Wycombe, Greenford > and Staines on to the Southern. This route would have been of the utmost use > if the London junctions had been destroyed. Actually it was only used on a > few occasions, and the operating difficulties were considerable. ==Bicester Military Railway== Arncott Supply Depot In the late 1930s, a site at Bicester was selected for a large Ordnance Depot to be road and rail served. Construction of the Depot began in July 1940. The railway part of the site would start from a junction with the Oxford to Bletchley line and encircle the two hills of Graven Hill and Arncott. By the end of 1941 the exchange sidings had been laid, and in 1942 the first troop train entered the depot from Bicester station. The site was heavily used during the war, particularly in the preparations for D-Day. Since the war, the site has been retained as a base for the Royal Logistic Corps. At its peak there were about 40 single-track miles of layout within the depot.Simpson, volume 1, pages 68 to 71Lawton and Sackett, pages 11 to 20 ==The wartime curves after the war== The Oxford connection was useful in peacetime and was retained. The same is true of the Claydon curve, which provided a useful route for certain freight flows, and for empty passenger stock moves. The Bicester and Sandy connections proved less useful, and were removed. ==Nationalisation== The main line railways of Great Britain were taken into state ownership at the beginning of 1948, pursuant to the Transport Act 1948. The entire line was in the London Midland Region of British Railways at first, but in 1951 the section from just east of Bicester to Oxford was transferred to the Western Region. ==Transfer to the GWR station at Oxford== The operation of two passenger stations at Oxford was obviously wasteful and the wartime connection allowed trains from the Bletchley direction to run directly into the GWR's Oxford General station. In October 1951, a complete transfer of passenger operation at Oxford into this (former GWR) station, now named simply Oxford railway station, took place. Most goods workings were transferred to the former GWR Hinksey yard, and Rewley Road station handled only coal and some general goods traffic.Simpson, volume 1, page 132 ==1955 development plan: goods== Railway lines at Bletchley after construction of the Bletchley Flyover In the first years of British Railways, the organisation was beset with falling demand as costs increased. In 1955 a report, The Modernisation and Re-equipment of British Railways,The Modernisation and Re-equipment of British Railways, British Transport Commission, London, 1955 was published. ¬£1.2 billion would be spent on the project. Subsidiary reports recommended the development of the Oxford to Cambridge line as part of an outer freight ring route from Cambridge to Ashford (Kent) via Oxford, Reading and Tonbridge, keeping freight flows away from London. The cost was to be ¬£15 million. A large marshalling yard was to be built at Swanbourne, and the Bletchley Flyover (a viaduct over the West Coast Main Line beside Bletchley station). Work on the Swanbourne yard and the Bletchley viaduct started in September 1958. The viaduct was ready in 1962 (it had cost ¬£1.5 million) but work was halted on the marshalling yard.T R Gourvish, British Railways: 1948 ‚Äì 1973: A Business History, Cambridge University Press, 1986, , pages 290 and 703Maggs, page 105 Gerry Fiennes was Chief Operating Officer, British Railways, at the time and wrote that he was convinced marshalling yards should be built in the areas of production and consumption, and not, like Swanbourne, in greenfield sites: ==Modernisation and rationalisation== The Oxford to Cambridge railway line in 1960If development of passenger business on the line had been envisaged in 1955, that too was suddenly reversed, and in 1959 closure of the entire route was considered. However the introduction of diesel multiple unit passenger trains in that year substantially reduced operating costs, and the closure idea was rescinded. In the Beeching Report of 1963,The Reshaping of British Railways, British Railways Board, London, 1963 retention of the line was recommended, with only minor curtailment, but in December 1963 closure was once again put forward, as income was only a little over half of operating expenses. Closure was approved, and most local freight facilities were withdrawn on 18 April 1966. Following public protest, passenger operation on the central section between Bedford and Bletchley was retained; delay in arranging substitute bus services resulted in the passenger closure of the remainder being deferred to 1 January 1968. The line from Bedford (Goldington Power Station) to the junction at Cambridge was closed completely; the wartime marshalling yard at Swanbourne was closed in March 1967.Gordon, pages 148 and 149 The Buckingham branch closed to passengers on 7 September 1964 and to goods on 5 December 1966.Gould, page 15Simpson, volume 1, page 15 On 7 October 1973, the line from Bicester to Oxford was reduced to single track. Following that time, for some years the chief use of the line was as a connection from Aylesbury via Claydon LNE Junction to Bletchley for stone trains, refuse trains from the Bristol area, and empty passenger stock movements.Simpson, volume 1, pages 134 and 136 ==Revitalisation and renewal, East West Rail== Swanbourne, showing the dilapidated condition of the track (February 2006) Although the story of the original Varsity Line ends in 1967, parts of the route continued as the Oxford‚ÄìBicester line and the Marston Vale line. Beginning in 2015, work to revitalise and renew the route began; it hoped that by the end of the 2020s the two university cities will be connected by rail again as the East West Rail link. ==Varsity line station locations and dates== The Varsity Line and the lines it meets.

II. 3., H-1052). Its main objectives are: # to bring together artists and scientists, educators and students devoted to, or interested in, the research and understanding of the concept and application of symmetry (asymmetry, dissymmetry); # to provide regular information to the general public about events in symmetry studies; # to ensure a regular forum (including the organization of symposia, and the publication of a periodical) for all those interested in symmetry studies. The topic was introduced for the first time by Russian and Polish scholars. Then in 1952, Hermann Weyl published his fascinating book Symmetry,Hermann Weyl, 1952. Symmetry. Princeton University Press. which was later translated into 10 languages. Since then, it became an attractive subject of research in various fields. A variety of manifestations of the principle of symmetry in sculpture, painting, architecture, ornament, and design, in organic and inorganic nature has been revealed; the philosophical and mathematical significance of this principle has been studied. During the 1980's the discussions concerning the nature of the world, whether it was essentially probabilistic or naturally geometric, revived the interest of the researchers to the topic. The intellectual atmosphere of this period facilitated the idea of establishment of a new institution devoted to the study of all forms of complexity and patterns of symmetry and orderly structures pervading science, nature and society, that ultimately led to the establishment of the International Society for the Interdisciplinary Study of Symmetry. The Society's community comprises several branches of science and art, while symmetry studies have gained the rank of an individual interdisciplinary field in the judgement of the scientific community. The Society has members in all continents, in over forty countries. The Society was founded in 1989 following a successful international meeting in Budapest. It has operated continuously since its foundation, publishing printed and web journals and hosting an International Congress and Exhibition entitled Symmetry: Art and Science every three years: * 1989 in Budapest, Hungary * 1992 in Hiroshima, Japan * 1995 in Washington DC, US * 1998 in Haifa, Israel * 2001 in Sydney, Australia * 2004 in Tihany, Hungary * 2007 in Buenos Aires, Argentina * 2010 in Gm√ºnd, Austria * 2013 in Crete, Greece * 2016 in Adelaide, Australia *2019 in Kanazawa, Japan Interim full conferences have been held in * Tsukuba Science City (co- organized with Katachi no kagaku kai, Japan), 1994 and 1998 * Brussels (2002) * Lviv [Lemberg] (2008) * Krak√≥w and Wroclaw (2008).

Binegar is a small village and civil parish in Somerset, England. It is located on the A37, east of Wells, between Shepton Mallet and Chilcompton. Its population in 2011 was 313. Binegar and Gurney Slade on the opposite side of the A37 are effectively a single village and share a sign on the main road. In Gurney Slade, the quarry and houses on the north side of Tape Lane are in Binegar parish whilst the south side is in Ashwick parish. In Binegar, some houses on the south side of Station Road are in Ashwick parish and some on the north side of the village are in Emborough parish. ==History== The village had one Church of England Voluntary Controlled primary school, which was shut at the end of 2011, one very old church, post office, and smattering of houses. It also has 2 pubs, the Horse & Jockey and The George. It used to have a station on the Somerset and Dorset Joint Railway, which closed in 1966, and was the site of accidents on the line in 1885 and 1886. The name of the village was Begenhangra, in a charter of 1065, which probably meant the slope where beans are grown. It formed part of the endowment of Wells Cathedral. Calamine ore was mined at Merchants Hill in the late 18th century, but the area's principal focus was on limestone quarrying, at Gurney Slade quarry, and agriculture. Adjacent to the quarry there is now a plant which processes powdered material (known as filler) from various Mendip quarries. The parish was part of the hundred of Wells Forum. ==Governance== The parish council has responsibility for local issues, including setting an annual precept (local rate) to cover the council's operating costs and producing annual accounts for public scrutiny. The parish council evaluates local planning applications and works with the local police, district council officers, and neighbourhood watch groups on matters of crime, security, and traffic. The parish council's role also includes initiating projects for the maintenance and repair of parish facilities, as well as consulting with the district council on the maintenance, repair, and improvement of highways, drainage, footpaths, public transport, and street cleaning. Conservation matters (including trees and listed buildings) and environmental issues are also the responsibility of the council. The village falls within the Non- metropolitan district of Mendip, which was formed on 1 April 1974 under the Local Government Act 1972, having previously been part of Shepton Mallet Rural District, which is responsible for local planning and building control, local roads, council housing, environmental health, markets and fairs, refuse collection and recycling, cemeteries and crematoria, leisure services, parks, and tourism. Somerset County Council is responsible for running the largest and most expensive local services such as education, social services, libraries, main roads, public transport, policing and fire services, trading standards, waste disposal and strategic planning. It is also part of the Wells county constituency represented in the House of Commons of the Parliament of the United Kingdom. It elects one Member of Parliament (MP) by the first past the post system of election, and part of the South West England constituency of the European Parliament which elects seven MEPs using the d'Hondt method of party-list proportional representation. ==Religious sites== The Norman Church of the Holy Trinity was rebuilt in the 15th century, and again rebuilt (except for the tower) in 1858 for Rev William Heade. The tower contains two bells dating from 1776 and made by William Bilbie of the Bilbie family. It has been designated by English Heritage as a Grade II* listed building. ==References Category:Villages in Mendip District Category:Civil parishes in Somerset ","title":"Binegar"},{"id":"2225070","text":"Namibia Women's Action for Equality Party was a political party in Namibia.

It results in itchy, red, swollen, and cracked skin. Clear fluid may come from the affected areas, which often thickens over time. While the condition may occur at any age, it typically starts in childhood, with changing severity over the years. In children under one year of age, much of the body may be affected. As children get older, the areas on the insides of the knees and elbows are most commonly affected. In adults, the hands and feet are most commonly affected. Scratching the affected areas worsens the symptoms, and those affected have an increased risk of skin infections. Many people with atopic dermatitis develop hay fever or asthma. The cause is unknown but believed to involve genetics, immune system dysfunction, environmental exposures, and difficulties with the permeability of the skin. If one identical twin is affected, there is an 85% chance the other also has the condition. Those who live in cities and dry climates are more commonly affected. Exposure to certain chemicals or frequent hand washing makes symptoms worse. While emotional stress may make the symptoms worse, it is not a cause. The disorder is not contagious. The diagnosis is typically based on the signs and symptoms. Other diseases that must be excluded before making a diagnosis include contact dermatitis, psoriasis, and seborrheic dermatitis. Treatment involves avoiding things that make the condition worse, daily bathing with application of a moisturising cream afterwards, applying steroid creams when flares occur, and medications to help with itchiness. Things that commonly make it worse include wool clothing, soaps, perfumes, chlorine, dust, and cigarette smoke. Phototherapy may be useful in some people. Steroid pills or creams based on calcineurin inhibitors may occasionally be used if other measures are not effective. Antibiotics (either by mouth or topically) may be needed if a bacterial infection develops. Dietary changes are only needed if food allergies are suspected. Atopic dermatitis affects about 20% of people at some point in their lives. It is more common in younger children. Males and females are equally affected. Many people outgrow the condition. Atopic dermatitis is sometimes called eczema, a term that also refers to a larger group of skin conditions. Other names include \\"infantile eczema\\", \\"flexural eczema\\", \\"prurigo Besnier\\", \\"allergic eczema\\", and \\"neurodermatitis\\". == Signs and symptoms == The pattern of atopic eczema varies with age. People with AD often have dry and scaly skin that spans the entire body, except perhaps the diaper area, and intensely itchy red, splotchy, raised lesions to form in the bends of the arms or legs, face, and neck. AD commonly affects the eyelids where signs such as Dennie-Morgan infraorbital fold, infra-auricular fissure, and periorbital pigmentation can be seen. Post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation on the neck gives the classic 'dirty neck' appearance. Lichenification, excoriation and erosion or crusting on the trunk may indicate secondary infection. Flexural distribution with ill- defined edges with or without hyperlinearity on the wrist, finger knuckles, ankle, feet and hand are also commonly seen. == Causes == The cause of AD is not known, although there is some evidence of genetic, environmental, and immunologic factors. === Genetics === Many people with AD have a family history of atopy. Atopy is an immediate-onset allergic reaction (type 1 hypersensitivity reaction) that manifests as asthma, food allergies, AD or hay fever. About 30% of people with atopic dermatitis have mutations in the gene for the production of filaggrin (FLG), which increase the risk for early onset of atopic dermatitis and developing asthma. === Hygiene hypothesis === According to the hygiene hypothesis, early childhood exposure to certain microorganisms (such as gut flora and helminth parasites) protects against allergic diseases by contributing to the development of the immune system. This exposure is limited in a modern \\"sanitary\\" environment, and the incorrectly-developed immune system is prone to develop allergies to harmless substances. There is some support for this hypothesis with respect to AD. Those exposed to dogs while growing up have a lower risk of atopic dermatitis. There is also support from epidemiological studies for a protective role for helminths against AD. Likewise children with poor hygiene are at a lower risk for developing AD, as are children who drink unpasteurised milk. === Allergens === In a small percentage of cases, atopic dermatitis is caused by sensitization to foods. Also, exposure to allergens, either from food or the environment, can exacerbate existing atopic dermatitis. Exposure to dust mites, for example, is believed to contribute to one's risk of developing AD. A diet high in fruits seems to have a protective effect against AD, whereas the opposite seems true for fast foods. Atopic dermatitis sometimes appears associated with celiac disease and non-celiac gluten sensitivity, and the improvement with a gluten-free diet indicates that gluten is a causative agent in these cases. ===Role of Staphylococcus aureus=== Colonization of the skin by the bacterium S. aureus is extremely prevalent in those with atopic dermatitis. Studies have found that abnormalities in the skin barrier of persons with AD are exploited by S. aureus to trigger cytokine expression, thus aggravating the condition. === Hard water === Atopic dermatitis in children may be linked to the level of calcium carbonate or \\"hardness\\" of household water, when used to drink. So far these findings have been supported in children from the United Kingdom, Spain, and Japan. ==Pathophysiology== The pathophysiology may involve a mixture of type I and type IV-like hypersensitivity reactions. == Diagnosis == Atopic dermatitis is typically diagnosed clinically, meaning it is diagnosed based on signs and symptoms alone, without special testing. Several different forms of criteria developed for research have also been validated to aid in diagnosis. Of these, the UK Diagnostic Criteria, based on the work of Hanifin and Rajka, has been the most widely validated. {  +UK diagnostic criteria !People must have itchy skin, or evidence of rubbing or scratching, plus three or more of the following: - Skin creases are involved: flexural dermatitis of fronts of ankles, antecubital fossae, popliteal fossae, skin around eyes, or neck, (or cheeks for children under 10) - History of asthma or allergic rhinitis (or family history of these conditions if patient is a child ‚â§4 years old) - Symptoms began before age 2 (can only be applied to patients ‚â•4 years old) - History of dry skin (within the past year) - Dermatitis is visible on flexural surfaces (patients ‚â•age 4) or on the cheeks, forehead, and extensor surfaces (patients ===Lifestyle=== Applying moisturisers may prevent the skin from drying out and decrease the need for other medications. Affected persons often report that improvement of skin hydration parallels with improvement in AD symptoms. Health professionals often recommend that persons with AD bathe regularly in lukewarm baths, especially in salt water, to moisten their skin. Avoiding woollen clothing is usually good for those with AD. Likewise silk, silver-coated clothing may help. Dilute bleach baths have also been reported effective at managing AD. ===Diet=== The role of vitamin D on atopic dermatitis is not clear, but there is some evidence that vitamin D supplementation may improve its symptoms. Studies have investigated the role of long chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LCPUFA) supplementation and LCPUFA status in the prevention and treatment of atopic diseases, but the results are controversial. It remains unclear if the nutritional intake of n-3 fatty acids has a clear preventive or therapeutic role, or if n-6 fatty acids consumption promotes atopic diseases.Lohner S, Decsi T. Role of Long-Chain Polyunsaturated Fatty Acids in the Prevention and Treatment of Atopic Diseases. In: Polyunsaturated Fatty Acids: Sources, Antioxidant Properties and Health Benefits (edited by: Angel Catal√°). NOVA Publishers. 2013. Chapter 11, pp. 1-24. () Several probiotics seem to have a positive effect with a roughly 20% reduction in the rate of atopic dermatitis. The best evidence is for multiple strains of bacteria. In people with celiac disease or non-celiac gluten sensitivity, a gluten free diet improves their symptoms and prevents the occurrence of new outbreaks. ===Medication=== Topical corticosteroids, such as hydrocortisone, have proven effective in managing AD. If topical corticosteroids and moisturisers fail, short-term treatment with topical calcineurin inhibitors like tacrolimus or pimecrolimus may be tried, although their use is controversial as some studies indicate that they increase the risk of developing skin cancer or lymphoma. A 2007 meta-analysis showed that topical pimecrolimus is not as effective as corticosteroids and tacrolimus. However a 2015 meta-analysis indicated that topical tacrolimus and pimecrolimus are more effective than low dose topical corticosteroids, and found no evidence for increased risk of malignancy or skin atrophy. In 2016, crisaborole, an inhibitor of PDE-4, was approved as a topical treatment for mild-to-moderate eczema. Other medications used for AD include systemic immunosuppressants such as ciclosporin, methotrexate, interferon gamma-1b, mycophenolate mofetil and azathioprine. Antidepressants and naltrexone may be used to control pruritus (itchiness). In 2017, the biologic agent dupilumab was approved to treat moderate-to-severe eczema. Leukotriene inhibitors such as monteleukast are of unclear benefit as of 2018. There is tentative evidence that allergy immunotherapy is effective in atopic dermatitis, but the quality of the evidence is low. This treatment consists of a series of injections or drops under the tongue of a solution containing the allergen. Antibiotics, either by mouth or applied topically, is commonly used to target overgrowth of Staphylococcus aureus in the skin of people with atopic dermatitis. However, a 2019 meta-analysis found no clear evidence of benefit. ===Light=== A more novel form of treatment involves exposure to broad or narrow-band ultraviolet (UV) light. UV radiation exposure has been found to have a localized immunomodulatory effect on affected tissues and may be used to decrease the severity and frequency of flares. In particular, the usage of UVA1 is more effective in treating acute flares, whereas narrow-band UVB is more effective in long-term management scenarios. However, UV radiation has also been implicated in various types of skin cancer, and thus UV treatment is not without risk. ===Alternative medicine=== While there are several Chinese herbal medicines intended for treating atopic eczema, there is no conclusive evidence that these treatments, taken by mouth or applied topically, reduce the severity of eczema in children or adults. == Epidemiology == Since the beginning of the twentieth century, many inflammatory skin disorders have become more common; atopic dermatitis (AD) is a classic example of such a disease. It now affects 15‚Äì30% of children and 2‚Äì10% of adults in developed countries and in the United States has nearly tripled in the past thirty to forty years. Over 15 million American adults and children have atopic dermatitis. ==Research== Evidence suggests that IL-4 is central in the pathogenesis of AD. Therefore, there is a rationale for targeting IL-4 with anti-IL-4 inhibitors. People with atopic dermatitis are more likely to have Staphylococcus aureus living on them. The role this plays in pathogenesis is yet to be determined. Medications in Phase III trials as treatments include tralokinumab and abrocitinib. == References  External links == *NIH Handout on Health: Atopic Dermatitis * * Category:Type I hypersensitivity Category:Steroid-responsive inflammatory conditions Category:Wikipedia medicine articles ready to translate Category:RTTEM ","title":"Atopic dermatitis"},{"id":"2225074","text":"Map of Fiji showing Western division.

It is a remake of the Indian Film Do Dooni Char which was a remake of 1963 Bengali language comedy film Bhrantibilas, that is based on Ishwar Chandra Vidyasagar's Bengali novel by the same name, which itself is based on Shakespeare's play The Comedy of Errors and is again getting adapted by Rohit Shetty in his new movie, Cirkus starring Ranveer Singh, Pooja Hegde, Jacqueline Fernandez, and Varun Sharma in the lead role. All characters are innocent and destiny plays the main role in bringing all characters to one place. Most of the other films are generally based on false characters and deliberately make false statements to fool others. ==Plot== The film is about two pairs of identical twins separated at birth and how their lives go haywire when they meet in adulthood. Raj Tilak (Utpal Dutt) and his wife (Shammi) are on a trip with their twin sons, both of whom they call Ashok. Since they look the same, they should be called the same, is Mr Tilak's reasoning. As fate would have it, they adopt another set of twins, both of whom they call Bahadur. An unfortunate accident then divides the family, leaving both parents with one child out of each pair of twins. A few years later, Ashok (Sanjeev Kumar) is married to Sudha (Moushumi Chatterjee) and Bahadur (Deven Verma) is married to Prema (Aruna Irani). They all stay together with Sudha's younger sister Tanu (Deepti Naval). Into their lives enter the other Ashok, a detective novel aficionado, and Bahadur, a bhang (an edible form of cannabis which has been used in India since before the Vedic period) lover. Now there are two Ashoks and two Bahadurs in the same city. This is more than their families, the Jeweller, the Taxi Driver and the Inspector can handle. == Cast == *Sanjeev Kumar as Ashok R.

As a sculptor, his most famous works are the Madonna and Child in the church of Lebrija (also called Nebrija), and the colossal figures of San Pedro and San Pablo. He was made first royal architect, painter to Philip IV, and instructor to the prince, Balthasar Charles, Prince of Asturias. The King gave him the church preferment of a canon of the Granada Cathedral (1652), in order to take up a position as chief architect of the cathedral, where his main achievement in architecture was the fa√ßade, designed at the end of his life and erected to his design after his death. He was notorious for his ungovernable temper; and it is said that once he risked his life by committing the then capital offence of dashing to pieces the statue of a saint, when in a rage with the purchaser who begrudged the price he demanded. According to another story, he found his house robbed after coming home one evening, his wife murdered, and his Italian servant fled. Notwithstanding the presumption against the fugitive, the magistrates condemned Cano, because he was of a jealous temper. Upon this he fled to Valencia, but afterwards returned to Madrid, where he was put to the torture, which he endured without incriminating himself, and the king received him into favour.Anonymous, \\"Alonso Cano\\" in Retratos de Espa√±oles ilustres con un ep√≠tome de sus vidas, 1791. After the death of his wife he took Holy Orders as a protection from further prosecution, but still continued his professional pursuits. He died in 1667. In his last moments, when the priest held to him a crucifix, he told him to take it away; according to the Catholic Encyclopedia, this was because the priest gave the Sacrament to conversos.

German speakers use the clearer term Romantische Naturphilosophie, the philosophy of nature developed at the time of the founding of German Romanticism. It is particularly associated with the philosophical work of Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph von SchellingFrederick C. Beiser(2002), German Idealism: The Struggle Against Subjectivism 1781‚Äì1801, Harvard university Press, p. 506. and Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel‚Äîthough it has some clear precursors also. More particularly it is identified with some of the initial works of Schelling during the period 1797‚Äì9, in reaction to the views of Fichte, and subsequent developments from Schelling's position. Always controversial, some of Schelling's ideas in this direction are still considered of philosophical interest, even if the subsequent development of experimental natural science had a destructive impact on the credibility of the theories of his followers in Naturphilosophie.http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/schelling/ Naturphilosophie attempted to comprehend nature in its totality and to outline its general theoretical structure, thus attempting to lay the foundations for the natural sciences. In developing their theories, the German Naturphilosophen found their inspiration in the natural philosophy of the Ancient Greek Ionian philosophers. As an approach to philosophy and science, Naturphilosophie has had a difficult reception. In Germany, neo-Kantians came to distrust its developments as speculative and overly metaphysical.http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/cohen/ For most of the 19th and early 20th centuries, it was poorly understood in Anglophone countries. Over the years, it has been subjected to continuing criticism. Since the 1960s, improved translations have appeared, and scholars have developed a better appreciation of the objectives of Naturphilosophie. ==Outline of development== The German Idealist philosopher Fichte had attempted to show that the whole structure of reality follows necessarily from the fact of self-consciousness. Schelling took Fichte's position as his starting-point, and in his earliest writings posited that nature must have reality for itself. In this light Fichte's doctrines appeared incomplete. On the one hand, they identified the ultimate ground of the universe of reason too closely with finite, individual Spirit. On the other, they threatened the reality of the world of nature by seeing it too much in the manner of subjective idealism. Fichte, in this view, had not managed to unite his system with the aesthetic view of nature to which Immanuel Kant's Critique of Judgment had pointed. Naturphilosophie is therefore one possible theory of the unity of nature. Nature as the sum of what is objective, and intelligence as the complex of all the activities making up self-consciousness, appear as equally real. The philosophy of nature and transcendental idealism would be the two complementary portions making up philosophy as a whole. ==German philosophy== Naturphilosophie translated into English would mean just \\"philosophy of nature\\", and its scope began to be taken in a broad way. Johann Gottfried Herder, particularly taken in opposition to Immanuel Kant, was a precursor of Schelling: > Herder's dynamic view of nature was developed by Goethe and Schelling and > led to the tradition of Naturphilosophie > [...]http://www.cosmosandhistory.org/index.php/journal/article/view/160/269 Later Friedrich Schlegel theorised about a particular German strand in philosophy of nature, citing Jakob B√∂hme, Johannes Kepler and Georg Ernst Stahl, with Jan Baptist van Helmont as an edge case.Paola Mayer, Jena Romanticism and Its Appropriation of Jakob B√∂hme: Theosophy, Hagiography, Literature (1999), p. 127. Frederick Beiser instead traces Naturphilosophie as developed by Schelling, Hegel, Schlegel and Novalis to a crux in the theory of matter, and identifies the origins of the line they took with the vis viva theory of matter in the work of Gottfried Leibniz.Frederick Beiser, 'The Enlightenment and Idealism', pp. 21‚Äì42, esp. pp. 32‚Äì33, in Karl Ameriks (editor) (2000), The Cambridge Companion to German Idealism. Subsequently Schelling identified himself with Baruch de Spinoza, to whose thought he saw himself as approaching. The Darstellung meines Systems, and the expanded treatment in the lectures on a System der gesamten Philosophie und der Naturphilosophie insbesondere given in W√ºrzburg in 1804, contain elements of Spinoza's philosophy. ==Schelling== In a short space of time Schelling produced three works: Ideen zu einer Philosophie der Natur als Einleitung in das Studium dieser Wissenschaft, 1797 (Ideas for a Philosophy of Nature as Introduction to the Study of this Science); Von der Weltseele, 1798 (On the World Soul); and Erster Entwurf eines Systems der Naturphilosophie, 1799 (First Plan of a System of the Philosophy of Nature). As criticism of scientific procedure, these writings retain a relevance. Historically, according to Richards: > Despite the tentativeness of their titles, these monographs introduced > radical interpretations of nature that would reverberate through the > sciences, and particularly the biology, of the next century. They developed > the fundamental doctrines of Naturphilosophie. In System des transzendentalen Idealismus, 1800 (System of Transcendental Idealism) Schelling included ideas on matter and the organic in Part III. They form just part of a more ambitious work that takes up other themes, in particular aesthetics. From this point onwards Naturphilosophie was less of a research concern for him, as he reformulated his philosophy. However, it remained an influential aspect of his teaching. For a short while, he edited a journal, the Neue Zeitschrift f√ºr speculative Physik (bound volume 1802).Online text Schelling's Naturphilosophie was a way in which he worked himself out of the tutelage of Fichte, with whom he quarrelled decisively towards the end of the 1790s. More than that, however, it brought him within the orbit of Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, both intellectually and (as a direct consequence of Goethe's sympathetic attitude) by a relocation; and it broke with basic Kantian tenets. Iain Hamilton Grant writes: > Schelling's postkantian confrontation with nature itself begins with the > overthrow of the Copernican revolution [...]Grant 2006, p. 6. Schelling held that the divisions imposed on nature, by our ordinary perception and thought, do not have absolute validity. They should be interpreted as the outcome of the single formative energy which is the soul or inner aspect of nature. In other words he was a proponent of a variety of organicism. The dynamic series of stages in nature, the forms in which the ideal structure of nature is realized, are matter, as the equilibrium of the fundamental expansive and contractive forces; light, with its subordinate processes (magnetism, electricity, and chemical action); organism, with its component phases of reproduction, irritability and sensibility. The continual change presented to us by experience, taken together with the thought of unity in productive force of nature, leads to the conception of the duality through which nature expresses itself in its varied products. In the introduction to the Ideen he argues against dogmatism, in the terms that a dogmatist cannot explain the organic; and that recourse to the idea of a cosmic creator is a feature of dogmatic systems imposed by the need to explain nature as purposive and unified.Dale E. Snow, Schelling and the end of Idealism (1996), p. 83. Fichte's system, called the Wissenschaftslehre, had begun with a fundamental distinction between dogmatism (fatalistic) and criticism (free), as his formulation of idealism.Beiser 2002, p. 261. Beiser divides up the mature form of Schelling's Naturphilosophie into the attitudes of:Beiser 2002, p. 483. # transcendental realism: the thesis that \\"nature exists independent of all consciousness, even that of the transcendental subject\\" (in Kantian terminology (Critique of Pure Reason) the transcendental subject is the condition of possibility of experience), and # transcendental naturalism: the thesis that \\"everything is explicable according to the laws of nature, including the rationality of the transcendental subject\\". Beiser notes how Naturphilosophie was first a counterbalance to Wissenschaftslehre, and then in Schelling's approach became the senior partner. After that, it was hardly to be avoided that Schelling would become an opponent of Fichte, having been a close follower in the early 1790s. We are able to apprehend and represent nature to ourselves in the successive forms which its development assumes, since it is the same spirit of which we become aware in self-consciousness, though here unconsciously. The variety of its forms is not imposed on it externally, since there is no external teleology in nature. Nature is a self- forming whole, within which only natural explanations can be sought. The function of Naturphilosophie is to exhibit the ideal as springing from the real, not to deduce the real from the ideal. ==Influence and critics of Naturphilosophie== Criticism of Naturphilosophie has been widespread, over two centuries. Schelling's theories, however influential in terms of the general culture of the time, have not survived in scientific terms. Like other strands of speculation in the life sciences, in particular, such as vitalism, they retreated in the face of experiment, and then were written out of the history of science as Whig history. But critics were initially not scientists (a term not used until later); rather they came largely from within philosophy and Romantic science, a community including many physicians. Typically, the retrospective views of scientists of the 19th century on \\"Romantic science\\" in general erased distinctions: > Scientific criticism in the nineteenth century took hardly any notice of the > distinctions between Romantic, speculative and transcendental, scientific > and aesthetic directions.Dietrich von Engelhardt, Romanticism in Germany p. > 112, in Roy Porter and Mikula≈° Teich, editors, Romanticism in National > Context (1988). One outspoken critic was the chemist Justus von Liebig, who compared Naturphilosophie with the Black Death.Siegbert Prawer (editor), The Romantic Period in Germany (1970), Introduction by Prawer p. 5. Another critic, the physiologist Emil du Bois-Reymond, frequently dismissed Naturphilosophie as \\"bogus\\". ===Role in aesthetics=== Isaiah Berlin summed up the reasons why Naturphilosophie had a wide-ranging impact on views of art and artists: > if everything in nature is living, and if we ourselves are simply its most > self-conscious representatives, the function of the artist is to delve > within himself, and above all to delve within the dark and unconscious > forces which move within him, and to bring these to consciousness by the > most agonising and violent internal struggle.Isaiah Berlin, The Roots of > Romanticism (Henry Hardy, editor) (2000), p. 89. ===Philosophical criticism=== Fichte was very critical of the opposition set up in Schelling's Naturphilosophie to his own conception of Wissenschaftslehre. In that debate, Hegel then intervened, largely supporting his student friend Schelling, with the work usually called his Differenzschrift, the Differenz des Fichteschen und Schellingschen Systems der Philosophie (The Difference Between Fichte's and Schelling's System of Philosophy); a key publication in his own philosophical development, his first book, it was published in September 1801.Terry Pinkard, Hegel (2000), p. 109. Schelling's Absolute was left with no other function than that of removing all the differences which give form to thought. The criticisms of Fichte, and more particularly of Hegel (in the Preface to the Phenomenology of Spirit), pointed to a defect in the conception of the Absolute as mere featureless identity. It was ridiculed by Hegel as \\"the night in which all cows are black.\\" ===Other views in Romantic science=== Ignaz Paul Vitalis Troxler, a follower of Schelling, later broke with him.http://www.fernuni- hagen.de/EUROL/Projekt/biografien/troxler-e.htm He came to the view that the Absolute in nature and mind is beyond the intellect and reason. ==Naturphilosophen== *Adam Karl August von Eschenmayer, engaged in controversy with Schelling from 1801, published Grundriss der Natur-Philosophie in 1832 *Carl Friedrich Kielmeyer, an influence on Schelling's thinking, he was a founder rather than a follower, and a proponent of recapitulation theory *Johann Friedrich MeckelStephen Jay Gould, Ontogeny and Phylogeny (1977), p. 45. *Lorenz OkenStephen Jay Gould, Ontogeny and Phylogeny (1977), p. 39. *Hans Christian √òrstedhttp://www.sil.si.edu/silpublications/dibner-library- lectures/scientific-discoveries/text-lecture.htm *Johann Wilhelm Ritter *Henrik Steffens *August Ludwig H√ºlsen *Gottfried Reinhold Treviranus *Karl Joseph Hieronymus Windischmann ==NotesReferences== ;19th century * F.

While his performing career was relatively short, much of his work as a player, composer, and arranger was quite influential and well-recognized during his time. However, Gryce abruptly ended his jazz career in the 1960s. This, in addition to his nature as a very private person, has resulted in very little knowledge of Gryce today. Several of his compositions have been covered extensively (\\"Minority\\", \\"Social Call\\", \\"Nica's Tempo\\") and have become minor jazz standards. Gryce's compositional bent includes harmonic choices similar to those of contemporaries Benny Golson, Tadd Dameron and Horace Silver. Gryce's playing, arranging, and composing are most associated with the classic hard bop era (roughly 1953‚Äì1965). He was a well-educated composer and musician, and wrote some classical works as a student at the Boston Conservatory. As a jazz musician and composer he was very much influenced by the work of Charlie Parker and Thelonious Monk.Cohen, Noal; Fitzgerald, Michael. Rat Race Blues: The Musical Life of Gigi Gryce. Berkeley: Berkeley Hill Books, 2002. == Early life == George General Gryce Jr. was born in Pensacola, Florida on November 28, 1925. His family's strong emphasis on music, manners, and discipline had a tremendous effect on him as a child and into his later career. Grice's parents were of modest means, his mother a seamstress and his father the owner of a small cleaning and pressing service. The family belonged to the African Methodist Episcopal Church and attended services diligently. Especially as the Great Depression began to take its toll on the family's financial welfare, the Grices did their best to instill the value of discipline and hard work in their children.Cohen, Noal; Fitzgerald, Michael. Rat Race Blues: The Musical Life of Gigi Gryce. Berkeley: Berkeley Hill Books, 2002. p. 11. Music was very much emphasized in the Grice household. The family had a piano in the house, which Gigi and his siblings (four older sisters and one younger brother) were encouraged to play. Mostly church music was performed in the Grice home, while pop and jazz was mostly frowned upon. (Later, however, when Gigi pursued jazz as a career, his mother and older sisters would support him personally and financially.) Many of the Grice children were encouraged to pursue vocal performance at church, school, and other community; for a time the family even held weekly recitals in their home.Cohen, Noal; Fitzgerald, Michael. Rat Race Blues: The Musical Life of Gigi Gryce. Berkeley: Berkeley Hill Books, 2002. p. 12. The early thirties saw tragedy and hardship for the Grice family. In 1931, as the economic crisis of The Great Depression began to take hold, the Grices were forced to sell their cleaning business. Two years later, Gigi's father, George Sr., died after suffering a heart attack. Rebecca Grice was forced to raise the children as a single mother, relocating the family in order to rent out the house. Even through this hardship, however, Rebecca continued to motivate her children for success through strict but supportive parenting, encouraging musical development, hard work, discipline, and Christian morals.Cohen, Noal; Fitzgerald, Michael. Rat Race Blues: The Musical Life of Gigi Gryce. Berkeley: Berkeley Hill Books, 2002. p. 14. Gigi very much applied his family's sense of discipline to his developing passion for music. As a youth Gigi was described as bright but reserved, extremely polite, studious, and formal in nature. It is unclear exactly when Gigi first began learning the clarinet ‚Äì it is rumored he may have started as early as age 9 or 10, but the first evidence for his pursuit appears later as he entered high school. The under-resourced, and at this time, mostly black Booker T. Washington High School had a series of music teachers through the Federal Music Project; Gigi first studied with Joseph Jessie and later Raymond Shepard. As it was for many, a musical instrument would have been a crippling expense for the Grices during the Depression; when Gigi and his brother Tommy studied clarinet with Shepard they allegedly borrowed the same clarinet from a friend directly before each lesson. Eventually, Gigi's mother was able to buy him his own metal cavalry clarinet, with which Gigi became quite successful as a high school student, winning school and state competitions. At school Gigi was also able to study music theory, which he very much enjoyed and continued to explore on the piano at home Cohen, Noal; Fitzgerald, Michael. Rat Race Blues: The Musical Life of Gigi Gryce. Berkeley: Berkeley Hill Books, 2002. pp. 20-24. == Early music career == Gryce graduated from high school in 1943, working at the shipyard and playing in Raymond Shepard's professional band for a time before being drafted by the navy in March 1944. Gryce continued to pursue music during his two-year term, making his way into the navy band and earning the rank of musician second class. While stationed in Great Lakes, Illinois, Gryce spent time in Chicago during leaves and became more acquainted with the sound of bebop. It was at this time that he bought his own alto saxophone and, in Chicago, that he met musicians Andrew \\"Goon\\" Gardner and Harry Curtis. Gryce may have even briefly studied at the Chicago Conservatory of Music.Cohen, Noal; Fitzgerald, Michael. Rat Race Blues: The Musical Life of Gigi Gryce. Berkeley: Berkeley Hill Books, 2002. pp. 29-32. After completing his time in the navy, Gryce decided to continue his musical education, financially supported by the G.I. Bill as well as his mother and older sisters. He moved to Hartford to live with his sister Harriet and her husband in 1946, and the following year enrolled at the Boston Conservatory. At the Boston Conservatory Gryce developed his theoretical background and studied classical composition, writing three symphonies and a ballet in addition to other works. He was very much inspired and influenced by the work and philosophy of Boston Conservatory composer Alan Hovhaness, a musical eclectic whose passion was for melodicism and lyricism.Cohen, Noal; Fitzgerald, Michael. Rat Race Blues: The Musical Life of Gigi Gryce. Berkeley: Berkeley Hill Books, 2002. pp. 37-52. During his time at the conservatory Gryce also developed connections in the Hartford, Boston, and New York jazz scenes which would have a tremendous effect on his later career as a jazz musician, composer, and arranger. While New York was best known for cutting edge jazz of the time, both Boston and Hartford were also the sites of active and innovative jazz scenes. Gryce traveled between the two cities, and arranged for local bands including those of Sabby Lewis, Phil Edmonds, and Bunky Emerson. While Gryce developed his theoretical background and a passion for the works of Bartok and Stravinsky, he simultaneously developed an obsession for the work of Charlie Parker and Thelonious Monk, with whom, around 1949, he became acquainted and also performed. Gryce developed a reputation as a well- trained and talented artist, and became relatively well known in the local Boston and Hartford scenes. He also began to explore the New York scene, where he would eventually find himself in the early fifties.Cohen, Noal; Fitzgerald, Michael. Rat Race Blues: The Musical Life of Gigi Gryce. Berkeley: Berkeley Hill Books, 2002. pp. 54-62. Gryce is rumored to have traveled to Paris on a Fulbright scholarship in 1951 to study with Nadia Boulanger and Arthur Honegger. However, there is much confusion and rumor surrounding this period in Gryce's life, and there is no evidence to suggest that Gryce did receive a Fulbright or formally study with the two composers. Gryce did take two semesters off to study in Europe, but little is known about his travels. It is possible that he studied with the composers privately. While Gryce did propagate the Fulbright rumor himself to substantiate his credentials, Gryce had little else to say about this time in his life.Fitzgerald, Michael. Rat Race Blues: The Musical Life of Gigi Gryce. Berkeley: Berkeley Hill Books, 2002. pp. 70-74. == New York, the Lionel Hampton band, and Europe == After graduating with a degree in composition in 1952, Gryce relocated to New York City, where he would enjoy much success in the mid fifties. In 1953 Max Roach recorded one of Gryce's charts with his septet, and soon after Gryce recorded with Howard McGhee and wrote for Horace Silver's sextet as well.Cohen, Noal; Fitzgerald, Michael. Rat Race Blues: The Musical Life of Gigi Gryce. Berkeley: Berkeley Hill Books, 2002. p. 79. Gryce was influenced by Tadd Dameron, with whom he played in 1953 at the Paradise Club.Cohen, Noal; Fitzgerald, Michael. Rat Race Blues: The Musical Life of Gigi Gryce. Berkeley: Berkeley Hill Books, 2002. p. 89. Gryce had not yet reached his peak as a musician or soloist, but was developing a reputation as a versatile and talented composer and arranger. Later in 1953 Gryce also contributed a tune, \\"Up in Quincy's Place\\" to Art Farmer's Prestige recordings. While this recording was rather inconsequential, Farmer would become one of Gryce's closest colleagues.Cohen, Noal; Fitzgerald, Michael. Rat Race Blues: The Musical Life of Gigi Gryce. Berkeley: Berkeley Hill Books, 2002. pp. 79-90. One of the most important connections Gryce made in New York was with Quincy Jones, who encouraged Lionel Hampton to hire Gryce for his band in the summer of 1953. After playing with Hampton's band in the States, Gryce was invited to join the band for their European tour.Cohen, Noal; Fitzgerald, Michael. Rat Race Blues: The Musical Life of Gigi Gryce. Berkeley: Berkeley Hill Books, 2002. p. 94. While the style of the Hampton band was outdated and overly commercialized in Gryce's eyes, the opportunities and connections made on the European tour were largely what propelled Gryce into success as an artist. In Hampton's band, Gryce played with Anthony Ortega, Clifford Solomon (tenor saxophone), Clifford Scott, Oscar Estelle (baritone saxophone), Walter Williams (trumpet), Art Farmer, Clifford Brown, Quincy Jones, Al Hayse, Jimmy Cleveland, George \\"Buster\\" Cooper, William \\"Monk\\" Montgomery, and Alan Dawson. Gryce became particularly close friends with Clifford Brown, with whom he found much in common. The Hampton tour did not pay well, and Gryce and others frequently sought recording opportunities on the side, particularly in Stockholm and Paris, where Europeans were eager to record touring Americans. There was already some tension in the band between young bebop-influenced musicians and the more established swing musicians (including Hampton himself), and Hampton did not react well when he heard his musicians were recording on the side.Cohen, Noal; Fitzgerald, Michael. Rat Race Blues: The Musical Life of Gigi Gryce. Berkeley: Berkeley Hill Books, 2002. pp. 94-115. The recordings Gryce made with Clifford Brown and others on the tour were often hurried and done on the fly, yet they were instrumental in building his career, particularly as a composer. Notable of these European recordings were \\"Paris the Beautiful\\", featuring tonal centers a third apart and a Parker-influenced solo by Gryce; \\"Brown Skins\\", a concerto for a large jazz ensemble; \\"Blue Concept\\", recorded by the Gryce-Brown sextet; and \\"Strictly Romantic\\", which oscillates between A flat and G major. In addition, Henri Renaud recorded an entire album exclusively of Gryce's work, which did a great deal to build his reputation.Cohen, Noal; Fitzgerald, Michael (2002) Rat Race Blues: The Musical Life of Gigi Gryce pp. 126-36, Berkeley: Berkeley Hill Books == Career in the United States == Gryce and the other personnel from the Hampton Band returned to New York in November 1953, where the hard bop scene was just beginning to gain traction. This was the perfect time for Gryce to arrive on the scene. Soon after his return, he recorded with Henri Renaud, and Art Blakey recorded seven of Gryce's songs for EmArcy records. Gryce formed a quintet with Farmer in March 1954, which first recorded for Prestige Records in May of that year. Personnel included pianist Horace Silver, bassist Percy Heath, and Drummer Kenny Clarke. Gryce's works with Farmer are some of his most influential and best known. In June of that year Gryce again recorded with Farmer, this time exclusively as composer and arranger. By the time Farmer and Gryce began their third project, they had hit their creative stride. The record made in May 1955 by the Farmer-Gryce quintet featured pianist Freddie Redd, bassist Addison Farmer, and drummer Art Taylor. This session exemplifies Gryce's feel for thematic development, all of the pieces artfully composed and arranged. Later in 1955 Gryce also played for Oscar Pettiford's octet, and got the opportunity to play alto in Thelonious Monk's recording with Percy Heath and Art Blakey for Signal Records.Cohen, Noal; Fitzgerald, Michael. Rat Race Blues: The Musical Life of Gigi Gryce. Berkeley: Berkeley Hill Books, 2002. pp. 151-62. The final ticket to Gryce's success was his third recording with the Farmer Quintet in October 1955 and his nonet recordings for Signal Records immediately after. The Farmer record featured non-standard forms, and adventurous arrangements which pushed the limits of the hard bop idiom. His Signal Records arrangements were very much influenced by the style and instrumentation of Miles Davis's Birth of the Cool group, and were very well received by the jazz community. By the mid-1950s Gryce was a major figure in jazz, known as a great individualist, a competent studio musician, and an innovative composer.Cohen, Noal; Fitzgerald, Michael. Rat Race Blues: The Musical Life of Gigi Gryce. Berkeley: Berkeley Hill Books, 2002. pp. 175-176. == Publishing career == In addition to his musical career, Gryce was a vehement advocate of composers' and musicians' rights. In 1955 he started his own publishing company, Melotone Music, and later an additional company called Totem. This was a time when black musicians in particularly were taken advantage of by the music industry. Many musicians neglected the business side of their careers or were actively cheated by record companies. As a composer Gryce always ensured that he got credit for his work, and actively encouraged his colleagues to do the same. Silver largely credits Gryce with inspiring him to found his Ecaroh Music company and the Silveto label. Little is known about Gryce's financial troubles in the early 1960s, but this hardship very much contributed to Gryce's breakdown and withdrawal from the jazz community.Cohen, Noal; Fitzgerald, Michael. Rat Race Blues: The Musical Life of Gigi Gryce. Berkeley: Berkeley Hill Books, 2002. p. 167. == Decline == Gryce stayed on the cutting edge through 1956 until his career peaked in 1957. He worked on several projects as composer and arranger with the Teddy Charles Tentet and the Oscar Pettiford Orchestra. The Tentet began as an outgrowth of Charles Mingus's Jazz Composers Workshop, and was very successful as a performing dance band despite its experimental nature. His work with the Oscar Pettiford Orchestra was also extremely well-recognized, producing significant coverage to the musicians who participated as well as to Gryce himself.Cohen, Noal; Fitzgerald, Michael. Rat Race Blues: The Musical Life of Gigi Gryce. Berkeley: Berkeley Hill Books, 2002. p. 198. In 1957 Gryce and Donald Byrd collaborated on a series of projects with Jazz Lab, which produced play-along recordings as educational tools. Gryce's arrangements were fresh but accessible, tailored for educational purposes. The rhythm section played with a soloist to give the play-alongs a more natural feel. The group also performed, and gave a rather lukewarm performance at the Newport Jazz Festival.Cohen, Noal; Fitzgerald, Michael. Rat Race Blues: The Musical Life of Gigi Gryce. Berkeley: Berkeley Hill Books, 2002. p. 213. The years 1957 to 1960 saw a series of miscellaneous projects for Gryce. He continued to play with the Jazz Lab, as well as writing for Betty Carter, Art Farmer, Jimmy Cleveland, Curtis Fuller, and Max Roach.Cohen, Noal; Fitzgerald, Michael. Rat Race Blues: The Musical Life of Gigi Gryce. Berkeley: Berkeley Hill Books, 2002. pp. 248-70. He put together his own quintet, which he renamed the Orch- tette after adding vibraphonist Eddie Costa in 1960. His recordings with the Orch-tette had potential, but featured intricate arrangements which limited space for solos.Cohen, Noal; Fitzgerald, Michael. Rat Race Blues: The Musical Life of Gigi Gryce. Berkeley: Berkeley Hill Books, 2002. p. 290. Gryce worked on a handful of other projects in 1960, including a film score to On the Sound by Phil Baker and a final studio recording on Randy Weston's Uhuru Afrika. However, by this time Gryce was becoming preoccupied with business troubles associated with his publishing companies, as well as some family issues.Cohen, Noal; Fitzgerald, Michael. Rat Race Blues: The Musical Life of Gigi Gryce. Berkeley: Berkeley Hill Books, 2002. p. 307. Gryce's genre of hard bop was beginning to give way to more experimental strains. Around 1963, Gryce withdrew completely from his jazz career. == Personal life == From childhood Gryce was always marked by a private and formal disposition. While he was very well liked by his colleagues, he was often very much an outsider in the community. Gryce also followed a strict moral lifestyle, abstaining from alcohol, drugs, and other vices common among his colleagues.Cohen, Noal; Fitzgerald, Michael. Rat Race Blues: The Musical Life of Gigi Gryce. Berkeley: Berkeley Hill Books, 2002. p. 335. === Family life === Gryce is known to have had two romantic relationships before his marriage to Eleanor Sears in 1953. Gryce had a brief relationship with Evelyn \\"Baby\\" Dubose in Pensacola during his Pensacola and Navy years, for whom he named his piece \\"Baby\\" which was recorded in Europe in 1953.Cohen, Noal; Fitzgerald, Michael. Rat Race Blues: The Musical Life of Gigi Gryce. Berkeley: Berkeley Hill Books, 2002. p. 28. He also had a casual relationship with vocalist Margie Anderson, with whom he worked during his time in Boston.Cohen, Noal; Fitzgerald, Michael. Rat Race Blues: The Musical Life of Gigi Gryce. Berkeley: Berkeley Hill Books, 2002. p. 68. On December 20, 1953, soon after his return from the Lionel Hampton tour, he married Eleanor Sears, to whom he was introduced by trumpeter Idrees Sulieman.Cohen, Noal; Fitzgerald, Michael. Rat Race Blues: The Musical Life of Gigi Gryce. Berkeley: Berkeley Hill Books, 2002. p. 148. Several of his compositions are credited to pseudonym \\"Lee Sears.\\" They had three children: Bashir (born 1957); Laila (born 1959); and Lynette (born 1963).Cohen, Noal; Fitzgerald, Michael. Rat Race Blues: The Musical Life of Gigi Gryce. Berkeley: Berkeley Hill Books, 2002. pp. 234, 276, 308. They also had a child, Bilil, in 1958 who was born prematurely and did not survive infancy.Cohen, Noal; Fitzgerald, Michael. Rat Race Blues: The Musical Life of Gigi Gryce. Berkeley: Berkeley Hill Books, 2002. p. 253. === Conversion to Islam === Gryce had always been described as having a strict moral sensibility. He may have been interested in Islam as early as 1950, and as a student became interested in religious history.Cohen, Noal; Fitzgerald, Michael. Rat Race Blues: The Musical Life of Gigi Gryce. Berkeley: Berkeley Hill Books, 2002. p. 50. At the Boston Conservatory in 1953 he named one of his symphonies \\"Gashiya\\" for a surah in the Qur'an. Gryce reveals little about who or what urged his conversion, but Islam was an increasingly popular faith among black jazz musicians in the fifties, particularly Ahmadiyya, Nation of Islam, and Sunni Islam.Bayoumi, Moustafa. ‚ÄúEast of the Sun (West of the Moon): Islam, the Ahmadis, and African America‚Äù, Journal of African American Studies (October 2001): pp. 251-63. Gryce is believed to have converted during or shortly after his travels in Europe during his college years.Cohen, Noal; Fitzgerald, Michael. Rat Race Blues: The Musical Life of Gigi Gryce. Berkeley: Berkeley Hill Books, 2002. p. 74. While Gryce did not regularly attend the mosque, he did read the Qur'an and abstain from drugs, alcohol, and pork.Cohen, Noal; Fitzgerald, Michael. Rat Race Blues: The Musical Life of Gigi Gryce. Berkeley: Berkeley Hill Books, 2002. p. 235. His faith was a source of some tension in his marriage to Eleanor, who remained a practicing Christian. Many of Gryce's compositions had Islamic titles and his first two children Islam-inspired names. == Withdrawal, teaching career, and death == Little is known about the real nature of Gryce's retreat from jazz, as this period is characterized by a great deal of misunderstanding and rumor. Gryce revealed very little about his business hardships, but what is known is that his publishing business encountered financial troubles in the early 1960s, with many musicians withdrawing from Melotone and Totem.Cohen, Noal; Fitzgerald, Michael. Rat Race Blues: The Musical Life of Gigi Gryce. Berkeley: Berkeley Hill Books, 2002. p. 310. Many of his colleagues believe that powerful interests considered Gryce's publishing activities a threat, and were forcing him out of business. Rumors circulated about intimidation and threats to his family. While these rumors have not been confirmed, Gryce's behavior became extremely introverted and erratic during this time. He dissolved his publishing companies in 1963 and gave up his music career, thereafter adopting his Islamic name entirely, Basheer Qusim.Cohen, Noal; Fitzgerald, Michael. Rat Race Blues: The Musical Life of Gigi Gryce. Berkeley: Berkeley Hill Books, 2002. pp. 310-18. In the 1960s Gryce reinvented himself as a public school teacher in New York. He was somewhat interested in education throughout his life, and was said to be an excellent music instructor. He received a master's degree in education from Fordham University in 1978 and developed an incredible passion for teaching. He left a lasting legacy at Elementary School No. 53 in the Bronx, which was renamed in his honor after his death. Students, colleagues, and parents who encountered Gryce during this time knew him as a very private, serious, passionate, and caring man. Believing that music aided literacy, Gryce was a strict but caring teacher, and went out of his way to aid students at educational risk, working at an under-resourced mostly black and Hispanic school.Cohen, Noal; Fitzgerald, Michael. Rat Race Blues: The Musical Life of Gigi Gryce. Berkeley: Berkeley Hill Books, 2002. pp. 321-23. Gryce died on March 14, 1983, of a heart attack after becoming increasingly ill. Before his death he reached out to his family again, and visited Pensacola for the first time in almost thirty years.Cohen, Noal; Fitzgerald, Michael. Rat Race Blues: The Musical Life of Gigi Gryce. Berkeley: Berkeley Hill Books, 2002. p. 329. == Musical style, influences, and legacy == While in many ways his work exemplifies the conventions of the hard bop era, Gryce always attempted to push the limits of common practice. As an educated composer with an extensive theoretical background, Gryce was prone to unconventional harmonization, form, and instrumentation as his style developed. In \\"Up in Quincy's Place\\", one of his very early tunes, Gryce was rather ahead of his time in his frequent use of quartal harmony, a practice that would be popularized during the cool jazz era.Cohen, Noal; Fitzgerald, Michael. Rat Race Blues: The Musical Life of Gigi Gryce. Berkeley: Berkeley Hill Books, 2002. p. 91.DeVeaux, Scott; Giddins, Gary. Jazz. New York: W.W. Norton & Company, 2009, p. 379. His compositions and arrangements with Farmer continued to feature non-standard forms and harmonies 175. His approach to hard bop trod the line between experimental and accessible, particularly in later work with the Teddy Charles Tentet and the Oscar Pettiford Orchestra. As an experimental composer, his goal was not jazz without limits, but forms which provided boundaries which liberated the soloist.Cohen, Noal; Fitzgerald, Michael. Rat Race Blues: The Musical Life of Gigi Gryce. Berkeley: Berkeley Hill Books, 2002. p. 189. While Gryce was a very accomplished saxophonist, clarinetist, and flautist his playing tended to be less innovative than his writing. As a saxophonist he was always very much influenced by Charlie Parker, who he had always idolized and became friends with in the mid-fifties. Contemporaries recall that Parker would sometimes borrow Gryce's horn.Cohen, Noal; Fitzgerald, Michael. Rat Race Blues: The Musical Life of Gigi Gryce.

Created by Namco's Project Soul division, she first appeared in Soulcalibur II, followed by Soulcalibur III, Soulcalibur IV, and the reboot Soulcalibur VI. Hailing from the Village of the Wind Deity, located in the Philippines during the time of the Spanish colonization, Talim is the daughter of a priestess who could control the wind to perform miracles. She would also take the position eventually, but after receiving a fragment of the cursed sword, Soul Edge, and sensing its malicious impact on humanity, she decides to travel the world so she could return it to its rightful place and restore balance to the world. The character has received positive reception, often noting her unique speed- driven fighting style as well as her sexual appeal, despite her relatively young age. Her absence in Soulcalibur V has induced criticism from various outlets. ==Conception and design== Talim is regarded as the first Filipina character introduced to the fighting game genre. In the character's native Tagalog language, her name means \\"edge\\" or \\"sharp\\". Her design and concept were built to revolve around them, starting with gender, then physical measurements, and lastly background details. Once established her appearance and movement were fleshed out by the team's concept artist Aya Takemura and rendered as a 3D model by a design team that worked solely on the character. Talim was then animated by a motion designer using motion capture and working directly with the team. During this phase the team additionally worked with the Soulcalibur story creators, refining the character's own role in the plot as needed throughout development. As a character introduced in Soulcalibur II, Talim's weapons, a pair of elbow blades, were decided upon before other aspects of the character were. Originally considered for the first Soulcalibur, the weapons were selected to be unique amongst the others characters' weapons in the title. Talim's weapons were built around the concept of dual-weapon usage, with special emphasis that while bladed, the weapons themselves were not actual tonfa. During development it was considered to allow them to transform and be sentient, however the idea was abandoned. Talim's character concept was designed around the idea of introducing a young female character that the developers felt the series lacked, while at the same time making her appear androgynous. == In video games == In the Village of the Wind Deity (Nayong Anito ng Hangin), Samar island, there lived a tribe of people who could control the winds. Talim was the granddaughter of this village's elder, Kalana, and daughter of its shaman, Lidi.Soulcalibur II, Talim Character Profile Due to turmoil caused by the influences of Spanish and Portuguese culture, she was reared to be its last priestess (babaylan). The day that the Evil Seed spread across the world, Talim felt the winds, and an evil aura that devoured everything in its path surged into her body, causing her to lose consciousness for days. Years later, when Talim was 15 years old, a man from the west brought with him a strange metal fragment, claiming it to be a vitality amulet. Talim, however, recognized the evil energy as the same energy she had experienced years before and left on a journey, believing that if she were to return the fragment to its rightful place, peace would eventually be restored, despite the elders' misgivings. Having collected several of the fragments, she eventually learned that the source of the evil energy was an evil sword called Soul Edge. Sensing another source of evil energy, Talim traveled to a mountain range, eventually locating it in a sick child living at a watermill. A young man named Hong Yun-seong arrived later as Talim settled into the watermill to try to heal the child, also searching for clues regarding Soul Edge, and came to stay with her. Talim ultimately healed the child by releasing the evil energy from within him all at once into the wind.Soulcalibur III, Talim Character Profile She then left the watermill with Yun-seong and continued to search for Soul Edge in Soulcalibur IV. They met Seong Mi-na on their travels, and together she and Talim tried to convince Yun-seong of the dangers in attempting to attain Soul Edge's power. However, Yun-seong vanished the next day, leaving both of them worried but hoping he would make the right choice. The two parted ways: Mi-na to look for Yun-seong, while Talim carried on the search for Soul Edge alone. In the rebooted timeline of Soulcalibur VI, Talim had to prove herself to her people, especially her grandmother, that she could return the fragment of Soul Edge to its rightful place. After passing her grandmother's test, Talim began her journey westward. == Gameplay == Talim wields Syi Salika and Loka Luha, a pair of tonfa-like weapons called Elbow Blades, used by the wind-worshipping people of Southeast Asia in ceremonial dances and thus are more ritual items rather than weapons. Her movement and fighting style were designed around her culture and a bird-theme, emphasizing close horizontal strikes upon opponents as well as freedom of movement. In Soulcalibur III, these weapons, and Talim's \\"Wind Dance\\" fighting style are available under the discipline Soul of Talim to characters created under the Saint class. The names of her moves are mostly in Tagalog. According to 1UP.com, Talim is a difficult character to master as the player using her \\"has to rely on tricks, gimmicks, and stuns to really apply any damage, and these need a bit of time -- and timing -- to set up.\\" == Reception== Talim's initial addition to the series has been received warmly, with reviews of Soulcalibur II describing her as a welcome addition to the series as well as a \\"speed demon\\". GameNOW described her as \\"profoundly unique not only to SC2, but to fighting games in general.\\"GameNOW staff (September 2003). \\"New to SC2\\". GameNOW GameSpy's Christian Nutt stated Talim's \\"unpredictable nature\\" made her interesting, though added \\"she's almost too cute to fit in with the rest of the SCII crew.\\" Insert Credit's Tim Rogers called Talim \\"the cutest of the young girl characters [in Soulcalibur II] by far,\\" and a preference for her symmetrical outfits. Electronic Gaming Monthly noted a positive impression in her ability to fight against the title's much larger male characters, an effect University of Delaware professor Rachel Hutchinson described as \\"entertainment through deviation from the norm\\" against stereotypical gender expectations. In 2013, Complex ranking her the eighth best character in the series. In 2015, Talim was voted the most popular Soulcalibur character in the West in an official poll by Namco Bandai. Despite her age, Talim has been utilized in material revolving around her sex appeal as a female character, such as PSM's swimsuit issuesPSM Staff (June 2003). \\"Girls of Summer\\". PSM. and Play's \\"Girls of Gaming\\" publications,Play Staff. \\"Girls of Gaming 5.5\\". Play. and The Village Voice noted concern over the character's portrayal in such material, describing it as \\"troubling\\".

It is largely coterminous with the present-day region of Czech Silesia and was, historically, part of the larger Silesia region. ==Geography== Austrian Silesia (outlined in yellow), Richard Andree, 1880 Austrian Silesia consisted of two territories, separated by the Moravian land strip of Moravsk√° Ostrava between the Ostravice and Oder rivers. The area east of the Ostravice around Cieszyn reached from the heights of the Western Carpathians (Silesian Beskids) in the south, where it bordered with the Kingdom of Hungary, along the Olza and upper Vistula rivers to the border with Prussian Silesia in the north. In the east the Bia≈Ça river at Bielsko separated it from the Lesser Polish lands of the Polish‚ÄìLithuanian Commonwealth, incorporated into the Austrian Kingdom of Galicia and Lodomeria upon the First Partition of Poland in 1772. The territory west of the Oder river stretching from the town of Opava up to B√≠l√° Voda was confined by the Jesen√≠ky mountain range of the eastern Sudetes in the south, separating it from Moravia, and the Opava river in the north. In the west the Golden Mountains formed the border with the County of Kladsko. ==History== The area originally formed the south-eastern part of the Medieval Duchy of Silesia, a province of the Piast Kingdom of Poland. During the 14th century most Dukes of Silesia had declared themselves Bohemian vassals. As part of the Lands of the Bohemian Crown, Silesia was inherited by the Habsburg archduke Ferdinand I of Austria in 1526, after the last Jagiellon king Louis II of Bohemia had died at the Battle of Moh√°cs. With the female succession of the Habsburg empress Maria Theresa to the throne in 1740, the Prussian king Frederick the Great laid claim to the Silesian province and, without waiting for any reply, on 16 December started the First Silesian War, thereby opening the larger War of the Austrian Succession. His campaign was concluded in 1742 with the Prussian victory at the Battle of Chotusitz leading to the treaties of Breslau and Berlin, in which Silesia was divided. Composition of Austrian Silesia Under the terms of the treaty, the Kingdom of Prussia received most of the territory including the Bohemian County of Kladsko, while only a small part of southeastern Silesia remained with the Habsburg Monarchy, consisting of: *the Upper Silesian duchy of Teschen (Cieszyn) *parts of the former Moravian Duchy of Opava with Duchy of Krnov south of the Opava River, comprising several Moravian enclaves. *the southern part of the Lower Silesian Duchy of Nysa around Jesen√≠k forming the Duchy of Upper and Lower Silesia, which remained a Bohemian crown land with its capital in the city of Opava. In 1766 the title of a Duke of Teschen was granted to Prince Albert of Saxony, son-in-law of Maria Theresa, while the title of a Duke of Troppau and J√§gerndorf remained with the Princely Family of Liechtenstein. The Nysa territory was held by the Bishops of Wroc≈Çaw with their residence at Castle J√°nsk√Ω vrch (Johannisberg). When in 1804 the Habsurg emperor Francis II established the Austrian Empire, his title would include the \\"Duke of Upper and Lower Silesia\\". Austrian Silesia was connected by rail with the Austrian capital Vienna, when the Emperor Ferdinand Northern Railway line was extended to Bohum√≠n station in 1847. In the course of the Austro-Hungarian Compromise of 1867 the Duchy of Upper and Lower Silesia became a crown land of Cisleithanian Austria. In November 1918 the Dual Monarchy was abolished. The major part of Austrian Silesia was ceded to the newly created state of Czechoslovakia by the 1919 Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye, with the exception of Cieszyn Silesia (the former Duchy of Teschen), which after the Polish‚ÄìCzechoslovak War was split in 1920 along the Olza river with its eastern part falling to the Autonomous Silesian Voivodeship of Poland. Smaller parts of the duchy also became a part of Poland, while the adjacent Hluƒç√≠n Region of Prussian Silesia fell to Czechoslovakia. Coat of arms of the Duchy of Upper and Lower Silesia, as drawn by Hugo Gerard Str√∂hl (1851-1919) ==Demographics== According to an Austrian census, Austrian Silesia in 1910 was home to 756,949 people, speaking the following languages: *43% - German *31% - Polish *26% - Czech ===Major towns=== Towns with more than 5,000 people in 1880: {  - !Cities !German name !Population - Opava Troppau 20,563 - Bielsko Bielitz 13,060 - Cieszyn/Tƒõ≈°√≠n Teschen 13,004 - Krnov J√§gerndorf 11,792 - Brunt√°l Freudenthal 7,595 - Fr√Ωdek Frydek 7,374 (1890) } ===Administration=== Administrative divisions of Silesia as a crown land of Austria in 1900 The Duchy of Upper and Lower Silesia was originally divided into the two districts (Bezirke) of Teschen (Tƒõ≈°√≠nsk√Ω kraj, pop. 213,040 in 1847) and Troppau (Opavsk√Ω kraj, pop. 260,199) with its seat at Krnov. In eastern Teschen, the autonomous Duchy of Bielsko was established in 1754. Upon the Revolutions of 1848 and up to its dissolution Austrian Silesia was intermittently re-organised into the districts of: *Bielitz (Bielsko) *Freistadt (Fry≈°t√°t) *Freiwaldau (Fr√Ωvaldov) *Freudenthal (Brunt√°l) *Friedek (Fr√Ωdek) *J√§gerndorf (Krnov) *Teschen (Cieszyn/Tƒõ≈°√≠n) *Troppau (Opava) *Wagstadt (Bilovec).

In sea transport, a packet service is a regular, scheduled service, carrying freight and passengers. The ships used for this service are called packet ships or packet boats. The seamen are called packetmen, and the business is called packet trade. \\"Packet\\" can mean a small parcel but, originally meant a parcel of important correspondence or valuable items, for urgent delivery.Oxford English Dictionary - Packet: \\"A small pack, package, or parcel. In later use freq.: the container or wrapping in which goods are sold; packaging; a bag or envelope for packing something in. Also: the contents of a packet. In early use chiefly used of a parcel of letters or dispatches, esp. the state parcel or mail in which letters to and from foreign countries were carried.\\" The French-language term \\"paquebot\\" derives from the English term \\"packet boat,\\" but means a large ocean liner. Poster advertising a packet service, Greenock, Scotland to New York, 1823 This sense became extended to mean any regularly scheduled ship, carrying passengers, as in packet trade. The word \\"packet\\" is frequently modified by the destination, e.g. Sydney packet, or by motive force, e.g. \\"steam packet\\". ==History== Many states, civilisations and organisations set up mail systems for high value goods, especially confidential correspondence and bullion. In times of war, regular shipments ran the gauntlet of warships and privateers, and even in peacetime, pirates could be a threat on some routes. In 1829, the pirate Mansel Alcantra captured the packet Topaz and murdered her crew after looting her. In Britain, the Post Office Packet Service used small, fast, lightly armed ships to carry state papers to overseas destinations on a regular schedule. This service operated from Tudor times until 1823, when the Admiralty assumed the responsibility for running the service. During the French Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars the packet ships were targets for privateers and warships seeking prize money. Although some were captured, others managed to fight back. In the 1850s the Post Office moved to using contract carriers. Other European states with overseas colonies also developed packet mail systems. Eventually, however, commercial steam liners began to work regular international schedules and received contracts from governments to carry mail as well as passengers and high-value cargo. Their services retained the name \\"Packet\\". ==Companies== Packet shipping companies included: * Baltimore Steam Packet Company * Black Ball Line (trans-Atlantic packet) * City of Dublin Steam Packet Company * Cunard Line * Isle of Man Steam Packet Company * Liverpool Packet * Woolwich Steam Packet Company * Robert Kermits Red Star Line ==United States== In the United States, \\"packet trade\\" is often used to refer to the Atlantic (or Western) Ocean packets which traded with Europe and Africa (notably Cape Verde). Packet boats, smaller vessels designed for domestic use, also were extensively used in the 19th century for internal mail and scheduled service using rivers and canals, such as along the Erie Canal, which cut travel time across New York state in half; the Pennsylvania Canal, the James River and Kanawha Canal, and navigable rivers. During the 18th century ships carrying cargo, passengers and mail between Europe and America would sail only when they were full. Starting in the early 19th century, as trade with America became more common, schedule regularity became a priority. ===Black Ball line=== In 1818, ships of the Black Ball line began regularly scheduled trips between Britain and the United States. These \\"packet ships\\" (named for their delivery of mail \\"packets\\") were infamous for keeping to their disciplined schedules. This often involved harsh treatment of seamen and earned the ships the nickname \\"bloodboat\\". The original Black Ball Line was founded by a group of New York Quakers, but later a rival service founded by James Baines of Liverpool also styled itself the Black Ball Line, despite the protests of the original company of that name. ===Cape Verde=== Because of the influence of whaling and several local droughts, there was substantial migration from Cape Verde to America, most notably to New Bedford, Massachusetts. This migration built strong ties between the two locations. A strong packet trade between New England and Cape Verde developed during the early-to-mid-19th century. ===Modern day=== In the 21st century, ePacket delivery became available through the US Postal Service as a deal with China Post, Hongkong Post, and the Korean postal service in order to support internet commerce between East Asia and the United States. Vendors in those countries can sell goods directly to American customers while enjoying delivery rates that are often less even than domestic US vendors would pay to deliver the same parcel. These low rates and the current lack of protective tariffs on imported goods from foreign countries make the service controversial because it apparently gives foreign vendors, especially in mainland China and Hong Kong, a competitive advantage in the still-growing online market. The USPS has complained of inability to effectively negotiate prices with the Chinese postal services, and was losing millions of dollars on the service each year. ==Australia== The first seagoing ship built in Van Diemens Land (in 1812) was named the Henrietta Packet by virtue of the fact that she offered a regular passenger service between Hobart, Tasmania and Sydney, New South Wales. From the 1830s the term \\"steam packet\\" was commonly applied to early steam ship services that, at least in theory, offered a regular and reliable service, and is perpetuated today by many waterfront establishments around Australia bearing such names as the \\"Steam Packet Inn\\" or \\"Steam Packet Hotel\\". Both fast sailing ships and early steam ships holding mail contracts between Great Britain and Australia were also often referred to as packets. These included several ships of James Baines' Black Ball Line and the Orient Line. ==Netherlands== In the late 15th to mid 16th century the Dutch system of the beurtvaart developed, a related system for mostly inland navigation. Ships of the beurtvaart carried passengers, livestock and freight along fixed routes at fixed prices with scheduled departures. Organised by the cities, it grew to an extensive and reliable network over the following century. Some of the cities arranged for international (seagoing) connections as well. In the second half of the 19th century authorities withdrew from intervening and a lot of steamship companies sprang up, offering much the same services. Some carried freight and livestock only, some of them were mainly for passenger transport, becoming more like public transport. They would call their service beurtvaart or occasionally use the word 'packet' as did Alkmaar Packet. ==See also== *Post Office Packet Service *Isle of Man Steam Packet *Packet boat ==Further reading== *Dave Hollett, Fast Passage to Australia: the History of the Black Ball, Eagle and White Star Lines, London, Fairplay, 1986. ==References== Category:Packet (sea transport) Category:Packet (river transport) Category:Maritime history Category:Economic history of the United States Category:Economic history of Australia Category:Economic history of the United Kingdom Category:Cape Verdean American history ","title":"Packet trade"},{"id":"2225142","text":"Eroski is a Spanish supermarket chain with nearly 1,000 outlets spread across Spain (excluding franchises).

Armand Barb√®s (18 September 1809 - 26 June 1870) was a French Republican revolutionary and a fierce and steadfast opponent of the July monarchy (1830‚Äì1848). He is remembered as a man whose life centers on two days: * 12 May 1839, the day of the uprising in which the Republicans tried to overthrow the king, Louis Philippe. His ill-considered actions on this day led to a sentence of life imprisonment; he was, however, released by the revolution of 1848; and * 15 May 1848, the day when demonstrators invaded the Assembl√©e Nationale, where Barb√®s had been serving, for only about three weeks, as a deputy. The demonstrators' ostensible aim was to urge the government to exercise whatever influence it could in support of the liberation of Poland. Things got out of hand, however, and Barb√®s got caught up in what was perceived to be a coup d'√©tat through the imposition of a provisional government. Barb√®s was again imprisoned, but he was pardoned by Napoleon III in 1854. He fled into exile in the Netherlands, where he died on 26 June 1870, only weeks before the end of the Second Empire in France. A most colorful character, he was nicknamed the Bayard of Democracy, presumably in honor of the chevalier, Pierre Terrail, seigneur de Bayard (1476‚Äì1524). He was also known as the \\"peerless conspirator\\", and a modern historian has called him \\"a man of action without a program.\\" Barb√®s is today the very paradigm of the nineteenth-century \\"romantic revolutionary\\" type, courageous, generous, and a true democrat. He was called the \\"scourge of the establishment\\" by Karl Marx. ==Youth== Barb√®s was born into a middle-class family in Pointe-√†-Pitre, Guadeloupe. His father, an army surgeon from Carcassonne in the d√©partement of Aude, was born in Capendu, also in Aude. He was a veteran of Napoleon's Egyptian campaign. Posted to Guadeloupe in 1801, he remained there until the fall of the First Empire in 1814. The family returned to Carcassonne, and the eldest son of the doctor, Armand, eventually arrived in Carcassonne also, in 1830, the place of his revolutionary baptism. At twenty, Armand, disposed to a Republican point-of-view early in the development of his consciousness, was as physically strong as he was precocious of intellect. He had an imposing physique, and he was chosen to lead the local battalion of the National Guard during the 1830 revolution. The battalion was financed by the elder Barb√®s out of his own pocket. The following year, Armand went to Paris to study medicine, but he found the very sight of blood repugnant. So, with a passion reminiscent of the Flaubert hero, Fr√©d√©ric Moreau in Sentimental Education (1869), he threw himself, body and soul, into a study of the law. Like Moreau, Barb√®s experienced his parents' deaths at an early age. As a consequence, he was left a large inheritance, so large, in fact, that Barb√®s was relieved of the need to work to earn his living, and he became free to submit to the passion of his life: conspiring to overthrow the ruling regime, in this case, the July Monarchy. In 1834, his membership in a Jacobin-leaning organization, the Soci√©t√© des Droits de l'Homme (Society for the Rights of Man), led to his first arrest. Released in early 1835, he served as a lawyer for 164 defendants indicted for republican insurgency during 1834, and, in July 1835, he assisted twenty-eight of them to escape from Sainte-Pelagie prison in Paris, an institution reserved for political troublemakers. In 1834, the Society for the Rights of Man, at about the time of Barb√®s's arrest, was dismantled by the police. He responded by founding the short-lived Society of Avengers, which was followed, the next year, by the League of Families, the organization for which Barb√®s composed the oath of membership, a must for all aspiring conspirators. This was the beginning of his long and tumultuous \\"collaboration\\" with Louis Auguste Blanqui. On 10 March 1836, Barb√®s and Blanqui were arrested by the police while loading ammunition in the apartment they shared in Paris. Barb√®s, sentenced to one year imprisonment, was pardoned in 1837, and he spent several months, after his pardon, with his family in Carcassonne. There, he devised plans for a new secret society, and he wrote the brochure that will remain his only contribution to revolutionary literature, \\"A Few Words to Those who Sympathize with Workers without Work\\". When he returned to Paris in 1838, he joined with Blanqui and Martin Bernard to form yet another republican secret society, the very proletarian Society of Seasons. ==The Society of Seasons== The Society of Seasons was organized on the principle of a hierarchy of cells. A \\"week\\" was a group of six men and a leader. Four \\"weeks\\" made a \\"month\\" of twenty-eight \\"days\\" (actually, twenty- eight initiates, plus a leader.) Three months constituted a \\"season\\", and four \\"seasons\\" made a \\"year\\". At its height, the Society comprised more than three \\"years\\". The founding of the Society of Seasons led directly to the Barb√®s-led insurrection of 12 May 1839. At this time, Barb√®s, Blanqui, and Martin were three Republicans cut from the same cloth. They were of the same generation, with the same youthful commitment to revolutionary struggle, and they shared a common experience of oppression, trials, and imprisonment. Then their paths diverged. ==The 1839 coup== On 12 May 1839, the Society of Seasons and its approximately nine hundred members felt strong enough to attempt a coup d'√©tat in Paris. Four hundred insurgents managed to seize the National Assembly, the city hall, and the Palace of Justice, but they were unable to maintain their grip for more than a few hours because of a lack of numbers and weapons. Following the failure of this insurrection, Barb√®s was sentenced to death, but his sentence was commuted to 'life imprisonment' largely due to the intervention of Victor Hugo. Also, these events led to a divorce between Barb√®s and Blanqui, which became a severe impediment to the extreme left during the revolution of 1848 and also later in the century. Barb√®s was sent to Mont-Saint-Michel on 17 July 1839 with three other convicts, including Martin Bernard, who left a detailed account of their time in prison. (Blanqui and five other insurgents joined them on 6 February 1840.) Upon their arrival, the inmates were fighting against the rigors of solitary confinement by maintaining a continuous din, from the windows, up the chimneys, and through the walls. Barb√®s, Bernard, and an old comrade, Delsade, managed, after repeated trials, to open the doors of their cells to meet. Discovered in April 1841, they were punished by imprisonment in the \\"loges\\" section of the prison, completely in view of the warder on duty. The prison administration then equipped their cells with double gates to prevent them from approaching the cross in what, after all, had been an abbey before its conversion to a high- security prison at the time of the French Revolution. On the nights of 10 and 11 February 1842, Barb√®s, Blanqui and others attempted to escape, in fog, using a rope made of knotted sheets. Barb√®s was the first over the wall, but he was injured in the fall, and this doomed the escape attempt. All of them were reconfined in their cells. Shortly thereafter, Barb√®s contracted what he called consumption (tuberculosis), probably, in fact, persistent bronchitis brought on by the cold and damp of Mont-Saint-Michel. ==Barb√®s and Blanqui== Blanqui, the prime mover of the 1839 coup, seems to have believed that Barb√®s, who had been away from revolutionary activities for a short while, lacked resolve, that he was exhausted from repeated discouragements, and that this attitude in Barb√®s disheartened his fellow insurgents, leading to a failure of the coup. In fact, when he was released from prison in 1848, Barb√®s seemed to have regained his fervor, and he rallied the revolutionary left in a more moderate and pragmatic direction, to oppose Blanqui. Guided by Alphonse de Lamartine, he formed the Club of the Revolution to counteract Blanqui's Central Insurrection Society, an organization prudently renamed the Central Republican Society. Owing to his previous brief military experience in the Aude, Barb√®s was appointed colonel of the National Guard of the Twelfth District, and, ironically, he led his troops, on 16 April 1848, against a workers' demonstration led by Louis Blanc and Blanqui. Workers had demanded a more active social program and especially the postponement of the immanent elections to the constituent National Assembly. The protesters foresaw that the government had no time to \\"educate\\" the provincials, so the new Assembly would be dominated by Parisian conservatives and reactionaries. A month earlier, in March 1848, the hostility between Barb√®s and Blanqui had erupted with the publication in the mainstream press of the so-called document Taschereau, said to be derived from police records. This document purportedly proved that Blanqui had betrayed his fellow conspirators during the 1839 coup. A goodly number of historians now consider it highly likely that this document was \\"a false broadcast, in the form of leaks by the government\\" to destabilize and undermine Blanqui. If so, it worked. Barb√®s apparently believed in the authenticity of this document, and this caused \\"terrible divisions\\" among those of the left, divisions still present at the end of the century. The two men, who had become distrustful of one another, ended up hating each other with the same passion that had fueled their early revolutionary idealism. Nonetheless, both are major figures in the Republican pantheon, where they both enjoy a reputation as uncompromising revolutionaries, never diminished by the inevitable compromises necessitated by the exercise of power. Barb√®s, perhaps more thoughtful than his colleague, was fascinated by Blanqui, who was romantic, brave, but prone to impulses and inconsistencies. Beyond this fascination, Barb√®s hoped to channel the might of the volcanic Blanqui, but, he was, many suppose, secretly afraid of Blanqui's capacity for unreason and violence. ==The treason of Barb√®s== Photograph of Armand Barb√®s in Holland, 1869 Released from prison in 1848, Barb√®s seemed to his contemporaries to be obsessed with thwarting Blanqui. Elected to the Constituent Assembly of 23 April 1848, Barb√®s, at the extreme left of the chamber, represented his native department of Aude. His parliamentary career was brief, however, since, on 15 May, demonstrators invaded the Assembly, under the pretext of presenting a petition urging the government to become more involved in the liberation of Poland. Barb√®s, initially opposed the demonstration, and he tried to disperse the crowd, but he seemed to lose his head when he saw Auguste Blanqui in the assembly chamber. In an effort to seize the demonstration as a tool to bludgeon his enemy, he sparked a riot in front of the city hall, where a new, and more radical, republic was proclaimed. The insurgency was 'deflated' by itself when National Guard arrived to stop Barbes. He was sentenced to life imprisonment in April 1849 by the High Court of Justice, after he was found guilty of two major charges, an attack that aimed to overthrow the government, and incitement to civil war. Later, Karl Marx wrote in Class Struggles in France: \\"On 12 May [1848, the proletariat] sought unsuccessfully to regain its revolutionary influence, but only managed to deliver to the bourgeoisie's jailers their most energetic leaders.\\" Modern historians have been even less kind: George Duveau, the historian, described the event as a \\"tragic and absurd farce which had, from the beginning, no prospect of success\\". Barb√®s showed an indomitable courage and chivalry, a taste for sacrifice, and an acceptance of his responsibilities. This certainly explains the charisma that was undeniably his; this view was common to all of his contemporaries, even his opponents. There is, nonetheless, an element of irrationality in the man that defies analysis, a \\"mythe Barb√®s\\" that continues to fascinate readers of history. Sentenced to life imprisonment in 1849, Barb√®s was released by Napoleon III in 1854. However, he never returned to France. He had spent all but a few weeks of the previous fifteen years in confinement as a political prisoner. He realized that returning to French society would only tempt him to further political intrigues, so he withdrew into voluntary exile at the Hague, where he died on 26 June 1870, aged 60, just weeks before the Second Empire fell, the event that would, no doubt, have delighted him beyond all else. He is buried in the private domain of Fourtou at Villalier, Aude. ==See also== * Barb√®s ‚Äì Rochechouart (Paris M√©tro) * Ferdinand Barrot * Jules-Ferdinand Baulard * Marie-Sophie Leroyer de Chantepie * Ch√¢teau de Vincennes * French demonstration of 15 May 1848 * High Court of Justice of Bourges * Albert Laponneraye * √âtienne-Denis Pasquier * Listing of the works of Alexandre Falgui√®re ==French bibliography== * \\"'Quelques mots √† ceux qui poss√®dent en faveur des Prol√©taires sans travail.\\"' Barb√®s Carcassonne, 1837 * Karl Marx, ¬´ Luttes de classe en France ¬ª, s.d. * B.M. de Saint-√âtienne, Correspondance de Martin Bernard. s.d. * Tchernoff, I.

Jones was given the nickname Mr Baldy for shaving his victims' hair and dressing them in female clothing during the attacks. ==Criminal background== He pled guilty to 17 charges, including six of indecent assault on a male under 16, six of abduction, two of burglary and two of theft. He was sentenced to 14 years jail with a non-parole period of 12 years. After remissions of one-third, he was paroled in 1989 and he raped a nine-year-old-boy and sexually abused the victim's six-year-old brother within weeks. He was convicted of aggravated rape, sexual penetration of a child under 10 and three counts of indecent assault, and was sentenced in 1992 to 14 years imprisonment with a non parole period of 12 years to be served cumulatively with the balance of parole that he breached. Under the terms of the sentence, Jones was eligible for parole in August 2003, and was eventually released from HM Prison Ararat in July 2005 with the strictest parole conditions ever given to a Victorian prisoner. The extended supervision order imposed 23 conditions, restricting his movements and contact with other people, and was to wear an electronic anklet to allow monitoring 24 hours a day. Jones was first settled in an undisclosed residential area, later revealed to be in the area, causing public outcry over his placement near to schools and playgrounds. After a vigil by protesters outside the house, Jones was moved from this address to a cottage within the perimeter of HM Prison Ararat. On 7 August 2005, talk radio show host Derryn Hinch revealed Jones' living arrangements on air; Hinch's comments caused controversy in the Melbourne suburb of Frankston, where residents attacked the house named on air and abused its occupants, and a local supermarket began a petition to remove Jones from the area. Hinch later revealed his comments were mistaken and Jones was not living at the Frankston address. The following day the Victorian government represented by Peter Faris applied to the County Court of Victoria for a 15-year supervision order under the Serious Sex Offenders Monitoring Act, enabling Jones to be supervised once his parole term expired. Jones appeared in court via video-link and did not contest the application. In August 2006, Jones was caught wandering the streets of Ararat, in breach of his supervision order and was arrested by prison officers and was imprisoned indefinitely for multiple breaches of his parole conditions. For two weeks in 2008, power was lost to the electronic equipment set up to monitor Jones' movements. Authorities believed he deliberately disconnected the mains power supply to the monitoring unit in his cottage. In 2016 under supervision, he was attending the Salvation Army men's shed program. ==See also== *Child sexual abuse in Australia *Garry David - (d. 1993), Victorian prisoner during the 1990s who remained imprisoned beyond his sentence due to fears for public safety. ==References *Mr Baldy set to be freed and tracked Category:1947 births Category:Living people Category:20th- century Australian criminals Category:Australian kidnappers Category:Australian people convicted of child sexual abuse Category:Australian people convicted of indecent assault Category:Australian rapists Category:People convicted of burglary Category:People convicted of theft Category:Criminals from Melbourne Category:Date of birth missing (living people) Category:People convicted of kidnapping Category:Place of birth missing (living people) ","title":"Brian Keith Jones"},{"id":"2225178","text":"Located on the isolated west coast of Espiritu Santo, Mount Tabwemasana is not only the highest peak in Vanuatu, but also one of the highest mountains in the Pacific. At , Tabwemasana towers above the surrounding mountains and provides fantastic views toward the Coral Sea in East. Tabwemasana actually consists of two peaks and local folklore believes that these two peaks (male and female) come together in embrace at night. Until the 1970s the village of Kerepua was located on the flanks of Tabwemasana, a full day's walk to the coast through thick rainforest. However, in the late 1970s like many other mountain villages, Kerepua was relocated to the coast and now provides the launching pad for any summit attempt. Very few tourists climb Tabwemasana each year, with the number reaching the summit generally less than six persons per year. This is primarily due to the isolated location of the mountain and the physical difficulty of ascending the peak. Those wishing to climb Tabwemasana must first take a boat from the village of Tasiriki to Kerepua. From Kerepua you trek up a river before leaving the valley for a steep ascent up the mountain.

In specific, since the fire has a basic role in this event, the latter meaning (i.e. the scarlet) makes more sense. Local varieties of the name of the festival include Azerbaijani (in Ardabil), Kurdish and (in Kurdistan), and Isfahani Persian (in Isfahan). To the Yezidi Kurds, it is known as . ==Observances== 2018 Charshanbe Suri fireworks in Akre. ===Jumping over the fire=== Before the start of the festival, people gather brushwood in an open, free exterior space. At sunset, after making one or more bonfires, they jump over the flames, singing , literally meaning \\"[let] your redness [be] mine, my paleness yours\\", or a local equivalent of it. This is considered a purification practice. ===Spoon- banging=== Charshanbe Suri includes a custom similar to trick-or-treating that is called (), literally translated as \\"spoon-banging\\". It is observed by people wearing disguises and going door-to-door to hit spoons against plates or bowls and receive packaged snacks. ==Historical backgroundAncient Origin=== The festival has its origin in ancient Iranian rituals. The ancient Iranians celebrated the festival of Hamaspathmaedaya (), the last five days of the year in honor of the spirits of the dead, which is today referred to as Farvardinegan. They believed that the spirits of the dead would come for reunion. The seven holy immortals () were honored, and were bidden a formal ritual farewell at the dawn of the New Year. The festival also coincided with festivals celebrating the creation of fire and humans. By the time of the Sasanian Empire, the festival was divided into two distinct pentads, known as the lesser and the greater . The belief had gradually developed that the \\"lesser \\" belonged to the souls of children and those who died without sin, while the \\"greater \\" was for all souls. ===Qajar Empire=== A custom once in vogue in Tehran was to seek the intercession of the so-called \\"Pearl Cannon\\" () on the occasion of Charshanbe Suri. This heavy gun, which was cast by the foundry-man IsmƒÅil IsfahƒÅni in 1800, under the reign of Fath-Ali Shah of the Qajar dynasty, became the focus of many popular myths. Until the 1920s, it stood in Arg Square (, ), to which the people of Tehran used to flock on the occasion of Charshanbe Suri. Spinsters and childless or unhappy wives climbed up and sat on the barrel or crawled under it, and mothers even made ill- behaved and troublesome children pass under it in the belief that doing so would cure their naughtiness. These customs died out in the 1920s, when the Pearl Cannon was moved to the Army's Officers' Club. There was also another Pearl Cannon in Tabriz. Girls and women used to fasten their dakhils (pieces of a paper or cloth inscribed with wishes and prayers) to its barrel on the occasion of Charshanbe Suri. In times, the cannon had been used as a sanctuary for political or non-political fugitives to be immune to arrest or to protest from family problems. Sadegh Hedayat, an Iranian writer of prose fiction and short stories, has a book with the name of this cannon, , that criticize the old beliefs in Iranian folklore. The book also mentions the origin of the Pearl Cannon. Today, the Pearl Cannon is placed in the opening of the Building Number 7 of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs at 30th Tir Avenue, and the Cultural Heritage Organization of Iran is still in argument with the ministry to displace the gun to a museum. ==Gallery== Shah of Iran ChaharchanbehSouri.JPGMohammad Reza Pahlavi, the last Shah of Iran, jumping over the fire.

The 16th-century Kinnaird Castle was converted in 1787 for use as the Kinnaird Head Lighthouse, the first lighthouse in Scotland to be lit by the Commissioners of Northern Lights. Kinnaird Castle and the nearby Winetower were described by W. Douglas Simpson as two of the nine castles of the Knuckle, referring to the rocky headland of north-east Aberdeenshire. The lighthouse is a category A listed building. and the Winetower is a scheduled monument. ==Kinnaird Castle== Kinnaird Castle, also known as Fraserburgh Castle and Kinnairdshead Castle, was begun in March 1570. The builder was Sir Alexander Fraser, 8th laird of Philorth, (c.1536‚Äì1623), who also transformed the fishing village of Faithlie into the burgh of Fraserburgh in the 1590s. However, the building of the castle led to such expense that he was forced to sell Philorth Castle, the family home. Alexander, 10th of Philorth, fought for the king at the Battle of Worcester (1651). Despite being badly wounded, he survived to live into his eighties. In 1669 he inherited the title of Lord Saltoun, and in later years he had apartments at Kinnaird Castle The last people to reside in the castle were Henrietta Fraser (1698-1751), daughter of the 12th Lord Saltoun, and her husband John Gordon of Kinellar (1684-1764). In 1787 it was leased to the Trustees of the Northern lights, who turned it into Kinnaird Head Lighthouse. Designed by Thomas Smith, the lamp was first lit on 1 December. The structure was rebuilt in the 1820s, and superseded by a new lighthouse in 1991. It now houses the Museum of Scottish Lighthouses, which incorporates the original lighthouse and a modern building housing collections of lenses and other artefacts from many lighthouses across Scotland. == Winetower == The Winetower The Winetower is a small three-storey tower located approximately from Kinnaird Head Lighthouse. The tower has been dated to the 16th-century, and may have gained its name through use as a store associated with the castle. The tower is accessed via the second floor, and contains elaborate carved stone pendants. It is reputed that in the cave below, one of the Fraser family imprisoned his daughter's boyfriend, leaving him to drown there. The daughter then jumped from the roof of the tower. There is red paint on the rocks below to illustrate her blood. According to local tradition, the tower is said to be haunted. ==Footnotes * *Museum of Scottish Lighthouses web site *Historic Environment Scotland: Visitor guide (Castle Lighthouse) Category:Headlands of Scotland Category:Banff and Buchan Category:Fraserburgh Category:Landforms of Aberdeenshire ","title":"Kinnaird Head"},{"id":"2225201","text":"is a 1988 ice hockey video game published and developed by Nintendo, originally for the Famicom Disk System.

Each game is made up of three periods, with the victory going to the team who has the most points at the end of the game. At the beginning, two opposing players from each team face off in the middle of the rink. There are three kinds of players - the first is fast, weak, and feeble, but is good at the face-off; the second is average in all qualities, and the third is slow and poor at the face-off, but very powerful, both in body checking and shooting strength. The arena is similarly designed to a real-world ice hockey arena. The arena is coated in ice, with a goal on either side of the arena. There are a variety of marked areas, including the goal line that the puck must cross to score, the attacking/defending zone which is situated closely to each goal, the face-off spot, the neutral spot, and others. Each side of the arena has exactly the same design. If two opposing players fight for the puck for a certain amount of time, other players join into the fight, resulting in the player from the losing team in the fight to be put in the penalty box for a period of time. ==Regional differences== There are some regional differences in the team roster line-ups. In Japan's Famicom Disk System version, the lineup is Japan (JPN), United States (USA), Czechoslovakia (TCH), Canada (CAN), Poland (POL), and the Soviet Union (URS). For the PAL versions, Nintendo removed Japan from the team roster and included Sweden instead. For the North American and European version, Nintendo includes these six teams: the United States (USA), Sweden (SWE), Czechoslovakia (TCH), Canada (CAN), Poland (POL), and the Soviet Union (URS). There are also differences in the music. In the Japanese version, the music for the in-game play, and for scoring a goal, is completely different from the US version.http://tcrf.net/Ice_Hockey_%28NES%29 ==Reception and legacy== Ice Hockey was rated the 142nd best game made on a Nintendo System in Nintendo Power's Top 200 Games list. Electronic Gaming Monthly listed it as number 94 on their 100 best console video games of all time, remarking that it \\"has some of the most hilarious gameplay of any sports game ever, yet it still requires a lot of skill to play and accurately represents the excitement of real hockey. Fights turn into brawls, close games raise the crowd noise up when the game clock reaches two minutes, and the available team members vary in ability, making for (gasp!) strategic play.\\" Note: Contrary to the title, the intro to the article explicitly states that the list covers console video games only, meaning PC games and arcade games were not eligible. It was also included in IGN's top 100 NES games list, ranking at 100. Mark Bozon praised it for being the most addictive of Nintendo's early sports titles, commenting that it was in his NES as often as Super Mario Bros. 3 was. Aaron Thomas of GameSpot also commended the Virtual Console re-release for being \\"one of those rare NES sports games that's almost as much fun to play today as it was when it was released.\\" Hideki Konno, the designer of the game, later went on to direct and produce classic Nintendo titles such as Super Mario Kart, Super Mario World 2: Yoshi's Island, and Luigi's Mansion. The Fat Hockey Player appears as a collectible sticker in Super Smash Bros. Brawl. ==ReferencesIce Hockey 68k Port to TI-89/Titanium, TI-92/Plus, and Voyage 200 calculators located at ticalc.org *Ice Hockey at NinDB *Official entry into the Hockeywood Video Game Hall of Fame Official entry into the Hockeywood Video Game Hall of Fame Category:1988 video games Category:Famicom Disk System games Category:Ice hockey video games Category:Nintendo Entertainment System games Category:Nintendo games Category:Pax Softnica games Category:Video games developed in Japan Category:Video games scored by Soyo Oka Category:Virtual Console games Category:Virtual Console games for Wii U Category:Multiplayer and single-player video games Category:Nintendo Switch Online NES games ","title":"Ice Hockey (1988 video game)"},{"id":"2225205","text":"Francisco Serrano Dom√≠nguez Cuenca y P√©rez de Vargas, 1st Duke of la Torre, Grandee of Spain, Count of San Antonio (17 December 1810 - 25 November 1885) was a Spanish marshal and statesman. He was Prime Minister of Spain in 1868-69 and regent in 1869-70\\\\. ==Early life and education== Serrano was born on 17 December 1810 in the Isla de Le√≥n (current day San Fernando), in the Bay of C√°diz. He was son of Francisco Serrano y Cuenca and Isabel Dom√≠nguez de Guevara Vasconcelos. His father, born in Lopera, parish of Pur√≠sima Concepci√≥n, was a general officer and a Liberal. His mother was born in Marbella circa 1780. Serrano began his studies at Vergara in the Basque provinces. ==Military career== Following his father into the military, he became a cadet in 1822 in the Sagunto regiment, cornet in 1833 in the lancers of Sagunto, and passed into the carabiniers in 1829. When the Carlist agitation began in 1833, he transferred into the cuirassiers. He formed part of the escort that accompanied Don Carlos, the first pretender and brother of Ferdinand VII, to the frontier of Portugal. As aide-de-camp of Espoz y Mina, then under the orders of generals C√≥rdoba and Espartero, in the armies of Queen Isabella, Serrano took such an active part in the First Carlist War from 1834 to 1839, that he rose from the rank of captain to that of brigadier- general. He was awarded the Cross of San Fernando and many medals. He was also granted the 155th Grand Cross of the Order of the Tower and Sword. In 1839, he was elected as a member of Cortes for the first time for M√°laga. In 1840 he was promoted to the rank of general of division and commander of the district of Valencia, which he relinquished to take his seat in congress. ==Political career== Portrait by Antonio Gisbert. From that day Serrano became one of the chief military politicians of Spain. In 1841, he helped Espartero to overthrow the regency of Maria Christina of Bourbon-Sicily. In 1843, at Barcelona he made a pronunciamiento against Espartero. He was appointed as the minister of war in the cabinet of Joaqu√≠n Mar√≠a L√≥pez y L√≥pez, which convoked the Cortes that declared Queen Isabella of age at fifteen. He served in the same capacity in an Olozaga cabinet, sulked as long as the Moderates (') were in office. In 1845, he was appointed as a senator, and in 1848 as captain-general of Granada. From 1846 to 1853, he was away from politics, living on his Andalusian estates or traveling abroad. On 29 September 1850 in Madrid, Serrano married his first cousin, Antonia Dom√≠nguez y Borrell, Guevara y Lemus, 2nd Countess of San Antonio, with whom he had five children. Serrano assisted Marshal Leopoldo O'Donnell in the military movements of 1854 and 1856, and was his staunch follower for twelve years. === Captain-General of Cuba === O'Donnell appointed Serrano as marshal in 1856 and captain-general of Cuba from 1859 to 1862. Serrano governed that island with success, and helped carry out the war in Santo Domingo. He was the first viceroy to advocate political and financial reforms in the colony. === Return to the Peninsula === On his return to Peninsular Spain, O'Donnell made him Duke of la Torre ('), Grandee of Spain of the first class, and the 139th Minister of Foreign Affairs, serving from 18 January to 2 March 1863. Serrano risked his life in helping O'Donnell quell the insurrection of 22 June 1866 at Madrid. He was awarded with the Order of the Golden Fleece. After the death of O'Donnell, Serrano became the leader of the Liberal Union Party. As president of the senate, he assisted R√≠os Rosas to draw up a petition to Queen Isabella against her Moderate ministers, for which both were exiled. === The Glorious Revolution === Serrano began to conspire with Antoine, Duke of Montpensier, Prim and Sagasta. On 7 July 1868, Gonz√°lez Bravo had Serrano and other generals arrested and taken to the Canary Islands. There Serrano remained until Admiral Topete sent a steamer to bring him to Cadiz on 18 September that same year. On landing he signed the manifesto of the revolution with Prim, Topete, Sagasta, Martos and others, and accepted the command of the revolutionary army. He routed the troops of Queen Isabella under the orders of the Marquess of Novaliches at the bridge of Alcolea. The queen fled to France, and Serrano, having entered Madrid, formed a Provisional Government. === 1868‚Äì1871 Provisional Government === Provisional Government in 1869, by J. Laurent. In February 1869, he convoked the Cortes Constituyentes; he was appointed successively as president of the executive, Prime Minister of Spain, and Regent from 3 October 1868 to 18 June 1869. Serrano ruled impartially, respecting the independence of the Cortes and cabinets. He acceded to their selection of Amadeus I of Savoy as king, although he would have preferred Montpensier. As soon as Amadeus reached Madrid, after the death of Prim, Serrano consented to form a coalition cabinet, which lasted only a few months. Serrano resigned and took the command of the Italian king's army against the Carlists in northern Spain. He tried to form one more cabinet under King Amadeus as the 65th Prime Minister of Spain on 6 June 1872, but resigned on 12 June when that monarch declined to give his ministers dictatorial powers and sent for Ruiz Zorrilla. His mistakes led to Amadeus abdicating the throne on 11 February 1873. === Conspirations against the Republic === Serrano opposed the federal republic, and conspired with other generals and politicians to overthrow it on 23 April 1873. Having failed, he went into exile in France. On the eve of his coup d'√©tat of 3 January 1874 that sought to thwart the Federal Republic, the leading instigator, the General Pav√≠a, sent for Serrano to take the leadership. The Duke of la Torre's coat of arms === Dictatorship of Serrano === Serrano again took the title of president of the executive; he tried to form a coalition cabinet, but Cristino Martos and Sagasta soon quarrelled. His next cabinet was presided over by Sagasta. The military and political unrest continued, and at the end of December 1874, the Bourbons were restored by another pronunciamiento. During the eleven months he remained in office, Serrano devoted his attention chiefly to the reorganization of finance, the renewal of relations with American and European powers, and the suppression of revolt. === Later life === After Alfonso XII ascended the throne in 1875, Serrano spent some time in France. He returned to Madrid in 1876, attended palace receptions, took his seat as a marshal in the senate, and flirted politically with Sagasta and his party in 1881. He finally gave his support to the formation of a dynastic Left with a democratic program defended by his nephew, General L√≥pez Dom√≠nguez. He died in Madrid on 25 November/26 November 1885, twenty-four hours after Alfonso XII, son of Isabella II, and purportedly, her husband and cousin Francis, although Alfonso's true biological paternity is uncertain. == Notes References== ;Attribution == Bibliography == * ==External links== * - - - - - - - - - - - - Category:1810 births Category:1885 deaths Category:People from San Fernando, C√°diz Category:Ambassadors of Spain to France Category:Governors of Cuba Category:Spanish captain generals Category:Cuban nobility 101 Category:Grandees of Spain Category:Knights of the Golden Fleece of Spain Category:Laureate Cross of Saint Ferdinand Category:Grand Crosses of the Order of the Tower and Sword Category:Leaders of political parties in Spain Category:Liberal Union (Spain) politicians Category:Prime Ministers of Spain Category:Regents of Spain Category:Defence ministers of Spain Category:Viceroys of New Granada Category:19th-century South American people Category:Military personnel of the First Carlist War Category:Grand Masters of the Order of Isabella the Catholic Category:Presidents of the Senate of Spain Category:Presidents of the Executive Power of the First Spanish Republic Category:Spanish military personnel of the Third Carlist War (Governmental faction) ","title":"Francisco Serrano, 1st Duke of la Torre"},{"id":"2225216","text":"Ronald Eldon Wyatt (2 June 1933 ‚Äì August 4, 1999) was an adventurer noted for advocating the Durupƒ±nar site as the site of Noah's Ark, along with almost 100 other Bible-related alleged discoveries. He has been criticized by scientists, historians, biblical scholars, as well as some creationists. ==Biography== Wyatt was working as a nurse anesthetist in a hospital in Madison, Tennessee, when in 1960, he saw a picture in Life of the Durupƒ±nar site, a boat-like shape on a mountain near Mount Ararat. The resulting widespread speculation in evangelical Christian circles that this might be Noah's Ark started Wyatt on his career as an amateur archaeologist. From 1977 until his death in 1999 he made over one hundred trips to the Middle East, his interests widening to take in a wide variety of references from the Old and New Testaments. The Durupƒ±nar site in 2007 By the time of his death in 1999, Wyatt claimed to have discovered several sites and artifacts related to the Bible and biblical archaeology. Wyatt was not considered credible by professional archaeologists and biblical scholars. The Garden Tomb Association of Jerusalem state in a letter they issue to visitors on request: > The Council of the Garden Tomb Association (London) totally refute the claim > of Wyatt to have discovered the original Ark of the Covenant or any other > biblical artifacts within the boundaries of the area known as the Garden > Tomb Jerusalem. Though Wyatt was allowed to dig within this privately owned > garden on a number of occasions (the last occasion being the summer of 1991) > staff members of the Association observed his progress and entered his > excavated shaft.

In order to excavate one must have at least a BA in archaeology which he does not possess despite his claims to the contrary. ... [His claims] fall into the category of trash which one finds in tabloids such as the National Enquirer, Sun etc.\\"Letter from Joe Zias Joe Zias did not indicate where Ron Wyatt had ever claimed to have a BA in archaeology. Wyatt's official organization, Wyatt Archaeological Research (WAR), claims that the IAA have always been aware of the excavations and issued \\"verbal permits\\" for most of them and official permits to all WAR excavations since 2002. Nevertheless, the only evidence of WAR involvement in a legitimate excavation sanctioned by the IAA relates to WAR part-funding of a 2005 dig. Evangelicals have also been critical of Wyatt's claims: Answers in Genesis called Wyatt's claims \\"fraudulent\\", and David Merling, a Seventh-day Adventist professor of archaeology addressed the issues of Wyatt's Noah's Ark and anchor stones with the following: > While the Durupinar site is about the right length for Noah's ark, [it is] > ... too wide to be Noah's ark. Wyatt has claimed that the \\"boat-shapedness\\" > of this formation can only be explained by its being Noah's ark, but both > Shea and Morris have offered other plausible explanations. Likewise, Wyatt > has argued that the standing stones he has found are anchors, while Terian > is aware of similar stones outside the Durupinar site area that were pagan > cultic stones later converted by Christians for Christian purposes. == Death == Wyatt died on August 4, 1999, aged 66, in Baptist Central Hospital in Memphis, Tennessee, following cancer. His interment was in Columbia's Polk Memorial Park Cemetery. Following Wyatt's death, a split developed between the official Wyatt Archaeological Research (WAR) organization, which he founded, and the independent ministries and interested individuals that had previously cooperated with WAR. WAR claims to be the sole owner of all Wyatt's photographs, newsletters and other intellectual property. Other individuals who had known and worked with Wyatt established independent ministries and websites with the purpose of promoting Wyatt's discoveries outside the framework set by WAR. ==See also== * David Fasold * Mount Judi * Mountains of Ararat * In Search of Noah's Ark * Searches for Noah's Ark ==References * Covenant Keepers * Category:1933 births Category:1999 deaths Category:Amateur archaeologists Category:American Seventh-day Adventists Category:Historical theories and materials on the Exodus ","title":"Ron Wyatt"},{"id":"2225227","text":"Tecmo Baseball is a baseball video game developed by Tecmo for the Nintendo Entertainment System.

It was separated from the pale clouded yellow, C. hyale, in 1905. Berger's clouded yellow is a Palearctic species (South and Central Europe, South Russia, Russian Far East, Siberia Central Asia and temperate China also Asia Minor, Caucasus and Transcaucasia. Specimen ==Description== The wings of the male have a yellow ground colour, the females have a greenish-white ground colour, only the underside of the hind wings is yellowish. The upper wing side of both sexes has a dusted dark brown to black marginal band, which is only narrow on the hind wings. In the cell of the forewings there is a black spot on the upper and lower sides. The males have on the upperside of the hind wings in the cell an orange spot with a red border, on the underside this spot is bright and clearly outlined in red. This spot may be divided into two by the red border, so that it resembles an eight similar to Colias hyale and other yellow members of the genus Colias. In the females, the orange spot on the top of the hind wings is not bordered. The caterpillars , on the other hand, clearly differ from the caterpillars of Colias hyale after the second moult. Both caterpillars are green, however, the caterpillar of Colias alfacariensis has four eye-catching yellow lines with black dots while the caterpillar of the Colias hyale has only two thin side lines. Similar species *Colias hyale Colias alfacariensis together with Colias hyale forms a kind of complex. Since the butterflies of both species develop many variations, the two species cannot be differentiated by morphology or on the basis of a genitalic examination .

Tourism is popular in this rural area which is an agricultural region with a emphasis on wine grapes. For statistical purposes, the United States Census Bureau has defined Los Olivos as a census-designated place (CDP). The population was 1,132 at the 2010 census. The ZIP Code is 93441, and the community is within the area code 805. ==History== Sometime around 1880, on a bluff overlooking Alamo Pintado Creek, just north of the town of Ballard, a two-story house was built, with a wide, covered front porch and neatly symmetrical arched windows in the center gable, situated on prime farmland. It became the property of twenty-two-year-old Alden March Boyd, of Albany, New York, when he paid $8,000 for \\"157 acres, more or less, together with the dwelling house,\\" in 1885. He planted five thousand olive trees, and called it Rancho De Los Olivos. The 1880s were a boom time for California. On November 16, 1887, the Pacific Coast Railway line extension from Los Alamos was completed. The developers of the narrow-gauge railway first named their town El Olivar, then El Olivos, and finally Los Olivos, after Boyd's nearby ranch. Los Olivos was connected by the narrow gauge railroad to points north as far as San Luis Obispo until the train made its last run in 1934. The southern terminus of the railroad was in front of Mattei's Tavern, where a stagecoach line continued over San Marcos Pass into Santa Barbara. ==Geography== Los Olivos is one of five communities (with Ballard, Buellton, Solvang, and Santa Ynez) that make up the Santa Ynez Valley. The census definition of the area was created by the Census Bureau for statistical purposes and may not precisely correspond to local understanding of the area with the same name. The town is near SR 154, a scenic road from Santa Barbara over San Marcos Pass, through the coastal Santa Ynez Mountains. ===Climate=== Under the K√∂ppen Climate Classification, \\"dry-summer subtropical\\" climates are often referred to as \\"Mediterranean\\".

Winters are mild and wet with the majority of the yearly precipitation (nearly 80%) falling from December through March. ==Economy and tourism== Los Olivos is known for its wineries and tasting rooms. Starting in Los Olivos and stretching north is the Foxen Canyon Wine Trail. There are a number of large thoroughbred horse ranches in the area. Mattei's Tavern, a former stagecoach stop, is a restaurant. ==In popular culture== In May 1986, Los Olivos was used as the location setting for the fictional town of \\"Mayberry\\" in the made-for-TV movie Return to Mayberry, based on the popular 1960s sitcom The Andy Griffith Show. Several locations in Los Olivos were featured in the 2004 movie Sideways. The Los Olivos Grand Hotel, built in 1985, is now Fess Parker's Wine Country Inn, owned by the family of former Daniel Boone and Davy Crockett star Fess Parker (1924‚Äì2010). Parker and his wine were featured on the NBC daytime drama Santa Barbara (first episode of Season Two) of James May and Oz Clarke's Big Wine Adventure.

In 1977, the Club changed its name to Sydney Olympic and became a founding member of the Phillips Soccer League, later named the National Soccer League (NSL), the inaugural national football league of Australia, remaining a member of the competition until its demise in 2004. Sydney Olympic have won many trophies in Australian football, including two NSL Championships, two NSL Cups, the NSL Minor Premiership and three NSW Premier League Championships. The club has also won the Johnny Warren Cup, the Brett Emerton Cup, the National Youth League Championship, the National Youth League Minor Premiership and the NSW Premier League Club Championship. Sydney Olympic has traditionally been one of the most well supported football teams in Australia, setting numerous domestic crowd attendances. A crowd of 18,985 attended Sydney Olympic's victory over Northern Spirit in 1998 at North Sydney Oval, a record crowd attendance between two clubs during the regular season of the NSL, defeating the previous record of 18,367 set when Newcastle KB United played Sydney Olympic in 1979 at Marathon Stadium. The greatest crowd attendance for a Grand Final was recorded during the 2001/02 season when 42,735 people were present at Subiaco Oval to see Sydney Olympic defeat Perth Glory. ==1957: Pan- Hellenic - The Beginnings== Established in Sydney by Greek immigrants in 1957, Sydney Olympic Football Club has been and continues to be a major pillar and a leading contributor to football in Australia as well as a nursery to many of its finest talents. In the late 1940s and 50s there were several small Greek teams for the purposes of socialising and giving a sense of home for the newly arrived migrants. These teams included; Taxiarchis, Atlas, Astro, Pansamiakos as well as several others. Many people wondered about uniting all of these smaller teams to establish 1 strong Greek team in order to participate in the NSW Soccer Federation. The founding date of the Club is set as 28 November 1957, as this was the first meeting of Club Founder Christos Giannakoulias with several other influential protagonists at his home. It was decided there, that the newly formed team would be known as Pan-Hellenic, as it represented the shared journeys of Greeks from all over the world who migrated to Sydney and not just from Greece and Cyprus, but also from various other places like; Egypt, Romania, Albania, Yugoslavia, Bulgaria, Anatolia and Asia Minor The club was established as Pan-Hellenic Soccer Club and its initial strip was blue and white vertical stripes. ==1958-60: NSW 2nd Division== In its first season in 1958, Pan-Hellenic found itself in the NSW 2nd Division, which at the time was split into 2 groups - Western & Eastern - After topping its group, Pan-Hellenic faced off with Budapest, who had topped the other group in the Grand Final, which Pan-Hellenic won 3-1. This still was not good enough for promotion and Pan-Hellenic was forced to play a separate play-off with Budapest for promotion. The initial match ended 1-1 and a replay was ordered a few days later, which Budapest won 4-0. For season 1959, the Federation did away with a Finals Series and promotion playoffs, instead awarding promotion to the club which topped the competition table after the 26 rounds. Pan- Hellenic would miss out again on promotion, as it finished runner-up to Neerlandia. In 1960 and in what would become a tradition in Australian Football, the format was changed yet again. A Finals Series would be played this season, Pan-Hellenic reached the Grand Final again, but would go on and lose to Polonia 2-1. But this time, the team which would end up atop the competition ladder was crowned the Champions and would be promoted, fortunately for Pan-Hellenic, they finished top of the ladder 1 point ahead of Polonia, were crowned Champions and finally earned promotion to the NSW 1st Division for 1961. ==1960s: NSW 1st Division== In its first season in the NSW 1st Division in 1961, the club would finish in the top 4 finishing 4th, a fantastic achievement. In the Finals Series Pan-Hellenic lost its Semi-Final to Hakoah 1-0. 1962 saw Pan-Hellenic finish in 7th place, before rebounding in 1963 to once again make the top 4, finishing 4th once again and qualified for the Finals Series. South Coast United delivered a heavy blow in the Semi- Final, dishing out a 7-1 loss to Pan-Hellenic. In 1964 Pan-Hellenic finished 6th. While in 1965 the club endured a difficult League campaign, coming within a whisker of being relegated, finishing 2nd last and having to endure the 3 relegation playoff ties. The first 2 ended in draws (0-0 and 1-1) against Polonia, the 3rd match was a 5-4 thriller to Pan-Hellenic, a victory which preserved its 1st Division status. This was in total contrast with Pan- Hellenic's Cup form, which saw them go on a run all the way to the Final, only to lose 3-1 to Hakoah. For season 1966, Pan-Hellenic finished in 5th spot. The club would return to Finals Football once again in 1967 finishing in 4th, but would once again fail to progress in the Finals Series. 1967 also saw Pan- Hellenic go on a great run in the inaugural National Club Knock-Out competition the - Australia Cup - falling one game short of the Final, as it lost to APIA Leichhardt 3-2 after extra-time in the Semi-Final. The 1968 season though, was the highlight of the pre-National Soccer League era, 11 years after the club's foundation, Pan-Hellenic finished 2nd in the standings and reached the NSW First Division Grand Final for the first time. Pan- Hellenic would unfortunately lose 4‚Äì2 to bitter rivals Hakoah in front of a crowd of 22,111 at the Sydney Sports Ground. In 1969 Pan-Hellenic would have to settle for a mid-table 6th-placed finish. The club also experienced another great Cup run making it to the Final once again in 1969, a Final it would ultimately lose 3-2 to Prague. ==1970s== After some lean seasons: 1970 (8th), 1971 (10th), 1972 (7th), 1973 (9th) 1974 saw a marked improvement in the team under Socceroos coach Rale Rasic. Pan-Hellenic just missed out on the top 4 to finish in 5th spot. 1975 did see Pan-Hellenic once again make the top 4, finishing in 3rd place. In the Finals Series Pan-Hellenic dispatched Auburn 2-1 in the Semi-Final to make it through to the Preliminary Final, which the club went on to lose 1‚Äì0 after extra-time to APIA Leichhardt, in a tight and tense affair. In its final season in the NSW State League for the time being and its last season under the name Pan-Hellenic in 1976, the club just missed out on a Finals spot, ending up in 5th place. ==1977: Sydney Olympic & the NSL== For 1977 the club became a pioneering founding member of the National Soccer League, and also changed its name to Sydney Olympic. Sydney Olympic had a tough initiation into National League Football in 1977, finishing 3rd last. 1978 saw a vast improvement from Sydney Olympic as it finished in a much- improved and respectable mid-table position. In 1979 Sydney Olympic endured another difficult campaign, finishing in 2nd last place. The Federation at the time, then made the decision to \\"cut back\\" on teams from NSW and being the last placed NSW team, beating only South Melbourne who had finished last, Sydney Olympic was controversially relegated. ==1980s== The spell back in the NSW First Division competition for the club did not last long, with Sydney Olympic defeating the Parramatta Eagles 4‚Äì0 in the 1980 NSW Grand Final to win the NSW First Division. That victory secured Sydney Olympic a return to top- flight Australian football in 1981 where it remained until the NSL folded in 2004. The 1980s for Sydney Olympic were characterized with great football, large and passionate support, fantastic players, unfathomable highs as well as a litany of failures. Seasons 1981 and 1982 were a period of stabilisation for the club, as it settled back into the National Soccer League. Sydney Olympic finished both seasons in the safety of mid-table security. During this period many young players and future legends of the club would be given their opportunity to make their mark for Sydney Olympic. The mid-1980s are generally referred to as a Golden Era for Sydney Olympic. It was exciting times and the club was on a high, huge crowds flocked and followed the club wherever they were playing, and on the park the team was playing magnificent football and in later years would be labelled as one of the best club sides in Australian football history. Between 1983 and 1986 Sydney Olympic played in 4 consecutive National Finals. Beating Heidelberg United in the 1983 NSL Cup Final and beating Preston Lions in the 1985 NSL Cup Final. Sydney Olympic also made it to the NSL Grand Finals of 1984 and 1986, losing to South Melbourne FC and Adelaide City respectively. After this period, there was an exodus of players at Sydney Olympic meaning the team almost had to be re-built, as only a few players would remain. It showed as the club dropped back to a mid-table finish for season 1987. Sydney Olympic bounced back in season 1988 to finish 5th and qualify for the Finals Series once again. Though disappointingly, they would go on to lose that Semi-Final 3-1 to the Marconi Stallions. 1989 would prove to be a bitter-sweet end to the decade for Sydney Olympic. The club climbed the ladder and enjoyed a great season, finishing 3rd and once again qualifying for the Finals. A Semi-Final victory over Melbourne Knights was followed by a Preliminary Final victory over St George FC, meaning Sydney Olympic found themselves in their 3rd NSL Grand Final in 6 years. But it would not be 3rd time lucky for the Blues, as they succumbed to an injury-time winner in the Grand Final to lose 1-0 to Marconi in front of 23,387 fans at the Parramatta Stadium. 1989 also saw another great NSL Cup run for Sydney Olympic, reaching another Final. But the club could not make up for their Grand Final loss & lost the 1989 NSL Cup Final 2-0 to Adelaide City. ==1990s== The 1990s began on the right foot for the club as it sneaked into that year's NSL Finals Series in 5th. A year after Sydney Olympic's 1989 NSL Grand Final loss against Marconi, 1990 saw Sydney Olympic meet Marconi once again in the Grand Final. This time it would be Olympic's day as they exacted revenge by beating Marconi 2‚Äì0, before a then record NSL crowd of 26,353. Scorers that day were Alistair Edwards and Robert Ironside either side of half-time. 1990 also saw Sydney Olympic reach another NSL Cup Final, their 4th in 8 years, unfortunately going down to South Melbourne. In defense of their title in season 1990/91, Sydney Olympic endured an inconsistent season, which came down to the last match of the regular season in what became a pre-Finals Series playoff against 6th placed Parramatta Melita. Sitting in 5th, a draw would have been enough for Olympic to finish in the top 5 and qualify for the Finals, but a late Parramatta goal ensured Olympic would succumb to a 1‚Äì0 loss and were leapfrogged into the top 5 by Parramatta FC. Sydney Olympic surged once again in season 1991/92, missing out on the Minor Premiership by 1 point. Things were looking promising heading into that season's Finals Series, but it was not to be as Olympic were disappointingly bundled out of the Finals. The next few seasons were inconsistent for Olympic. 1992/93 (9th), 1993/94 (6th), 1994/95 (9th). For season 1995/96, Sydney Olympic formed a prosperous partnership with the University of Technology Sydney (UTS) and became known as UTS Sydney Olympic. During that time, the Club's home ground was Leichhardt Oval, 1995/96 also saw Olympic finish 3rd on the ladder 1 point behind eventual Minor Premiers and old foes Marconi. Qualifying for the Finals Series again, Olympic were eventually eliminated by Adelaide City. A change of home ground awaited the Blues going into season 1996/97. Belmore Sports Ground, in the more traditional heartland of Olympic, became the Club's new home. In April 1997, Sydney Olympic enjoyed a record home attendance in the NSL at Belmore, of 16,724 against Marconi. Sydney Olympic missed out on Finals Football ending the season in 9th. Season 1997/98 also saw the club's worst ever defeat in January 1998, when the Canberra Cosmos inflicted an 8‚Äì1 loss on Sydney Olympic in the nation's capital. This season saw Olympic finish 9th. During season 1998/99 Sydney Olympic was involved in a match which attracted the largest crowd for any regular NSL season match excluding finals. That game was against the Northern Spirit at North Sydney Oval in what was the Spirit's debut match in the NSL. That evening, 18,985 soccer-loving enthusiasts turned out to watch Sydney Olympic defeat new boys Northern Spirit 2‚Äì0. Olympic golden boys Chris Kalantzis and Pablo Cardozo were the goal scorers. The season saw Olympic finish 7th, missing the Finals ==2000‚Äì2004== The 2000s saw Olympic's fortunes take an upturn. 1999/2000 saw their biggest ever NSL win, a 6‚Äì0 defeat of South Melbourne in January 2000 at Belmore Sports Ground. The club would again make the Finals that season, finishing in 5th place. During the Finals Series Sydney Olympic beat Adelaide City over 2 legs, but would go on to lose to Carlton SC in extra-time, for a spot in the Preliminary Final. In season 2000/01, Sydney Olympic finished 4th on the competition ladder. In the Finals Series, Olympic eliminated Marconi and then Melbourne Knights to make it through to the Preliminary Final, a match they lost 2‚Äì0 to the Minor Premiers South Melbourne. Season 2001/02 saw the club move base again, this time to the Sutherland Shire in Sydney's south, an area with no NSL representation, but a large base of registered junior players to potentially tap into. Olympic played out of Toyota Park. The move had also involved a change of name from Sydney Olympic to Olympic Sharks with the traditional blue and white colours of the club still in place. This season also saw Olympic capture their 2nd NSL Championship, a lone Ante Milicic goal early in the second-half, being enough to defeat Perth Glory at Subiaco Oval in front of 42,735 fans. The 2002/03 season saw Sydney Olympic win its first ever Minor Premiership by finishing on top of the NSL ladder, which eventually led to Olympic's second consecutive appearance in the NSL Grand Final. This time however, it would be the Perth Glory who would take out the title, winning 2‚Äì0 in Perth, in front of 38,111 fans. Despite the on field successes, the move to the Sutherland Shire was short-lived. Poor attendances took their toll on the venture and for season 2003/04 the club chose to revert to the widely preferred name of Sydney Olympic and moving to OKI Jubilee Stadium at Kogarah. ==2004‚Äì2009: Back to the State Leagues== Following the demise of the NSL in 2004, Sydney Olympic participated in the 2004/05 NSW Premier League season and just missed out on the Finals Series. In 2006 Sydney Olympic returned to Belmore Sports Ground where the club had a mid-table finish of 6th. 2007 was a special year for Sydney Olympic as it celebrated the 50th anniversary of its founding, with the club's jersey reverting to the original blue and white vertical striped design. On the field it would turn out to be a forgettable year for the club, as it ended the season in 9th spot. In the 2008 season under the stewardship of former player Milan Blagojevic, the club laid the platform for what would be a successful season by capturing the 2008 pre- season Johnny Warren Cup with a gutsy 2‚Äì1 win over the Sutherland Sharks. During the regular season, Sydney Olympic finished 3rd on the ladder, their best league finish since the 2002/03 NSL season. In the ensuing Finals Series Olympic were stopped 1 game short of that season's Grand Final losing in the Preliminary Final to Sutherland. The 2008 season also saw Olympic make the Waratah Cup Final, only to lose that Final. In season 2009, Sydney Olympic dropped back down the ladder, ending the season in a disappointing 8th spot. ==2010s== The new decade would start off in a miserable way. Season 2010 saw Sydney Olympic equal their worst ever league finish, ending the season in 2nd last spot. In 2011, Sydney Olympic with a new coaching staff and many new players finished in 1st place, four points clear of Sydney rivals Sydney United FC to claim the Minor Premiership. In the Finals Series Olympic beat Sydney United 2‚Äì0 in the Semi-Final and beat them again by the same score-line in the Grand Final, in front of 10,000+ fans at Belmore Sports Ground and went on to become NSW Champions again. 2012 saw Sydney Olympic finish 2nd in the NSW Premier League, but were bundled out of the Finals Series in straight sets and in 2013 Sydney Olympic finished a disappointing 7th. In 2014, former Greek international centre-back Sotirios Kyrgiakos signed for the club. Kyrgiakos stated in the press conference; \\"It's a beautiful thing for me to come to Sydney & play football in Australia. I wanted to have this experience and this opportunity was available for a handful of games, which was the proposal from the club. I will be thrilled to get to know Australian football and experience it and it's very significant that I'm coming to a very historic club with great Greek support\\". Sydney Olympic finished the regular season in 4th, before embarking on an amazing Finals run. Winning 3 sudden death matches in succession to make it to the NSW Grand Final, only to lose 2‚Äì1 to Blacktown City after extra-time. In 2014 Sydney Olympic also made it to the FFA Cup Round of 16 only to be defeated 2‚Äì1 by Bentleigh Greens after a compressed end of year schedule eventually took its toll on the team. In 2015 Sydney Olympic finished 4th in the regular season again after a great end to the regular season, which saw the team win 5 straight matches. After a convincing 2‚Äì0 victory in the first week of the Finals against Wollongong Wolves, the team set up a Semi-Final showdown against old rivals APIA Leichhardt, who took a 1‚Äì0 lead via a deflection. Sydney Olympic couldn't capitalise on a string of great chances in the second half to equalise, seeing the team eliminated 1‚Äì0. In 2015 Sydney Olympic again made it to the Round of 16 stage of the FFA Cup, but were disappointingly eliminated following a 3‚Äì1 loss to Hume City FC. For 2016, Sydney Olympic endured an up and down season where it finished the season in 6th spot. In 2017, Sydney Olympic reached the Finals again, but were knocked out by Manly United in the first week. The club was also knocked out of the Cup in the early rounds in both 2016 and 2017. In 2018, Sydney Olympic returned to winning ways. First clinching the Minor Premiership in a nail- biting last day of the season by leap-frogging old rivals APIA Leichhardt to finish top. This was added to by winning the Grand Final 3-1 and being crowned Champions, also against APIA Leichhardt. In 2019, Sydney Olympic experienced an up and down season trying to defend their title from the previous season. Finishing the season 6th, they missed the Finals. They were also knocked out of the Cup in the early rounds. ==2020s== Due to the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, the 2020 season was suspended in April after 3 Rounds. The competition only resumed after a 4 month hiatus and returned in August, as a shortened 11-round season, with the club finishing in 4th position. Both the State and National Cup competitions were cancelled. ==PlayersCurrent squad=== Updated October 11, 2018 ===Notable Internationals=== Australia *Terry Antonis *Andy Bernal *Milan Blagojevic *Roy Blitz *Clint Bolton *Tim Cahill *Nick Carle *Pablo Cardozo *Jason Culina *John Doyle *Alistair Edwards *Brett Emerton *Rodolfo Gnavi *Troy Halpin *Dave Harding *Robert Hooker *Graham Jennings *Ante Juric *Chris Kalantzis *John Karaspyros *Peter Katholos *John Kosmina *Mark Koussas *Massimo Luongo *Garry Manuel *Ante Milicic *Dave Mitchell *Jade North *Scott Ollerenshaw *Jim Patikas *Dimitri Petratos *Jason Polak *Tom Pondeljak *Peter Raskopoulos *Abbas Saad *Marshall Soper *Tony Spyridakos *Kimon Taliadoros *Kris Trajanovski *Alan Westwater *Lindsay Wilson *Ned Zelic Greece *Sotirios Kyrgiakos *Takis Loukanidis Lebanon *Yahya El Hindi Liberia *Mass Sarr Jr. New Zealand *Andrew Durante *Clint Gosling *Kevin Hagan *Ricki Herbert *Robert Ironside *Michael McGarry *Glen Moss *Chris Zoricich Philippines *Iain Ramsay Scotland *David Provan Uruguay *Vicente Estavillo Wales *Ian Rush Netherlands *Wim van der Gaag ==Club officials== Directors * President: Bill Papas * Secretary and Legal Counsel: Francis Farmakidis * Directors: Bill Papas, Francis Farmikidis, and Damon Hanlin Management * CEO: John Boulous * Head Coach: Ante Juric * Under 20s Coach: Kerim Baba * Under 18s Coach: Jim Patikas * Women's First Grade Coach: George Beltsos * Women's Reserve Grade Coach: Arthur Beltsos ==Former coaches== * John Phillips * Julius Polgar * Walter Tamandl * Bill Vrolyks * Joe Vlasits * George Yangou * Takis Loukanidis * John Kalogeras * Rale Rasic * Raul Blanco * Bruce Stowell * Tommy Anderson * Joe Marston * Jimmy Adam * Tommy Docherty * Manfred Schaefer * Eddie Thomson * Mick Hickman * Peter Raskopoulos * Bertie Mariani * Vicente Estavillo * Tom Sermanni * David Ratcliffe * Geoff Harcombe * Dave Mitchell * Branko Culina * Gary Phillips * Lee Sterrey * Peter Papanikitas * Les Scheinflug * Chris Kalantzis * Milan Blagojevic * Aytek Genc * Nick Theodorakopoulos * Manny Spanoudakis * Andr√© Gumprecht * Steve O'Connor * Peter Tsekenis * Grant Lee * Jamie Monroy * Gorka Etxeberria * Abbas Saad ==Honours== *National Soccer League :Winners (2): 1990, 2002 :Runners Up (4): 1984, 1986, 1989, 2003 *National Soccer League Minor Premiership :Winners (1): 2003 :Runners Up (3): 1984, 1986, 1992 *Australia Cup/NSL Cup/FFA Cup :Winners (2): 1983, 1985 :Runners Up (2): 1989, 1990 :Semi-Finalists (2): 1967, 1995 *National Youth League :Winners (1): 1987 *NSW Premier League/NSW 1st Division :Winners (3): 1980, 2011, 2018 :Runners Up (2): 1968, 2014 *NSW Premier League/NSW 1st Division Minor Premiership :Winners (2): 2011, 2018 :Runners Up (3): 1968, 1980, 2012 *NSW Super League/NSW 2nd Division :Winners (2): 1958, 1960 :Runners Up (1): 1959 *NSW State/Federation/AMPOL/Waratah Cup :Winners (1): 1980 :Runners Up (4): 1965. 1969, 1994, 2008 *Johnny Warren Cup :Winners (1): 2008 ==Individual honours== *NSL Player of the Year Award :1982 ‚Äì Peter Katholos *NSL Top Goalscorer Award :1991/1992 ‚Äì Tim Bredbury :1998/1999 ‚Äì Pablo Cardozo *NSL Under 21 Player of the Year Award :1997/1998 ‚Äì Brett Emerton *NSW NPL Goalkeeper of the Year Award :2017 ‚Äì Paul Henderson :2018 ‚Äì Paul Henderson ==Hall of Fame== On 6 March 2018, Sydney Olympic announced their thirteenth Hall of Fame inductee. *Mark Bosnich *Nick Carle *Pablo Cardozo *Graham Jennings *Ante Juric *Chris Kalantzis * Peter Katholos *Grant Lee *Gary Meier *Les Murray *Jim Patikas *Abbas Saad *Peter Raskopoulos ==References * Sydney Olympic FC official website * SoccerAust * OZ Football Category:National Premier Leagues clubs Category:Greek-Australian culture in Sydney Category:National Soccer League (Australia) teams Category:New South Wales Premier League teams Category:Association football clubs established in 1957 Category:Diaspora sports clubs in Australia ","title":"Sydney Olympic FC"},{"id":"2225268","text":"thumbnail325px Incorporated cities and rural areas after the Greater Hamburg Act (1937): The Greater Hamburg Act (), in full the Law Regarding Greater Hamburg and Other Territorial Readjustments (), was passed by the government of Nazi Germany on 26 January 1937, and mandated the exchange of territories between Hamburg and the Free State of Prussia. It became effective on 1 April 1937.With the exception of paragraph 2 (unifying Hamburg to a single Gemeinde) which according to paragraph 15 had to be put into effect separately at a date determined by the minister of the interior no later than 1 April 1938, and with the exception of paragraph 10, which became effective immediately == Greater Hamburg == Hamburg lost most of its exclaves, including Geesthacht and Cuxhaven. In return, Hamburg was enlarged by including formerly Prussian towns like Altona, Wandsbek, and Harburg-Wilhelmsburg as well as a number of villages. Altona and Wandsbek had been part of the Prussian province of Schleswig-Holstein, while Harburg-Wilhelmsburg had been a part of the Prussian province of Hanover. This represented the formal merger of what had previously been referred to as the \\"Four-City Region\\". == L√ºbeck == Besides the regulations for Hamburg, the law incorporated most of the Free City of L√ºbeck into the Prussian province of Schleswig-Holstein, though some smaller villages were included in the State of Mecklenburg. This constituted a victory for the Gauleiter (regional party leader) of Schleswig-Holstein, who had competed with the neighbouring Gauleiter of Mecklenburg for control of the city ever since 1933. Until the Greater Hamburg Act, L√ºbeck had been a separate member state of the Reich. Two reasons for ending this status are cited: Adolf Hitler had a distaste for L√ºbeck ever since the city council forbade him to campaign there in 1932. Also, L√ºbeck formed part of the compensation given to Prussia for its losses to Hamburg. Besides L√ºbeck, Prussia also gained Hamburg's territories Geesthacht, which was also incorporated into the province of Schleswig- Holstein, and Ritzeb√ºttel (including Cuxhaven), which went to the Province of Hanover. == Notes and references  Further reading == * Dr William Boehart: \\"Das Gro√ü-Hamburg-Gesetz ‚Äî Ein R√ºckblick 70 Jahre danach\\".

David and his siblings were placed in an orphanage when he was four. From that time until 1972, when he escaped from legal custody, he spent his life in a number of orphanages, boys' homes and youth training centres. At the age of 11 David began committing various offences including larceny, making threats and offences of dishonesty. When he was 13, he was first diagnosed as having a personality disorder with psychopathic traits. David was subsequently admitted to psychiatric facilities on eight separate occasions between 1976 and 1984, and was variously diagnosed with antisocial,Dangerous offender legislation around the world borderline, histrionic and narcissistic personality disorders. It was during this time that he began self-mutilating to an extreme degree. Among other things, he swallowed razor blades, cut off parts of his ears and his left nipple, injured his genitals, hammered nails into his feet and swallowed corrosive liquids. ==Imprisonment== In 1982 David was sentenced to 14 years imprisonment for the attempted murder of three people, during a robbery-gone-wrong at a pizza restaurant in Rye, Victoria., The robbery appeared to be an attempt to draw police into a shootout. The pizza shop owner and one of the responding police officers were severely wounded in the incident, while David was wounded in the legs by police. A news crew spotted David fleeing the scene and he was arrested. Whilst imprisoned, David wrote many manuscripts, one titled Blueprint for Urban Warfare, which spoke of committing massacres upon his release from prison. The \\"Blueprint\\" listed 49 \\"combat situations\\", ranging from horror movie clich√©s (cigarette machines dispensing severed fingers, drink machines dispensing blood) to far more disturbing scenarios, such as the bombing of bridges and public buildings, the assassination of prominent politicians, the poisoning of water supplies and indiscriminate shooting in public places. David later claimed that he had been instructed to write his more graphic fantasies down as a form of therapy. He also manifested a great deal of hostility to the police force and prison system, resorting to violence and self-mutilation whenever his requests or demands were not met. In January 1990, David was declared mentally ill by government health department officials. The Mental Health Act 1986 entitled David the right to appeal, which he did in February and March 1990. In May 1990 the board found David was not mentally ill and recommended he be discharged as an involuntary patient. This was a consequence of the Board's assertion that a personality disorder is not a mental illness as per the Mental Health Act. ===Community Protection Act=== The Victorian Government faced the dilemma of respecting David's right to freedom and the protection of the community upon his release from prison. The government sought to keep David imprisoned indefinitely by introducing the Community Protection Act 1990.http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/journals/AJHR/1997/3.html That legislation gave Victorian Supreme Court judges the power to hold David in \\"preventative detention\\" for twelve months if the judge was convinced by evidence before them that David was still a risk to the community and likely to commit further offences if released from prison. David was an intelligent man, with significant literary, analytical and computer skills. But as he had a long history of responding to the most minor frustrations with violence, damage to property and self-harm, and refused on principle to co-operate with attempts to reduce such behaviours prior to his re-entry to society, the Supreme Court repeatedly applied the legislation to continue his confinement. David committed suicide by ingesting razor blades that led to peritonitis; he died on 11 June 1993.Greig, D. N. (2002) Neither Bad nor Mad : The Competing Discourses of Psychiatry, Law, and Politics, London: Jessica Kingsley Pub. At the time of his death aged 38, David was still a prisoner and had spent a total of 33 years in various institutions. ==Afterword== A similar act was passed by the Parliament of New South Wales in an attempt to enforce similar preventative detention against a named individual. This act was challenged in Kable v Director of Public Prosecutions (NSW) and overturned as unconstitutional. The song, ‚ÄúHe's On The Run‚Äù by Gene Bradley Fisk was written about David. ==See also == * List of Australian criminals ==References * Attorney General v David, Supreme Court of Victoria (PDF) Category:1954 births Category:1993 deaths Category:20th-century Australian criminals Category:Australian people who died in prison custody Category:Criminals from Melbourne Category:Criminals who committed suicide Category:Deaths from peritonitis Category:People with antisocial personality disorder Category:People with narcissistic personality disorder Category:Prisoners who died in Victoria (Australia) detention Category:Suicides in Victoria (Australia) Category:People with borderline personality disorder Category:People with histrionic personality disorder Category:People who committed suicide in prison custody ","title":"Garry David"},{"id":"2225298","text":"Killer is the fourth studio album by the Alice Cooper band, released in November 1971. The album reached number 21 on the Billboard 200 album chart, and the two singles \\"Under My Wheels\\" and \\"Be My Lover\\" made the Billboard Hot 100 chart. == Songs == Cooper said in the liner notes of A Fistful of Alice and In the Studio with Redbeard, which spotlighted the Killer and Love It to Death albums, that the song \\"Desperado\\" was written about his friend Jim Morrison, who died the year this album was released. According to an NPR radio interview with Alice Cooper, \\"Desperado\\" was written about Robert Vaughn's character from the movie The Magnificent Seven. \\"Halo of Flies\\" was, according to Cooper's liner notes in the compilation The Definitive Alice Cooper, an attempt by the band to prove that they could perform King Crimson-like progressive rock suites, and was supposedly about a SMERSH-like organisation. \\"Desperado\\", along with \\"Under My Wheels\\" and \\"Be My Lover\\" have appeared on different compilation albums by Cooper. The song \\"Dead Babies\\" stirred up some controversy following the album's release, despite the fact that its lyrics conveyed an \\"anti-child abuse\\" message. ==Reception Critical reception === Rolling Stone's Lester Bangs gave it a favorable review. He explained that \\"it brings all the elements of the band's approach to sound and texture to a totally integrated pinnacle that fulfills all the promise of their erratic first two albums\\" and that \\"each song on [the] album finds him in a different role in the endless movie he is projecting on them.\\" He concluded by calling Alice Cooper \\"a strong band, a vital band, and they are going to be around for a long, long time.\\" Robert Christgau rated the album a B-, stating that \\"a taste for the base usages of hard rock rarely comes with a hit attached these days, much less 'surreal', 'theatrical', and let us not forget 'transvestite' trappings\\". However, he said that \\"[the album] falters after 'Under My Wheels' and 'Be My Lover', neither of them an 'I'm Eighteen' in the human outreach department.\\" AllMusic's Greg Prato rated \\"Killer\\" four-and-a-half out of five stars. He stated that \\"disturbing tracks ... fit in perfectly\\" and that \\"other songs were even more exceptional\\". He concluded by pointing out that \\"it rewarded them as being among the most notorious and misunderstood entertainers, thoroughly despised by grownups.\\" === Charts === The album reached on the Billboard album chart and two singles made the Hot 100 chart. \\"Be My Lover\\" reached on the Billboard chart and \\"Under My Wheels\\" reached . ===Live performances=== Killer is the third-most-represented album in Alice Cooper‚Äôs concert setlists behind Welcome to My Nightmare and Billion Dollar Babies, accounting for 13.3 percent of the songs he has played live. Alongside Welcome to My Nightmare, it is one of only two Alice Cooper albums where every song has been played live, although ‚ÄúYeah, Yeah, Yeah‚Äù has never been played since the end of the supporting Killer Tour, while ‚ÄúYou Drive Me Nervous‚Äù was not played subsequent to the Killer Tour until 1999, and has never been performed since 2006. ‚ÄúDesperado‚Äù was performed only once prior to the Trash Tour in 1989, but has been frequently played live since. === Influence === Johnny Rotten of the Sex Pistols and Public Image Ltd called Killer the greatest rock album of all time.Lydon, John.

Its name comes from the Romans, who ate them as a delicacy. == Description == The edible dormouse is the largest of all dormice, being around in head-body length, plus an 11- to 13-cm-long tail. It normally weighs from , but may almost double in weight immediately prior to hibernation. It has a generally squirrel-like body, with small ears, short legs, and large feet. Its fur is grey to greyish-brown in colour over most of the body, while the underparts and the inner surface of legs are white to pale buff; the line of demarcation is rather well defined. Unlike most other dormice, they have no dark markings on the face, aside from faint rings around the eyes. The tail is long and bushy, with fur slightly darker than that on the body. Front feet have four digits and their hind feet have five. The soles of their feet are naked. Females have from four to six pairs of teats. The edible dormouse is capable of limited autotomy; if another animal grasps the tail, the skin breaks easily and slides off the underlying bone, allowing the dormouse to escape. The exposed vertebrae then break off and the wound heals over, forming a fresh brush of hair. == Distribution == The edible dormouse is found throughout much of mainland western Europe. It is also found on a number of Mediterranean islands, including Sardinia, Corsica, Sicily, and Crete. It is rather more sparsely distributed through central Europe and the Balkans, but can be found as far north-east as the upper Volga River. Close to the Volga River where small groups of the species are found at the Zhiguli Mountains, in Russia. They are also found in the Caucasus region, and along the southern coast of the Caspian Sea. Germany has a small population of edible dormice within its borders, ranging from two to six individuals per hectare. It is also found in scattered populations throughout Thrace, located on the southeastern tip of the European Balkan peninsula. In this region, two subspecies of the edible dormouse are found, G. g. glis and G. g. orientalis. Northern Anatolia has a different subspecies, G. g pindicus. Map showing approximate distribution of Glis glis in England A small, isolated population of Glis glis also exists in south-east England. At the turn of the 20th century, the British banker and zoologist Lionel Walter Rothschild kept Glis glis in his private collection in the town of Tring in Hertfordshire; in 1902 some of the animals escaped and reproduced, establishing themselves in the wild as an invasive species. Today, the British edible dormouse population is thought to be 10,000 strong, and Glis glis have been recorded in a radius of Tring, mostly concentrated to the south and east. The area of distribution has been described as triangle between Beaconsfield, Aylesbury, and Luton, around the southeast side of the Chiltern Hills.\\"The Glis glis Around Amersham .\\" Amersham ‚Äì News, Views and Information. 3 October 2007 == Ecology and habitat == Edible dormice inhabit deciduous forests dominated by oak and beech, from sea level to the upper limits of such forests at . They prefer dense forests with rocky cliffs and caves, but may be found in maquis vegetation, orchards, and urban margins. They have frequently been reported from caves as deep as , where they can shelter from predators. Population densities range from two to 22 individuals per hectare. Females inhabit only very small home ranges, of , but males occupy much larger ranges of , with several burrows. Edible dormice are primarily herbivorous, feeding mainly on berries, apples, and nuts. However, they are adaptable, and have also been reported to eat bark, leaves, flowers, invertebrates, and even eggs. Beech mast, which is rich in energy and protein, is an excellent source of food for young and lactating females. Some dormice are found to have hair and ectoparasite remains in their stomachs, but this is mainly due to accidental ingestion during grooming. Edible dormice also consume large numbers of beech tree seeds. A single, large, seeding tree within the home range of a dormouse can produce enough resources to support the energy requirements of reproduction. The location and age of a beech tree helps dictate where a population of dormice live, since older trees produce more seeds. == Behaviour == An edible dormouse. 19th century illustration of Myoxus glis from Iconographia Zoologica Edible dormice are nocturnal, spending the day in nests taken from birds, or located in hollow trees or similar shelter. They are good climbers, and spend most of their time in the trees, although they are relatively poor jumpers. The dormouse uses sticky secretions of plantar glands when they are climbing on smooth surfaces to prevent them from falling. They generally stay in the forest and avoid open areas to any extent. They are not generally social animals, although small groups of closely related adults have occasionally been reported. Many edible dormice mothers form communal nesting areas where they care for their young together. Communication is partly by sound, with the animals making various squeaks or snuffling sounds, and partly by scent. They leave scent trails from scent glands on their feet, as well as glands at the top of their tails by the anus. They rub their anal region on the ground and places they walk, so traces of the secretion will be left for other dormice, especially during periods of sexual activity. Edible dormice are active during a six-month period and go into hibernation from roughly October to May, depending on local climatic conditions. They are mostly active in the summer and are active on average 202 min in a 24-hour day, mostly at night. They prepare a den in soft soil or hidden in a cave, and rely on fat reserves to survive through the winter. During hibernation, metabolic rate and body temperature fall dramatically, and the animal may cease breathing altogether for periods up to an hour. In years with low food availability edible dormice can hibernate longer than 11 months. In the wild, most edible dormice hibernate for three winters, and then die in the fourth while hibernating, when their cheek teeth are worn out to a degree that prevents normal mastication of food. Their primary predators include owls, foxes, pine martens, and wildcats. == Reproduction == The breeding season is from late June to mid August, but both male and female dormice do not produce every year. Variation in food resources strongly influences reproduction because reproduction is tightly linked to the availability of energy-rich seeds. Therefore, edible dormice breed during the phase of high food availability. Females are able to produce additional young if amino acid- rich foods like inflorescences, unripe seeds, and (or) larval insects, which also increase their numbers by eating the same enriched plant food, are available. An abundance of energy-rich seeds allows newborn dormice to increase their body fat to prepare for their first hibernation. Females reach sexual maturity at 351‚Äì380 days old and males significantly lower their body mass during mating season. Males are not territorial, and may visit the territories of several nearby females to mate, becoming aggressive to any other males they encounter. The male attracts a female by squeaking, then conducts a circular courtship dance before mounting her. During mating season, males lower their body mass and use their body fat reserves to help fuel the energetic costs of reproduction. Gestation lasts from 20‚Äì31 days, and results in the birth of up to 11 young, although four or five are more typical. They develop their fur by 16 days, and open their eyes after around 3 weeks. They begin to leave the nest after around 30 days, and are sexually mature by the time they complete their second hibernation. Compared with similarly sized mammals, they have an unusually long lifespan, and have been reported to live up to 12 years in the wild. The breeding habits of the edible dormouse have been cited as a possible cause of its unusual pattern of telomere lengthening with age. In humans and other animals, telomeres almost always shorten with age. == Evolution == Although the edible dormouse is the only living member of its genus, a number of fossil species are also known. The genus Glis first originated in the middle Oligocene, although it did not become common until the Pliocene. By the Pleistocene, only one species, G. sackdillingensis, is known to have survived, and this is likely the ancestor of the modern species, which first appeared in the early to mid-Pleistocene. Edible dormice that have been isolated on oceanic islands are a prime example of insular gigantism, in which small animals in isolated locations become larger over the course of many generations. Although it is not known why, the number of teats on a female edible dormouse varies across regions of Europe. For example, those in Italy have two to seven, while those in Lithuania have three to six. == Interaction with humans  As a pest === A house in Tring, Hertfordshire, England, damaged by a fire attributed to Glis glis in 2015 Glis glis have adapted well to the presence of humans and now frequently hibernate in insulated attics and even dark shelves in cupboards, particularly if soft materials are on the shelf to make a nest. In this situation, they are generally regarded as a pest due to the fire risk from gnawed electrical cables and fouling from their faeces. Instances of house fire have been attributed to electrical fires caused by wires chewed by Glis glis. Despite being regarded as a pest in the United Kingdom, the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981 prohibits certain methods of killing dormice. This is because the Gliridae family of rodents is protected internationally under the Berne Convention on the Conservation of European Wildlife and Natural Habitats, to which the United Kingdom is a signatory. Removing edible dormice from a property may only be carried out by a qualified pest controller licensed by Natural England using spring traps. The animals must then be humanely destroyed after capture. When present in large numbers, edible dormice may cause damage to orchards and be considered pests. === As food === right The edible dormouse was farmed and eaten by the ancient Romans, the Gauls, and the Etruscans (usually as a snack), hence the word edible in its name. The Romans would catch dormice from the wild in autumn when they were fattest. The dormice were kept and raised either in large pits or (in less spacious urban surroundings) in terra cotta containers, the gliraria, something like contemporary hamster cages. They fed these captive dormice walnuts, chestnuts, and acorns for fattening. The dormice were served by either roasting them and dipping them in honey or stuffing them with a mixture of pork, pine nuts, and other flavorings. It was, however, very important to upper-class Romans that the dormice be separated from other products of the hunt, like the large game, for presentation purposes. Wild edible dormice are still consumed in Slovenia, as well as in Croatia. In Slovenia they are considered a rare delicacy and dormouse trapping is a tradition. Slovenians use several methods of trapping. The first used were the hollow-tree trapping method and the flat-stone trapping method. By the 17th century, the peasant trappers had invented the first self-triggering traps, usually made of different kinds of wood. In the 19th century, traps made from iron and steel were introduced. The trappers used many different types of bait to entice the dormice, ranging from pieces of fruit to bacon soaked in brandy. During the prime season, trappers could catch between 200 and 400 dormice, depending largely on what kind of trap they were using. Seasonal dormice feasts were welcome protein supplements for the impoverished peasantry. The people of Slovenia did not just catch the dormice for their meat: use of dormice for food and fur and of dormouse fat as an ointment is documented there since the 13th century. == References  External links == *The Dormouse Hollow Category:Mammals described in 1766 Category:Dormice Category:Mammals of Azerbaijan Category:Mammals of the Middle East Category:Mammals of Russia Category:Mammals of Turkey Category:Mammals of Central Asia Category:Meat by animal Category:Rodents of Europe Category:Roman cuisine Category:Articles containing video clips Category:Taxa named by Carl Linnaeus ","title":"Edible dormouse"},{"id":"2225301","text":"The short-tailed blue or tailed Cupid (Cupido argiades) Cupido argiades, funet.fi is a butterfly that forms part of the family Lycaenidae.

The larva is yellow green with darker lines and has fine hairs and dark brown spiracles.Kimmo Silvonen Larvae of North- European Lepidoptera The pupa is olive green and attached to the food plant with a silk girdle. ==Biology== This species has one brood each year. It overwinters as a young larva. Adults fly from May to August. Caterpillars mainly feed on Red Clover (Trifolium pratense) and other species of Trifolium (Trifolium medium, Trifolium spadiceum), on Vicia cracca, Anthyllis, Genista and Melilotus.Paolo Mazzei, Daniel Morel, Raniero Panfili Moths and Butterflies of Europe and North Africa ==Gallery== Polyommatus semiargus 04 - female (HS).jpgFemale File:Avene fg04.JPGMating pair File:Lycaenidae sp.jpgA group ==Bibliography== *D.J.

This system has a combined apparent visual magnitude of +2.88, making it one of the brighter members of the constellation. Based upon parallax measurements made during the Hipparcos mission, the distance to Sigma Scorpii is roughly 696 light-years (214 parsecs). North et al. (2007) computed a more accurate estimate of light years ( parsecs). The system consists of a spectroscopic binary with components designated Sigma Scorpii Aa1 (officially named Alniyat , the traditional name for the entire star system){{cite web  url=https://www.iau.org/public/themes/naming_stars/  title=Naming Stars publisher=IAU.org accessdate=16 December 2017) and a Beta Cephei variable) and Aa2; a third component (designated Sigma Scorpii Ab) at 0.4 arcseconds from the spectroscopic pair, and a fourth component (Sigma Scorpii B) at about 20 arcseconds. == Nomenclature == The red at bottom right is light from Sigma Scorpii being reflected off the surrounding dust. œÉ Scorpii (Latinised to Sigma Scorpii) is the star system's Bayer designation. The designations of the four components as Sigma Scorpii Aa1, Aa2, Ab and B derive from the convention used by the Washington Multiplicity Catalog (WMC) for multiple star systems, and adopted by the International Astronomical Union (IAU). Sigma Scorpii and Tau Scorpii together bore the traditional name Al Niyat (or Alniyat) derived from the Arabic ÿßŸÑŸÜŸäÿßÿ∑ al-niyƒÅ≈£ \\"the arteries\\" and referring to their position flanking the star Antares, the scorpion's heart, with Sigma Scorpii just to the north. In 2016, the International Astronomical Union organized a Working Group on Star Names (WGSN) to catalogue and standardize proper names for stars. The WGSN decided to attribute proper names to individual stars rather than entire multiple systems. It approved the name Alniyat for the component Sigma Scorpii Aa1 on February 1, 2017 and it is now so included in the List of IAU-approved Star Names. In Chinese, (), meaning Heart, refers to an asterism consisting of Sigma Scorpii, Antares and Tau Scorpii. ‰∏≠ÂúãÊòüÂ∫ßÁ•ûË©±, written by Èô≥‰πÖÈáë.

The indigenous Boorong people of northwestern Victoria in Australia saw this star and Tau Scorpii as wives of Djuit (Antares). == Properties == The brightest component of the system, Sigma Scorpii Aa, is a double-lined spectroscopic binary, which means that the pair has not been resolved using a telescope. Instead, their orbit is determined by changes in their combined spectrum caused by the Doppler shift. This indicates that the pair complete an orbit every 33.01 days and have an orbital eccentricity of 0.32. The primary component of the spectroscopic binary, Sigma Scorpii Aa1, is an evolved giant star with a stellar classification of B1 III. It has around 18 times the mass of the Sun and 12 times the Sun's radius. This star is radiating about times the luminosity of the Sun from its outer envelope at an effective temperature of . This is a variable star of the Beta Cephei type, causing the apparent magnitude to vary between +2.86 and +2.94 with multiple periods of , , and 8.2 days. During each pulsation cycle, the temperature of the star varies by . The other member of the core pair, Sigma Scorpii Aa2, is a main sequence star with a classification of B1 V. Orbiting this binary at a separation of half an arcsecond, or at least 120 Astronomical units (AU), four times the Sun-Neptune distance, is the magnitude +5.2 Sigma Scorpii Ab, which has an orbital period of over a hundred years. Even farther out at 20 arcseconds, or more than 4500 AU, is Sigma Scorpii B with a magnitude of +8.7. It is classified as a B9 dwarf. Given its position, youth, and space velocity, the Sigma Scorpii system is a likely member of the Gould Belt, and in particular the Upper Scorpius subgroup of the Scorpius‚ÄìCentaurus Association (Sco OB2). Recent isochronal age estimates for the system yield ages of 8‚Äì10 million years through comparison of the HR diagram positions for the stars to modern evolutionary tracks. This agrees well with the mean age for the Upper Scorpius group which is approximately 11 million years. ==References== Category:Scorpius (constellation) Scorpii, Sigma Scorpii, 20 Category:Beta Cephei variables Category:B-type giants Category:B-type main-sequence stars 4 Alniyat Category:Upper Scorpius 080112 147165 Category:Durchmusterung objects 6084 ","title":"Sigma Scorpii"},{"id":"2225334","text":"The Malabar Special Police (MSP) is a paramilitary unit of the State Police of Kerala, India. This unit also trains new recruits and also helps the local police units to maintain law and order during emergencies. During emergencies, this unit forms the riot police platoons fully equipped with riot gear. This police unit is known for its extraordinarily tough training, and the high quality of its firing and military drills. ==History== Formed in 1884, the MSP were initially known as the Malappuram Special Police, having been quartered in Malappuram. Its initial personnel consisted of 80 Constables, 4 Native Head Constables, 4 Sergeants, a Bugler and a European Inspector, who were temporarily drafted into a special force to deal with periodical outbreaks for freedom by native Muslims Moplahs. The squad was made permanent in 1897. In the 1921 Moplah Revolt, Malabar (the present districts of Kannur, Wayanad, Kozhikode, Malappuram, Palakkad and parts of Thrissur) witnessed a wave of popular unrest and other law and order problems. Mr. Hitchcock who was then the District Superintendent of Police, South Malabar realized the imperative need to raise a special force, organized, armed and equipped on the lines of an Indian infantry battalion to deal effectively problems threatening public peace. This suggestion, strongly endorsed by the District Magistrate, was accepted by the Viceroy's Government on 30 September 1921, which then sanctioned a strength of 6 British Officers, 8 Subedars, 16 Jemadars, 60 Havildars and 600 Constables to be formed into 6 companies of Auxiliary Police. In the following year, members of the force were drafted into Madras Presidency to counter the rebellion in the Rampa area that was being led by Alluri Sitarama Raju. Local forces had been unable to match the guerilla tactics of Raju in the forested areas, for which the Malabar unit were considered to be specialists. This was the beginning of the Malabar Special Police. As they were run by the British government and often used to quell native disturbances, the MSP were seen as a symbol of colonial oppression, a view that continues to hold sway today. On the eve of the linguistic reorganization of States in 1956, the MSP was divided into two. One half of the 6 companies and half of the Headquarters company fell to the share of Kerala and the other half allotted to Madras. Presently the MSP is headquartered at Malappuram. == References  *http://www.tn.gov.in/police/histone.htm *http://www.kerala.com/ke_historyfreedom.htm Category:Law enforcement in Kerala Category:Kerala Police ","title":"Malabar Special Police"},{"id":"2225336","text":"Joseph Marcell (born 14 August 1948) is an English actor and comedian, whom is best known for his role as Geoffrey Butler, the butler, on the sitcom by NBC, The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air from September 1990, until it ended in May 1996.

The geranium bronze butterfly is native to South Africa. The butterfly was first introduced to Europe in the late 20th century, where it has quickly spread to many southern and eastern European regions. Since its introduction to Europe, the geranium bronze butterfly has become a pest to cultivated Pelargonium and Geranium plant species. Currently, efforts are being made to contain the spread of the geranium bronze butterflies as well as to determine the most effective pesticide for the species. ==Description== The adult geranium bronze butterfly's wingspan ranges from 15‚Äì23 mm in males and 18‚Äì23 mm in females. The wings are brown/bronze with a white border outlining the wings. The underside is a grey-brown with darker bands interlaced with white, creating an intricate pattern. The hindwings contain an eye spot in order to divert predators from attacking. The male and female are similar in appearance. File:Lycaenidae - Cacyreus marshalli-1.JPGImago, underside File:Lycaenidae - Cacyreus marshalli.JPGImago, underside File:Cacyreus marshalli 01 by- dpc.jpgImago,upperside ==Geographic range== The geranium bronze was first recorded in regions of South Africa, including Natal, Swaziland, Botswana, Zimbabwe, the Cape Provinces, Lesotho, and Mozambique. It was accidentally brought to Europe in 1978. After being recorded in England, a colony of geranium bronze was soon found in Mallorca in 1990, and has since spread to most of the regions in southern Europe. In 1996, the geranium bronze butterfly was first recorded in Rome, Italy, and rapidly spread along the Adriatic and Tyrrhenian coastal areas before extending inland. The geranium bronze butterfly now has established colonies in Belgium, Germany, the Netherlands, Italy, France, Greece, Malta, Spain, Portugal, southern Switzerland, Slovenia, Croatia, and the French Mediterranean. ==Food resourcesCaterpillars=== After hatching, the geranium bronze larvae feed on the flower buds, young leaves, and soft stems of their host plant, typically from the genera Pelargonium and Geranium. In order to eat the stem of these plants, the larvae drill into the stems, causing damage to the plants. ==Life historyEgg=== Geranium bronze eggs are small with a slight green color that turns white then brown or light-yellow before the larva hatches. The eggs are 0.5 mm in diameter and 0.3 mm in height. The eggs are typically laid close to the flower buds, but are occasionally laid on the leaves. The laying of eggs usually occurs during summer months, while caterpillar activity has been recorded in the summer, fall, and winter. Geranium bronze larva ===Caterpillar=== Once hatched, the larvae bore through the stem of the host plant, where they are typically found within the stem or flower buds. The plant stem usually turns black after being invaded by larvae. The larva feeds on the host plant, damaging the host until it enters the pupa stage. During the first instar stage, the caterpillar's average length is 1 mm, which will increase to 2 mm during the following 8 days. Second instar caterpillars grow to an average of 3 mm; third instars to 6 mm; and fourth instars grow to 13 mm. The second, third, and fourth instar stages occur for a duration of 8, 8, and 9 days, respectively. The color of the caterpillars can vary. Most caterpillars are yellow or green, and may have pink markings. ===Pupa=== The pupa stage occurs at the bottom of the flower peduncle in many of the host species. The peduncles offer the best protection for the caterpillars, which is why the caterpillars will typically remain at the base of the flower until metamorphosis occurs. It has been suggested that geranium bronze may overwinter as either a caterpillar or a pupa, although further data is needed to confirm this. The pupa color varies, but they are typically green, pale- yellow, or brown. The pupa are hairy and are typically 9 mm long. ==Migration== Adults are on wing year-round in warmer areas, but usually from August to May in South Africa. At higher altitudes, adults are on wing in December and January. Geranium bronze have spread from their native regions of South Africa to numerous southern and eastern European regions. This was likely due to accidental transportation of plants infested with geranium bronze larvae and not due to any natural migration patterns. The geranium bronze butterflies fly for short periods of time and frequently rest. ==Predators== The geranium bronze butterfly has not been reported as a pest in its native home and surrounding South African regions. It is believed that the butterfly has not become a pest in the South African regions because of an indigenous predator or parasitoid that has kept the butterfly population low. The predator has yet to be identified. ==Parental care== Geranium sanguineum, one of geranium bronze's preferred host plants ===Oviposition=== Geranium bronze females prefer to lay their eggs on the flower buds of various Geranium species. They typically oviposit on top of and underneath leaves, but infrequently on stems. Geranium bronze butterflies are multivoltine, meaning they lay two or more broods per year. ===Plant selection for egg laying=== Geranium bronze typically lay eggs on plants from genera Pelargonium and Geranium, both in the family Geraniaceae. Once hatched, these plants act as hosts to the larvae. Quacchia et al. (2008) found that geranium bronze butterflies in Italy displayed preference for egg laying on Geranium sanguineum, Geranium sylvaticum, and Geranium pratense Data was collected from a 2-year observation in various regions of Piedmont and the Aosta Valley, Italy. Plant preference and offspring fitness (using wingspan as a marker for fitness) were analyzed, but no statistically significant correlation was found. ==Interaction with humans== Geranium bronze damage to Geranium plant ===Pest of plants=== Geranium bronze butterflies pose a large threat to Pelargonium species in Europe. European and Mediterranean Plant Protection Organization currently lists geranium bronze as an A2 quarantine pest for Europe, and an A1 quarantine pest for Turkey. If geranium bronze numbers in Italy and other regions of Europe continue to rise, it is possible that they will become a larger threat for not only the native flora, but also for local biodiversity. Geranium bronze may start to be in competition with indigenous lycaenid species whose only food source is Geranium plants, such as E. eumedon and A. nicias. Unfortunately, as pests, the geranium bronze butterflies have caused economic troubles as well. In countries like Spain, the Geranium plant species are highly bought in Spanish homes as ornaments. According to Sarto i Monteys et al., these plants are highly important in both sales and in employment for both production and marketing (Sarto i Monteys V 1991). In Spain alone, there are four major Geranium plant companies, together collecting over $30 million a year in the market. Companies have already seen drops in sales as the Geraniums have been affected by these butterflies. Currently, research is being done to find effective ways to prevent the attacks by these butterflies, but unfortunately many possible insecticides are too chemically potent on the plants that control of these butterflies has been difficult. ===Use of pesticides on geranium bronze=== There is a large body of research on the use of pesticides on geranium bronze butterflies. Contact pesticides were found to have no effect on the butterfly, because the larva spends the majority of its life within the plant, along with other endophytic habits. Herrero et al. found that B. thuringiensis may be effective in controlling the geranium bronze . In addition to Bacillus thuringiensis, the insecticides diflubenzuron, flufenoxuron, hexaflumuron, lamda-cyhalothrin, alphamethrin and benfuracarb are also effective. ==References== * J.

Though primarily an air-to-ground weapon, it saw limited use in other roles. Its warhead gave rise to the alternative name of the \\"60-pound rocket\\"; the solid-shot armour-piercing variant was referred to as the \\"25-pound rocket\\". They were generally used by British fighter-bomber aircraft against targets such as tanks, trains, motor transport and buildings, and by Coastal Command and Royal Navy aircraft against U-boats and shipping. The \\"3 inch\\" designation referred to the diameter of the rocket motor tube. ==History== The first use of rockets fired from aircraft was during World War I. The \\"unrotated projectiles\\" (UPs) were Le Prieur rockets which were mounted on the interplane struts of Nieuport fighters. These were used to attack observation balloons and were reasonably successful. Sopwith Baby and Pup and Home Defence B.E.2 fighters also carried rockets.Aeroplane Monthly June 1995 With the war ended the Royal Air Force, intent on retrenching, forgot about firing rockets from aircraft. The British Army, however, did see a use for rockets against low-flying aircraft; from late 1940 parts of Britain were defended by increasing numbers of \\"Z-Batteries\\" rockets supplementing the conventional anti-aircraft guns.The Blitz Then and Now: Volume 3 When German forces under the command of Rommel intervened in the Western Desert from early 1941, it became clear that the Desert Air Force lacked weapons capable of damaging or destroying the large numbers of armoured fighting vehicles, particularly the heavier Panzer III and Panzer IV tanks possessed by the Germans. Consequently, in April 1941 Henry Tizard, the Chief Scientist, called together a panel to study \\"Methods of Attacking Armoured Vehicles.\\" The types of weapons investigated included the 40 mm Vickers S gun and related weapons manufactured by the Coventry Ordnance Works, as well as the Bofors 40 mm and the US 37 mm T9 cannon fitted to the Bell P-39 Airacobra: however, it was already recognised that these weapons were only capable of dealing with light tanks and motor transport, and using larger weapons on fighter-bombers was ruled out because of weight and difficulties handling recoil. The chairman of the panel, Mr. Ivor Bowen (Assistant Director of Armament Research) turned to the idea of using rocket projectiles as a means of delivering a large warhead capable of destroying or disabling heavy tanks. Information was sought from the Soviets, who had just started using unguided RS-82 rockets against German ground forces in the opening phases of Operation Barbarossa.The possibility of the Soviets sending a team of engineers to help set up production of these weapons was a possibility in August 1941. However, the Soviet offer was withdrawn, in spite of British efforts at supplying a Wing of Hawker Hurricanes and training Soviet aircrew in their use. By September 1941 it was decided that two models of UP would be developed: * A 23 lb plastic explosive on a standard 2-inch UP. * A 20 lb solid armour-piercing head on a 3-inch UP. When it was realised that the 2-inch version would be less effective than the Vickers S cannon, it was decided to concentrate on development of the 3-inch version, which could be developed from the 2-inch rocket used in the Z-Batteries. ==Design== Attaching 60-pdr SAP warheads onto 3 in rocket projectile bodies The rocket body was a steel tube in diameter filled with of cordite propellant, fired electrically. The warhead was screwed into the forward end, and was initially a solid , armor-piercing shell which was quickly supplemented by a , high-explosive head. Another type of head was a mild steel (later concrete) practice head. Once the rocket had been mounted on the rails, an electrical lead (or \\"pigtail\\") was plugged into the exhaust of the rocket. Four large tailfins induced enough spin to stabilize the rocket, but as it was unguided, aiming was a matter of judgment and experience. Approach to the target needed to be precise, with no sideslip or yaw, which could throw the RP off line. Aircraft speed had to be precise at the moment of launch, and the angle of attack required precision. Trajectory drop was also a problem, especially at longer ranges.In tests carried out by the A&AEE;, dispersion (when aimed at a square target) was at range ‚Äì equal to 3¬∞ to 4¬∞ aiming error.Aeroplane Monthly July 1995 On the plus side the rocket was less complicated and more reliable than a gun firing a shell, and there was no recoil on firing. It was found to be a demoralising form of attack against ground troops, and the 60-pound warhead could be devastating. The rocket installations were light enough to be carried by single-seat fighters, giving them the punch of a cruiser.A typical cruiser gun of the era, the 6-inch gun used on Royal Navy ships for instance, fired perhaps four or six projectiles, while a fighter could fire eight 60-pound PR-3 in a single salvo. Against slow-moving large targets like shipping and U-boats, the rocket was a formidable weapon. The weight and drag of the all- steel rails initially fitted to British aircraft blunted performance. Some aircraft such as the Fairey Swordfish had steel \\"anti-blast\\" panels fitted under the rails to protect the wing, which further increased weight and drag. Aluminium Mark III rails, introduced from late 1944, reduced the effect. American experience with their own rockets (the USAAF's 3.5-Inch Forward Firing Aircraft Rocket (FFAR) and the USN's 5-inch FFAR & HVAR3.5 in FFAR 5 in FFAR and HVAR Retrieved 6 March 2008) showed that the long rails and anti- blast panels were unnecessary; zero-length launchers were introduced in May 1945. British aircraft started being fitted with \\"zero-point\\" mounting pylons in the post-war years. The 3-inch rocket motors (less warhead) were used in the bunker buster Disney bomb, 19 of them propelling the bomb to at impact with the target. ==Use in battleAir-to-ground use=== A gun camera picture of a rocket salvo, launched by a Hawker Typhoon towards railway wagons in a siding at Nordhorn, Germany (1945) Before the new weapon was released for service extensive tests were carried out by the Instrument, Armament and Defence Flight (IADF) at Royal Aircraft Establishment, Farnborough. Hurricanes were fitted with rockets and rails and flown during June and July 1942. Further tests were undertaken from 28 September to 30 November to develop rocket firing tactics. Other aircraft used were a Hudson, a Swordfish, a Boston II and a Sea Hurricane. At the same time the Aeroplane and Armament Experimental Establishment (A&AEE;) had to develop tactics for all the individual aircraft types which were to be armed with the RPs. Aiming was through a standard GM.II reflector gunsight. A later modification enabled the reflector to be tilted with the aid of a graduated scale, depressing the line of sight, the GM.IIL.GM.IIL 429sqn.ca For rockets only the Mk IIIA was the most successful ‚Äì it was used on the Ventura and Hudson. The first operational use of the RP was in the Western Desert as a \\"tank-busting\\" weapon on Hawker Hurricane Mk. IIEs and IVs. The 25-pound armour-piercing heads were found to be ineffective against the Tiger I tanks coming into German service. With the example of the success of Royal Artillery gunners using high-explosive shells from the 25 pdr gun-howitzer, it was decided to design a new 60-pound semi- armour-piercing (SAP) head. These were capable of knocking turrets off tanks. A typical RP-3 installation was 4 projectiles on launching rails under each wing. A selector switch was fitted to allow the pilot to fire them singly (later omitted), in pairs, or as a full salvo. Towards the end of the war some RAF Second Tactical Air Force Hawker Typhoons had their installation adapted to carry an additional four rockets doubled up under the eight already fitted.Shores and Thomas 2005, pages 245-250 Possibly the best known action involving RP-3s was that of the Falaise pocket of mid-August 1944. During the battle German forces, retreating to avoid being trapped in a pincer movement by Allied ground forces, came under air attack. Amongst the waves of light, medium and fighter bombers attacking the German columns the Typhoons of 2 TAF attacked with their rockets, claiming hundreds of tanks and \\"mechanised enemy transport\\".also known as \\"motorized enemy transport\\", as opposed to HDT ‚Äì \\"horse-drawn transport\\" After the battle Army and 2nd TAF Operational Research Sections studying the battleground came to the conclusion that far fewer vehicles (17 in total) had been destroyed by rocket strike alone. What was clear was that in the heat of battle it was far harder for pilots to launch the weapons while meeting the conditions needed for accuracy. Smoke, dust and debris in the target areas made accurate assessment of the damage caused almost impossible. But it was also clear rocket attacks devastated the morale of enemy troops ‚Äì many vehicles were found abandoned intact, or with only superficial damage. Interrogation of captured prisoners showed that even the prospect of rocket attack was extremely unnerving for them. ===Anti- submarine=== A rocket-armed Swordfish lands aboard HMS Tracker. Soon after some encouraging results from the initial deployment, trials of the weapon were conducted against targets representing U-boats. It was discovered that if the rockets were fired at a shallow angle, near misses resulted in the rockets curving upwards in seawater and piercing the targets below the waterline. Soon Coastal Command and the Royal Navy's Fleet Air Arm aircraft were using the rockets extensively. The first U-Boat destroyed with the assistance of a rocket attack was U-752 (Kapit√§n-Leutnant Schroeter), on 23 May 1943, by a Swordfish of 819 NAS. The rockets used on this occasion had solid, cast-iron heads and were known as rocket spears.Gerald Pawle, The Wheezers & Dodgers, Seaforth Publishing 2009 One of these punched right through the submarine's pressure hull and rendered it incapable of diving; the U‚Äìboat was scuttled by its crew. On 28 May 1943, a 608 Squadron Hudson destroyed a U-boat in the Mediterranean, the first destroyed solely by rocket. These rockets were, among other factors, credited with making it too dangerous for the Germans to continue operating their Flak U-Boats, which were initially designed with heavy anti-aircraft weaponry to hold off air attacks. From then until the end of the Second World War in Europe, Coastal Command and the Fleet Air Arm used the rockets as one of their primary weapons (alongside torpedoes, which, to a certain extent they replaced) against shipping and surfaced U-Boats. ===Ground-to-ground use=== Sherman tanks of the Coldstream Guards, 28 April 1945 In 1945, some British Shermans were fitted with two or four rails ‚Äì one or two either side of the turret ‚Äì to carry 60-pound headed rockets. These were used at the Rhine Crossing by tanks of the 1st Coldstream Guards. The tanks were called \\"Sherman Tulips\\". The tanks fitted included both conventional Shermans and the more heavily armed Sherman Fireflies. The modifications were first tried out by two officers of the 1st Armoured Battalion, Coldstream Guards, 5th Guards Armoured Brigade, who obtained rockets and launching rails from an RAF base and carried out the first test firings on 17 March 1945. They were inspired after hearing the idea had been earlier tried, but abandoned, by a Canadian unit, the 18th Armoured Car Regiment (12th Manitoba Dragoons), who had fitted RP-3 rails to a Staghound Armoured Car. Within a week all the tanks of Number 2 Squadron had been fitted with launch rails, some tanks had two launching rails, others had four. The rails were at fixed elevations and the rockets had fixed ranges either . The rockets were highly inaccurate when fired from a tank as they were being fired from a stationary point and had little slipstream over the fins. Despite this, the RP-3 was valued by tank crews for the destructive effect of its 60-pound warhead. In combat, they were also used for short-range, saturation bombardment of an area and were effective as an immediate counter to German ambushes. ==Specification== * Length: 55 in (1.4 metres) * Propelling charge: 11 lb (5 kg) cordite, electrically ignited. * Max speed 1,200 mph (480 m/s) * Range: 1-mile (1,600 m) * Weight: 47 lb (21 kg) with 25 lb (11 kg) AP head ;Variants Names referred to complete weight of the warhead fitted to the rocket body. * 60 lb Shell, HE/SAP \\"Semi-armour-piercing\\" with TNT filling * 60 lb Shell, HE/GP, Hollow charge * 18 lb Shell, HE ‚Äì (8 kg) * 25 lb Shot, AP ‚Äì (11 kg) * 25 lb Head, Solid, A/S ‚Äì anti-submarine use (11 kg) * 60 lb Shell, Practice ‚Äì training only (27 kg) * 12 lb Head, Practice ‚Äì training only (5 kg) ==Aircraft using the RP-3 in the Second World War== These are aircraft that used the RP-3 operationally, a number of aircraft types were fitted with RP-3s on an experimental basis. ===RAF and Commonwealth Air Forces=== * Boeing Fortress Mk.

It is the only dormouse native to the British Isles, and is therefore often referred to simply as the \\"dormouse\\" in British sources, although the edible dormouse, Glis glis, has been accidentally introduced and now has an established population. Though Ireland has no native dormouse, the hazel dormouse was discovered in County Kildare in 2010, and appears to be spreading rapidly, helped by the prevalence of hedgerows in the Irish countryside. The United Kingdom distribution of the hazel dormouse can be found on the National Biodiversity Network website. A 2016 study finds that hazel dormice in Britain have declined by over one third since 2000. Woodland habitat loss and management and a warming climate are seen as material threats to their future status. ===Habitat=== According to English Nature's Dormouse Conservation Handbook, hazel dormice are \\"particularly associated with deciduous woodland\\" but also inhabit hedgerows and scrub.Paul Bright, Pat Morris & Tony Mitchell- Jones, The Dormouse Conservation Handbook (2nd ed.: English Nature, 2006), p. 9. Dormice seldom travel more than 70 m from their nest.Paul Bright, Pat Morris & Tony Mitchell-Jones, The Dormouse Conservation Handbook (2nd ed.: English Nature, 2006), p. 13. ==Description == Hazel dormouse on Epilobium The hazel dormouse can reach a body length of about and a length of about if you consider the tail as well. It is long with a tail of . It weighs , although this increases to just before hibernation. This small mammal has reddish brown fur that can vary up to golden-brown or yellow-orange-brown becoming lighter in the lower part. Eyes are large and black. Ears are small and not very developed, while the tail is long and completely covered with hair. It is a nocturnal creature and spends most of its waking hours among the branches of trees looking for food. It will make long detours rather than come down to the ground and expose itself to danger. The hazel dormouse hibernates from October to April‚ÄìMay. ==Behaviour== In winter (October to November), the hazel dormouse will hibernate in nests on the ground, in the base of old coppiced trees or hazel stools, under piles of leaves or under log piles as these situations are not subject to extreme variations in either temperature or humidity. Dormice are almost completely arboreal in habit but much less reluctant to cross open ground than was thought even recently. When it wakes up in spring (late April or early May), it builds woven nests of shredded honeysuckle bark, fresh leaves and grasses in the undergrowth. If the weather is cold and wet, and food scarce, it saves energy by going into torpor; it curls up into a ball and goes to sleep. The hazel dormouse, therefore, spends a large proportion of its life sleeping ‚àí either hibernating in winter or in torpor in summer. M. avellanarius moving a newborn baby Examination of hazelnuts may show a neat, round hole in the shell. This indicates it has been opened by a small rodent, e.g., the dormouse, wood mouse, or bank vole. Other animals, such as squirrels or jays, will either split the shell completely in half or make a jagged hole in it. Further examination reveals the cut surface of the hole has toothmarks which follow the direction of the shell. In addition, there will be toothmarks on the outer surface of the nut, at an angle of about 45 degrees to the cut surface. Woodmice and voles bite across the nutshell leaving clear parallel toothmarks from inside to outside. Woodmice also leave toothmarks on the outer surface of the nut but voles do not. M. avellanarius during hibernation ==Diet== The hazel dormouse requires a variety of arboreal foods to survive. It eats berries and nuts and other fruit with hazelnuts being the main food for fattening up before hibernation. The dormouse also eats hornbeam and blackthorn fruit where hazel is scarce. Other food sources are the buds of young leaves, and flowers which provide nectar and pollen. The dormouse also eats insects found on food-source trees, particularly aphids and caterpillars. ===Plants of value to dormice=== *Hazel is the principal food source, supports insects, forms an understory of poles, especially when coppiced, which makes it useful for its arboreal activity. The hazel dormouse's Latin name avellanarius means 'hazel'. *Oaks supply insect and flower food; the acorns are of little value. *Honeysuckle bark is their primary nesting material, and flowers and fruit are used for food. *Bramble flowers and fruits provide food over a long period. The thorns give protection for nests. Dormice thrive on blackberries. *Alder buckthorn ‚Äì in parts of the dormouse range where hazel is scarce or absent, berries of alder buckthorn is the principal food source and vital for the accumulation of fat reserves in autumn prior to hibernation. *Willow ‚Äì unripe seeds in early spring. *Birch ‚Äì seeds. *Hawthorn flowers are an important food in the spring. The fruit is eaten occasionally.Hedgerows for Dormice . Ptes.org. Retrieved on 28 December 2012. *Blackthorn ‚Äì fruits (blackthorn fruit is called \\"sloe\\"). *Ash ‚Äì seed keys whilst they are still on the tree. *Sycamore supplies insects and pollen, and a habitat.

Australis is Latin for \\"southern\\" and Genubi is Arabic for \\"south\\". == Properties == Epsilon Leonis has a stellar classification of G1 II, with the luminosity class of II indicating that, at an age of , it has evolved into a bright giant. It is much larger and brighter than the Sun with a luminosity 288 times and a radius 21 times solar. Consequently, its absolute magnitude is actually ‚Äì1.49, making it one of the more luminous stars in the constellation, significantly more than Regulus. Its apparent brightness, though, is only 2.98. Given its distance of about , the star is more than three times the distance from the Sun than Regulus. At this distance, the visual magnitude of Epsilon Leonis is reduced by 0.03 as a result of extinction caused by intervening gas and dust. Epsilon Leonis exhibits the characteristics of a Cepheid-like variable, changing by an amplitude of 0.3 magnitude every few days. It has around four times the mass of the Sun and a projected rotational velocity of . Based upon its iron abundance, the metallicity of this star's outer atmosphere is only around 52% of the Sun's.

It marks the northern end of the main ridge of the Helvellyn range and is often walked as part of the ridge walk. The fell stands south of the village of Threlkeld and the A66 road, and it forms the steep eastern side of the tranquil valley of St John's in the Vale. On its western side the fell displays a dark mass of rocky crags and a deep-set rocky ravine. On the other side it has smooth grassy slopes. Beneath the north face is the steep valley or clough from which Clough Head gets its name. Also beneath the steep northern face lies the lower hill of Threlkeld Knotts, a granite hill which has been much quarried round its margin. A number of different types of rock are found on and around Clough Head, which were formed in very different circumstances. These include deep-sea sedimentation, effusive volcanic lava flows, explosive volcanism, an intrusion of granite, mineralisation and finally glacial sculpting. To understand the geology of Clough Head is to understand much of the geology of the Lake District. An old route known as the Old Coach Road passes beneath Clough Head. Most of the fell is Open Access land, which walkers can enter from either end of the Old Coach Road, or from a lane south of the village of Threlkeld. Four main routes lead to the summit. ==Topography== With a height of 726 m, Clough Head is the lowest summit of the Helvellyn range. Gentle grass-covered slopes on the south and east sides of the fell drop to a broad col and to Mosedale, both of which separate Clough Head from Great Dodd, its neighbour to the south. To the north of the summit the ground drops abruptly down a steep scree-covered and craggy slope which marks the northern end of the Helvellyn range. This face is called Red Screes from the colour of the rock. Beneath Red Screes is the lower, rounded, grassy hill of Threlkeld Knotts. This hill rises gently from the valley of the River Glenderamackin, which separates the Helvellyn range of fells from Blencathra and the northern Lakeland fells. A steep valley to the east of Threlkeld Knotts, which begins immediately below Red Screes, is the clough from which Clough Head is named. In the bottom of this valley there is a sheepfold known as Clough Fold.Ordnance Survey 1:25,000 Explorer map Sandbed Gill Steep rocky crags guard the whole western side of the fell, rising abruptly from the green valley of St John's in the Vale. This western face of Clough Head, is steep, rough and rocky. The principal rock features are, from north to south: Buck Castle, Wanthwaite Crags and Bram Crag. South of Wanthwaite Crags is the very steep Fisher's Wife's Rake, a grassy break in the cliffs (though with scree) which allows determined fell-walkers to ascend the fell on this side. North of Bram Crag is a deep-seated rocky ravine called Sandbed Gill. This gill contains a considerable flow of water in its rocky gorge, but it often has only a dry bed by the time it gets down to valley level. North-east of the summit of Clough Head is the lesser top of White Pike. From here the ridge descends and gradually broadens into the rough expanse of Thelkeld Common. The western slopes of Clough Head drain into St John's Beck, which flows north into the River Greta, and which in turn joins the River Derwent at Keswick. The southern and eastern slopes drain into Mosedale and Mosedale Beck, which also joins the River Greta, via the River Glenderamackin. { style=\\"width: 100%; height: 150px\\" border=\\"1\\"  + Clough Head and its Subsidiary Tops !

Its curving summit ridge contains three small tops, each of which is marked by a cairn. From Threlkeld Knotts there is a striking view of Red Screes just above, and a narrow path slants up through the crags to the west shoulder of Clough Head. On the northern slope of Threlkeld Knotts, not far above the large quarry, are the remains of an Iron Age settlement. The documented remains include seven hut circles, five enclosures, two trackways, a field system, and some fifty cairns which probably represent field clearances. Remains of enclosure walls may still be seen, about 200 m north of the Old Coach Road. ==Old Coach Road== An old route, marked on maps as \\"Old Coach Road\\" crosses the northern slopes of Threlkeld Knotts and skirts the eastern side of Clough Head, reaching a height of 437 mOrdnance Survey 1:50,000 Landranger map as it crosses from Wanthwaite () in St John's in the Vale to High Row near Dockray. This has suffered from rain water erosion in recent years, but remains a useful track for walkers. Near the summit of the road is Hause Well, a spring issuing from a crevice in the rock. The Ordnance Survey 1:25,000 map shows the road as an \\"other route with public access\\" and as a \\"traffic-free cycle route;\\" it does not show it as either a \\"byway\\" or a \\"restricted byway\\". However, official signs present on the gates at both ends of the road clearly show that access by motorised vehicles is permitted. ==Routes== Fisher's Wife's Rake The whole of Clough Head, Threlkeld Knotts and Threlkeld Common (above the intake wall which encloses the lower agricultural land and Threlkeld Quarry) is Open Access land. Entry to this land can be had from three points: from either end of the Old Coach Road, or from the lane leading to Newsham Farm. This lane begins opposite Threlkeld village, or it can be joined from the disused railway line alongside the road to the quarry. Walkers may approach the summit by means of four principal routes. A narrow footpath leads from the Old Coach Road (at a point 250 m east of Hause Well) to White Pike and then on to the summit. Another narrow path leads from Threlkeld Knotts, slanting up through the crags and scree of Red Screes to emerge on the west shoulder of Clough Head. From there one may go up gentle grassy slopes to the summit, although the main path contours round to meet the track coming up from Great Dodd, which suggests that many ridge-walkers bypass the top (just as the ridge path bypasses nearly all the other tops of the range.) From the south, the ridge track from Great Dodd leads straight up the long gentle slope to the top. Finally, Fisher's Wife's Rake is a possible route up through the crags on the west side of Clough Head for energetic and determined walkers, but it is \\"very steep.\\" Climbers, or scramblers with some rock-climbing experience and a rope for the more difficult pitches, can ascend the hidden recesses of Sandbed Gill. Sandbed Gill was the first new route in the Lake District to be pioneered by the brothers George and Ashley Abraham in 1890. Although George was only 18 at the time, and Ashley 14, they had already gained true rock-climbing skills elsewhere in the Lakes. Walkers should leave the gill well alone. Clough Head is often included as the first (or last) step of a traverse of the Helvellyn range. It may also be included in a longer version of the horseshoe walk around Deepdale which takes in the three \\"Dodds\\" to its south. This walk begins at High Row and takes advantage of the Old Coach Road. ==Summit== The summit of Clough Head and the view to the west The summit is marked by an Ordnance Survey triangulation column and a wind shelter. It provides a good view of Blencathra to the north, and a wide, all-round view, broken only by Great Dodd, with glimpses of both the Solway Firth to the north and Morecambe Bay to the south. To the south-west the vista of the high fells is \\"especially striking\\". Alfred Wainwright included a drawing of himself regarding Blencathra from this viewpoint in his Pictorial Guides to the Lakeland Fells. Mark Richards recommends White Pike as a better place for contemplating the view. ==Geology== The rocks of Clough Head belong to both the Skiddaw Group and the Borrowdale Volcanic Group, both of which date from the Ordovician period. An east-west geological fault just north of the summit has brought these two rather different rock groups side by side. To the north, including White Pike, much of Threlkeld Common and the margins of Threlkeld Knotts are rocks of the Buttermere Formation, part of the Skiddaw Group. \\\\- may be viewed on the or on the BGS's iGeology smartphone app Mudstones, siltstones and sandstones which had been deposited in deep water on the northern margin of an ancient continent (Avalonia) in the early Ordovician Period were chaotically disrupted by a huge undersea avalanche to form an olistostrome deposit in which blocks of rock are now embedded in a matrix of mudstone, and intensely deformed by minor folds, slumps and shears. This event can be dated to about 460 million years ago. The deep sea deposits of the Skiddaw Group were raised above sea level by the subduction of ocean crust from the north beneath the continent to the south. This uplift was followed by a brief (about 5 million years) period of intense volcanic activity, up to about 450 million years ago. To the south of the fault on Clough Head are rocks of the Birker Fell Andesite Formation. These rocks are among the earliest of the volcanic rocks of the Borrowdale Volcanic Group, and are part of a thick succession of andesite sheets which now outcrop in a wide band around the western and northern sides of the Lake District. These sheets were formed by successive eruptions of mobile andesitic lava from shallow-sided volcanoes. The composition of the erupting magma varied from time to time, and the geological map shows an area of basaltic andesite along the crags on the western side of the fell, and areas of dacite higher on the fell. Individual lava flows may be separated by beds of volcaniclastic sandstone, that is, sedimentary deposits formed from the erosion of the volcanic rocks and deposited by streams, floods and possibly wind. The geological map shows a number of areas of volcaniclastic sandstone on the crags on the west side, as well as a larger area surrounding the summit, into which an andesite sill was intruded. After the eruptions of the Birker Fell Formation, the composition of the erupting magma changed from largely andesitic to predominantly dacitic, and as a result the nature of the volcanism became more explosive. In the area to the north of Sticks Pass the Birker Fell andesites are overlain by the Lincomb Tarns Tuff Formation. This formation is one of the most widespread of the volcanic rocks of the Lake District; it seems that the whole district was buried beneath at least 150 m of densely welded ignimbrite, a rock formed from a pyroclastic flow of very hot gas and rock. This formation must represent a series of eruptions of truly exceptional magnitude, accompanying the formation of a volcanic caldera probably in the area around what is now Helvellyn. On Clough Head a small sheet of the Thirlmere Tuff Member covers the summit of the fell, a member of the Lincomb Tarns Formation. This rock is a rhyolitic lapilli-tuff in which the individual pieces of semi-molten lava were flattened under the weight of deposits above them. Towards the end of, or after the cessation of the volcanic activity a large granite batholith was emplaced in stages beneath the volcanic rocks of the Lake District. Threlkeld Knotts consists largely of an intrusion of micro-granite, known as the Threlkeld Intrusion, a part of the larger batholith. The granite was intruded into rocks of the Skiddaw Group and the base of the Borrowdale Volcanic Group. Uranium-lead dating has established an age of 451¬±1.1 million years for this intrusion. Seven quarries around the western side of Threlkeld Knotts have worked the microgranite. In addition to the large Threlkeld Quarry there are smaller workings at Birkett Bank, Hilltop Quarries and Bramcrag Quarry. Threlkeld Quarry was opened in 1870 to supply railway ballast for the Crewe to Carlisle railway line. Production increased in the 1890s with material for Thirlmere Reservoir and for roadstone. The quarry closed in the 1980s and now houses the Threlkeld Quarry and Mining Museum.Threlkeld Quarry and Mining Museum retrieved 14 June 2014 Mineral veins have been formed in many Lake District rocks by hydrothermal circulation of groundwater though geological faults and are often associated with the granite batholith. Veins containing lead and copper ores were found on Wanthwaite Crag where there are several old mineral workings, some very old. The most recent lease was taken out in 1887 by the short-lived and unsuccessful Wanthwaite Crag Mining Company. The lower promontory of Threlkeld Knotts north of Clough Head is scarred and flanked by 'rock slope failure' fractures and landslips, and views from the A66 and Blencathra could suggest that the whole mass of the Knotts has descended from the concavity in the north face, which is not a true glacial cirque (Lakeland combe), but this remains debatable.Jarman D and Wilson PW (2015): Clough Head - Threlkeld Knotts: a perplexing RSF complex. In McDougall DA and Evans DJA (eds), The Quaternary of the Lake District - Field Guide. Quaternary Research Association, London, 153-173. Rock slope failure also patterns White Pike with antiscarps (uphill-facing scarplets), which could formerly have extended across the Clough Head cavity. ==Names== Clough Head was called Threlkeld Fell in Thomas West's 1778 guide book. \\\\- available online at www.geog.port.ac.uk. Accessed 10 June 2014 Its present name, Clough Head, was first recorded by the Ordnance Survey in 1867. Clough is a dialect word from the Old English cl≈çh, a ravine. This appears to be a reference to a steep valley just below Red Screes, and which contains a sheepfold called Clough Fold. Thus Clough Head is \\"the hill-top above the ravine.\\"Diana Whaley, A Dictionary of Lake District Place-Names, English Place-Name Society 2006, White Pike is \\"the pale summit,\\" recorded since 1774, probably named from its pale-coloured rock, and perhaps in contrast to the reddish colour of Red Screes beneath the main summit. Threlkeld Knotts was first recorded by the Ordnance Survey in 1900. Knott is a dialect word from the Old Norse kn«´ttr, 'ball, hard round mass' used of compact or craggy hills. Hence Threlkeld Knotts is \\"the knobbly hill above Threlkeld\\", a place-name recorded from as early as 1197 and meaning \\"the slaves' spring\\" from the Old Norse √ær√¶la, 'thrall, slave,' and Old Norse kelda, 'a spring.' 'Thrall' may have been the word used by the Norse settlers to refer to the native Britons. Fisher's Wife's Rake is \\"Mrs Fisher's Path.\\" Rake is a dialect word of unknown origin which refers to a narrow path on a hill. Mark Richards claims that the name comes from the Fisher family of Rake How across the valley. He says the husband cut peat on the col above and his wife hauled it down by sled, but he gives no indication of the source of this information. ==Notes and references== Notes References * List of hills in the Lake District * List of fells in the Lake District Category:Fells of the Lake District Category:Hewitts of England Category:Nuttalls ","title":"Clough Head"},{"id":"2225391","text":"Da Fang (; pronounced ), also named Zhupu Da Fang or Zhuye Da Fang, is a Chinese green tea.

Both series are available on DVD and, at various times, through streaming services in the UK and the US. The series is filmed in a more traditional sitcom style than the mockumentary style used by Gervais and Merchant in their previous series The Office. Each episode has at least one guest star: a television or film celebrity, who play what Gervais and Merchant have referred to as \\"twisted\\" versions of themselves; an exaggerated or inverted parody of their public personas. The show has been critically acclaimed, and has a Metacritic score of 81/100. ==Cast and characters== * Ricky Gervais as Andy Millman * Ashley Jensen as Maggie Jacobs * Stephen Merchant as Darren Lamb (credited as \\"Agent\\") * Shaun Williamson as Barry from EastEnders (himself) * Shaun Pye as Greg Lindley-Jones ==Plot== Andy Millman (Ricky Gervais) is an aspiring actor who can only find work as an extra, which he calls being a \\"background artist\\" as a means of making the work seem more dignified. Andy is accompanied on his various projects by his platonic best friend and fellow extra, Maggie Jacobs (Ashley Jensen). Maggie is well-meaning but ditzy, often missing obvious social cues and failing to exhibit appropriate tact and subtlety in conversations. Unlike Andy, Maggie has no aspirations toward being anything more than an extra. Andy's agent, Darren Lamb (Stephen Merchant), has no real experience in the field of entertainment. He is incompetent, often taking no steps at all to find work for Andy, and even discouraging potential employers from hiring his client due to his flabby physique, age, and lack of acting experience. Darren is assisted by former soap opera star Shaun Williamson, who plays himself. Lamb frequently tries to undermine Andy by suggesting Williamson (who Lamb refers to by his former EastEnders character name, \\"Barry\\") is better suited for various acting roles that are offered to Andy. Fed up with life as an extra who is always being cut out of scenes just as he manages to get his face on camera, Andy shamelessly kisses up to celebrities and producers in an effort to try to get screen time or a line of dialogue. Although often successful in these endeavours, circumstances always arise that prevent Andy from advancing his career. Reasons include celebrities confessing that they have no real power to help, or (more often) Andy inadvertently offending the star which results in his immediate dismissal from the set. In the conclusion of season one, Andy delivers a sitcom script he has written to Patrick Stewart, who, in turn, passes it along to the BBC through his production company. Andy gets a meeting with BBC comedy producers who greenlight his project and agree to allow him to play the starring role in the show. Series Two largely chronicles Andy's frustrations with his sitcom‚ÄîWhen the Whistle Blows‚Äîwhich is heavily rewritten by BBC producers, resulting in it being a lowest-common-denominator comedy that relies on a multitude of catchphrases, offensive stereotypes and silly costumes for cheap laughs. Although the sitcom is commercially successful, pulling six million weekly viewers, it is a flop with critics who mercilessly bash both it and Andy. Andy periodically gets a chance to expand his repertoire in film and on stage but manages to ruin every opportunity that comes his way by either refusing to take direction, or by once again offending bigger stars than himself. In the series' 90-minute finale, the sitcom has made Andy financially successful and recognisable to many but he is increasingly frustrated with the show's quality and with his career not moving forward. Andy is convinced to fire Darren as his agent and become a client of a larger, more professional firm which he believes will accelerate his path upward. After taping a Christmas Special for When the Whistle Blows, he announces to the live studio audience that he is quitting the series effective immediately. His career falls into total stagnation and Andy is forced to take bit parts on various long-running British television series such as Doctor Who and Hotel Babylon. Eventually, his agent ceases to take his calls. Andy's relationship with Maggie sours as he frequently ignores her and spends all of the time they spend together complaining about not getting the opportunities he feels he deserves. When he crashes his agent's lunch meeting at a posh restaurant, he is bluntly told that he will never realise his dreams of having fame, fortune, prestige and respect. Crushed, Andy reluctantly agrees to lower his expectations for the sake of remaining modestly famous and successful and is cast in Celebrity Big Brother. While staying in the Celebrity Big Brother house, Andy openly reflects upon the price of fame and grows increasingly disenchanted with the culture of celebrity worship that has manifested itself throughout Western society. His despondency culminates in an emotional breakdown during a conversation with the other housemates. He tearfully turns to the camera and apologises to Maggie, who is watching the broadcast from her flat, for ignoring her and not heeding her advice to be grateful for the things he has managed to achieve. He voluntarily departs the house, ending his tenure on the show. Moved by the unexpected outpouring of emotion, a group of journalists eagerly awaits Andy's appearance at a press conference. Andy's agent returns and tells him that his emotional turn has instantly skyrocketed Andy's profile and that a number of A-list stars are requesting to meet him. As his agent prepares to introduce him to the throng of waiting press, Andy quietly slips out the back door of the studio where Maggie is waiting for him in her car. They drive off together with Andy seemingly turning his back on show business and accepting a life of anonymity. ==Episodes== There are twelve regular episodes and a 90-minute Christmas special. When the first series was originally broadcast in the UK, the episode featuring Ben Stiller was broadcast first, followed by the Ross Kemp and Vinnie Jones episode the following week. When the series was repeated over the Christmas holiday 2005, the episodes were returned to their intended order, with Ross Kemp first, followed by Stiller. The first series DVD, released in the UK on 31 October 2005, also preserves this same order, along with the Extras script book. When the first series was shown in North America, another order was used:HBO: Extras ‚Äì Episode 12, Season 2 # Kate Winslet # Ben Stiller # Ross Kemp & Vinnie Jones # Les Dennis # Samuel L. Jackson # Patrick Stewart ==UK and US version differences== There were some subtle changes between the UK and US versions, with references to the names of British celebrities often being changed to American celebrities for the US edition. In series 2, episode 1, Keith Chegwin's anti-gay tirade includes the sentence \\"Men have knobs, women have fannies. Pop knob in fanny. Not up the arse.\\" In British English \\"fanny\\" is a euphemism for vagina, while in American English \\"fanny\\" is a term for buttocks. A scene was shot, and aired in the US, in which Chegwin says \\"Men have dicks. Women have vaginas. Pop dick in vagina. Not up the bum.\\" In series 2, episode 3, in the scene where Darren Lamb tells Andy Millman about an offer that has come in for Andy to play a supporting role in a film, Lamb mistakenly says the film stars Billie Piper. For the American broadcast, an alternative take was used where Merchant's character says, \\"How do you fancy three days with Halle Berry?\\" In each case, Piper and Berry's names are mistaken for the name Harry Potter (actor Daniel Radcliffe guest stars in the episode). In series 2, episode 4, a scene featuring UK TV presenter Moira Stuart was completely excised from the US version and a song by Coldplay frontman Chris Martin replaced it; the latter was featured as a deleted scene on the DVD releases. In the Christmas special the talking \\"Jade Goody\\" doll was replaced by a talking \\"Kramer\\" doll. (Both dolls parodied incidents where each celebrity said things publicly that were generally seen as racist.) The T-shirt in the studio audience depicting Victoria Wood and Asda is replaced in the US version by a T-shirt depicting Sigourney Weaver and DirectTV. A scene with George Michael was also truncated to remove references to UK celebrities Richard and Judy and Catherine Tate. A scene set in the Carphone Warehouse was edited to remove jokes referring to the long running BBC soap opera EastEnders. ==When the Whistle Blows== When the Whistle Blows is the show- within-a-show sitcom created, co-written by and starring Andy Millman. It was first mentioned in episode 1.3, as a script that Millman had written and given to Darren, who neglected to read it (in a recurring joke, he would frequently forget the name of the show, often calling it When the Wind Blows and even confusing it with The Wind in the Willows). The script was turned into a sitcom on BBC One in the first-season finale, after Millman gave the script to Patrick Stewart. Excerpts from the sitcom are featured in the second season, and many of the Extras second season plotlines revolve around Millman's experiences on and around the show. When the Whistle Blows is set in a Wigan factory canteen. The humour is broad and lowbrow in the manner of many catchphrase-based sitcoms. The main catchphrase of the show, \\"Are you 'avin' a laugh?\\" is spoken by Millman. The show is unpopular with critics but popular with the public. It does receive a BAFTA nomination, although Millman suspects it is there simply to make up the numbers, and in the end it loses to an unspecified programme by Stephen Fry. Millman is deeply unhappy with the show, feeling that too many people have interfered with his original ideas in the hunt for ratings. It appears that Millman originally set out to do a comedy similar to The Office, with true-to-life characters in a realistic work environment, without a studio audience or canned laughter. After being forced to collaborate and compromise many of his ideas with producers at the BBC, the show is transformed into lowest common denominator fare with each character having his/her own catchphrase which are repeated ad nauseam to the delight of its 6 million viewers. The show is further debased by the unexplained guest appearance of Coldplay's Chris Martin, in episode 2.4, which bears no relation to the plot and which Millman openly opposes, going so far as to utter the on- camera line, \\"Chris Martin, what are you doing in a factory in Wigan? It's mental!\\" The presence of studio audiences, canned laughter, and the reliance on funny wigs, costumes and catchphrases for humour is a comment on British comedy hits such as Little Britain and The League of Gentlemen. Many people that Millman sees at the recording of the pilot wear T-shirts displaying comedy catchphrases, such as \\"Wassup\\", \\"It's Chico Time\\", \\"I'm a lady!\\", \\"Am I bovvered?\\" and \\"Garlic bread?.\\" (These shirts are not shown in the US version of Extras.) Some of the reviews that the show gets refer to it as a \\"time warp comedy\\", and Millman's character talks about 1970s catchphrases such as Mr Humphreys' \\"I'm Free\\" (from Are You Being Served?) and Frank Spencer's \\"Ooh Betty\\" (from Some Mothers Do 'Ave 'Em), suggesting that it is also partly sending up 1970s British comedy. In episode 2.5, Germaine Greer suggests that When the Whistle Blows is \\"sub Carry On\\". ==Music== The closing title track is called \\"Tea for the Tillerman\\", which is written and performed by Cat Stevens and is the title track of his album Tea for the Tillerman. The fourth episode of the second series of the show features a cover of the song performed by Chris Martin of Coldplay. The song in the Christmas Special highlighting Maggie's depression after she hits bottom and quits acting is \\"This Woman's Work\\" by Kate Bush. When Andy is having a bad time at The Ivy restaurant and leaves Maggie on her own, The Smiths' song \\"Please, Please, Please, Let Me Get What I Want\\" can be heard. ==Guest star cancellations and replacements== According to a segment in the extras section of the Series 1 DVD, Jude Law was scheduled to appear in one of the episodes, after meeting Gervais backstage on the Late Show with David Letterman, but had to pull out due to film commitments. This resulted in Gervais and Merchant having to scramble to find a replacement actor at the last minute, with Leonardo DiCaprio being considered and doggedly pursued. A featurette on the first series DVD release, \\"Finding Leo\\", consists of late-night video camera footage (shot mostly by Merchant) chronicling Gervais' desperate but ultimately unsuccessful attempts to contact DiCaprio's representatives. Law was ultimately replaced by Patrick Stewart in the series 1 finale, although a poster for the Jude Law film Alfie appeared at the end. Other actors who did not appear in Extras despite initial reports from Gervais that they would appear include Madonna, Brad Pitt, and Tom Cruise. Keith Harris turned down a part having read the script, telling The Independent \\"This isn't clever writing, it's pure filth\\". ==Awards and nominations== {  ! Award !!

The star is bright enough to be seen with the naked eye, having an apparent visual magnitude of 4.32 Based upon an annual parallax shift of 0.00991 arcseconds, it is located about 329 light- years from the Sun. At that distance, the visual magnitude of the star is reduced by an interstellar absorption factor of 0.06 because of extinction. == Nomenclature == Œª Leonis (Latinised to Lambda Leonis) is the star's Bayer designation.

The clock can be placed almost anywhere, if only the projected image must be seen. The image generated by most projection clocks is large enough that a nearsighted person can see it from a distance without glasses or contact lenses. Clocks usually have a conventional display on their body, in addition to the projector, Projection clocks are also used in advertising and merchandising. High-brightness analog projection clocks can superimpose a business' logo on top of the clock face, while there are low-brightness projection clocks designed for home use that project for example a logo in addition to the time. Some projection clocks are radio-controlled, synchronising with a broadcast time standard and always displaying the right time without the need to set them. They may also display other information such as temperature and humidity. ==History== Projection clocks were patented at least twice: once in 1909, and another time in 1940. Both patents have expired. Early projection clocks were universally analog but with the widespread adoption of digital clocks, digital projection clocks became the standard. ==Technology== A projection clock usually needs a backlight like an incandescent bulb or LED. There are low-brightness and high-brightness clocks. While the projection created by low-brightness clocks can be viewed only in a darkened room, high-brightness ones can also be viewed at bright light or daylight. ===Low-brightness projection clocks=== Most modern projection clocks have a red LED-based projector. Additional optional features not specific to projection clocks are the inclusion of a LED or LCD display in addition to the projector, an alarm function, and synchronisation to a broadcast time standard. ===High-brightness projection clocks=== Modern high-brightness projection clocks are in most cases analog, and have a halogen bulb backlight. In most cases they use a set of rotating and fixed transparent discs with hands and a face. An LCD is integrated into some clocks to combine analog and digital information on the projected image. Projectors used in projection clocks are similar to other projectors, and use the same optical principles. They usually use lenses although some projectors use the principle of shadow theater, vector or raster scanning. ==References== Category:Clocks ","title":"Projection clock"},{"id":"2225423","text":"Research institute AMOLF is part of the institutes organization of Netherlands Organisation for Scientific Research (NWO).

To reach this goal, a number of novelanalytical instrumentation were developed, starting with the development of mass-spectrometric tools. In 1953 AMOLF was the first European institute to successfully enrich Uranium. Soon after, research on thermal diffusion in gases followed, as did ultracentrifuge concepts, cathode dispersion, excitation of gases by using energetic ions and research on molecular beams. The gas-ultracentrifuge developed at AMOLF (under ) provided a base for the commercial enrichment of Uranium at the today well-known company of URENCO in Almelo. ==Structure and organization == AMOLF functions as an incubator for Dutch science, both in terms of launching new research themes and in terms of training talented scientists.

Lubok. 18th century Sirin is a mythological creature of Russian legends, with the head and chest of a beautiful woman and the body of a bird (usually an owl). According to myth, the Sirin lived in Vyraj or around the Euphrates River. This half-woman half-bird is directly based on the Greek myths and later folklore about sirens. She was usually portrayed wearing a crown or with a nimbus. Sirin sang beautiful songs to the saints, foretelling future blisses. The bird was dangerous. Men who heard her would forget everything on earth, follow her, and ultimately die. People would attempt to save themselves from Sirin by shooting cannons, ringing bells and making other loud noises to scare the bird off. Later (17-18th century), the image of Sirin changed and she started to symbolize world harmony (as she live near paradise). People in those times believed only happy people could hear a Sirin, while only very few could see one because she is as fast and difficult to catch as human happiness. She symbolizes eternal joy and heavenly happiness. According to folk tales, at the morning of the Apple Feast of the Saviour day, Sirin flies into the apple orchard and cries sadly. In the afternoon, the Alkonost flies to this place, beginning to rejoice and laugh. Alkonost brushes dew from her wings, granting healing powers to all fruits on the tree she is sitting on. The legend of Sirin might have been introduced to Rus' by Persian merchants in the 8th-9th century. In the cities of Chersonesos and Kiev she is often found on pottery, golden pendants, even on the borders of Gospel books of tenth-twelfth centuries. Furthermore, Sirin is connected to the Greek Siren. Due to the history, the Russian culture has experienced a very strong correlation with Greek culture and Byzantine Empire through its steppes, the Volga river and Dniepr river. Pomors often depicted Sirin on the illustrations in the Book of Genesis as birds sitting in paradise trees. Sometimes Sirin is seen as a metaphor for God's word going into the soul of a man. Sometimes she is seen as a metaphor of heretics tempting the weak. Sometimes Sirin was considered equivalent to the Polish Wila. In Russian folklore, Sirin was mixed with the revered religious writer Saint Ephrem the Syrian. Thus, peasant lyrists such as Nikolay Klyuev often used Sirin as a synonym for poet. ==Gallery== Image:Bilibin sirin bi.JPGIvan Bilibin's Sirin Image:Grebnev sirin postcard.JPGSirin (postcard) (1908) Image:Sirin lubok.jpgSirin Russian lubok 19th century Image:Sirin lubok1.jpgSirin Russian lubok 19th century Image:Vasnetsov Sirin Alkonost.jpgViktor Vasnetsov.

Jacobs Theatre, formerly called the Royale Theatre and the John Golden Theatre, is a Broadway theatre located at 242 West 45th Street (George Abbott Way) in Midtown Manhattan, New York City. ==History== Designed by architect Herbert J. Krapp, and built by the Chanin Construction Company, it opened as the Royale Theatre on January 11, 1927, with a musical entitled Piggy. Produced by William B. Friedlander, Piggy had a weak script, but the popular comedian Sam Bernard played the starring role and carried the show for 79 performances. Bernard died soon after the show closed. Built as part of a three theater complex, alongside the 800-seat Theatre Masque, the 1,600-seat Majestic, and the Lincoln Hotel (now the RowNYC Hotel and previously the Milford Plaza Hotel), the theater features an ornate stone facade, with vaulted large windows above the street frontage. The landmarked interior features murals by Willy Pogany and one balcony level all under an expansive vaulted plasterwork ceiling. With a seating capacity just over 1,100, the theater has been home to both plays and musical productions in its ninety-year history. Producer John Golden leased the theatre and renamed it for himself from 1932 to 1937 (when he moved to the Theatre Masque next door). The Shubert Organization then assumed ownership and initially leased the theatre to CBS Radio. In 1940, the Royale was restored to use as a legitimate theatre under its original name. On May 9, 2005, it was renamed for longtime Shubert Organization president Bernard B. Jacobs. The theatre has been closed as of March 12, 2020 due to the COVID-19 Pandemic. It does not plan on opening until January 3, 2021. ==Notable productions== * 1927: Piggy (opened January 11, 1927, closed March 19, 1927) * 1927: Rang Tang * 1928: Diamond Lil * 1933: Both Your Houses * 1934: Small Miracle * 1940: Du Barry Was a Lady * 1941: The Corn Is Green * 1946: The Glass Menagerie * 1947: Our Lan' * 1949: The Madwoman of Chaillot * 1952: New Faces of 1952 * 1954: The Immoralist * 1954: The Boy Friend * 1955: The Matchmaker * 1957: The Tunnel of Love * 1958: The Entertainer * 1958: Gigi * 1960: Becket * 1961: The Night of the Iguana * 1964: The Subject Was Roses * 1965: The Owl and the Pussycat; Cactus Flower * 1971: The Incomparable Max * 1972: Jacques Brel is Alive and Well and Living in Paris; Moonchildren; Grease * 1980: Whose Life is it Anyway?; A Day in Hollywood / A Night in the Ukraine * 1982: Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat * 1984: The Human Comedy * 1985: Pack of Lies; Song and Dance * 1988: Speed-the-Plow * 1989: Lend Me a Tenor * 1992: Conversations with My Father * 1994: An Inspector Calls * 1997: Triumph of Love * 1998: Art * 2000: Copenhagen * 2003: Anna in the Tropics, Ma Rainey's Black Bottom * 2004: A Raisin in the Sun * 2005: Glengarry Glen Ross * 2006: Three Days of Rain; Martin Short: Fame Becomes Me * 2007: Frost/Nixon; Rock 'n' Roll * 2008: The Country Girl; 13 * 2009: God of Carnage * 2010: Bloody Bloody Andrew Jackson * 2011: That Championship Season; The Mountaintop * 2012: Once * 2015: It's Only a Play; The Color Purple * 2017: Bandstand * 2018: The Iceman Cometh; The Ferryman * 2019: Betrayal * 2020: Company ==Box office record== Once achieved the box office record for the Bernard B.

As was the case with their other early albums, it was recorded with a full orchestra.

In an interview with Songfacts, Keith Domone (official biographer of Barclay James Harvest with his wife Monika) said John Lees wrote \\"Mocking Bird\\" back in 1968 while he was living with the parents of his future wife, Olwen.

Turkish is a highly agglutinative language, in that much of the grammar is expressed by means of suffixes added to nouns and verbs. It is very regular compared with many European languages. For example, evlerden \\"from the houses\\" can be analysed as ev \\"house\\", -ler (plural suffix), -den (ablative case, meaning \\"from\\"); gidiyorum \\"I am going\\" as git \\"go\\", -iyor (present continuous tense), -um (1st person singular = \\"I\\"). Another characteristic of Turkish is vowel harmony. Most suffixes have two or four different forms, the choice between which depends on the vowel of the word's root or the preceding suffix: for example, the ablative case of evler is evlerden \\"from the houses\\" but, the ablative case of ba≈ülar \\"heads\\" is ba≈ülardan \\"from the heads\\". Verbs have six grammatical persons (three singular and three plural), various voices (active and passive, reflexive, reciprocal, and causative), and a large number of grammatical tenses. Meanings such as \\"not\\", \\"be able\\", \\"must\\" and \\"if\\", which are expressed as separate words in most European languages, are usually expressed with verbal suffixes in Turkish. A characteristic of Turkish which is shared by neighboring languages such as Bulgarian and Persian is that the perfect tense suffix (in Turkish -mi≈ü-, -m√º≈ü-, -mƒ±≈ü-, or -mu≈ü-) often has an inferential meaning, e.g. geliyormu≈üum \\"it would seem (they say) that I am coming\\". Verbs also have a number of participial forms, which Turkish makes much use of. Clauses which begin with \\"who\\" or \\"because\\" in English are generally translated by means of participial phrases in Turkish. In Turkish, verbs generally come at the end of the sentence or clause; adjectives and possessive nouns come before the noun they describe; and meanings such as \\"behind\\", \\"for\\", \\"like/similar to\\" etc. are expressed as postpositions following the noun rather than prepositions before it. ==IntroductionSuffixes=== A suffix (ek) is attached to a stem (g√∂vde). A stem may be a root (k√∂k) or further analyzable. The suffixes used in Turkish fall roughly into two classes: constructive suffixes (yapƒ±m ekleri) and inflectional suffixes (√ßekim ekleri). A constructive suffix makes a new word from an old one, that is, it is a derivational suffix. An inflectional suffix indicates how a word is used in a sentence. The article on Turkish grammar pertains chiefly to inflectional suffixes. The article on Turkish vocabulary treats the constructive suffixes. The vowels of suffixes undergo vowel harmony. When a suffix is attached to a stem, the vowel in the suffix generally agrees in frontness or backness and in roundedness with the last vowel in the stem or of the preceding suffix. Some suffixes show two-way vowel harmony between e and a, for example the plural suffix -ler/-lar. The e form is found after a syllable with i, e, √∂ or √º (e.g. evler \\"houses\\", g√ºnler \\"days\\"), and also after certain Arabic or French borrowings such as saatler \\"hours, clocks\\", kalpler \\"hearts\\". Other suffixes show four-way vowel harmony between i, ƒ±, u, √º, for example the possessive ending -im/-ƒ±m/-um/-√ºm \\"my\\". These endings are found after syllables containing their own vowels or after e, a, o, √∂ respectively (e.g. evim \\"my house\\", g√∂z√ºm \\"my eye\\", etc.) A Turkish suffix can be called enclitic if its vowel undergoes vowel harmony, agreeing with the last vowel of the stem the suffix is attached to. ===Gender=== Turkish is a gender-neutral language except for a few sex-specific compound words (mostly naming professions). The English third-person singular pronouns she, he, and it all correspond to a single Turkish pronoun, o. Since many given names in Turkish are also gender-neutral, it is possible to describe someone without their sex being made known. ===Person=== Turkish has a strong T‚ÄìV distinction, using the second-person plural as the formal form, as in French and many other languages. Turkish also uses various honorifics. T‚ÄìV distinction Family members and friends speak to one another using the second singular person sen, and adults use sen to address minors. In formal situations (meeting people for the first time, business, customer-clerk, colleagues) plural second-person siz is used almost exclusively. In very formal situations, double plural second-person sizler may refer to a much-respected person. Rarely, third-person plural conjugation of the verb (but not the pronoun) may be used to emphasize utmost respect. In the imperative, there are three forms: second person singular for informal, second person plural for formal, and double plural second person for very formal situations. Thus, the imperative forms of the verb gelmek, \\"to come\\", are gel (second person singular, informal), gelin (second person plural, formal), and geliniz (double second-person plural, very formal). The very formal forms are not frequently used. Honorifics Turkish honorifics generally follow the first name, especially if they refer to gender or particular social statuses (e.g. Bay (Mr.), Hanƒ±m (Ms.), Hoca (teacher)). Such honorifics are used both in formal and informal situations. A newer honorific is Sayƒ±n, which precedes the surname or full name, and is not gender-specific. (e.g. Sayƒ±n Name Surname, or Sayƒ±n Surname, or Sayƒ±n Name Bey/Hanƒ±m). They are generally used in very formal situations. While these honorifics are normally used in pre-position to Turkish first names, for foreigners, names are preceded by Bay (Mr.) or Bayan (Ms.): Bay [Fox] Mulder, Bayan [Dana] Scully (cf. Fox [Mulder] Bey, Dana [Scully] Hanƒ±m, if these names were Turkish).http://www.thexfiles- tr.net/senaryo5x07.htm ===Turkish terminology=== In the Turkish terms for the constructive and inflectional endings, three roots are involved: *ek \\"supplement, affix\\" (notably Turkish has no prefixes) *yap- \\"make\\" *√ßek- \\"pull, draw\\" For the last two verbal roots, the constructive suffix -im can be added to form nouns for instances of the actions denoted by the roots: *yapƒ±m \\"construction\\"; *√ßekim \\"[a] pull or draw\\" (or a \\"take\\" in cinema). Either of these nouns can be compounded with the noun ek, resulting in an indefinite compound (belirtisiz tamlama), the sign of which is the inflectional suffix -i attached to ek: *yapƒ±m eki \\"structure-suffix\\"; *√ßekim eki \\"inflection-suffix\\". The inflectional suffix -ler comes before the -i to form the plural, so yapƒ±m ekleri, √ßekim ekleri. Many words in Turkish-- particularly many grammatical terms-- are neologisms invented to replace earlier words borrowed from Arabic or Persian, which have largely been successful at permanently superseding the previously-used foreign terms. (See the main article on Turkish language.) In some cases, the foreign term continues to be in use alongside the neologism. ==Parts of speech== There are nine parts of speech (s√∂z t√ºrleri \\"word-kinds\\") in Turkish. #noun (isim or ad \\"name\\"); #pronoun (zamir \\"inner being\\", or adƒ±l from ad); #adjective (sƒ±fat \\"role, quality\\", or √∂nad \\"front-noun\\"); #verb (fiil \\"act, deed\\", or eylem \\"action\\" from eyle- \\"make, do\\"). #adverb (zarf \\"envelope\\", or belirte√ß from belir- \\"determine\\"); #postposition (ilge√ß from ilgi \\"interest, relation\\"); #conjunction (baƒüla√ß from baƒü \\"bond\\"); #particle (edat, or ilge√ß); #interjection (nid√¢ [obsolete], or √ºnlem from √ºn \\"fame, repute, sound\\"). Postpositions are analogous to prepositions in English, the main difference being that they follow their objects. Postpositions can be considered particles, but there are particles in Turkish that are not postpositions. Only nouns, pronouns and verbs are inflected in Turkish. An adjective can usually be treated as a noun or pronoun, in which case it can also be inflected. Inflection can give a noun features of a verb such as person and tense. With inflection, a verb can become one of the following: * verbal noun (isim-fiil); * verbal adjective (sƒ±fat-fiil) or participle (orta√ß); * verbal adverb (called a gerund by Lewis (1967)). These have peculiarities not shared with other nouns, adjectives or adverbs. For example, some participles take a person the way verbs do. Also, a verbal noun or adverb can take a direct object. Some verbal nouns are not inflected forms in Turkish but are borrowed from Arabic or other languages. In Turkish, an ascriptive clause can be composed of a common noun standing alone as the Predicative, both the Subject and the Predicator being implicit and assumed from the situation. Example: :k√∂pek ‚Äì \\"dog\\" :K√∂pek. ‚Äì \\"It is a dog.\\" This means that both a noun and a verb can alone constitute an affirmative clause in Turkish, which is not the case in English. There are two standards for listing verbs in dictionaries. Most dictionaries follow the tradition of spelling out the infinitive form of the verb as the headword of the entry, but others such as the Redhouse Turkish-English Dictionary are more technical and spell out the stem of the verb instead, that is, they spell out a string of letters that is useful for producing all other verb forms through morphological rules. Similar to the latter, this article follows the stem-as-citeword standard. * Infinitive: ko≈ümak (\\"to run\\") * Stem: ko≈ü- (\\"run\\") In Turkish, the verbal stem is also the second-person singular imperative form. Example: :ko≈ü- (stem meaning \\"run\\") :Ko≈ü! (\\"Run!\\") Many verbs are formed from nouns by addition of -le. For example: :k√∂pek ‚Äì \\"dog\\" :k√∂pekle ‚Äì \\"dog paddle\\" (in any of several ways) The aorist tense of a verb is formed by adding -(i/e)r. The plural of a noun is formed by suffixing -ler. Hence, the suffix -ler can indicate either a plural noun or a finite verb: :K√∂pek + ler ‚Äì \\"(They are) dogs.\\" :K√∂pekle + r ‚Äì \\"S/he dog paddles.\\" Most adjectives can be treated as nouns or pronouns. For example, gen√ß can mean \\"young\\", \\"young person\\", or \\"the young person being referred to\\". An adjective or noun can stand, as a modifier, before a noun. If the modifier is a noun (but not a noun of material), then the second noun word takes the inflectional suffix -i: :ak di≈ü ‚Äì \\"white tooth\\" :altƒ±n di≈ü ‚Äì \\"gold tooth\\" :k√∂pek di≈üi ‚Äì \\"canine tooth\\" Comparison of adjectives is not done by inflecting adjectives or adverbs, but by other means (described below). Adjectives can serve as adverbs, sometimes by means of repetition: :yava≈ü ‚Äì \\"slow\\" :yava≈ü yava≈ü ‚Äì \\"slowly\\" ==Word order== A general rule of Turkish word order is that the modifier precedes the modified: *adjective (used attributively) precedes noun; *adverb precedes verb; *object of postposition precedes postposition. Although the most common order of Turkish transitive sentences is subject‚Äìobject‚Äìverb (SOV), all six permutations are valid (the subject and object are distinguished by case suffixes). The word order serves to express the theme and focus (rheme) of the sentence. The sentence initial portion is associated with the topic, the position just before the verb is used for the focus, and the post verbal position is used for background or clarifying information E.E. Erguvanli 1984 The function of Word Order in Turkish Grammar. University of California Press. UCLA PhD Dissertation 1979Hoffman, B. (1994) Generating Context-Appropriate Word Orders in Turkish in Proceedings of the Seventh International Workshop on Natural Language Generation Pages 117-126 https://arxiv.org/abs/cmp-lg/9407017v1 The following sentences illustrate how Subject-Object-Verb order changes the meaning. In the English translations given here, the focus of the sentence is given in all capitals, while the background information (known from earlier in the discourse) is given in parenthesis. {  + !Word order !Turkish !Gloss !English !Notes - SOV Ali eve gidiyor. Ali to-house is- going Ali is going home.  - OSV Eve Ali gidiyor. to-house Ali is-going Ali is going home.  - SVO Ali gidiyor eve. Ali is-going to house Ali is going home.  - OVS Eve gidiyor Ali. to-house is-going Ali Ali is going home. Same as SOV (anacoluthon). - VSO Gidiyor Ali eve. is-going Ali to- house There goes Ali home. Anacoluthon - VOS Gidiyor eve Ali. is-going to-house Ali There goes Ali home. Anacoluthon } Meanings may be different depending on emphasis. In one study, only about half of the transitive sentences used by a sample of Turkish speakers were found to be in the SOV order.Slobin, D.I. and Bever, G.T. Children use Canonical Sentence Schemas: A Cross-linguistic Study of Word Order and Inflections. Cognition, 12:229-265, 1982 When a sentence has a multiple informational components, the stressed component is positioned just before the verb: {  + !Turkish !Gloss !English - Ali bug√ºn eve arabayla gidiyor. Ali today to-house by-car is-going Today, Ali is going to the house by car. - Ali eve arabayla bug√ºn gidiyor. Ali to-house by-car today is-going Today, Ali is going to the house by car. - Ali arabayla bug√ºn eve gidiyor. Ali by-car today to-house is- going Today, Ali is going to the house by car. } ==Morpheme order== The order of morphemes in Turkish is often opposite to English: {class =  !Turkish !English !Comment - Avrupa align=\\"right\\" Europe  - Avrupalƒ± align=\\"right\\" of Europe / European adjective (European) - Avrupalƒ±la≈ü align=\\"right\\" become European (intransitive) verb root - Avrupalƒ±la≈ütƒ±r align=\\"right\\" Europeanise (transitive) verb root - Avrupalƒ±la≈ütƒ±rama align=\\"right\\" be unable to Europeanise negated verb root - Avrupalƒ±la≈ütƒ±ramadƒ±k align=\\"right\\" we couldn't Europeanise participle - Avrupalƒ±la≈ütƒ±ramadƒ±k align=\\"right\\" one that is unable to be Europeanised noun - Avrupalƒ±la≈ütƒ±ramadƒ±klar align=\\"right\\" unable to be Europeanised ones plural - Avrupalƒ±la≈ütƒ±ramadƒ±klarƒ±mƒ±z align=\\"right\\" they, who we couldn't manage to Europeanise possessive, 1st person plural - Avrupalƒ±la≈ütƒ±ramadƒ±klarƒ±mƒ±zdan align=\\"right\\" of them who we couldn't manage to Europeanise ablative case - Avrupalƒ±la≈ütƒ±ramadƒ±klarƒ±mƒ±zdanmƒ±≈ü align=\\"right\\" is reportedly of ours that were unable to Europeanise copula in inferential tense - Avrupalƒ±la≈ütƒ±ramadƒ±klarƒ±mƒ±zdanmƒ±≈üsƒ±nƒ±z align=\\"right\\" you are reportedly of ours that were unable to Europeanise 2nd person plural/formal - Avrupalƒ±la≈ütƒ±ramadƒ±klarƒ±mƒ±zdanmƒ±≈üsƒ±nƒ±zcasƒ±na align=\\"right\\" as if you were reportedly of ours that were unable to Europeanise Adverb of equalization/possibility } The above example is also illustrative of the productive nature of Turkish suffixes in creating new verbs, nouns, etc. Note that the word Avrupalƒ±la≈ütƒ±ramadƒ±k can be a verb, a participle, or a noun; In this parse, it is a participle, or verbal adjective, that is used as a noun. The longest published word in Turkish, muvaffakiyetsizle≈ütiricile≈ütiriveremeyebileceklerimizdenmi≈üsinizcesine, means \\"as if you are one of those that we cannot easily convert into an unsuccessful-person-maker\\" (i.e., someone who un-educates people to make them unsuccessful). ==Inflectional suffixes== : For case endings, see The plural suffix (√ßoƒüul eki) can be used with nouns and with third-person verbs: * -ler (front vowel harmony: e, i, √∂, √º) * -lar (back vowel harmony: a, ƒ±, o, u) Nouns are derived from verbs in several ways. The number of ways of forming verbal nouns (fiil isimleri) from verb-stems can be debated; here are three: :{ class= + Verbal-noun suffixes - ! description !! suffix - infinitive (mastar \\"template\\") -mek - gerund -me - \\"way of doing VERB\\" -(y)i≈ü } Several series of endings show distinctions of person (ki≈üi); they are given here, along with the personal pronouns for comparison: :{class= + Indicators of person - !colspan=2personcolspan=21stcolspan=22ndcolspan=23rd - !colspan=2number/ - align=center !colspan=2personal pronouns benbizsensizoonlar - align=center !colspan=2suffixes of possession (iyelik ekleri) -(i)m-(i)miz-(i)n-(i)niz-(s)i-leri - align=center !rowspan=4personal endings (ki≈üi ekleri) !predicative (I) -(y)im-(y)iz-sin-siniz‚Äî-ler - align=center !verbal (II) -m-k-n-niz‚Äî-ler - align=center !optative (III) -(y)eyim-(y)elim-(y)esin-(y)esiniz-(y)e-(y)eler - align=center !imperative (IV)   ‚Äî-(y)in(iz)-sin-sinler } The names given to the personal endings here are not standard. These endings are often just referred to as type I, II, III, and IV respectively; but the order in which the types are numbered is also not standard. Lewis (1967) refers to the suffixes of possession as \\"personal\\" endings. In the third person, plural number is not always explicitly marked, and the same form is used for both singular and plural. If the plural suffix -ler is used, it combines with the personal endings as indicated in the final column of the table. A \\"suffix of possession\\" gives the person of the possessor of the object named by the noun to which the suffix is attached; it also indicates a subject for a participle. (See .) A \\"predicative\\" ending can assign a person to a noun, thus creating a complete sentence: :insan \\"human\\" ‚Üí ƒ∞nsanƒ±m. \\"I am a human.\\" See also and Turkish copula. All of the personal suffixes can be used in the formation of verbs. Verb-stems have been mentioned. A verb-base is obtained from a verb- stem by attachment of certain suffixes or characteristics given below. Then the personal endings here called \\"predicative\\" and \\"verbal\\" attach only to verb-bases; the optative and imperative endings attach to verb-stems. :{ class= + Verb characteristics - !rowspan=8with predicative endings !colspan=2progressive -mekte - !colspan=2necessitative -meli - !rowspan=3aorist (habitual)The term \\"aorist\\" is often used in Turkish grammars for the habitual aspect. This is quite different from its use in Greek grammars, where it means perfective aspect: what is called \\"definite past\\" in Turkish.!!positive -(i/e)r - !negative -mez - !impotential -(y)emez - !colspan=2future -(y)ecek - !colspan=2inferential perfective -mi≈ü - !colspan=2imperfective The imperfective aspect is often called \\"present\\", though it is not actually present tense -iyor - !rowspan=2with verbal endings!!colspan=2perfectiveThe perfective aspect is often called \\"definite past\\", though it is not actually past tense -di - !colspan=2conditional -se } The first syllable of the present/imperfective tense suffix (-iyor) exhibits vowel harmony while the second is invariable. When suffixed to a stem ending in a vowel, that vowel is elided: ye- + -iyor ‚Üí yiyor. The aorist negative and impotential forms are given here because they are anomalous. Note, that the -z of the aorist negative (-mez) and impotential (-(y)emez) is dropped in the first-person singular and plural, in order to be able to suffix it (but is retained when the interrogative particle mi intervenes; see below). (Aorist negative first-person singular: -mem; but: aorist impotential third- person plural: -(y)emezler.) See also Negation and potential in verb-stems under below. Some third-person verbs also function as participles. Participles can be classified as personal, if they take a suffix of possession, and impersonal, if they do not. The following suffixes attach to verb-stems: :{ class= + Participial endings - !colspan=2 impersonalpersonal - !rowspan=3aorist!!positive -(i/e)rrowspan=4 - !negative -mez - !impotential -(y)emez - !colspan=2imperfective -(y)en - !colspan=2future colspan=2 align=center-(y)ecek - !colspan=2perfective -mi≈ü-dik } The interrogative particle (soru eki) is not written as a suffix, but phonetically it is enclitic; in particular, it exhibits vowel harmony: * mi (front- unrounded vowel harmony: i, after e and i) * mƒ± (back-unrounded vowel harmony: ƒ±, after a and ƒ±) * mu (back-rounded vowel harmony: u, after o and u) * m√º (front-rounded vowel harmony: √º, after √∂ and √º) ==NounsInflection=== A Turkish noun has no gender. The dictionary-form of a noun can take up to four (kinds of) #Inflectional suffixes, generally in the following order: # plural suffix; # suffix of possession (iyelik eki from iye \\"owner\\"); # case-ending; # personal suffix (ki≈üi eki from ki≈üi \\"person\\"). Through its presence or absence, the plural ending shows distinctions of number. Number A noun is made plural by addition of -ler or -lar (depending on the vowel harmony). When a numeral is used with a noun, however, the plural suffix is usually not used: :{ -  ba≈ü  \\"head\\" -  ba≈ülar  \\"[some] heads\\" -  be≈ü ba≈ü  \\"five head(s)\\", but -  Be≈üevler  \\"Five Houses\\" (district of Bursa) } The plural ending also allows a family (living in one house) to be designated by a single member: :{ -  Aliler  \\"Ali and his family\\" -  teyze  \\"maternal aunt\\" -  teyzem  \\"my maternal aunt\\" -  teyzemler  \\"my maternal aunt and her family\\" } In the last example, the first-person singular suffix of possession comes before the plural ending; this is an exception to the order of suffixes given above. In the usual order, we have: :teyzelerim \\"my maternal aunts\\" Nouns are pluralized in standard temporal greetings. : g√ºn (\\"day\\") ‚Äì ƒ∞yi g√ºnler! (\\"Good day!\\") : yƒ±l (\\"year\\") ‚Äì Mutlu yƒ±llar! (\\"Happy new year!\\") Possession As noted earlier, the suffixes of possession give the person (and number) of the possessor of what is named by the noun: {  style=\\"min-width: 35%;\\" + Suffixes of Possession (iyelik ekleri) - ! !! 1st !! 2nd !! 3rd - ! singular  -(i)m  -(i)n  -(s)i - ! plural  -(i)miz  -(i)niz  -leri } When a word takes one of the endings of possession, the word becomes the name of something possessed, not possessing. The word for the possessor, if present, takes the genitive case ending. {  + Examples with teyze (\\"maternal aunt\\") - ! Example !! Composition !! Translation -  teyzen  teyze \\"maternal aunt\\" + -n \\"belonging to you (singular)\\"  \\"your maternal aunt\\" -  teyzeniz  teyze \\"maternal aunt\\" + -niz \\"belonging to you (plural)\\"  \\"your maternal aunt\\" -  teyzelerin  teyze \\"maternal aunt\\" + -ler- (plural suffix) + -in \\"belonging to you (singular)\\"  \\"your maternal aunts\\" -  teyzeleriniz  teyze \\"maternal aunt\\" + -ler- (plural suffix) + -iniz \\"belonging to you (plural)\\"  \\"your maternal aunts\\" } The plural ending will not be attached twice to the same word; therefore ambiguity is possible: :{ -  fikir  \\"idea\\" -  fikirleri  \\"their idea\\" or \\"their ideas\\" or \\"his/her ideas\\" } Ambiguity can be resolved with #Pronouns. Case Turkish cases and case endings (durum ekleri from dur- \\"stop, last\\", or h√¢l ekleri from h√¢l \\"state, condition\\") can be named (in English) and used roughly as in Latin: { class= + Cases and their endings - ! Case !! Turkish Name !! Ending !! Example -  Absolute  yalƒ±n (\\"bare\\") durum  -‚àÖ-  ev (\\"house\\") -  Definite Accusative  belirtme (\\"clarifying\\") durumu  -(y)ƒ±-, -(y)i-, -(y)u-, -(y)√º-  evi -  Dative  y√∂nelme (\\"going-towards\\") durumu  -(y)a-, -(y)e-  eve -  Locative  bulunma (\\"being-present\\") durumu  -da-, -de-, -ta-, -te- evde -  Ablative  √ßƒ±kma (\\"going-out\\") durumu  -dan-, -den-, -tan-, -ten- evden -  Genitive  tamlayan (\\"compounding\\") eki  -(n)ƒ±n-, -(n)in-, -(n)un-, -(n)√ºn-  evin } :If a case ending is attached to a demonstrative pronoun (which ends in o or u), or to a noun that has already taken a third-person ending of possession, then the case ending is preceded by n (and the parenthetical y is not used). The absolute case combines the uses of the nominative, vocative, and (in part) accusative cases. It is for subjects, and for names of people being addressed. It is also used for indefinite direct objects. Definite direct objects are in the definite- accusative case: :{ -  ≈üiir  \\"poem\\"  (absolute case) -  ≈ûiir okur.  \\"S/he reads a poem/poetry.\\"  (absolute case, indefinite direct object) -  ≈ûiiri okur.  \\"S/he reads the poem.\\"  (accusative case, definite direct object) } The dative case tells whither, that is, the place to which. Thus it has roughly the meaning of the English prepositions \\"to\\" and \\"into\\", and also \\"in\\" when it can be replaced with \\"into\\": :{ -  Birayƒ±  buzdolabƒ±na  koy. -  the-beer  into-icebox  put -  colspan=3  \\"Put the beer in(to) the fridge.\\" } The dative also is for objects, usually indirect objects, but sometimes objects that in English would be considered direct: :{ -  G√ºne≈üin  batƒ±≈üƒ±na  bak. -  sun's  at-its-sinking  look -  colspan=3  \\"Look at the sunset.\\" } :{ -  H√ºk√ºmete  g√ºven. -  in-government  trust -  colspan=2  \\"Trust the government.\\" } The locative case tells where, hence corresponds to the English prepositions \\"at\\", \\"on\\", and \\"in\\" (when it does not mean \\"into\\"). : ev \\"house\\" ‚Üí evde \\"at home\\" :{ -  Buzdolabƒ±nda  d√∂rt  bira  var -  in-icebox  four  beer  exist -  colspan=4  \\"There are four beers in the fridge.\\" } The ablative case tells whence, that is, the place from which (or through which), hence: *material out of which something is made; :{ -  kumdan  yapƒ±lmƒ±≈ü  kale -  of-sand  made  castle -  colspan=3  \\"castle made of sand\\" } *a cause by which something is effected; :{ -  a√ßlƒ±ktan  √∂l -  of-hunger  die -  colspan=3  \\"die of hunger\\" } *that to which other things are being compared (see #Adjectives below). In Turkish terminology, the genitive case indicates a \\"compounding\\" (tamlayan) word. The corresponding \\"compounded\\" (tamlanan) word will take the appropriate suffix of possession. The pair of these words is then a definite compound (belirtili tamlama): :{ -  anne  \\"mother\\" -  annesi  \\"her mother\\" -  Ay≈üe'nin annesi  \\"Ay≈üe's mother\\" } (The apostrophe in Turkish is used before suffixes attached to proper nouns.) However, if two nouns are connected, but not by ownership, then the second noun generally takes an ending of possession, while the first takes no ending. The result is an indefinite compound (belirtisiz tamlama): :{ -  T√ºrkiye'nin Cumhurba≈ükanƒ±  \\"The President of Turkey\\" (definite) -  T√ºrkiye Cumhuriyeti  \\"The Republic of Turkey\\" (indefinite) } If one noun names a material, the other noun need not take an ending: :{ -  nik√¢h y√ºz√ºƒü√º  \\"wedding ring\\" -  altƒ±n y√ºz√ºk  \\"gold ring\\" } Predication If a noun is to be in the first or second person, one of the predicative suffixes (or type-I personal suffixes) will show this. {  - ! !! 1st !! 2nd !! 3rd - ! singular  -(y)im  -sin  ‚Äî - ! plural  -(y)iz  -siniz  -ler } Examples : d√ºnya \\"world\\" ‚Üí D√ºnyayƒ±z. \\"We are the world.\\" : √ßocuk \\"child\\" ‚Üí √áocuklarsƒ±nƒ±z. \\"You are the children\\" In the third person, no ending is required. However, the ending -dir can be used; it is saidLewis, 1967: VIII,3 to be the remnant of a verb turur \\"S/he stands\\". Again in the third person, the plural suffix may be used: :{ -  T√ºrk or T√ºrkt√ºr  \\"S/he is Turkish\\" -  T√ºrkler or T√ºrkt√ºrler  \\"They are Turkish\\" -  T√ºrklerdir  \\"They are the Turks\\" Lewis, 1967: VIII,5 } Several suffixes can be combined: :{  colspan=4  Evinizdeyim. -  ev-  -iniz  -de-  -yim -  house  your (plural)  at (locative case)  I am (1st-sing. predicative) -  colspan=4  \\"I am at your house.\\" } ===Verbal nouns=== The infinitive, formed with -mek as noted earlier, does not take a suffix of possession, or the genitive case-ending. It does take all other case-endings. In particular, the progressive characteristic given earlier is the infinitive ending with the locative ending: :Konu≈ümaktayƒ±z ‚Äì \\"We are in (the act of) speaking.\\" :Sava≈ümaktayƒ±z ‚Äì \\"We are in warmaking\\", that is, \\"We are at war.\\" The verbal noun in -me is called a gerund above, since it corresponds roughly to the English gerund. :bekle \\"wait\\" ‚Üí bekleme \\"waiting\\": bekleme odasƒ± \\"waiting room\\" The verbal noun can take a suffix of possession and any case-ending: :{  Beklemeniz  l√¢zƒ±m. -  your-waiting  necessary -  colspan=2  \\"You have to wait.\\" } :{  Sesini  duymayƒ±  seviyorum. -  your-voice-  hearing-  I-love -  colspan=3  \\"I like to hear your voice.\\" } The dative form of a Turkish gerund can correspond precisely to an English infinitive with to: :{  √úlkemizde  nano  teknolojik  √ºr√ºnler  √ºretilmeye  ba≈ülandƒ±. -  In-our-country  nano  technological  products  to-be- produced  began -  colspan=6  \\"Nano-technological products began to be produced in our country.\\"Cumhuriyet Bilim-Teknik 13 August 2005, p. 1 } The suffix -i≈ü can also be used to create verbal nouns: :{ class= ! Verb !! Noun -  y√ºr√º- \\"walk\\"  y√ºr√ºy√º≈ü \\"walk, walking\\" -  yaƒü- \\"rain\\"  yaƒüƒ±≈ü \\"rain\\" -  al- \\"take\\" + ver- \\"give/spend\\"  alƒ±≈üveri≈ü \\"shopping\\" -  yara- \\"be of use\\", yaratƒ±l- \\"be created\\"  yaratƒ±lƒ±≈ü \\"creation\\" } The verb et- \\"make, do\\" can be considered as an auxiliary verb, since for example it is often used with verbal nouns borrowed from other languages, such as Arabic: kabul et- \\"accept\\" (kabul \\"[an] accepting\\"); reddet- \\"reject\\" (ret \\"[a] rejecting\\"); ziyaret et- \\"visit\\" (ziyaret \\"[a] visiting\\"). Considered as units, these are transitive verbs; but the nouns in them can also, by themselves, take direct objects: Antalya'yƒ± ziyaret \\"visit to Antalya\\". What looks like an ablative gerund is usually an adverb; the ending -meden usually has the sense of \\"without\\". See #Adverbs below. An infinitive in the absolute case can be the object of a verb such as iste- \\"want\\": Kimi eƒüitime devam etmek, \\"Some-of-them towards-education continuation make kimi de √ßalƒ±≈ümak istiyor. some-of-them also work want\\" that is, \\"Some want to continue their education, and some want to work\\" (source: Cumhuriyet Pazar Dergi, 14 August 2005, p. 1.) Note here that the compound verb devam et- \\"continue, last\\" does not take a direct object, but is complemented by a dative noun. Another way to express obligation (besides with l√¢zƒ±m as in the earlier example) is by means of zor \\"trouble, compulsion\\" and an infinitive: Gitmek zoru \\"Go compulsion\\", Gitmek zorundayƒ±z \\"We must go\\". (Source: same as the last example.) Both an infinitive and a gerund are objects of the postposition i√ßin \\"for\\" in the third sentence of the quotation within the following quotation: A free translation is: > The facility authorities said: \\"The people of this district [namely Edremit, > Van] are generally conservative. They cannot enter the lake comfortably, > because the shore areas are near the road. So we are using a screen, both to > close off the view of passersby on the road, and so that men will not cause > discomfort.\\" However, children cannot be prevented from spying on the other > side through gaps in the screen. ===Auxiliary verbs=== Certain verbs in Turkish are used to enhance the meaning of other verbs, or to agglutinate verbs from nouns. These verbs are called auxiliary verbs. A concise list follows: Verbs that are used with nouns to agglutinate new verbs * etmek * olmak * kƒ±lmak * eylemek Examples * farz (assumption) ‚Üí farz etmek (to assume) * hak (right) ‚Üí hak etmek (to deserve) * af (amnesty) ‚Üí affetmek (to excuse) * kayƒ±p (loss) ‚Üí kaybetmek (to lose) * terk (leaving) ‚Üí terk etmek (to leave) * arz (submission, supply) ‚Üí arz etmek (to submit, to supply) If there is a change in the noun root through the process of agglutination, it is written adjacently. These are mostly Arabic loan-words, which switch to their more original form. In Turkish words, two consonants of a syllable need a vowel to be pronounced. There are exceptions in loan words only, but those that lost their original form are more common. This occurs in two ways: If a word ends in two identical consonants, one is dropped, e.g. hall (\\"state, status\\") becomes hal; aff (\\"amnesty, forgiving\\") becomes af. If a syllable ends in two different consonants, a vowel is added between them; e.g., h√ºkm (\\"judgement\\") becomes h√ºk√ºm. Exceptions: Words which end in nk, rt, rk, such as (\\"throne\\"), renk (\\"colour\\"), kart (\\"card\\"), do not add a vowel. Most of these are loan-words from Persian or Western languages (but zevk \\"pleasure\\" from Arabic ÿ∞ŸéŸàŸíŸÇ). Examples { class= - ! Noun & Auxiliary Verb !! Verb !! Notes -  kayƒ±p + etmek  kaybetmek (\\"to lose\\")  kayƒ±p (\\"lost\\") was originally kayb, an Arabic loanword -  haciz + etmek  haczetmek (\\"to sequester\\")  haciz (\\"sequestration\\") was originally hacz, an Arabic loanword -  haz + etmek  hazzetmek (\\"to relish, enjoy\\")  haz (\\"delight\\") was originally hazz, an Arabic loanword } Verbs that are used with other verbs to enhance the meaning: * -(i)vermek (implies urgency) * -(e)bilmek (implies ability) * -(e)durmak (implies continuity) * -(e)gelmek (implies repetition) * -(a)kalmak (implies continuity) * -(e)yazmak (implies a close escape) Examples * d√º≈ü- (fall) ‚Üí d√º≈üeyazdƒ±m (I almost fell) * git- (go) ‚Üí gidiverdim (I just went) * yava≈üla- (slow down) ‚Üí yava≈ülayabilirim (I can slow down) * yaz- (write) ‚Üí yazaduruyorlar (they keep on writing) * s√∂yle- (tell) ‚Üí s√∂ylenegelir (keeps being told) ==Adjectives== Adjectives used attributively precede the noun; used predicatively, they follow, unless something other than word order shows that they are being used predicatively: :{ class= - ! Attributive  ye≈üil √ßim  \\"[the] green grass\\" - ! rowspan=2  Predicative  √áim ye≈üil(dir).  rowspan=2  \\"Grass is green.\\" -  Ye≈üildir √ßim. } ===Descriptive adjectives=== Most adjectives in the dictionary are descriptive. The two most fundamental descriptive adjectives are: * var (\\"existing\\") * yok (\\"not existing\\") These are used only predicatively: * with the sense of the English \\"There is\\" and \\"There is not\\": :{ -  G√∂kte  bir  bulut  yok. -  in-the-sky  a  cloud  not existing -  colspan=4  \\"There is not a cloud in the sky.\\" } *in the construction that supplies the lack of a verb \\"have\\": :{ -  Balcƒ±nƒ±n  var  bal  tasƒ±,  Oduncunun  var  baltasƒ±. -  honey-seller's  exists  honey  his-pot  wood-cutter's  exists  his-axe -  colspan=7  \\"The honey-seller has a honey-pot; the wood-cutter has an axe.\\" } :(This is a proverbial expression; the more usual order would make the saying, Balcƒ±nƒ±n bal tasƒ± var, oduncunun baltasƒ± var). ===Indefinite adjectives=== The cardinal number bir (\\"one\\") can be used as an indefinite article. Word order can make a difference: :g√ºzel bir g√ºn ‚Äì \\"a nice day\\" :bir g√ºzel g√ºn ‚Äì \\"one fine day\\" Unless it is being used by itself, elliptically, the adjective hi√ß (\\"no\\") requires an additional word with negative force: :{ -  Hi√ß  param  yok. -  no  my-money  there-is-not -  colspan=3  \\"I have no money.\\" } :{ -  Hi√ßbir  adam  ada  deƒüildir. -  no-one  man  island  is-not -  colspan=3  \\"No man is an island.\\" } Compare: *Bir ≈üey g√∂r√ºyorum. ‚Äì \\"I see something.\\" *Hi√ßbir ≈üey g√∂remiyorum. ‚Äì \\"I can't see anything.\\" ===Comparison=== In a positive comparison, the object takes the ablative case; the adverb daha (\\"more\\") is optional, unless the object is left out. :{ -  t√ºyden  (daha)  hafif -  feather-  (more)  light -  colspan=3  \\"lighter than a feather\\" } In a negative comparison, the adverb az (\\"less\\") is needed; the object still takes the ablative; daha can still be used as well. :{ -  kur≈üundan  (daha)  az  aƒüƒ±r -  lead-  (more)  less  heavy -  colspan=4  \\"less heavy than lead\\" } The superlative degree is expressed by the adverb en (\\"most\\"). :{ -  en  b√ºy√ºk  yalancƒ± -  most  big  liar -  colspan=3  \\"the biggest liar\\" } :{ -  en  az  g√ºvenilir -  most  less  trust- -  colspan=3  \\"the least trustworthy\\" } ===Participles=== It is noted under #Parts of speech that Turkish participles (sƒ±fat-fiiller) can be classified as *personal, if they take a suffix of possession; *impersonal, if they do not. In a personal participle, the suffix of possession signifies the subject of the underlying verb; if this possessor is third person, then the possessor may be further specified with a noun in the genitive case. The noun modified by a personal participle as an adjective may be the direct object of the underlying verb; the connexion may also be more vague. The noun modified by an impersonal participle is generally the subject of the underlying verb (but see Lewis (1967: IX,2)). The aorist tense (geni≈ü zaman \\"broad time\\") is for habitual actions; the present tense (≈üimdiki zaman \\"time that is now\\") is for actions ongoing or contemplated. Aorist Present that is, \\"No legal process has begun concerning the AKP members who pulled out guns and fired them in the air\\"; for -ip see #Adverbs below. that is, \\"last week\\"; Future Past/present A personal participle can be construed as a noun and used in parallel with verbal nouns: that is, \\"Children are working, 68% to provide for their family's needs, 21% because their family wants it, 6% to learn a job or profession, 4% to meet their [own] needs.\\" The following sentence from a newspaper headline contains twenty-two words, nine derived from verbs, four of these as participles, three as gerunds. Note also the use of kontrol from French as a verbal noun with et-: In other words: > Saying that, by not joining the EU and by drawing close to the Islamic > world, Turkey would be pushed into the lap of those who favor sharia, French > senator Duireux made clear that it was necessary to control the Islamic > tide. ==Adverbs== The adverb of negation is deƒüil. It is used to negate sentences that are without verb or var; then it takes the appropriate personal ending: Evde deƒüilim \\"I am not at home.\\" A number of adverbs are derived from verbs: The ending -e is seen in: G√ºle g√ºle \\"[Go] smilingly\\" (said to somebody departing); G√ºle g√ºle kullanƒ±n \\"Use [it] smilingly\\" (said to somebody with a new acquisition); Be≈üe √ßeyrek kala kalktƒ±m \\"To-five a-quarter remaining I-got- up\\", that is, \\"I got up at a quarter to five\\"; Onu yirmi ge√ße uyudun \\"You slept at twenty past ten\\" (uyu- \\"sleep\\", although uy- \\"heed\\"). The ending -erek denotes action at the same time as, or preceding, that of another verb: Geceyi konu≈üarak ge√ßirdik \\"The-night talking we-caused-to-pass\\", that is, \\"We spent the night talking.\\" Akƒ±l y√ºr√ºterek bu sonuca ula≈üƒ±yorum \\"By using reason, I arrived at this conclusion\\" [the latter is B√ºlent Ecevit as quoted in Cumhuriyet, 20 July 2005]. Doƒüaya en az zarar vererek ya≈üamak \\"To live while giving the least harm to nature\\" [Buƒüday magazine, 7-8/2005, no 32]. From ol- \\"be, become\\", olarak forms adverbial phrases corresponding to those in English with \\"as\\": Size bir dost olarak s√∂yl√ºyorum \\"To-you a friend as I'm-telling\\", that is, \\"I'm telling you this as a friend\\"; ciddi olarak \\"seriously\\" (ciddi \\"serious\\"). The ending -meden on a verb-stem looks like the ablative gerund, but it is not (Lewis [XI,12]). It indicates an action not occurring at all, or following that of the main verb: Bakmadan atlama \\"Don't leap without looking\\"; Bakmadan √∂nce atlama \\"Don't leap before looking.\\" Bir soruyu cevaplamadan tartƒ±≈ümak, tartƒ±≈ümadan cevaplamaktan iyidir \\"A particular- question without-answering to-debate without-debating from-to-answer is-good,\\" that is, \\"It is better to debate without answering than to answer without debating.\\" (Source of the last sentence: Joseph Joubert as quoted on p. 20 of G√ºndelik Bilmeceler by Partha Ghose and Dipankar Home, translated by √ñzlem √ñzbal, T√ºbitak Pop√ºler Bilim Kitaplarƒ± 25, Ankara, 1996.) Complementing √∂nce \\"before\\" is sonra \\"after\\", which can follow a verb-stem given the ending -dikten: Baktƒ±ktan sonra atla \\"After looking, leap\\"; Ay≈üe baktƒ±ktan sonra Ne≈üe atladƒ± \\"After Ay≈üe looked, Ne≈üe leapt.\\" Simultaneity is expressed by iken or its (not enclitic) suffixed form -(y)ken; but if it follows a verb, then the verb appears, not as a stem, but as a base; see #Bases of verbs: Eve girmekteyken, bir ≈üey hatƒ±rladƒ±m \\"As I was entering the house, I remembered something\\"; Ben eve girmekteyken, telefon √ßaldƒ± \\"As I was entering the house, the telephone rang.\\" If two verbs of the same grammatical form have the same subject, the endings on the first verb can be replaced by -ip; see the example under #Participles. ==Pronouns== The third-person personal pronoun o \\"she/he/it\\" is declined as if it were the noun on. The other persons, ben \\"I\\", sen \\"you (singular/informal)\\", biz \\"we\\", siz \\"you (plural/formal)\\", are declined like nouns, except for a vowel change in the dative, and an anomalous genitive; also the plural forms do not involve -ler: { class= ! !colspan=3singular !colspan=3plural - ! !!1st!!2nd!!3rd!!1st!!2nd!!3rd - !absolute ben sen o biz siz onlar - !accusative beni seni onu bizi sizi onlarƒ± - !dative bana sana ona bize size onlara - !locative bende sende onda bizde sizde onlarda - !ablative bendensendenondanbizdensizdenonlardan - !genitive benim senin onun bizim sizin onlarƒ±n } The absolute case is generally needed only for emphasis: :‚ÄîNasƒ±lsƒ±nƒ±z? \\"How are you?\\" :‚Äîƒ∞yiyim; siz nasƒ±lsƒ±nƒ±z? \\"I am fine; how are you?\\" :‚ÄîBen de iyiyim. \\"I too am fine.\\" The third-person pronoun can clear up an ambiguity mentioned above: {  onlarƒ±n fikri  \\"their idea\\" -  onlarƒ±n fikirleri  \\"their ideas\\" -  onun fikirleri  \\"her [or his] ideas\\" } The pronoun o is also one of the demonstrative pronouns: *o \\"that\\"; *bu \\"this\\"; *≈üu \\"this or that\\" (thing pointed to). The latter two are declined like o (that is, treated as if they were bun and ≈üun). The interrogative pronouns (and adjectives) are: *kim \\"who\\"; *ne \\"what\\"; *hangi \\"which\\"; *ka√ß \\"how many\\" or \\"how much\\". These appear in embedded questions but do not serve as true relative pronouns: :Buzdolabƒ±nda ka√ß tane var, o bilir. ‚Äì \\"S/he knows how many are in the refrigerator.\\" There is a suffix -ki that acts as a relative pronoun in that it creates what, in English, would be called relative clauses. It does not display vowel harmony, except in a few common formations: :benimki ‚Äì \\"mine (that which is mine)\\" :buzdolabƒ±ndaki bira ‚Äì \\"beer that is in the refrigerator\\" (no vowel harmony) :bug√ºnk√º ‚Äì \\"today's (which is today)\\" (with vowel harmony) :d√ºnk√º ‚Äì \\"yesterday's (which was yesterday)\\" (with vowel harmony) The reflexive pronoun (d√∂n√º≈ül√º zamir from d√∂n- \\"turn\\") is kendi \\"own, self\\": :Kendi kendinden korkma ‚Äì \\"Do not be afraid of thyself.\\" Many of the indefinite adjectives can function as pronouns, taking case-endings. ==VerbsCopula=Stems of verbs=== Many stems in the dictionary are indivisible; others consist of endings attached to a root. Verb-stems from nouns The verb-stem temizle- \\"make clean\\" is the adjective temiz \\"clean\\" with the suffix -le; this suffix was mentioned earlier under #Parts of speech in connexion with the verb k√∂pekle-. Many verbs are formed from nouns or adjectives with -le: :{  ! Noun !! Verb -  ba≈ü \\"head\\"  ba≈üla- \\"make a head\\", that is, \\"begin\\" -  kilit \\"lock\\"  kilitle- \\"make locked\\", that is, \\"lock\\" -  kir \\"dirt\\"  kirle- \\"make dirty\\" } Voice A verbal root, or a verb-stem in -le, can be lengthened with certain extensions. If present, they appear in the following order, and they indicate distinctions of voice: :{ + Extensions for voice - ! Voice !! Ending !! Notes - !Reflexive -(i)nrowspan=2 - !Reciprocal -(i)≈ü - !rowspan=4Causative -tafter polysyllabic stems in -l, -r, or a vowel; and - -dirin other cases; except: - -ir, -er, -itafter some monosyllabic stems; and -  there are some other exceptional forms as well. - ! Passive -ilafter stems ending in a consonant other than -l; otherwise, same as reflexive. } These endings might seem to be inflectional in the sense of the above, but their meanings are not always clear from their particular names, and dictionaries do generally give the resulting forms, so in this sense they are constructive endings. The causative extension makes an intransitive verb transitive, and a transitive verb factitive. Together, the reciprocal and causative extension make the repetitive extension -(i)≈ütir. :{  ! Verb Root/Stem !! New Verb !! Voice -  rowspan=2  bul \\"find\\"  bulu≈ü \\"meet\\"  -u≈ü (reciprocal) -  bulun \\"be found/present\\"  -un (reflexive) -  rowspan=2  yƒ±ka \\"wash (something)\\"  yƒ±kan \\"wash oneself\\"  -n (reflexive) -  yƒ±kanƒ±l \\"be washed\\"  -n (reflexive) + -ƒ±l (passive) -  kayna \\"(come to a) boil\\"  kaynat \\"(bring to a) boil\\"  -t (causitive) -  √∂l \\"die\\"  √∂ld√ºr \\"kill\\"  -d√ºr (causitive) -  :√∂ld√ºr \\"kill\\"  √∂ld√ºrt \\"have (someone) killed\\"  -t (causitive, factitive) -  ara \\"look for\\"  ara≈ütƒ±r \\"investigate\\"  -≈ü (reciprocal) + -tƒ±r (causitive) = (repetitive) } Negation and potential in verb-stems A dictionary-stem is positive; it can be made: *negative, by addition of -me; *impotential, by addition of -e and then -me. Any of these three (kinds of) stems can be made potential by addition of -e and then -bil. The -bil is not enclitic, but represents the verb bil- \\"know, be able\\"; the first syllable of the impotential ending represents an obsolete verb u- \\"be powerful, able\\" #Lewis [VIII,55]. So far then, there are six kinds of stems: :{ + Paradigm for stems negative, impotential and potential - ! English infinitiveEnglish finite form - gel-\\"come\\"\\"come\\" - gelme-\\"not come\\"\\"do not come\\" - geleme-\\"be unable to come\\"\\"cannot come\\" - gelebil-\\"be able to come\\"\\"can come\\" - gelmeyebil-\\"be able to not come\\"\\"may not come\\" - gelemeyebil-\\"able to be unable to come\\"\\"may be unable to come\\" } Such stems are not used for aorist forms, which have their own peculiar means of forming negatives and impotentials. ===Bases of verbs=== The characteristics with which verb-bases are formed from stems are given under . Note again that aorist verbs have their own peculiar negative and impotential forms. The progressive base in -mekte is discussed under . Another base, namely the necessitative (gereklilik), is formed from a verbal noun. The characteristic is -meli, where -li forms adjectives from nouns, and -me forms gerunds from verb-stems. A native speaker may perceive the ending -meli as indivisible; the analysis here is from #Lewis [VIII,30]). The present base is derived from the ancient verb yorƒ±- \\"go, walk\\" #Lewis [VIII,16]; this can be used for ongoing actions, or for contemplated future actions. The meaning of the aorist base is described under #Adjectives from verbs: participles. There is some irregularity in first-person negative and impotential aorists. The full form of the base -mez (or (y)emez) reappears before the interrogative particle mi: :Gelmem \\"I do not come\\" (cf. Gelmez miyim \\"Do I not come?\\"); :Gelmeyiz \\"We do not come\\" (cf. Gelmez miyiz \\"Do we not come?\\") The definite past or di-past is used to assert that something did happen in the past. The inferential past or mi≈ü-past can be understood as asserting that a past participle is applicable now; hence it is used when the fact of a past event, as such, is not important; in particular, the inferential past is used when one did not actually witness the past event. A newspaper will generally use the di-past, because it is authoritative. The need to indicate uncertainty and inference by means of the mi≈ü-past may help to explain the extensive use of ki in the newspaper excerpt at Turkish vocabulary#The conjunction ki. The conditional (≈üart) verb could also be called \\"hypothetical\\"; it is used for remote possibilities, or things one might wish for. (See also #Compound bases.) The various bases thus give distinctions of tense, aspect and mood. These can be briefly tabulated: :{  + First-person singular verbs ! Form !! Suffix !! Verb !! English Translation -  Progressive  -mekte gelmekteyim\\"I am in the process of coming\\" -  Necessitative  -meli gelmeliyim\\"I must come\\" -  Positive  -(i/e)r gelirim\\"I come\\" -  Negative  -me(z) gelmem\\"I do not come\\" -  Impotential  -(y)eme(z) gelemem\\"I cannot come\\" -  Future  -(y)ecek geleceƒüim\\"I will come\\" -  Inferential Past  -mi≈ü gelmi≈üim\\"It seems that I came\\" -  Present/Imperfective  -iyor geliyorum\\"I am coming\\" -  Perfective/Definite Past  -di geldim\\"I came\\" -  Conditional  -se gelsem\\"if only I came\\" } ===Questions=== The interrogative particle mi precedes predicative (type-I) endings (except for the 3rd person plural -ler), but follows the complete verb formed from a verbal, type-II ending: :Geliyor musunuz? \\"Are you coming?\\" (but: Geliyorlar mƒ±? \\"Are they coming?\\") :Geldiniz mi? \\"Did you come?\\" ===Optative and imperative moods=== Usually, in the optative (istek), only the first-person forms are used, and these supply the lack of a first-person imperative (emir). In common practice then, there is one series of endings to express something wished for: :{  + Merged Optative & Imperative Moods - ! Number !! Person !! Ending !! Example !! English Translation - ! rowspan=3  Singular ! 1st  -(y)eyim Geleyim\\"Let me come\\" - ! 2nd  ‚Äî  Gel \\"Come (you, singular)\\" - ! 3rd  -sin  Gelsin \\"Let [her/him/it] come\\" - ! rowspan=3  Plural ! 1st  -(y)elim  Gelelim \\"Let us come\\" - ! 2nd  -(y)in(iz)  Gelin \\"Come (you, plural)\\" - ! 3rd  -sinler  Gelsinler\\"Let them come\\" } ===The defective verb i-=== The ancient verb er- #Lewis [VIII,2] survives in Turkish in three bases: *imi≈ü, *idi, *ise. The form iken given under #Adverbs from verbs is also descended from er-. Since no more bases are founded on the stem i-, this verb can be called defective. In particular, i- forms no negative or impotential stems; negation is achieved with the #Adverb of negation, deƒüil, given earlier. The i- bases are often turned into base-forming suffixes without change in meaning; the corresponding suffixes are *-(y)mi≈ü, *-(y)di, *-(y)se, where the y is used only after vowels. For example, Hasta imi≈ü and Hastaymƒ±≈ü both mean, \\"Apparently/Reportedly, he/she/it is ill\\". The verb i- serves as a copula. When a copula is needed, but the appropriate base in i- does not exist, then the corresponding base in ol- is used; when used otherwise this stem means \\"become\\". The verb i- is irregular in the way it is used in questions: the particle mi always precedes it: :Ku≈ü idi or Ku≈ütu \\"It was a bird\\"; :Ku≈ü muydu? \\"Was it a bird?\\" ===Compound bases=== The bases so far considered can be called \\"simple\\". A base in i- can be attached to another base, forming a compound base. One can then interpret the result in terms of English verb forms by reading backwards. The following list is representative, not exhaustive: *Past tenses: **continuous past: Geliyordum \\"I was coming\\"; **aorist past: Gelirdim \\"I used to come\\"; **future past: Gelecektim \\"I was going to come\\"; **pluperfect: Gelmi≈ütim \\"I had come\\"; **necessitative past: Gelmeliydim \\"I had to come\\"; **conditional past: Gelseydim \\"If only I had come.\\" *Inferential tenses: **continuous inferential: Geliyormu≈üum \\"It seems (they say) I am coming\\"; **future inferential: Gelecekmi≈üim \\"It seems I shall come\\"; **aorist inferential: Gelirmi≈üim \\"It seems I come\\"; **necessitative inferential: Gelmeliymi≈üim \\"They say I must come.\\" By means of ise or -(y)se, a verb can be made conditional in the sense of being the hypothesis or protasis of a complex statement: :√∂nemli bir ≈üey yapƒ±yorsunuz \\"You are doing something important\\"; :√ñnemli bir ≈üey yapƒ±yorsanƒ±z, rahatsƒ±z etmeyelim \\"If you are doing something important, let us not cause disturbance.\\" The simple conditional can be used for remote conditions: :Bakmakla √∂ƒürenilse, k√∂pekler kasap olurdu \\"If learning by looking were possible, dogs would be butchers.\\" ==NotesReferencesGrammars=== * \\"A classic, still used to teach Turkish grammar in many universities.\\" * \\"Turkish lessons with Turkish-English explanation[s] for foreigners.\\" * \\"A classic, still used to teach Turkish grammar in many universities.\\" * \\"The most recent comprehensive grammar in English.\\" * * Second edition.

The Federation was created late in 1934 by the decision of the Supreme Council of Physical Culture of the USSR (, VSFK) as its sports section governing specifically football. It was the only organization that obtained recognition of FIFA in 1946. ==History== After the establishment of the Soviet regime in the former Russian Empire all its former affiliations abroad were discontinued. Football life in the country however did not stop. In July 1920 the first championship of the Russian SFSR took place, won by the collective city team of Moscow. In September 1923 the first championship of the Soviet Union took place which was won also by the Moscow team. In August 1928 the first Spartakiad took place in Moscow (not to be confused with the Spartakiad of Peoples of the USSR) which included a football tournament. On 27 May 1934, the \\"Distinguished Master of Sports\\" achievement award was established, and given to eight footballers that same year. On 27 December 1934, the All-Union Council of Physical Culture (VSFK) of the Central Executive Committee of the Soviet Union (TsIK USSR) established a special public organization ‚Äì the Football Section of the USSR ‚Äì to take charge of football events in the country. In addition, there was also the Football Directorate of the Soviet Sports Committee, subordinated directly to the Soviet government. ===First memorable exhibition games=== On 30 August 1935 the national team of the Ukrainian SSR beat Red Star Olympique (from France) 6:1. Goals were scored by Shylovsky (3), Parovyshnikov (2), Shchehodsky. Team squad of UkrSSR (2-3-5): # Ya. Trusevych # K. Fomin (captain) # D. Kirillov # M. Fomin # V. Fomin # V. Hreber # M. Makhynya # P. Parovyshnikov # K. Shchehodsky # P. Laiko # V. Shylovsky Next month a collective team of Prague visited the Soviet Union playing against team of Leningrad, Moscow, and UkrSSR. In January 1936 the Moscow team consisting of players from Dynamo Moscow and Spartak Moscow visited Racing Paris to which they lost 1:2. A single goal for the Soviets was scored by Yakushyn. Team squad of Moscow (2-3-5): # A. Akimov # Al. Starostin (captain) # L. Korchebokov # A. Ryomin # And. Starostin # S. Leuta # A. Lapshyn (V. Stepanov, 46) # M. Yakushyn # V. Smirnov # V. Pavlov (M. Velichkin, 86) # S. Ilyin all coached by M. Kvashnin and N. Starostin. === Later history === In 1936 the Section of Football of USSR established the Soviet Top League as a championship among teams of Volunteer Sports Sovcieties (DSO) and agencies introducing four hierarchal groups (leagues) of eight teams. On 22 July 1937 for the first time TsIK USSR given awards to 38 best Soviet sportsmen among which were 12 football players. The first recipient of Order of Lenin among football players became Nikolai Starostin. The Order of the Red Banner of Labour received Alexander Starostin and Sergei Ilyin, other nine players received Order of the Badge of Honor. During World War II (1941‚Äì1944) the main football events were suspended, but there were several regional competitions. When the Soviet Union was liberated from the occupation of Nazi Germany in August 1944 the next national cup competition took place as the first official post-war football event. In July 1946 the Football Section of the USSR was admitted to FIFA on the proposition of delegates from Yugoslavia and Czechoslovakia and on 27 September 1947 the USSR was awarded a permanent seat of the vice-president of FIFA which was taken by Valentin Granatkin. The main national football team of the Soviet Union however did not compete at the FIFA World Cup until 1958. The first coach appointed was Boris Arkadiev who in 1952 led the team to the Olympic games in Helsinki. He later along with several other football specialist was accused of sabotaging the team that was eliminated in the tournament's Round of 16. In January 1957 the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR awarded the Order of Lenin to Vsevolod Bobrov and Lev Yashin to commemorate their achievements in sport. In May 1959 the Football Section of the USSR was reorganized as the Football Federation of the USSR. In 1960 the national team of the Soviet Union won the first continental championship beating the national team of Yugoslavia 2:1 in extra time. In 1963 Lev Yashin became the first Soviet player to be awarded the Ballon d'Or. For the first time in 1965‚Äì66 season the Soviet football clubs debuted in the European international football competitions. In 1972 the Football Federation of the USSR became a government agency of the State Committee of Sports (Goskomsport). However, because Granatkin continued to chair the Football Federation, that reorganization did not drew much attention from FIFA.Football of double subordination Dynamo Kyiv became the first Soviet club to win a European club trophy, when they defeated Ferencvaros 3‚Äì0 in the 1975 UEFA Cup Winners' Cup Final. In 1988 Lev Yashin received the golden order of FIFA \\"For service\\" and in March 1990 was recognized as the Hero of Socialist Labour. Next month the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet awarded the Hero of Socialist Labour to Nikolai Starostin as well. On 8 February 1992 the federation was recognized as the parent association of the newly established Russian Football Union (RFS). In July of the same year the Executive Committee of FIFA confirmed the succession of the Soviet federation as the Russian Football Union and readmitted it under the new name and statute. ==Regional Federations== * Football Federation of the Ukrainian SSR (1959?), succeeded by the Football Federation of Ukraine in December 1991 * Football Federation of the Belarussian SSR, succeeded by the Football Federation of Belarus in 1989 * Football Federation of the Kazakh SSR (1959), succeeded by the Football Federation of Kazakhstan in 1989 * Football Federation of the Georgian SSR (1936), succeeded by the Georgian Football Federation in February 1990 * Football Federation of the Uzbek SSR (1946), succeeded by the Uzbekistan Football Federation * Football Federation of the Tajik SSR (1936), succeeded by the Tajikistan Football Federation ==Chairmen== * Vyacheslav Koloskov (January 1990 ‚Äì 1991) * L.

Georgians live scattered throughout Turkey, although they are concentrated on two major regions of residence: * Black Sea coast, in the provinces Giresun, Ordu, Samsun, and Sinop, with extension to Amasya and Tokat. Chveneburi, particularly in Fatsa, √únye, Ordu, Terme, and √áar≈üamba, largely preserve their language and traditions. * Northwestern Turkey, in the provinces D√ºzce, Sakarya, Yalova, Kocaeli, Bursa, and Balƒ±kesir. Magnarella estimated the number of Georgians in Turkey to have been over 60,000 in 1979.Peter A. Andrews & R√ºdiger Benninghaus (1989), Ethnic Groups in the Republic of Turkey, Vol. 1, p. 174. Reichert, . == Imerkhevians == Imerkhevians (Shavshetians) are an ethnographic subgroup of Georgians who speak the Imerkhevian dialect (imerkheuli) of the Georgian language, which shares many common features with the neighboring Adjarian.Tuite, Kevin (1998), Kartvelian morphosyntax: number agreement and morphosyntactic oritntation in the South Caucasian languages, p. 178. Lincom Europa. Imerkhevians are indigenous population of Artvin Province. The majority of the Imerkhevians today live in an area they call Imerkhevi, the name of the cultural region traditionally inhabited by the Imerkhevian. The population of Imerkhevi is largely composed of ethnic Georgians, who inhabit 14 hamlets around Meydancƒ±k, formerly known as Diobani. These settlements have both official Turkish and unofficial Georgian names. Reflecting some internal differentiation persisting in Turkey's Georgian community, the Imerkhevians claim a different origin from the Georgians in the Bor√ßka area, who have adopted an inclusive Adjar identity. The Imerkhevians are Sunni Muslims, closely integrated with the Turkish society. Almost all are bilingual in Georgian and Turkish. == Chveneburi == Chveneburi had arrived in Turkey basically in three waves of migration due to pogroms and what is now termed ethnic cleansing of Caucasians by the Russian Empire. The first wave was during and after the Russo-Turkish War, 1828-1829 when the Sublime Porte consigned its sovereignty over several parts of Georgia to the Russian Empire. Minor immigrations had also followed until the end of Russo-Turkish War, 1877‚Äì1878 when Ottoman Empire allowed Chveneburis to immigrate, the major wave of immigration involved at least 500,000 people from historic Georgian regions that had considerable Muslim populations such as Batumi and Kars. This wave of being muhajirs, known as muhajiroba (·Éõ·É£·É∞·Éê·ÉØ·Éò·É†·Éù·Éë·Éê) had left many Muslim-majority regions of Georgia virtually depopulated. The last sizable wave of immigration was in 1921 when Turkey finally gave up its claims on Adjara in the Treaty of Kars with the Soviet republics. This last wave also involved Turkish-speaking Muslims from Upper Adjara. Adjarians were also known by their places of origin, such as Batumlular for people from Batumi, √á√ºr√ºksulular for people from Kobuleti.Ali Pasha of √á√ºr√ºksu (front row, middle) and Ottoman Georgians during the Russo-Turkish War (1877‚Äì78). At the end of the war, the re- settlement of Ottoman Georgians in Fatsa was supervised by Ali Pasha.BERAT YILDIZ, EMIGRATIONS FROM THE RUSSIAN EMPIRE TO THE OTTOMAN EMPIRE: AN ANALYSIS IN THE LIGHT OF THE NEW ARCHIVAL MATERIALS, BILKENT UNIVERSITYChveneburi (, ), meaning \\"of us\\" in Georgian, is an autonym of Muslim immigrants of Georgian descent who had settled in non-Georgian majority regions of Turkey, thus, \\"of us\\" signifies a triple distinction from Christian Georgians, Muslim Turks, and autochthonous Muslim Georgians from Artvin. As with most Turkish citizens, most Chveneburi subscribe to the Hanafi madh'hab of Sunni Islam. === Press === The most important Georgian cultural magazine in Turkey also bears the name √áveneburi. It was founded in 1977 in Stockholm, Sweden by Shalva Tevzadze. It is distributed in Turkey by Ahmet √ñzkan Melashvili, who also wrote the book G√ºrc√ºstan (Georgia) in 1968. In 1980, √ñzkan was assassinated in Bursa by the Grey Wolves.. Since then, Fahrettin √áiloƒülu has been in charge of the magazine (1993). Between 1997 and 2006, Osman Nuri Mercan was the editor of the magazine. The magazine's content is almost completely in Turkish and presents articles on Chveneburi as well as the present situation and the history of Georgia and Georgians worldwide. Another journal, Pirosmani, bilingual in Georgian and Turkish, is published in Istanbul, sponsored by theGeorgian Catholic Simon Zazadze. === Group identity === Group identity is shaped basically by the schism with Christian Georgians. Chveneburi usually restrain from using the word Kartveli (·É•·Éê·É†·Éó·Éï·Éî·Éö·Éò) as a self-designation because they think it indicates being a Christian. They prefer to use Gurji (G√ºrc√º) (·Éí·É£·É†·ÉØ·Éò) when referring to their more precise ethnic background. Intermarriage with other Sunni groups is common. In some regions, specifically √únye for instance, Chveneburi women are sought-after brides, seen by the local rural Turkish population as beautiful and hard-working wives. This phenomenon further accelerates cultural and linguistic assimilation of the community. == Laz people == Laz people are an indigenous Kartvelian-speaking ethnic group inhabiting the Black Sea coastal regions of Turkey and Georgia.1 Minorsky, V. \\"Laz.\\" Encyclopaedia of Islam, Second Edition. Edited by: P. Bearman , Th. Bianquis , C.E . Bosworth , E. van Donzel and W.P. Heinrichs. Brill, 2010. Estimates of the total population of the Laz people today vary drastically, with numbers as low as 45,000 to as high as 1.6 million people, with the majority living in northeast Turkey. The Laz speak the Laz language, a member of the same Kartvelian language family as Georgian, Svan, and Mingrelian.BRAUND, D., Georgia in antiquity: a history of Colchis and Transcaucasian Iberia 550 BC ‚Äì AD 562, Oxford University Press, p. 93 == See also == *Georgia‚ÄìTurkey relations *Peoples of the Caucasus in Turkey *Islam in Georgia *Adjarians *Pontic Greeks *Hamshenis *Iranian Georgians == References  Bibliography == * Black Sea: Encyclopedic Dictionary (√ñzhan √ñzt√ºrk.

It was opened in 1997 as the Thackray Medical Museum. In 1998 it won \\"Museum of the Year\\" and has other awards including in 2004 both the \\"Excellence in England Small Tourist Attraction of the Year\\" and \\"Sandford Award for Heritage Education\\".Thackray Museum (2008) Thackray Museum Background Information the museum galleries, cafe and gift shop are temporarily closed: initially in 2019 for a ¬£4 million refurbishment, while the museum conference centre and car park remained open, and later because of the Covid-19 pandemic. The museum is due to reopen in October 2020. ==History== The building is a Grade II listed building, the former Leeds Union Workhouse, which opened in 1861 (foundation stone laid 1858) to accommodate 784 paupers. By the end of the 19th century, the buildings had become largely used for medical care of the poor, rather than workhouse and training. During the First World War it was called the East Leeds War Hospital, caring for armed services personnel. The building was later known as the Ashley Wing, which was part of the hospital until the 1990s when the old Leeds Union Workhouse building was considered unfit for modern medicine. As a listed building, it could not be demolished and Parliament gave permission for it to house the Thackray Medical Museum, which opened in 1997. The museum's origins can be traced to Great George Street, Leeds, where Charles Thackray opened a small family-run chemist shop in 1902. In less than a century the corner shop grew into one of Britain's principal medical companies, Chas F Thackray Limited, manufacturing drugs and medical instruments and pioneering the hip replacement operation alongside Sir John Charnley. In the 1980s Charles Thackray's grandson Paul Thackray established a small collection as an archive of the Leeds-based medical supplies company. In 1990 a charitable trust was established to develop the collection. ==Museum displays== Highlights include Leeds 1842: Life in Victorian Leeds: visitors walk through a reproduction of slum streets complete with authentic sights, sounds and smells and are invited to follow the lives, ailments and treatments of eight Victorian characters, making the choices that determine their survival amongst the rats, fleas and bedbugs. Pain, Pus and Blood describes surgery before anaesthesia, and how pain relief progressed and Having a Baby focuses on developments in safety for childbirth. Hannah Dyson's Ordeal is a video reconstruction of 1842 surgery, before anaesthetics were in use: visitors watch as a surgeon, his assistant and a group of trainee doctors prepare for Hannah Dyson's operation - the amputation of her leg after it was crushed in a mill accident. (The actual operation is not seen in the reconstruction.) The LifeZone! is an interactive children's gallery, looking at how the human body works, with a smaller room for the under-fives. The 'Recovery?' Gallery explores treatment of veterans of warfare, looking at the First World War and modern conflict medicine. There is a temporary exhibition gallery which changes annually.

The museum also cares for a collection of historical medical trade literature, which can be accessed by visitors in the museum's Library and Resource Centre by appointment. Highlights in the collection include the Wilkinson English Delftware apothecary jar display, an impressive display of early pharmaceutical jars which are all on permanent display. Also on display is Prince Albert's personal medicine chest and a selection of eighteenth and nineteenth century surgical equipment including amputation knives, saws and trepanning instruments. The Thackray Medical Museum featured in Most Haunted on 1 November 2015 on Really (TV channel). ==Temporary exhibitions== The Thackray Medical Museum was one of fifteen venues across the UK, Europe and Africa to have been selected by the Wellcome Trust to, simultaneously, exhibit the winning collection from the Wellcome Image Awards, 2016. The awards celebrate scientists, clinicians, photographers and artists of images that best communicate significant aspects of biomedical science. A temporary exhibition of twenty images was displayed at the Thackray Medical Museum. The display included inside the human eye, a 3D image produced using optical coherence tomography. The image depicts blood vessels as tunnel like structures. Other images focused on bone development, the Ebola virus and engineering human liver tissue. ==Medicine and history lecture series== The museum offers a medicine and history lecture series which runs from October to March each year. Lectures focus on the changing nature of health and medicine. Themes explored include robot-assisted surgery and health informatics. ==Education and learning== Visited by 20,000 school students each year the museum delivers a series of in-classroom work and education resources, loans boxes and teacher events. The museum has been awarded the Sandford Award for Heritage Education. ==References * Museum website * Yorkshire Medical and Dental History Society * Wellcome Image Awards 2016 * Category:Museums in Leeds Category:Listed buildings in Leeds Category:Grade II listed buildings in West Yorkshire Category:Medical museums in England Category:History museums in West Yorkshire ","title":"Thackray Museum of Medicine"},{"id":"2225554","text":"The Toronto International Dragon Boat Race Festival (TIDBRF), is an annual dragon boat regatta, first held in Toronto, Ontario, Canada in 1988.

In Jewish religious law (halakha), the laws of yichud ( issur yichud, prohibition of seclusion) prohibit seclusion in a private area of a man and a woman who are not married to each other. Such seclusion is prohibited in order to prevent the two from being tempted or having the opportunity to commit adulterous or promiscuous acts. A person who is present in order to prevent yichud is called a shomer. The laws of yichud are typically followed in Orthodox Judaism. Adherents of Conservative and Reform Judaism do not generally abide by the laws of yichud. The term \\"yichud\\" also refers to a ritual during an Ashkenazi Jewish wedding in which the newly married couple spends a period secluded in a room by themselves. In earlier historical periods, as early as the talmudic era,Abraham P. Bloch, The Biblical and historical background of Jewish customs and ceremonies (KTAV Publishing House, Inc., 1980), p. 32. the marriage would be consummated at this time, but that practice is no longer current. == Source of the prohibition == Deuteronomy 13:7 says: > If your very own brother, or your son or daughter, or the wife you love, or > your closest friend secretly entices you, saying, 'Let us go and worship > other gods, gods that neither you nor your ancestors have known...' The Talmud gives an explanation to the passage, which is supposed to be a hint of yichud: > Said R. Johanan on the authority of R. Ishmael, Where do we find an allusion > to yihud in the Torah? - For it is written: If thy brother, the son of thy > mother, entices thee [etc.]: does then only a mother's son entice, and not a > father's son? But it is to tell you: a son may be alone with his mother, but > not with any other woman interdicted in the Torah.Kiddushin 80b. According to Talmud, Amnon's rape of his half-sister Tamar led King David to extend the prohibition of yichud to unmarried girls. 17th-century painting. The Talmud also claims that after the rape of Tamar, daughter of David, when she was left alone with her half-brother Amnon, David and his high court extended this prohibition to unmarried girls as well. Later, in the times of Shammai and Hillel the Elder, the prohibition was extended to include a non- Jewish woman. These rules are discussed in the Talmud.Rabbi N. D. Dubov: Source Material: Gaining The Necessary Background To Understand The Laws The Laws of Yichud: Permissibility and Prohibition Regarding the Seclusion of a Man and Woman. New York 2006, Sichos in English. Most rishonim define the prohibition of yichud as a Torah law. Although Maimonides writes that the prohibition of yichud is derived from divrei kabbalah (Bible texts later than the Pentateuch), many interpret his words as meaning that it is a Torah law, though some regard it as a rabbinic prohibition.Rabbi Yehoshua Pfeffer: Shoftim: Halachos of Seclusion (1) Torah & Horaah, Re'eh 5771 (2011).Rabbi Howard Jachter: Yichud - Part Two Rabbi Jachter's Halacha Files Vol.12 No. 7. 18 Kislev 5763/November 23, 2002. Rashi maintained that insofar as the prohibition of yichud is mandated by the Torah, it is an essential prohibition, whereas rabbinical extensions of the prohibition are enacted as a fence meant to distance a person from forbidden relationships. Hence, leniencies would apply only to the rabbinic additions to the laws of yichud. Halachic consensus, following Maimonides, is, though, that leniencies apply even to Torah-mandated yichud laws. == Laws == Yichud applies also out of doors. Illustration from Eliza Orzeszkowa's novel Meir Ezofowicz, which deals with the conflict between Jewish orthodoxy and modern liberalism. The laws of yichud provide for strong restrictions on unrelated members of the opposite sex being secluded together, and milder ones for close family members. Different opinions exist regarding application of these laws both in terms of situation and in terms of the individuals involved. Prohibition of yichud applies to men over 13 years and, generally, girls over three, and a woman over twelve may not be alone with a boy over nine.Rabbi Doniel Neustadt: Hilchos Yichud: Rulings of Harav M. Feinstein Weekly Halacha (1997) torah.org. Even seclusion of short duration is forbidden, if it could potentially last longer.Rabbi N. D. Dubov: Yichud‚ÄîWhat, Where And With Whom The Laws of Yichud: Permissibility and Prohibition Regarding the Seclusion of a Man and Woman. Chapter 1. New York 2006, Sichos in English. == Leniencies == There are a number of circumstances, under which the prohibition of yichud may be circumvented. Typically, these apply fully to yichud with an observant Jew. Meeting a non-Jew or a secular Jew may require more scrupulousness. === Baaloh B'ir - in town === If the husband is in town (Baaloh B'ir, or Baala Bair), or, more precisely, if it is possible that he can appear suddenly, a woman may be secluded with another man in her home. The fear of his sudden appearance is considered a deterrent to engaging in illicit behavior. If the husband works fixed hours, or if they meet where they are not likely to be found, the husband's presence in town does not circumvent yichud. A close, long-standing relationship (Libo Gas Boh) between the wife and another man also proscribes yichud in spite of the husband's presence in town. The lenience caused by the man's presence in town does not, however apply to his being secluded with another woman when his wife may appear suddenly. Paradoxically, if a husband gives his wife permission to be secluded with a man, the lenience does no longer apply, since she does not fear his sudden entrance. Rashi believes that the husband‚Äôs presence in town only mitigates the prohibition, rather than abrogating it. The Shulchan Aruch, following Tosafot, however, rule that when the husband is in town the yichud restriction does not apply at all. Maimonides and Shulchan Aruch write that the rationale for Baaloh B'ir is that \\"her husband's fear is upon her.\\" This does not imply a concrete fear that her husband will enter unexpectedly, but rather that she feels a natural inhibition, in the knowledge that her husband is close by. As a consequence of this, she can be in yichud with another man in a large city, like London or New York, where the chance that he suddenly appears is non-existent. Neither does her husband's permission undermine the leniency, according to this interpretation. Rashi interprets Baalo B'ir as referring to a concrete fear of sudden exposure. So does rabbi Moshe Feinstein, who consequently rules in a stricter way. Another issue of debate is whether cities who have grown together to form a continuous area are to be treated as one city. Rabbi Shlomo Zalman Auerbach argues that if the wife is in Ramat Gan and the husband is in Tel Aviv he is still considered to be \\"in town\\". Since there are no significant uninhabited areas separating these cities, they are defined as one city from a Halachic perspective. === Pesach Posuach - open door === The door is considered open as long as it is not locked, and the prohibition of yichud is circumvented. Yichud is alleviated when the door is open. This principle is known as pesach pasuach lireshus harabim (lit. an open doorway to the public domain). The Shulchan Aruch rules: \\"If the door is open to the public domain, there is no concern of yichud.\\"Yehoshua Pfeffer: Shoftim: Halachos of Seclusion (2) Torah & Horaah, Shofetim 5771 (2011). This ruling has been interpreted and enlarged in various ways: 1. the door is actually openPitchei Teshuva 22:8 quoting the Beit Meir and rabbi Akiva Eiger (responsa 100) 2\\\\. when the door is closed but unlocked 3. then door is locked, but somebody with a key is liable to come in at any time 4. the door is locked, but there is a reasonable possibility that people may knock on the door and expect to be answered (according to Moshe Feinstein). A woman being secluded with another man is also justified when people outside can see through the window what is going on inside the house. In case of a close, long-standing friendship between the man and the woman, however, a more stringent behavior is expected. The leniency usually does not apply late at night, as there is little or no chance that people would come in unexpectedly then. === Shomrim - guards === Yichud can be circumvented by the presence of other individuals (shomrim, guards or Chaperones), who would serve to provide a check on the man's behavior. Generally, Torah-observant Jewish men qualify as shomrim. Female relatives that permit yichud are: a man's mother; his daughter or granddaughter; his sister; his grandmother; and a woman's mother-in-law, daughter-in-law and sister-in-law. Children aged 6‚Äì9 also qualify. A woman may be secluded with a man if one or more additional men are present. Although yichud with a woman and two or more men, according to most poskim, is permitted during day time and in the evening, the presence of at least three men is required during nighttime sleeping hours. The same goes for situations when children are present instead of adults. Sefardic Jews require the presence of the wife of one of the men for a woman to be secluded with them. Shulchan Aruch, though, follows Maimonides in ruling that yichud with one woman is prohibited even with many men. The disagreement is based on a passage in Gemara, which states that the permission for two men to be secluded with one woman applies only to kosher people, and tells a story where two acharonim met a woman in a secluded place, and one of them preferred to leave, since perchance only tzaddikim are defined as kosher. Nissim of Gerona considered this an excessive stringency, and thought that regular people are defined as kosher. Moses Isserles follows this view, and states that yichud with one woman and several men is prohibited only for promiscuous people.Rav Ofer Livnat: Hemdat HaDaf Hayomi: The Prohibition of Yichud eretzhemdah.org, 3 Tishrei 5771/September 11, 2010. According to Rashi, yichud is permitted when at least three women are present, but most poskim follow Maimonides, who ruled that no number of women present circumvents the prohibition of yichud. Many poskim permits yichud in the presence of the man's grandmother, mother, daughter, granddaughter or sister [over seven years], but do not accept the woman's daughter, granddaughter or sister. Avraham Danzig writes that the prohibition for one man to be in seclusion with two women is only rabbinic, whereas Torah law only prohibits a man from being secluded with one woman. == Siblings == It is preferable that a brother and sister who have reached the age of six should not sleep in the same room.Rabbi N. D. Dubov: Being Careful About Yichud The Laws of Yichud: Permissibility and Prohibition Regarding the Seclusion of a Man and Woman. Chapter 11. New York 2006, Sichos in English. Yichud between a brother and a sister above the age of Bar and Bat Mitzvah is considered appropriate for a short term, but not when their parents are away for an extended period of time. There are various opinions about the duration of a permitted yichud. Some poskim allow only up to three nights; others allow up to thirty days. If the brother and sister live separately and one comes to visit the other, yichud is permitted as long as they do not stay longer than the normal stay of a house guest (where circumstances like the distance of their residence is taken into account). However, when a sibling moves in on a permanent basis, yichud is forbidden even for one day. == Adopted children == Yichud with one's own children is legitimate, but if they are adopted, restrictions apply. 18th-century painting. Opinions among Poskim are divided about yichud between adoptive parents and their children of the opposite gender, who were adopted at a very young age. Rabbis Moshe Feinstein, Eliezer Waldenberg, Hayim David HaLevi, and Nahum Rabinovitch all ruled that adoptive parents are permitted to engage in yichud with their adopted children since sexual attraction normally does not occur in such situations. Feinstein, though, restricts the permission to situations when both adoptive parents are alive and married to each other, and Waldenberg only permits yichud if a girl was adopted before the age of three and a boy was adopted before the age of nine. Ovadia Yosef is essentially lenient about this issue, though he believes that it is preferable to adopt a girl so that the wife who is home most of the time can prevent yichud with the husband from occurring. The lenient view is strongly opposed by others, particularly in Haredi Judaism. Menachem Mendel Schneerson vigorously argued that yichud is forbidden in the adoptive situation. He insists that this was common custom in earlier generations. Dov Berish Weidenfeld, Yaakov Yisrael Kanievsky, Ezra Ettiah, Avrohom Yeshaya Karelitz, and Shmuel Wosner take the same position.Rabbi Howard Jachter: Yichud - Part One Rabbi Jachter's Halacha Files Vol.12 No. 6. 11 Kislev 5763/November 6, 2002. Yichud with biological children is fully permitted. The Gemara explains that God was moved by the prayers of the Great Assembly to curtail the yetzer hara for incest so there is no need for a prohibition when it comes to biological parents and children. == Unmarried couples == A man and woman who are engaged to be married may not dwell together unless other people are in the same house and the door is unlocked. Leaving the door slightly ajar is commendable. They may not stay together even on a temporary basis, such as in a hotel. According to some poskim, sleeping in the same house if other family members are present does not violate yichud laws, but should be avoided due to tzniut considerations. Others, including Moses Isserles and Joseph Soloveitchik, however, disagree about this and would not permit sleeping in the home of their future in-laws. Although mingling of men and women does not violate the prohibition of yichud, it should nonetheless be avoided, even if it is for the purpose of fulfilling a mitzvah.Social Mingling between Genders 5 Tevet 5774/8 December 2013. Regardless of whether yichud takes place or not, girlfriend/boyfriend relationships are forbidden, since dating, according to halacha, should not serve other purposes than finding a suitable marriage partner.Mordechai Becher and Moshe Newman: After the Return: Maintaining Good Family Relations and Adjusting to Your New Lifestyle‚Äîa Practical Halachic Guide for the Newly Observant p. 103. Feldheim Publishers 1994. == Babysitting and caregiving == Visiting a doctor's or dentist's office has to occur during regular office hours, when people may enter unexpectedly. Unless it is one's own child, grandchild or sibling, a female over the age of 12 should not babysit a boy 9 or older, and a male over the age of 13 should not babysit a girl 3 or older. The prohibition of yichud makes some natural solutions problematic, e.g. when a teenage girl who might babysit her sister's son has to consider the possibility of getting into yichud with her brother-in-law. The situation may be evaded by the presence of another boy or girl aged 6‚Äì9, or, such children lacking, by giving a key to the neighbors and asking them to come in unexpectedly.Rabbi N. D. Dubov: Babysitting The Laws of Yichud: Permissibility and Prohibition Regarding the Seclusion of a Man and Woman. Chapter 9. New York 2006, Sichos in English.Rabbi N. D. Dubov: \\"Ishto Meshamroso\\"‚ÄîHis Wife Guards Him The Laws of Yichud: Permissibility and Prohibition Regarding the Seclusion of a Man and Woman. Chapter 4. New York 2006, Sichos in English. If a father is single, or his wife is away, and he employs a female babysitter, he has to take care that he does not enter the house before the babysitter has exited, unless there are shomrim present; or else, at least he should leave the door open. Visiting a doctor's office is allowed during regular office hours, when people may enter unexpectedly. Otherwise, a shomer is required. Mortal danger always overrides yichud laws, although there are authorities who disagree with this.Rabbi N. D. Dubov: Medical Personnel The Laws of Yichud: Permissibility and Prohibition Regarding the Seclusion of a Man and Woman. Chapter 10. New York 2006, Sichos in English. Serious illness, on the other hand, does not alleviate the prohibition of yichud. An exception is, according to Moshe Feinstein, a male patient who has been diagnosed as impotent, but in this case marit ayin calls for carefulness. A dependent adult person in need of care should take a caregiver of the same gender. This applies also to very old men. During daytime, an opposite gender housekeeper and medical staff may visit if the door is unlocked, or the neighbors have a key and are asked to come in unannounced from time to time. Some poskim are lenient when it comes to a doctor's interaction with his patients, since he is supposedly consumed by his work and not likely to think sinful thoughts. They invoke Gemara, which applies this reasoning to allow a professional to mate animals, although it is otherwise forbidden to watch animals mate. Therapists of the same sex are preferable, but when there is no one else as qualified as a therapist of the opposite gender, there is green light as long as leniences of yichud are in place. Since the client develops a close relationship with the therapist, Baaloh B'ir does not count. == Transportation == Yichud situations may arise if other passengers get off the bus or taxi, and a woman is left alone with the driver. Two unrelated, opposite-gender persons may travel in a vehicle together within the local area, but should not take out-of-town trips together, particularly if they are traveling to an area where they are not known to anyone, and will not be able to return on the same day. For tzniut considerations, the woman had better sit in the rear if the man is driving (or vice versa), and engaging in prolonged conversation is not advisable.Rabbi N. D. Dubov: Transportation The Laws of Yichud: Permissibility and Prohibition Regarding the Seclusion of a Man and Woman. Chapter 7. New York 2006, Sichos in English. If a woman is traveling in a bus or taxi, and the other passengers get off, leaving her alone with the driver, she should leave the vehicle, unless they drive where there are passersby or a steady stream of traffic. On a bus, train or airplane, sitting adjacent to a member of the opposite gender is permitted, but many Orthodox Jews follow stringencies to avoid this due to the laws of negiah and tzniut.Rabbi Ari Enkin: Book Review: Guidelines ‚Äì Questions and Answers About the Laws of Yichud Review of Rabbi Elozor Barclay and rabbi Yitzchok Jaeger: Guidelines ‚Äì Questions and Answers About the Laws of Yichud, Menucha. Torahmusings.com 18 June 2013. According to most poskim, there are no restrictions on being secluded together momentarily in a temporary environment, such as an elevator. Since elevators are boarded constantly, there is always a chance that anyone could enter without warning.Rabbi N. D. Dubov: Common Yichud Situations The Laws of Yichud: Permissibility and Prohibition Regarding the Seclusion of a Man and Woman. Chapter 6. New York 2006, Sichos in English. == Business == If a location can be viewed from the outside, there is no concern for yichud. In a location of business, a male and female may be together for business purposes provided that the location where they are has the potential to be viewed from outside. Otherwise, the door has to be unlocked or people with a key allowed to come in unexpectedly. This applies also if they have separate rooms in the same office. A close working relationship excludes the possibility of relying solely on Baaloh B'ir. A man may temporarily be secluded with three women, but not on the basis of a permanent relationship. Two men who are prutzim (fail to keep the laws of tznius) are not allowed to work with two women. Neither may a woman work together with three non-Jewish men.Rabbi N. D. Dubov: Yichud At Work The Laws of Yichud: Permissibility and Prohibition Regarding the Seclusion of a Man and Woman. Chapter 8. New York 2006, Sichos in English. A male teacher should take heed that he does not become overly familiar with the girls. A male teacher who is single should not teach young children of either sex, since he may associate with their mothers when they come and pick up their children. In schools with many staff members, however, one may be lenient, and some poskim take the position that this halacha applies only to situations where the teaching takes place in the private home of the teacher. == See also == * Jewish view of marriage * Negiah (guidelines for physical contact) * Niddah (menstruation laws) * Rebbetzin (rabbi's wife) * Role of women in Judaism * Shalom Bayit (peace and harmony in the relationship between husband and wife) * Shidduch (finding a marriage partner) * Tzniut (modest behavior) * Billy Graham rule (similar practice of some Christians) * Khalwa (similar prohibition in Islamic law) == References  External links == * Howard Jachter: The Yichud Prohibition - Part One: To Whom Does It Apply?

He is now working for Marvel Comics. ==Biography== Walker began his career in 1987 working on Future Shocks in 2000 AD, and followed this up with work on some of the anthology comic‚Äôs most popular long- running stories, including Judge Dredd, Rogue Trooper (inking Steve Dillon‚Äôs pencils), the ABC Warriors and Judge Anderson. During this period Walker also wrote a number of stories including Daemonifuge and The Inspectre, often with co-author Jim Campbell. In reviewing Daemonifuge: The Screaming Cage, critic Don D'Ammassa wrote, \\"The artwork is for the most part excellent.\\"D'Ammassa, Don (November 2002). \\"Daemonifuge: Book I; The Screaming Cage\\", Science Fiction Chronicle 24 (11): 32. Jeff Zaleski wrote, \\"Walker's grayscale, b&w; CGI artwork is extremely effective in the oversized format, and Walker's people look more human than most Warhammer characters.\\"Zaleski, Jeff (November 4, 2002). \\"Daemonifuge: The Screaming Cage\\", Publishers Weekly 249 (44): 65. Originally known for his glossy, painted style and the fine detail of his inked work, Walker has since 1998 changed the way he works, using a high contrast black line style with heavy shadows coupled with flat computer colouring, reminiscent of the work of Mike Mignola. From 2002 onwards, despite a couple of Judge Dredd stories, he has largely worked on American comic books starting with The Legion at DC Comics, written by Dan Abnett and Andy Lanning (DnA), before moving over to Marvel Comics. In April 2006, he worked on Marvel's cosmic crossover event, \\"Annihilation\\" with DnA plotting Nova, one of its four lead-ins. In 2005, Walker was commissioned by design agency ODD to draw the character of a 13-year-old James Bond for Charlie Higson's first Young Bond novel SilverFin.Ezard, John (April 23, 2005). \\"Young Bond proves a bestseller\\", The Guardian, p. 10.

Built by Armstrong Whitworth at Newcastle on Tyne, she was torpedoed and sunk by German destroyers in Narvik harbour on 9 April 1940. ==Description== Built as part of the general rearmament in the time leading up to the events in 1905, Norge remained, along with her sister-ship Eidsvold, the backbone of the Royal Norwegian Navy for just over 40 years. Norge and Eidsvold were the largest vessels in the Royal Norwegian Navy, displacing 4,233 tons and crewed by 270 men. Both vessels were considered to be quite powerful for their time, with two 21 cm (8.26 inch) guns as their main armament. They were armoured to withstand battle with ships of a similar size, with 6 inches (15.24 cm) of Krupp cemented armour in the belt and 9 inches (22.86 cm) of the same armour on the two gun turrets. Haakon VII boards Norge on 28 November 1905 It was intended to augment the Norwegian coastal defence ship fleet with the two ships of the Bj√∏rgvin class, ordered in 1912, but after these were requisitioned by the British Royal Navy while still under construction at the outbreak of World War I the Eidsvold class and the older, two ship strong, Tordenskjold class was forced to soldier on long after they were obsolete. ==First and final battle== The emergency steering wheel from Norge, retrieved from Narvik harbour by divers in 1983 On the morning of 9 April 1940, German forces entered Ofotfjord under cover of fog and heavy snow. The Germans contacted the captain of Eidsvold, demanding that he surrender, and when this was turned down, the battle-ready German destroyers torpedoed Eidsvold before she could fire her guns. Aboard Norge, deeper inside the fjord, the explosions were heard, but nothing could be seen until two German destroyers suddenly appeared out of the darkness. Captain Per Askim of Norge gave orders to open fire. Four rounds were fired from the 21 cm guns (one from the fore gun and three from the aft) as well as seven or eight rounds from the starboard 15 cm guns, directed against the German destroyer Bernd von Arnim. The range has been estimated as 800 metres (1/2 mile). Due to the difficult weather conditions, it was hard to use the optical sights for the guns, which resulted in the first salvo falling short of the target and the others going over the target. The German destroyers waited until they were alongside the pier before returning fire. Bernd von Arnim opened fire with her 12.7 cm (5 inch) guns, as well as with machine guns, but the weather gave the Germans problems as well. The destroyer also fired torpedoes‚Äîin all three salvoes of two torpedoes each. The first two salvoes missed, but the last struck Norge midships, and she sank in less than one minute, her propellers still turning. Ninety of the crew were rescued from the freezing water, but 101 perished in the battle which had lasted less than 20 minutes. The salvaged anchor of Norge outside the War Museum in Narvik ==The wreck== The remains of Norge lie at a depth of about , in the middle of Narvik harbour. Partly salvaged in situ, it is considered a war memorial and diving on the wreck is prohibited.PS Norge at Skovheim.org, retrieved 2 January 2007 ==NotesSources== * * ==External links== Category:Eidsvold-class coastal defence ships Category:Ships built on the River Tyne Category:1900 ships Category:World War II coastal defence ships of Norway Category:Maritime incidents in April 1940 Category:World War II shipwrecks in the Norwegian Sea ","title":"HNoMS Norge"},{"id":"2225573","text":"The were two winds or storms that are said to have saved Japan from two Mongol fleets under Kublai Khan. These fleets attacked Japan in 1274 and again in 1281.. Due to the growth of Zen Buddhism among Samurai at the time, these were the first events where the typhoons were described as \\"divine wind\\" as much by their timing as by their force. Since Man'y≈çsh≈´, the word kamikaze has been used as a Makurakotoba of waka introducing Ise Grand Shrine. ==History== The Mongol fleet destroyed in a typhoon, ink and water on paper, by Kikuchi Y≈çsai, 1847 The latter fleet, composed of \\"more than four thousand ships bearing nearly 140,000 men\\"McClain 2002. p. 17., is said to have been the largest attempted naval invasion in history whose scale was only recently eclipsed in modern times by the D-Day invasion of allied forces into Normandy in 1944. ==Events== In the first invasion, the Mongols successfully conquered the Japanese settlements on Tsushima and Iki islands. When they landed on Hakata Bay, however, they met fierce resistance by the armies of samurai clans and were forced to withdraw to their bases in China. In the midst of the withdrawal, they were hit by a typhoon. Most of their ships sank and many soldiers drowned. The first incident took place in autumn 1274 when a Mongol fleet of 500 to 900 ships carrying 30,000 to 40,000 men attacked Japan. While in Hakata Bay, Kyushu, a typhoon hit the fleet. An estimated 13,000 men drowned, around one-third of the ships sank, and the rest were damaged. During the time period between the first and second invasion, the Japanese prudently built two-meter-high walls to protect themselves from future assaults. Seven years later, the Mongols returned. Unable to find any suitable landing beaches due to the walls, the fleet stayed afloat for months and depleted their supplies as they searched for an area to land. After months of being exposed to the elements, the fleet was destroyed by a great typhoon, which the Japanese called \\"kamikaze\\" (divine wind). The Mongols never attacked Japan again, and more than 70,000 men were said to have been captured.Science HD Channel program \\"Unearthing Ancient Secrets\\" first aired: 1/26/2009. Episode named \\"Khubilai Khan's Lost Fleet\\" The second fleet was larger, comprising two forces with an estimated total of 4,400 ships and 140,000 men; greatly outnumbering the Japanese soldiers (who had an estimated 40,000 samurai and other fighting men). The typhoon led to the death of at least half the men, and only a few hundred vessels survived. Following the storm, most survivors were killed by the Japanese. This event is considered \\"one of the largest and most disastrous attempts at a naval invasion in history.\\" ==In myth== In popular Japanese myths at the time, the god Raijin was the god who turned the storms against the Mongols. Other variations say that the gods F≈´jin, Ry≈´jin or Hachiman caused the destructive kamikaze. ==As metaphor== The name given to the storm, kamikaze, was later used during World War II as nationalist propaganda for suicide attacks by Japanese pilots. The metaphor meant that the pilots were to be the \\"Divine Wind\\" that would again sweep the enemy from the seas. This use of kamikaze has come to be the common meaning of the word in English. ==See also== *Battle of Bun'ei *Battle of K≈çan *Mongol invasions of Japan *Protestant Wind *Miracle of the House of Brandenburg *Theodicy *Tornado == Notes  References == * * Category:Typhoons Category:Pre-1940 Pacific typhoon seasons Category:Unknown-strength tropical cyclones Category:Typhoons in Japan Category:13th century in Japan Category:1270s in Japan Category:1274 in Asia Category:1280s in Japan Category:1281 in Asia Category:Military history of the Mongol Empire Category:13th-century natural disasters Category:13th-century meteorology ","title":"Kamikaze (typhoon)"},{"id":"2225578","text":"The State Peace and Development Council ( ; abbreviated SPDC or , ) was the official name of the military government of Burma, which seized power under the rule of Saw Maung in 1988. On 30 March 2011, Senior General and Council Chairman Than Shwe signed a decree that officially dissolved the Council. From 1988 to 1997, the SPDC was known as the State Law and Order Restoration Council (abbreviated SLORC or ), which had replaced the Burma Socialist Programme Party. In 1997, SLORC was abolished and reconstituted as the State Peace and Development Council (SPDC). The powerful regional military commanders, who were members of SLORC, were promoted to new positions and transferred to the capital of Rangoon (now Yangon). The new regional military commanders were not included in the membership of the SPDC. The SPDC consisted of eleven senior military officers. The members of the junta wielded a great deal more power than the cabinet ministers, who were either more-junior military officers or civilians. The exception was the Defence Ministry portfolio, which was in the hands of junta leader Than Shwe himself. On 15 September 1993, it established the Union Solidarity and Development Association which was replaced by Union Solidarity and Development Party in 29 March 2010 in time for the elections. Although the regime retreated from the totalitarian Burmese Way to Socialism of BSPP when it took power in 1988, the regime was widely accused of human rights abuses. It rejected the 1990 election results and kept Aung San Suu Kyi under house arrest until her release on 13 November 2010. The council was officially dissolved on 30 March 2011, with the inauguration of the newly elected government, led by its former member and Prime Minister, President Thein Sein. ==History== SPDC members greet Thai PM Abhisit Vejjajiva in an October 2010 visit to Naypyidaw. SPDC members with Thai delegation in an October 2010 visit to Naypyidaw. The State Law and Order Restoration Council was formed when the Burmese Armed Forces, commanded by General Saw Maung (later self-promoted to 'Senior General' Saw Maung, died July 1997), seized power on 18 September 1988 crushing the 'Four Eights Uprising'. On the day it seized power SLORC issued Order No.1/1988 stating that the Armed Forces had taken over power and announced the formation of the SLORC. With Order No. 2/1988, the SLORC abolished all 'Organs of State Power' that were formed under the 1974 Burmese constitution. The Pyithu Hluttaw (the legislature under the 1974 Constitution), the Council of Ministers (the Cabinet), the Council of People's Justices (the Judiciary), the Council of People's Attorneys (the 'Attorney-General Office'), the Council of People's Inspectors (the 'Auditor-General Office'), as well as the State/Region, Township, Ward/Village People's Councils were abolished. The SLORC also stated that the services of the Deputy Ministers in the previous Burma Socialist Programme Party (BSPP) government which it replaced were also terminated. (Under the 1974 Burmese Constitution the 'Council of Ministers' acted as a Cabinet but since the Deputy Ministers were not considered to be formally part of the Council of Ministers, the SLORC made sure that the Deputy Ministers ‚Äì together with the Ministers' ‚Äì services in the previous BSPP government from whom it had taken over power were also terminated.) The Orders that SLORC issued on the day of its takeover can be seen in the 19 September 1988 issue of The Working People's Daily. The first Chairman of SLORC was General Saw Maung, later Senior General, who was also the Prime Minister. He was removed as both Chairman of SLORC and Prime Minister on 23 April 1992 when General Than Shwe, later Senior General, took over both posts from him. On 15 November 1997, SLORC was abolished and reconstituted as the State Peace and Development Council (SPDC). Most, but not all members of the abolished SLORC, were in the SPDC military regime. ==LeadershipChairmen=== { style=\\"text-align:center;\\" - ! colspan=3Chairman ! colspan=3Term of office ! rowspan=2Political party - !

Reports by these organisations as well as the United Nations and the Karen Human Rights Group alleged gross human rights abuses that took place in Burma under their regime, including: * Murder and arbitrary executions * Torture and rape * Recruitment of child soldiers * Forced relocations * Forced labour * Political imprisonment ===Murder=== One of the worst atrocities in Burma took place during the uprising of August 1988, when millions of Burmese marched throughout the country calling for an end to military rule. Soldiers shot hundreds of protesters and killed an estimated 3,000 people in the following weeks. During the August and September demonstrations of 2007, at least 184 protesters were shot and killed and many were tortured. Under the SPDC, the Burmese army engaged in military offensives against ethnic minority populations, committing acts that violated international humanitarian law. ===Recruitment of child soldiers=== It has been alleged that the SPDC forcibly recruited children ‚Äì some as young as 10 ‚Äì to serve in its army, the Tatmadaw. It is difficult to estimate the number of child soldiers used to serve in the Burmese army, but there were thousands, according to Human Rights Watch the Child Soldiers Global Report 2008 and Amnesty International. The UN Secretary- General named the SPDC in four consecutive reports for violating international standards prohibiting the recruitment and use of child soldiers.

Report of the Secretary-General on children and armed conflict in Myanmar 1 June 2009 UN Doc. S/2009/278 ===Forced relocations=== Human Rights Watch reported that since Cyclone Nargis in May 2008, the Burmese authorities expelled hundreds, if not thousands, of displaced persons from schools, monasteries, and public buildings, and encouraged them to return to their destroyed villages in the Irrawaddy Delta. The authorities emptied some public buildings and schools to use as polling stations for the 24 May referendum on a new constitution, despite pleas from United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon to postpone the referendum and focus their resources on humanitarian relief. The SPDC was alleged to have evicted people from dozens of government- operated tented relief camps in the vicinity of the former capital Yangon, ordering the residents to return to their homes, regardless of the conditions they face. The forced evictions were part of government efforts to demonstrate that the emergency relief period was over and that the affected population were capable of rebuilding their lives without foreign aid. People who were forced from their homes by Cyclone Nargis are considered to be internally displaced persons under international law. Under the UN Guiding Principles on Internal Displacement, the Burmese government was urged to ensure the right of \\"internally displaced persons to return voluntarily, in safety and with dignity, to their homes or places of habitual residence, or to resettle voluntarily in another part of the country.\\" ===Forced labour=== According to the International Labour Organization (ILO), despite the new quasi-civilian government taking power in Burma, forced labour continues to be widespread in Burma. It is imposed mainly by the military, for 'portering' (that is, carrying of provisions to remote bases, or on military operations), road construction, camp construction and repair, and for a range of other tasks. In March 1997, the European Union withdrew Burma's trade privileges because of the prevalence of forced labour and other abuses. The same year, the ILO established a Commission of Inquiry to look into allegations of forced labour, coming up with a damning report the following year. In November 2006, the International Labour Organization (ILO) announced it was to seek at the International Criminal CourtHuman Rights in Myanmar . \\"to prosecute members of the ruling Myanmar junta for crimes against humanity\\" over the allegations of forced labour of its citizens by the military. According to the ILO, an estimated 800,000 people are subject to forced labour in Burma.ILO cracks the whip at Yangon. ===Political imprisonment=== Even before the large-scale demonstrations began in August 2007, the authorities arrested many well-known opponents of the government on political grounds, several of whom had only been released from prison several months earlier. Before the 25‚Äì29 September crackdown, more arrests of members of the opposition party National League for Democracy (NLD) took place, which critics say was a pre-emptive measure before the crackdown. Mass round-ups occurred during the crackdown itself, and the authorities continued to arrest protesters and supporters throughout 2007. Between 3,000 and 4,000 political prisoners were detained, including children and pregnant women, 700 of whom were believed still in detention at year's end. At least 20 were charged and sentenced under anti-terrorism legislation in proceedings which did not meet international fair trial standards.

Of all the non-neutral powers, only the GDP of the United Kingdom had not decreased because of the war, West Germany's GDP was at its 1908 level and France's at its 1891 level. Trade was based on US dollar reserves (the only acceptable reserve currency), which Europe lacked. Therefore, the transfer of money (immediately after each transaction) increased the opportunity cost of trading. Some trade was reduced to barter. The situation led the Organisation for European Economic Co-operation (OEEC) to create the EPU, all members signing the agreement on 1 July 1950. The EPU accounted for trades but did not transfer money until the end of the month. It changed the landscape from bilateral trades of necessity (trading with partners because of outstanding debts) to multilateral trades. The EPU also forced liberalization by mandating that members eliminate discriminatory trade measures. The EPU was a general success with trade levels more than doubling during its existence. By its close in 1958, convertibility of currency was a possibility, no longer needing government permissions in European countries. ==See also== * Bretton Woods system * Marshall Plan *Asian Clearing Union *European Payments Council *European System of Central Banks *International Clearing Union == References == * Baldwin, Richard and Charles Wyplosz.

The STA was also flown to assess weather conditions just prior to Space Shuttle launches and landings. ==Development== NASA developed the STA using the Grumman Gulfstream II as the underlying aircraft platform. During the early phases of the Shuttle program, NASA considered using the Boeing 737 airliner as the basis for the STA, but rejected it due to cost and opted for the less-expensive Gulfstream II. The aircraft's exterior was modified to withstand the high aerodynamic forces incurred during training sorties. A redesigned cockpit provided a high- fidelity simulation of the Shuttle Orbiter's controls and pilot vantage point; even the seats were fitted in the same position as those in the Space Shuttle. ==Operational history== The four STAs were normally located at the NASA Forward Operating Location in El Paso, Texas and rotated through Ellington Field (Houston, Texas) for maintenance. The STA was also used at Kennedy Space Center in Florida. It was primarily flown by astronauts practicing landings at the Shuttle Landing Facility and White Sands Space Harbor as well as to assess weather conditions prior to Space Shuttle launches and landings. On December 3, 2003, a NASA Gulfstream II Shuttle Training Aircraft (STA) was flying a series of simulated shuttle landings to the Kennedy Space Center shuttle landing facility. On board the aircraft was an unidentified NASA astronaut pilot and two training personnel. The aircraft was on final approach at 13,000 feet when onboard instruments indicated a malfunction on one of the jet engine thrust reversers. The aircraft landed safely. A post-landing inspection showed that one of the 585-pound, 4-foot-wide, 5-foot-long thrust reversers had fallen off the aircraft. Divers later found the thrust reverser on the bottom of the nearby Banana River. An investigation showed that a bolt failed, releasing the part from the aircraft.\\"NASA ties bolt to training scare\\", Florida Today newspaper (article reprinted on the International Aviation Safety Association website), Feb 7, 2004\\"NASA Jet Sheds Parts Over Florida\\", AVweb website, February 9, 2004 ==Flight profile== The STA was particularly critical for Shuttle pilots in training because the Orbiter lacked atmospheric engines that would allow the craft to \\"go around\\" after a poor approach. After re-entry, the Shuttle was a very heavy glider (it was affectionately referred to as a 'flying brick') and as such had only one chance to land successfully. A STA flying above Discovery as it lands at the conclusion of STS-95 in 1998 To match the descent rate and drag profile of the real Shuttle at , the main landing gear of the C-11A was lowered (the nose gear stayed retracted due to wind load constraints) and engine thrust was reversed. Its flaps could deflect upwards to decrease lift as well as downwards to increase lift. Covers were placed on the left hand cockpit windows to provide the same view as from a Shuttle cockpit, and the left-hand pilot's seat was fitted with the same controls as a Shuttle. The STA's normal flight controls were moved to the right, where the instructor sat. Both seat positions had a head-up display (HUD). In a normal exercise, the pilot descended to at an airspeed of , from the landing target. The pilot then rolled the STA at , from landing. The nose of the aircraft was then dropped to increase speed to , descending at a 20-degree angle on the outer glide slope (OGS). The outer glide slope aiming point was short of the runway threshold, and used PAPIs for visual guidance in addition to the MLS system. At the guidance system changed to pre-flare and shortly after, at , the pilot started the flare maneuver to gradually reduce the descent angle and transition to the inner glide slope (IGS) which was 1.5 degrees from onwards, using a \\"ball-bar\\" system for visual guidance. The shuttle landing gear release was simulated at above the ground, since the STA main gear remained down for the whole simulation. The nose gear of the STA was lowered at AGL in case of an inadvertent touchdown with the runway surface. If the speed was correct, a green light on the instrument panel simulated shuttle landing when the pilot's eyes were above the runway. This was the exact position that the pilot's head would be in during an actual landing. In the exercise, the STA was still flying above the ground. The instructor pilot deselected the simulation mode, stowed the thrust reversers, and the instructor executed a go-around, never actually landing the aircraft (on training approaches). ==Avionics== The Shuttle Training Aircraft's cockpit. The commander's side of the cockpit, at left, featured a Shuttle-type heads-up display (HUD), rotational hand controller (RHC) used to fly the vehicle, and multi-function displays. The instructor pilot, who occupied the right-hand side of the STA cockpit, had access to a similar heads-up display, as well as conventional aircraft controls and instruments. A sophisticated computer system installed on board the STA simulated the flight dynamics of the orbiter with nearly perfect accuracy. The STA's highly realistic simulation of the orbiter was not limited to handling characteristics, but also implemented the shuttle control interfaces for the pilot. An onboard computer called the Advanced Digital Avionics System (ADAS) controlled the Direct Lift Control (DLC) and the in-flight reverse thrust during Simulation Mode.IIS Corp. Shuttle Training Aircraft Every shuttle commander practiced at least 1,000 landings in this manner, as had each mission's shuttle pilot.NASA - Test Drive: Shuttle Training Aircraft Preps Astronauts for Landing ==List of aircraft== Four Gulfstream II aircraft constituted the now retired STA fleet, although other Gulfstream II aircraft, lacking STA capabilities, are still used by NASA for personnel transport purposes.

From 1992 to 2004 he was the president of the international Traditionalist Catholic organisation Foederatio Internationalis Una Voce and was responsible for the unification of Una Voce America. ==Life== Davies was born to Cyril and Annie (n√©e Garnworthy) Davies. His father, a Welshman, was a Baptist, and his mother, who was English, was an Anglican. Davies was brought up in Yeovil, Somerset, but proud of his Welsh descent. He served as a regular soldier in the Somerset Light Infantry during the Malayan Emergency, the Suez Crisis, and the EOKA campaign in Cyprus. Davies was a Baptist who converted to Catholicism while still a student in the 1950s. While initially a supporter of the Second Vatican Council,, Society of St. Pius X ‚Äì Southern Africa Davies became critical of the liturgical changes that followed in its wake, which he argued were a result of distortions and misreadings of the Council's mandates for liturgical reform. Davies later supported the French Archbishop Marcel Lefebvre, founder of the Society of St. Pius X (SSPX), writing a three-volume series titled Apologia Pro Marcel Lefebvre in which he defended Lefebvre against accusations of disobedience and schism for refusing to celebrate the Mass of Paul VI. Although Davies opposed Lefebvre's canonically-illicit consecration of four SSPX bishops in 1988 against the wishes of Pope John Paul II, he continued to publicly support Lefebvre's defence of the Tridentine Mass and traditional Church teachings. William D. Dinges, Professor of Religion and Culture at The Catholic University of America, described Davies as \\"[i]nternationally, one of the most prolific traditionalist apologists\\". Davies was a critic of the alleged apparitions of the Blessed Virgin at Medjugorje, which he believed to be false. Davies died on 25 September 2004, aged 68, following a battle with cancer and was buried in the churchyard of St. Mary's, Chislehurst, Kent. He was survived by his wife, Marija, one daughter and two sons, __NOTOC__ one of whom is the barrister Adrian Davies. ==Selected published works== *The Liturgical Revolution (Vol. I: Cranmer's Godly Order Roman Catholic Books, vol.

Built by Armstrong Whitworth at Newcastle on Tyne in 1899, she was obsolete when sunk by German torpedoes in Narvik harbour on 9 April 1940 during the German invasion of Norway (Operation Weser√ºbung). ==Description== Launch card for Eidsvold, printed in connection with her launch by Armstrong Whitworth at Newcastle on Tyne Eidsvold was built as part of the general rearmament in the time leading up to the political events in 1905, and remained, along with her sister ship Norge, the backbone of the Royal Norwegian Navy for just over 40 years. She was named after the town of Eidsvold, the site of the drafting and signing of the Norwegian Constitution on 17 May 1814. Considered to be quite powerful ships for their time, with two 21 cm (8.26 inch) guns as their main armament, they were soon outclassed by the new Dreadnought battleships. They were armoured to withstand battle with ships of a similar class to their own, with 6 inches (15.24 cm) of Krupp cemented armour in the belt and 9 inches (22.86 cm) of the same armour on her two turrets. Eidsvold and Norge were the largest vessels in the Royal Norwegian Navy at 4,233 tons gross and crews of up to 270 men. It was intended to augment the Norwegian coastal defence ship fleet with the two ships of the Bj√∏rgvin-class, ordered in 1912, but after these were confiscated by the British Royal Navy at the outbreak of World War I, the Eidsvold-class and the older, two ship strong, Tordenskjold-class was forced to soldier on long after they were obsolete. ==First and final battle== Models of the coastal defence ships Tordenskiold and Eidsvold. Eidsvold in the rear In the morning of 9 April 1940, German forces entered Narvik harbour under cover of fog and heavy snow. Despite the weather, they were spotted by Norwegian vessels, which promptly reported the sighting and alerted Eidsvold and Norge. Aboard both ships steps were taken to prepare for combat. The guns were loaded with live ammunition and life preservers issued to the crew. Around 04:15 in the morning, the Germans spotted Eidsvold. Captain Odd Isaachsen Willoch aboard Eidsvold immediately ordered to signal the leading German destroyer with an Aldis lamp, and when the Germans failed to respond to the signal, he ordered a warning shot placed before their bow while he flew a two flag signal, ordering the destroyer to halt. Since the Germans had orders to occupy Norway peacefully if at all possible, the German destroyer Wilhelm Heidkamp stopped, and signalled Eidsvold that it would send an officer to negotiate. From a distance of about 200 metres, a small launch ferried Korvettenkapit√§n Gerlach over to Eidsvold. Gerlach and a signalman were received on the aft deck of Eidsvold by the second in command, and were taken to the bridge to speak to Captain Willoch. At the same time, the gun crews aboard Eidsvold kept the German destroyer in their sights, both the 21 cm guns and the 15 cm guns. Due to the short distance, the trajectory of the shells would have been flat, making it hard not to hit the thinly armoured vessel. Uniform of HNoMS Eidsvold crew member At the bridge, Gerlach tried to convince Willoch that the Germans had arrived as friends and that Willoch should surrender his ship peacefully. Willoch countered by pointing out that he was bound by duty to resist, but did ask for a ten-minute break to consider the matter. However, instead of considering surrender, Willoch used this time to contact his superiors, as well as the captain of Norge, informing them of his intent to attack the German forces. While this was going on, another German destroyer had crossed behind Eidsvold and took up a position from the vessel, ready to fire her torpedoes. Gerlach tried once again to convince Willoch to surrender, but was turned down a second time. As he left the deck of Eidsvold, he fired a red flare, indicating that the Norwegians wished to fight. At this point, Captain Willoch hurried towards the bridge, while shouting \\"P√• plass ved kanonene. N√• skal vi sl√•ss, gutter!\\" (\\"Man the guns. We're gonna fight, boys!\\"). Eidsvold turned towards the closest destroyer and accelerated, while the battery commander ordered the port battery (three 15 cm guns) to open fire. However, the Germans - afraid Eidsvold might ram the destroyer - fired four torpedoes at the old coastal defence ship. Two or three of the torpedoes hit before the port guns could fire, according to Norwegian sources: one under the rear turret, one midship and one in the bow. It is likely that the torpedoes ignited one of the magazines aboard, because Eidsvold was blown in two and sunk in seconds, propellers still turning. Only six of the crew were rescued, while 175 died in the freezing water. ==The wreck== Some remains of Eidsvold lie in shallow waters at the entrance to Narvik harbour. Mostly salvaged in situ, only minor remains are left of the ship.PS Eidsvold at Skovheim.org, retrieved 2 January 2007 ==NotesSources== * * Category:Eidsvold-class coastal defence ships Category:Ships built on the River Tyne Category:1900 ships Category:World War II coastal defence ships of Norway Category:Maritime incidents in April 1940 Category:World War II shipwrecks in the Norwegian Sea ","title":"HNoMS Eidsvold"},{"id":"2225630","text":"Mark Lewin (born March 16, 1937) is an American retired professional wrestler. == Early life == Lewin was born in Buffalo, New York. He had two elder brothers, Donn and Ted, both of whom also became professional wrestlers. He attended Lafayette High School. == Professional wrestling career == Lewin was trained to wrestle by his brother-in-law, Danny McShain. He debuted in 1953 at the age of 16. Lewin had great early success in a matinee-idol babyface tag team with Don Curtis, headlining in major territories like New York and Chicago. The team's brief heel turn was a shock to its many fans. The team split up in the early '60s and Mark embarked on a singles career. In 1963, Mark first tried out the \\"Maniac\\"/\\"Mad\\" Mark Lewin persona, which he would alternate consistently with his 'normal' babyface persona for the rest of his career. He wrestled in Australia and New Zealand in the 1960s and 1970s with great success, especially in New Zealand where he drew huge crowds during the tours. He frequently formed a tag team in Australia and New Zealand with King Curtis Iaukea. He also spent time in Detroit working against The Sheik and fellow wildman, Terry Funk. Lewin also wrestled in Vancouver with NWA All Star Wrestling, where he feuded with the likes of Gene Kiniski and \\"Bulldog\\" Bob Brown and twice won the Pacific Coast Heavyweight title. He found a lot of success in World Class Championship Wrestling in the late 1970s and early 1980s before going to Florida Championship Wrestling, where he joined Kevin Sullivan's \\"cult\\" as The Purple Haze, another variation of the 'Maniac' gimmick. Lewin worked as a booker for Jim Barnett in Australia. He was one of Sabu's frequent opponents in the 1980s. Lewin retired in 1998, but came back mid 2003 to work for Eddie Jr. and Thomas Farhat to start up All World Wrestling League/Big Time Wrestling. ==Championships and accomplishments== *All-Star Pro Wrestling **NWA Australasian Tag Team Championship (3 times) - with Steve Rickard (1), Al Perez (1), and Spiros Arion (1) *Big Time Wrestling **NWA United States Heavyweight Championship (Detroit version) (2 times) *Capitol Wrestling Corporation **NWA United States Tag Team Championship (Northeast version) (2 times) - with Don Curtis *Championship Wrestling from Florida **NWA Southern Heavyweight Championship (Florida version) (1 time) *Georgia Championship Wrestling **NWA International Tag Team Championship (Georgia version) (1 time) - with Donn Lewin *Maple Leaf Wrestling **NWA International Tag Team Championship (Toronto version) (1 time) - with Whipper Billy Watson *NWA All-Star Wrestling **NWA Canadian Tag Team Championship (Vancouver version) (1 time) - with Steven Little Bear **NWA Pacific Coast Heavyweight Championship (Vancouver version) (2 times) *NWA Hollywood Wrestling **WWA Americas Heavyweight Championship (1 time) **WWA World Heavyweight Championship (1 time) *NWA Big Time Wrestling / World Class Championship Wrestling **NWA American Tag Team Championship (2 times) - with The Spoiler **NWA Brass Knuckles Championship (Texas version) (8 times) **NWA Texas Heavyweight Championship (3 times)* **NWA Texas Tag Team Championship (1 time) - with Dick Steinborn **NWA World Six-Man Tag Team Championship (Texas version) (1 time) - with Killer Tim Brooks & One Man Gang *Pro Wrestling Illustrated **PWI ranked him # 265 of the 500 best singles wrestlers during the \\"PWI Years\\" in 2003. *Professional Wrestling Hall of Fame and Museum **(Class of 2009) - with Don Curtis *World Championship Wrestling (Australia) **IWA World Heavyweight Championship (2 times) **IWA World Tag Team Championship (8 times) - with King Curtis Iaukea (2), Bearcat Wright (1), Dominic DeNucci (1), Spiros Arion (1), Mario Milano, (1), Killer Kowalski (1) and Antonio Pugliese (1) **NWA Austra-Asian Tag Team Championship (1 time) - with Spiros Arion *Wrestling Observer Newsletter **Wrestling Observer Newsletter Hall of Fame (Class of 2017) 1This World Championship Wrestling was an NWA affiliated promotion based in Australia that operated from the mid-1960s to the early-1990s.

The organization argues that while the Second Vatican Council had introduced vernacular liturgies, it did not actually forbid the Latin Mass, and that regular weekday and Sunday Masses in Latin should be maintained. The organization also seeks to promote Latin Gregorian Chant, sacred polyphony and sacred art. Unlike some of the other Catholic traditionalist organizations, Una Voce seeks to remain faithful to the Pope within the Catholic Church, and asserts that the Tridentine and the vernacular masses should be allowed to co-exist. Among its prominent early members were the composers Maurice Durufl√© and Olivier Messiaen. A number of national associations developed during 1964 and 1965, and in 1966 an international association, the Foederatio Internationalis Una Voce was formed. It currently has over two dozen national affiliates. FIUV members value the traditional Latin Mass as direct link with the early Church and for conveying the mystery and majesty of God, but have been critiqued for elitism and for its emphasis on private religious devotion. The group has been described as an \\"arch-conservative\\" organization by Episcopal Church organist James E Frazier. Traditionalist Catholics usually uphold orthodox Catholic moral teaching on abortion, contraception and marriage. However, members of the FIUV reject comparisons to fundamentalism.

The team was a member of the United Soccer Leagues Premier Development League (PDL), the fourth tier of the American Soccer Pyramid, until 2006, when the team left the league and the franchise was terminated. The Blizzard played their home games at Sand Creek Stadium in the city of Colorado Springs, Colorado and also in the stadium at Harrison High School, also in Colorado Springs. The team's colors were red and white. ==Final Squad== vs Kansas City Brass, 23 July 2006 ==Year-by-year== {  !Year !Division !League !Regular Season !Playoffs !Open Cup - 2004 4 USL PDL 7th, Heartland Did not qualify Did not qualify - 2005 4 USL PDL 6th, Heartland Did not qualify Did not qualify - 2006 4 USL PDL 6th, Heartland Did not qualify Did not qualify } ==Competition History== Blizzard entered the PDL as an expansion franchise in 2004 as the third team from the Pikes Peak area to play in the league, following the runs of the Colorado Springs Stampede (1995‚Äì2000) and Colorado Springs Ascent (2001). Under owner/head coach Bill Arbogast Blizzard's first season in competition began strongly with back-to-back wins in their first two games, 4‚Äì0 over Kansas City Brass and 4‚Äì3 over state rivals Boulder Rapids Reserve, with Sean McGinnis and Daniel Wasson finding the net. This was as good as the season got, as they struggled to find consistency thereafter. They remained potent in front of goal throughout the year ‚Äì they beat St. Louis Strikers 5‚Äì3 (with McGinnis scoring a hat trick), overpowered Sioux Falls Spitfire 4‚Äì1 in mid- June, and enjoyed an excellent 5‚Äì0 win on the road in St. Louis in July. This was counteracted by several heavy defeats, including a 6‚Äì2 hammering by BYU Cougars, a 4‚Äì1 defeat to Boulder Rapids Reserve, a 4‚Äì0 thrashing on the road at the El Paso Patriots, and two 3‚Äì0 losses on the end of season run in. Blizzard finished their first campaign 7th in the Heartland Division, 35 points adrift of divisional champions Chicago Fire Premier. The 2005 season was a struggle for Blizzard; they dropped their opening three games of the season by significant margins, and left it late to pick up their first win 3‚Äì1 at home to Sioux Falls Spitfire at the end of May. However, this victory did not signal a turnaround in fortunes: they lost five of their next six games, beating expansion side Springfield Storm 3‚Äì1, but suffering heavy defeats to El Paso Patriots (3‚Äì0), Boulder Rapids Reserve (5‚Äì1) and BYU Cougars (6‚Äì2). Blizzard's fourth and final win of the season came at home in mid-July with a 3‚Äì1 victory over Kansas City Brass, but slumped to four consecutive losses in their final four games, including a 6‚Äì1 demolition by Boulder Rapids Reserve, and a humiliating 5‚Äì0 defeat by Des Moines Menace on the last day of the season. They finished the year 6th in the Heartland Division, 26 points off the leaders and just three points off the basement. Top scorer Ryan Regrutto did manage to hit 5 goals, while Craig Miller contributed 3 assists. John Wells was brought in as head coach for the 2006 season. The team won just three games all season‚Äî3‚Äì0 over Sioux Falls Spitfire in mid-June, 4‚Äì3 over expansion franchise Ogden Outlaws in early July, and 2‚Äì0 over fellow Utah team BYU Cougars. This was as good as it got for Blizzard: most of the rest of the season was spent enduring a series of heavy defeats, including a 4‚Äì1 thrashing at home by Des Moines Menace, a 6‚Äì1 demolition at the hands of Colorado Rapids U23's, a 3‚Äì1 loss on the road in Sioux Falls, and a 1‚Äì0 loss to Kansas City Brass on the final day of the season in what turned out to be the franchise's last ever game. Blizzard finished 2006 6th in the Heartland Division for the second consecutive year, three points ahead of Thunder Bay Chill, but 30 behind divisional champions Colorado. Joel Trainer was Blizzard's top scorer, with 7 goals, while Ryan Regrutto and Craig Miller both contributed 3 assists. Following the conclusion of the 2006 season the club folded, and left the PDL. The Blizzards season was capped off by a 2 win road trip in Utah which is a tuff Road Trip and getting 2 wins on the Road the same weekend in the PDL is rare. The Road trip was on the heels of a Wednesday night match with the Colorado Rapids at Sand Creek Stadium. Coach Fernando Clavijo and John Murphy arrived with the Rapids to play in front of a crowd of about 2,000 to watch the Blizzard come away with a 3‚Äì2 win which would prove to be the highlight of the Blizzards 2006 season. ==Coaches== * Bill Arbogast 2004‚Äì05 * John Wells 2006 ==Stadia== * Washburn Field, Colorado Springs, Colorado 2004‚Äì05 * Sand Creek Stadium, Colorado Springs, Colorado 2005‚Äì06 * Stadium at Harrison High School, Colorado Springs, Colorado 2006 (2 games) ==Average Attendance== * 2006: 219 * 2005: 752 Category:Sports in Colorado Springs, Colorado B Category:Defunct Premier Development League teams Category:2004 establishments in Colorado Category:2006 disestablishments in Colorado Category:Association football clubs established in 2004 Category:Association football clubs disestablished in 2006 ","title":"Colorado Springs Blizzard"},{"id":"2225658","text":"The Committee of 100 is a leadership organization of Chinese Americans in business, government, academia and the arts whose stated aim is \\"to encourage constructive relations between the peoples of the United States and Greater China.\\" It was founded in 1990 by I.

It is located beneath Chesed ('loving-kindness'), at the base of the \\"Pillar of Mercy\\" which also consists of Chochmah ('wisdom'). Netzach generally translates to 'eternity', and in the context of Kabbalah refers to 'perpetuity', 'victory', or 'endurance'. ==Ancient Israelite explanation== Netzach (Hebrew ◊†◊¶◊ó) communicates the idea of long- suffering, strength, endurance unto completion or patience. This term appears eight times in the Hebrew scriptures and derivatives of this child root ◊†◊¶◊ó from the parent root ◊†◊ó appear over forty times in the Hebrew text. See the following passages: * 1 Samuel 15:29 ◊ï÷∞◊í÷∑◊ù÷ô ◊†÷µ÷£◊¶÷∑◊ó ◊ô÷¥◊©÷∞◊Ç◊®÷∏◊ê÷µ÷î◊ú ◊ú÷π÷•◊ê Also the strength (◊†◊¶◊ó) of Israel will not.... * Job 34:36 ◊ê÷¥◊ô÷º÷£◊ï÷π◊ë ◊¢÷∑◊ì÷æ ◊†÷∂÷ë◊¶÷∑◊ó ◊¢÷∑◊ú÷æ ◊™÷∞÷º÷ù◊©÷ª◊Å◊ë÷π÷ó◊™ I request [that] Job will be proven up to the limit (◊†◊¶◊ó); he will return above men of misfortune. * Psalms 13:1 ◊ô÷∞÷≠◊î◊ï÷∏◊î ◊™÷¥÷º◊©÷∞◊Å◊õ÷∏÷º◊ó÷µ÷£◊†÷¥◊ô ◊†÷∂÷ë◊¶÷∑◊ó ◊¢÷∑◊ì÷æ ◊ê÷∏÷ì◊†÷∏◊î Yahweh, will You forget me continually (◊†◊¶◊ó)? Until when? * Jeremiah 15:18a ◊î÷∏◊ô÷∏÷§◊î ◊õ÷∞◊ê÷µ◊ë÷¥◊ô÷ô ◊†÷∂÷î◊¶÷∑◊ó ◊ï÷º◊û÷∑◊õ÷∏÷º◊™÷¥÷ñ◊ô ◊ê÷≤◊†◊ï÷º◊©÷∏◊Å÷ë◊î÷ô Why has my suffering been without end (◊†◊¶◊ó)? * Amos 1:11c ◊ï÷∞◊¢÷∂◊ë÷∞◊®÷∏◊™÷ñ◊ï÷π ◊©÷∞◊Å◊û÷∏÷•◊®÷∏◊î ◊†÷∂÷Ω◊¶÷∑◊ó◊É and he nursed his grudge forever(◊†◊¶◊ó). English translations are original translations by editor Charles Williams ==Jewish Kabbalah== Within the Sefiroth, Netzach sits geometrically across from Hod. This pairing makes up the third such group, the \\"tactical\\" sefirot, meaning that their purpose is not inherent in themselves, but rather as a means for something else. These sefirot mark a turning point. Whereas the first two groups of sefirot deal with God's intrinsic will, and what it is that He desires to bestow upon man, these sefirot are focused on man: What is the most appropriate way for man to receive God's message? How can God's will be implemented most effectively? Netzach refers to actions of God that are Chesed, \\"kindness,\\" in essence, but are presented through a prelude of harshness. Hod refers specifically to those events where the \\"wicked prosper.\\" It is retribution ‚ÄîGevurah, \\"strength/restraint,\\" in essence, but presented by a prelude of pleasantness. Netzach is \\"endurance,\\" the fortitude, and patience to follow through on your passions. It is paired with Hod as the righteous attributes related to group interactivity, with Netzach being leadership, the ability to rally others to a cause and motivate them to act; while Hod is community, the ability to do the footwork needed to follow through on ideas and make them happen. Netzach is identified with our right (left leg or foot) when the Tree of Life is portrayed on the human form, while Hod is on our left (right leg or foot). The angelic order of Netzach is the Elohim, the ruling Archangel of which is Haniel. ==In Christianity== Netzach is considered one of the Fruits of the Spirit in the Pauline Epistles (Romans 5:3, Galatians 5:22) ==References * Lessons in Tanya * Kabbalah 101: Netzach & Hod Category:Sephirot Category:Hebrew words and phrases Category:Kabbalistic words and phrases Category:Venus in culture ","title":"Netzach"},{"id":"2225681","text":"Matt Smith (born 31 October 1972) is the current and longest-serving editor of long-running British science fiction weekly comics anthology magazine 2000 AD, and also the longest-running editor of its sister title Judge Dredd Megazine.

Keith-Falconer was born in Edinburgh. After attending Harrow School and studying at the University of Cambridge, he moved into evangelistic work in London. In 1886, he was appointed Arabic professor at Cambridge, but his career was cut short near Aden while in missionary work. He translated the Fables of Bidpa√Ø. He was an athlete, a champion cyclist and is described as a world cycling champion in 1878. ==Background== Keith-Falconer was the third son of the Earl of Kintore and shared his childhood between the ancestral home in Scotland and Brighton on the southern English coast. In 1869, when he was 13, he succeeded in obtaining a place, through examination, at Harrow School, then in countryside north-west of London. He took notes of his lessons in shorthand, which he had taught himself.Sinker, Robert (1890), Memorials of the Hon Ion Keith-Falconer MA, Deighton Bell and Co, UK Keith-Falconer left Harrow in 1873, having acquired a tutor to teach him mathematics, studying with the Rev Lewis Hensley at his vicarage in Hitchin. As well as trigonometry and algebra and other subjects which seem not to have interested him particularly, he continued cycling and learned to sing. \\"This,\\" said Hensley, was \\"for the promotion of the Temperance cause, to which he devoted himself by assisting in the entertainments and addresses of a Temperance Brigade of young men.\\" Keith- Falconer went up to Trinity College, Cambridge, in September 1874. He lived at 21 Market Hill until he married. He finished his graduate studies with a First and began to read for honours in theological tripos. ==Cycling== A teacher at Harrow School, E. E. Bowen, said: :His bicycling feats were one common subject of interest between us. Bicycles were just coming into fashion when he went to the University; he was an enthusiast in the use of them and an admirable performer; and when he appeared in riding costume at Harrow, with his tall figure mounted on the enormous machine that he rode, it was a sight to see. He kept up the amusement for many years: for two or more he was certainly the best bicyclist in England, and his delight in success only shewed in more than common relief the charming modesty with which he carried his honours. The cycling historian Jim McGurn said: :Keith-Falconer came from an aristocratic family in the Scottish Highlands. Having ridden a low velocipede at Harrow School he took to the high bicycle as a student at Cambridge. He was 6ft 3in tall (1m 87), an exceptional height for the period, even for an aristocrat of well-nourished stock. He could master a very high machine, which gave him a competitive advantage.Because the gearing and therefore the distance a high bicycle, or penny-farthing, moved with each turn of the pedals, a rider with longer legs could sit astride a larger wheel Keith-Falconer also had the money to buy the best bicycles and the leisure to tour extensively. Although he may have been the fastest cyclist in the world, his cycling interests were of secondary importance to him. So amateurish was his attitude that on at least two occasions he forgot about racing engagements and turned up at short notice to win in heroic style.McGurn, James (1987), On Your Bicycle, John Murray, UK It was while at Cambridge ‚Äì where he was elected vice-president of the university bicycle club on 6 June 1874 ‚Äì that he won his first bicycle races. In a letter to his sister-in-law on 11 November 1874, he wrote: :Yesterday was the ten-mile bicycle race. Three started. I was one. I ran the distance in 34 minutes, being the fastest time, amateur or professional, on record. I was not at all exhausted... Today I am going to amuse the public by riding an 86-inch bicycle to Trumpington and back. There is a little scale of steps up it,The small steps along the spine of the bicycle so that he could climb into the saddle up which I am helped, and then started off and left to myself. It is great fun riding this leviathan: it creates such an extraordinary sensation among the old dons who happen to be passing. In 1875, he won a club race over the from Hatfield to Cambridge, and on 10 May won a race against Oxford University from St Albans to Oxford, . The following April he won a four-mile (6 km) race, described as \\"the amateur championship\\", at Lillie Bridge, setting a record time. On 15 May he won the Cambridge club's race at Fenner's in 3h 20m 37s. On 11 May 1878 he won the National Cyclists' Union two-mile (3 km) championship at Stamford Bridge. It was probably this race that gave him the status of world champion. Until the creation of the International Cycling Association, the NCU's championships were considered the unofficial championships of the world.Scottish Cyclist, 30 November 1892, p856 In 1882, Keith-Falconer rode from Land's End to John o' Groats, the length of Britain, in 13 days. He rode in his last two days. His last race of importance was the amateur championship on 29 July 1882, at Crystal Palace, outside London. He won, seven minutes better than the record, in 2h 43m 58s. On 28 May 1881, Keith-Falconer went cycle-touring through Oxford, Pangbourne and Harrow, a warm-up to his Land's End ‚Äì John o'Groats ride, that started on 4 June. Riding from one end of Britain to the other was, in the 19th century, a journey of poor or unmade roads, riding a high-wheeled bicycle with precarious balance and poor brakes. It demanded good weather. When it did not come, Keith- Falconer left Penzance after four days and returned to London and Cambridge. Keith-Falconer's views on cycling were not always those shared by cyclists of lesser opportunity. On 20 August 1881 he wrote to his friend Mr Charrington, with whom he worked in the East End of London (see below): :It is an excellent thing to encourage an innocent sport (such as bicycling) which keeps young fellows out of the public-houses, music halls and gambling hells and all the other traps that are ready to catch them. It is a great advantage to enter for a few races in public, and not merely to ride on the road for exercise, because in the former case one has to train oneself and this involves abstinence from beer and wine and tobacco, and early going to bed and early rising, and gets one's body into a really vigorous, healthy state. As to betting, nearly all Clubs forbid it, strictly... A bicycle race-course is as quiet as a public science lecture. ==Early evangelism== The area outside Cambridge known as Barnwell was then a rough area inhabited largely by labourers working on the railways, of which four competing lines met in Cambridge. Others worked in the fossil beds. Robert Sinker, Keith-Falconer's biographer, said the labourers were \\"mostly poor and ignorant, including even yet a large number of persons following vicious courses; and while the Gospel teaching of a band of devoted men was gradually leavening the mass, yet while the workers were slowly gaining on the task which faced them, hundreds were dying.\\" Keith-Falconer threw himself with others in May 1875 into a missionary project for the area. They hired a theatre and held preaching meetings there for a month. \\"All this time,\\" Sinker said, \\"Keith-Falconer was a steady and consistent helper of the mission, by his purse, by his personal cooperation, and we may feel sure by his prayers.\\" At the end of the month, they judged their work a success and repeated the process for three and a half years at the Ragged School, in New Street. There, Sinker said: :The gathering of people, of whom there were several hundreds, displayed a remarkable contrast to an ordinary Christian congregation. They represented a whole stratum decidedly below that of the decent working man of the poorer sort. Many were ragged, most were dirty and unkempt, and before the service began, many behaved outrageously. Yet when the service began, I rejoice to say, the conduct was orderly enough; evidently many, while coming in the first instance merely from curiosity, bore in their way a friendly feeling enough for their neighbours. Yet it may be noted, as shewing the stratum from which the bulk was drawn, that on one of the speakers' remarking: 'A great many of you, I know, have been, and some I fear still are, thieves!' he was greeted, in tones which shewed that no offence had been taken, with ready cries of 'Yes, sir!' Keith-Falconer lectured this audience on Zelophehad's daughters. The theatre in Barnwell became available in autumn 1878 and the evangelists acquired it, although outbid at the auction. Keith-Falconer was also involved in acquisition of the Great Assembly Hall in Mile End Road, in the East End of London. Here, the Tower Hamlets Mission was established. The state of the area is summarised by this account: :At the close of one of the meetings, a little boy was found sobbing. With some difficulty he was induced to tell his tale. It was simple. His widowed mother, his sisters, and he, all lived in one room. Everything had been sold to buy bread, except two white mice, the boy's pets. Through all their poverty, they had kept these white mice; but at last they too must go! With the proceeds he bought street songs, which he retailed on the 'waste'Possibly meaning singing the songs on waste ground in the area and so obtained the means of getting more bread for his mother and his sisters. Now they were completely destitute. The boy was accompanied home. Home! It was a wretched attic, in one of the most dilapidated houses. It was a wretchedly cold and dismal day. In the broken-down grate the dead embers of yesterday's firing remained. On the table, in a piece of newspaper, were a few crumbs. 'My good woman,' said Mr Charrington [one of the mission's members], 'why don't you open the window?' 'Oh,' she replied, 'you would not say that if you had nothing to eat and had no fire to warm you.' The family was relieved. ==Arab interests== Keith-Falconer taught himself Hebrew at Harrow and then moved on to other Semitic languages. At Cambridge he studied for a Semitic languages tripos, studying Hebrew, Arabic and Syriac. He required a deep knowledge of the Hebrew Bible. He passed. Keith-Falconer continued his study of Arabic in Germany, as much to perfect speaking German as deepen his knowledge of Arabia. He stayed at Leipzig for five months of 1881. That year he met General Gordon, who on 25 April 1881 wrote to him from Southampton: :My dear Mr Keith-Falconer :I only wish I could put you into something that would give you the work you need, viz. secular and religious work, running side by side. This is the proper work for man and I think you could find it. Would you like to go to Stamboul (Istanbul) as extra unpaid attach√© to Lord Dufferin; if so, why not try it, or else as private secretary to Saint Petersburg? If not, will you then come to me in Syria to the Hermitage? Believe me with kind regards, yours faithfully C. G. Gordon. In October, Keith-Falconer left for Assiout, 350 km from Cairo, on the Nile. It was the most distant point of the Egyptian railway. His first impressions were poor. On 20 November he wrote: :The dust ‚Äì I shall never forget it. I tried to read Dozy's Islamisme but in a short time the book and I got so filthy with the dust, that I became irritable and uncomfortable and could not read... There are a number of Greeks in Egypt and they dislike anything like manual labour, preferring to keep shops, and especially restaurants and hotels. Dr Hogg (his host] is a first-rate Arabist. He preaches in Arabic perfectly fluently. He teaches his students in Arabic, including the Sol-Fa class. (The Arabs have wretched ears, and Dr Hogg tells me that it was only by means of the Sol-Fa that he could get anything like music out of them.) On 30 November he wrote: :I am disappointed with Egypt, both as to scenery and climate. It is a vile place for catching cold. Buildings seem constructed with a view to as many draughts as possible... are no bells. This is the greatest drawback of all. You have to go outside your door and clap your hands, and when you have repeated this performance five or six times, the Arab may begin to have a suspicion that somebody wants him; and when you at last get him, it will be very wonderful if he does what you want. He went back to Europe. ==Land's End to John o' Groats== It was on returning to England that he made a second attempt on the long-distance record. He kept a diary which appeared in a newspaper in Aberdeen and in The London Bicycle Club Gazette. On his first day he rode into sweeping rain near Bodmin. :Heavy rain was now falling and necessitated an hour's halt. I had not got six miles out of Bodmin when a second and more violent storm of rain and mist gave me a bath all for nothing. So I pulled up again at a lonely village called Jamaica... Here I sat for five and a half weary hours at a little temperance inn, for there is no public-house in Jamaica. A copy of Butler's Dissertation on Virtue, which I found here, served, I hope, to reconcile me to the weather... :Third day. During the ride through Somerton (171) to Glastonbury (183), I became the victim first of stupidity, then of malice. A waggoner seeing me about to overtake him pulled very suddenly to the wrong side, and sent me sprawling over a heap of flints. No harm done. Shortly after that a wilful misdirection given to me by a playful Somersetian sent me 2¬Ω miles in the wrong direction, so that I traversed 12 instead of seven miles between Somerton and Glastonbury. Wells Cathedral (188) was one of the few sights I lingered to see. It is gorgeous. :Fifth day: Sunshine and rain alternated rapidly until the afternoon... The last 10 miles were done in the dark, rendered more intense by the rain-clouds. To ride along a stone road on a dark, rainy night is a most severe trial of nerve and temper. One cannot see the stones to avoid them, and each time the wheel goes over one, the machine is jerked up or thrust to one side, and the rider gets a shake that makes his heart jump into his mouth. :Sixth day: On emerging from the hotel I found to my horror that a furious north-west wind was blowing. I struggled on as far as Doncaster (412), when I became sick of fighting against that strong man, and threw up the sponge. After a good dinner at the Reindeer, I went to bed for a couple of hours, expecting that the wind would lull in the evening ‚Äì it did so, but of course the road got bad then. A wet, greasy o√∂lite road rendered more delightful by the recent gyrations of a feathery traction-engine, is a treat not soon forgotten by the bicyclist. :Eleventh day: To-day was a failure. After passing Blair Atholl (756), the glen becomes rapidly higher and narrower. The wind came sweeping down as though through a funnel... Another walking tour. After three miles my foot began to complain. At Dulnacardoch I was in such pain that I was obliged to invade a farm-house and ask for rest and food. :Thirteenth and last day: I rose to find my foot horribly stiff and painful. But the day was fine, no wind, and only 110 miles more to run... After refreshing and nursing myself at the Station Hotel [Wick, at midnight], I started again, to the blank astonishment of landlord, boots and waiters. The utter solitude, stillness and dreariness of the remaining 19 miles made a most remarkable impression on me. No one tree, bush or hedge did I see the whole way. At twenty minutes past three I stood stiff, sore and hungry before John O'Groats Hotel. I had ridden 994 miles in 13 days less 45 minutes. I had no difficulty rousing the landlord, and was soon asleep. ==Aden== Keith-Falconer chose Aden for his missionary work after reading an article by General Haig, whom he went to see in London. Haig had urged the Church Missionary Society to establish a mission there. There were reports that children attending the Roman Catholic mission returned to Islam on leaving. Keith-Falconer visited Aden in November 1885 for a six-month trial.Aden Airways ‚Äì Profile of Ion Falconer On 18 November he wrote to his mother: :I doubt whether anyone could leave here long without a weakening of all his faculties. I read Arabic for several hours a day, and a native fikih, or schoolmaster, comes daily to instruct me. Aden is not without its disadvantages as a mission station. The climate is very enervating and at the same time there is no hill-station anywhere near for the missionaries to go and recruit; but possibly after time such a hill-station will be opened. The relations between the English and the neighbouring tribes become more satisfactory as time goes on. He and his wife first lived near Crater Pass, overlooking Crater City. He distributed scriptures in the town and read publicly from an Arabic Bible. He then moved to Sheikh Othman, which had wells, a better climate and access to the interior by camel trails. In November 1886 Keith-Falconer and his wife returned to Aden definitively. He had the support of the Free Church to establish an orphanage and the help of a Glasgow physician, Stewart Corwen. They lived in a house with a walled garden. Alongside it was a hut in which Corwen saw his patients. On 22 February 1887 Keith-Falconer wrote about catching malaria, which he called Aden fever: :I never felt so utterly miserable in all my life... One of our Somali servants has had it as well, but coupled with a great deal of shivering... Quinine is quite useless in this fever, one must simply grin and bear it. He had repeated occurrences of malaria, speaking of \\"the long spell of fever which both my wife and I have been through\\", then that \\"our illness has thrown us back in every way\\", later that \\"I have been suffering from remitting fever; for twelve weary weeks, on my back a useless invalid.\\" Finally, his biographer wrote: :It was almost exactly six months after the young missionary, full of keen hopes and joyous anticipations, had left England for the East, that the telegram told the unlooked-for news of his death and his burial amid the scene of his labours... That warm, loving heart, that keen, active brain, were, for this world, at rest.Sinker, Robert (1890), Memorials of the Hon Ion Keith-Falconer MA, Deighton Bell and Co, UK ==Personal life and death== Keith-Falconer married Gwendolen Bevan, daughter of the banker Robert Cooper Lee Bevan, in Cannes on 4 March 1884. They had their honeymoon in southern France and in Italy, where they inspected the remains of Pompeii before moving to 5 Salisbury Villas, Station Road, Cambridge. He died in Aden after repeated bouts of malaria for which there was no cure.The British-Yemeni Society ‚Äì The Keith-Falconer Mission, 1886‚Äì1963 He was 30.McGurn, James (1987), On Your Bicycle, John Murray, UK A memorial church to him there opened 10 years later. He is buried in Holkat Bay cemetery. The Scottish Mission school and hospital at Sheikh Othman continued until the independence of South Yemen in 1967. The foreword by the Rev Robert Sinker, librarian of Trinity College, Cambridge, to his biography, Memorials of the Hon Ion Keith-Falconer MA says: :A career of exceptional promise was early closed in the death of Ion Keith-Falconer. The beauty of his character, his ardent missionary zeal, his great learning, form a combination rarely equalled... How noble a life his was, how unselfish, how worthy to be loved, those who knew him know well; how hard it is to adequately set forth, on the one hand, its harmonious beauty, on the other, the rich variety of its aspects, I am very fully conscious. ==References Bibliography == * Keith- Falconer, I.G.N., Kalilah and Dimnah, or, The Fables of Bidpai : being an account of their literary history / with an English translation of the later Syriac version of the same, and notes, Cambridge : University Press, (1885) * Sinker, Robert, Memorials of the Hon.

Founded in 2003, the team plays in the USL Premier Development League (PDL), the fourth tier of the American Soccer Pyramid, in the Northwest Division of the Western Conference. The team plays its home games at Bateman Park, where they have played since 2004. The team's colors are black, white and red. Until 2007 the team was known as the Abbotsford Rangers, but changed their name prior to the 2008 season to reflect the name of their parent organization. ==History== The Abbotsford area has long had a history of competitive developmental teams, including Abbotsford 86ers Select in 2000, Abbotsford 86ers in 1999 and Abbotsford Athletes in Action in 1998; Abbotsford Rangers joined the PDL as a 'provisional team' in 2003, playing at Rotary Stadium, but struggled on the field, losing their first eight games, and not picking up a win until mid-June when they topped Cascade Surge 3-2 off goals by Jason Jorgensen, Brad Peetoom and Spencer Schmidt. The victory sparked an unexpected 4-game winning streak which included a season's best 3-1 victory over Calgary Storm Select, but the resurgence was too little too late for the team, and the season ended with them in fourth place, and Jason Jorgensen as the top scorer. 2004 saw the Rangers move into a new home at Bateman Park, and hire a new player-manager in the shape of former Hamilton Academical and Canada defender Colin Miller, who had been in the Canadian squad for the 1986 FIFA World Cup. Despite Miller's presence, Abbotsford's results did not improve greatly; they did not pick up their first win until the fourth game (2-1 over Yakima Reds), and only managed three more victories all season. Things hit an all-time low on the final day of the season with their 5-0 demolition at the hands of Cascade Surge, and they again finished way off the pace, 19 points behind champions Cascade. 2005 saw Abbotsford slip even further behind their competition, finishing their season a full 29 points behind defending champions Cascade Surge in the Northwest division, with just 3 wins and 21 goals all year. Abbotsford suffered greatly on the road, losing 5-1 and 4-1 to Cascade, and didn't pick up a single point until their 2-1 victory away to Yakima Reds in mid-June. All of Abbotsford's wins were against Yakima, triumphing two more times, including a 1-0 final day victory on a goal by the consistent Jason Jorgensen. Nevertheless, Abbotsford's poor form was worrying for all involved. Early Abbotsford Rangers logo Then, quite inexplicably, everything changed in 2006. Miller's men were hot from the get- go, with an opening day tie with newcomers Tacoma F.C., and then back-to-back victories over Yakima Reds and the other Northwest newcomers, Ogden Outlaws. June saw the team embark on an unprecedented 6-game unbeaten streak, the highlight of which was a 4-0 road thumping of Cascade Surge. As the season wound down, Abbotsford were one of three teams vying for the playoffs, knowing that two victories in their final two games would take them into uncharted territory. A 4-0 triumph over Cascade - which included a hat trick from Sean Crocker - was followed by a comprehensive 3-0 win over Tacoma, and the Rangers had their first Northwest title, and were off to the playoffs. However, their post season was a short one, as they lost 3-2 to Orange County Blue Star first time out, despite being 2-0 up at half time. Colin Miller left Abbotsford in the 2006 close season to become Billy Davies' assistant at Derby County in the Premier League, and he was replaced by former Canadian international Shaun Lowther for the 2007 campaign. Initially the managerial change seemed to affect Abbotsford's excellent form, the team picking up just one win and four ties in their first ten game. However, following their come-from-behind 3-2 win against Yakima Reds at the end of June, something clicked into place for Abbotsford: from that point on they began to utterly demolish their opponents, thrashing Cascade Surge 4-0, topping Yakima Reds 3-0, beating Tacoma Tide 4-1, and finishing the year with an absolutely astonishing 11-0 win over Spokane Spiders which included a double hat-trick SIX goals from striker James Severn. However, this late rally was not enough for them to make the playoffs, and they eventually finished a close third in the table behind BYU Cougars and Tacoma Tide. Abbotsford began the 2008 season as the first-ever opponents of the new Vancouver Whitecaps Residency franchise; they lost the opening matchup 3-1, but won their next fixture against BYU Cougars, setting in motion the story of most of the rest of the season. 2008 was the year of 'boom or bust' for Abbotsford, where almost every game was either a resounding victory or a humiliating defeat: they beat Cascade Surge 5-0 in a game which featured a hat trick from Adrian Kekec, beat Spokane Spiders 4-0 at home, and put another four past Cascade at the beginning of July. At the other end of the scale, they were hammered 4-1 by Vancouver Whitecaps Residency in the second of their three matchups, were on the receiving end of a 5-1 thrashing from eventual divisional champs Tacoma Tide, and lost 4-1 to Yakima Reds in the middle of the five-game winless streak that concluded their season. While Abbotsford's games were never anything less than entertaining, their erratic form proved costly, as they finished the season in 6th place. Spencer Schmidt was top scorer for the season, with 7 goals, while Justin Cordick scored five goals and contributed 4 assists. 2009 was a return to the disappointing form of previous years for the Mariners, despite starting the season optimism following the hiring of local soccer personality Alan Errington as head coach. After a loss and a draw, they opened 2 game series at home against the new Victoria Highlanders franchise, and drew their home opener 2-2.http://www.uslsoccer.com/teams/2009/22292.html#SCHEDULE Following their 2-1 return win over Victoria and 4-0 thrashing of the Spokane Spiders (in which Cameron Wilson scored twice) in late May, were in contention at the early stage of the season. However, June was a disaster for Abbotsford, as the team suffered several tough losses, being outplayed 3-1 by the Kitsap Pumas, and being slaughtered 6-1 on the road at the Takima Reds. The Mariners ultimately won just four games all season, their final two victories coming via an unexpectedly comprehensive 6-0 revenge victory over Yakima that featured a pair of braces from Gibson Bardsley and substitute Brendan Podolsky, and an astonishing topsy-turvy 5-3 win over Tacoma Tide which saw the team weather a strong fight back after being 4-1 ahead at one stage. The 5-0 final day loss to Portland Timbers U23's summed up the season, and left them in 8th place in the Northwest, 15 points behind divisional champs Kitsap. Cameron Wilson was the Mariners' top scorer, with 8 goals, while Spencer Schmidt contributed 4 assists. ==PlayersCurrent roster=== . ===Notable former players=== This list of notable former players comprises players who went on to play professional soccer after playing for the team in the Premier Development League, or those who previously played professionally before joining the team. * Tyler Baldock * Adam Lang * Diaz Kambere * Stefan Leslie * Nigel Marples * Colin Miller ==Year-by-year== {  !Year !Division !League !Regular Season !Playoffs !Open Canada Cup - 2003 4 USL PDL 4th, Northwest Did not qualify Did not participate - 2004 4 USL PDL 3rd, Northwest Did not qualify Did not participate - 2005 4 USL PDL 4th, Northwest Did not qualify Did not participate - 2006 4 USL PDL bgcolor=\\"B3B7FF\\"1st, Northwest Round of 16 Did not participate - 2007 4 USL PDL 3rd, Northwest Did not qualify Did not participate - 2008 4 USL PDL 6th, Northwest Did not qualify N/A - 2009 4 USL PDL 8th, Northwest Did not qualify N/A - 2010 4 USL PDL 7th, Northwest Did not qualify N/A - 2011 4 USL PDL 5th, Northwest Did not qualify N/A - 20124 USL PDL 8th, NorthwestDid not qualifyN/A - 20135PCSL Reserves1stRunner UpN/A } ==Honors== * USL PDL Northwest Division Champions: 2006 ==Head coaches== * Colin Miller (2004‚Äì2006) * Shaun Lowther (2007‚Äì2008) * Alan Errington (2009) ==Stadia== * Rotary Stadium; Abbotsford, British Columbia (2003) * Bateman Park; Abbotsford, British Columbia (2004‚Äìpresent) * Townsend Park Stadium; Chilliwack, British Columbia (2009) 5 games ==Average attendance== Attendance stats are calculated by averaging each team's self-reported home attendances from the historical match archive at https://web.archive.org/web/20100105175057/http://www.uslsoccer.com/history/index_E.html. * 2005: 218 * 2006: 196 * 2007: 180 * 2008: 160 * 2009: 133 * 2010: 144 * 2011: 116 * 2012: 76 ==References *Official Site *Official PDL site Category:Association football clubs established in 2003 Category:Soccer clubs in British Columbia Category:Sport in Abbotsford, British Columbia Category:USL League Two teams Category:United Soccer League teams based in Canada Category:2003 establishments in British Columbia ","title":"Fraser Valley Mariners"},{"id":"2225696","text":"Nature Reviews Genetics is a monthly review journal in genetics and covers the full breadth of modern genetics.

Their lyrics are in English and for the most part explore the human psyche and the way that everyday events can affect a person psychologically, hence the band's slogan: \\"Seabound: Journey Into Your Mind.\\" ==History== Seabound began in 1995 when Frank Spinath and Martin Vorbrodt were introduced by a mutual friend. They were so different musically that they weren't certain as to whether or not a musical collaboration between them would work. Despite the uncertainty they decided to try an informal jam-oriented home project. They soon realized that with a more focused approach, they might be able to produce something quite special. They made the band official and decided to call themselves Seabound. They decided on the name because of Spinath's love of the ocean and the fact that Vorbrodt was born near the shore. The name also implies a ship leaving from a safe harbor into the unknown and sometimes treacherous seas, a metaphor for the band itself. For live concerts they are supported by Daniel Wehmeier on drums. The band recorded demos, which erroneously have come to now be known by fans as White Nights, a hastily proposed and shortly afterwards discarded working title for their Beyond Flatline album, and eventually caught the attention of dependent. Their debut album No Sleep Demon was released by Dependent in 2001. Drawing influence from the beat-oriented sounds of Front 242 and Covenant, as well as new wave acts such as Visage and Depeche Mode, the album proved to be relatively successful in the European EBM and Darkwave scenes. Tracks such as Travelling and Hooked were well-suited for club play; that exposure made the band known for their warm vocals, icy synth parts, and entrancing, sinuous melodies. They took their time recording the follow-up album Beyond Flatline. It was released in 2004 incorporating more of a trance influence into their sound. The duo embarked on a successful European tour with fellow Futurepop group Pride & Fall; this tour dawned the released a split EP entitled Beyond Flatline Tour 2004. The release featured a remix of the duo's single at that time \\"Watching Over You\\". Later that year the duo's debut album No Sleep Demon was re-released as No Sleep Demon V2.0 presenting new mixes of the songs \\"Hooked\\" and \\"Avalost\\". In 2006 their third album, Double-Crosser, was released, reaching No. 1 on the German Alternative Charts (DAC) and German Electronic Web Charts (GEWC). The album also reached No. 3 Hellenic Alternative Charts (HAC) and No. 6 Nordic Alternative Charts (NAC). In 2009, Seabound released When Black Beats Blue, an album containing rare and unreleased tracks. Seabound are the only band Die Form has remixed, and this album contains a version of Domination remixed by them. After 2009, Seabound took a break since Vorbrodt married and moved to California. The band released their latest album Speak in Storms in February 2014 and scored an entry in the German Media Control Charts (MCC), the German equivalent to the Billboard charts. The album was released in three different editions, from which two edition are 2-disc versions and were limited. The Tempest Edition of Speak In Storms was released in Book form and sold out within 2 months after release. ==Live performances== Seabound has played various tours, mainly in Europe and North America.

Yale and Theresa Yale. Her father was a Navy chaplain which meant that for many years she and her family moved to various locations in the United States and elsewhere before resettling in Evanston during her teen years. She earned a B.A. in English from Knox College. Yale's first published comics work appeared in 1987 in the New America limited series, a spin-off of Timothy Truman's Scout series published by Eclipse Comics. She married fellow comics creator, and frequent collaborator, John Ostrander the same year. Yale and Ostrander developed the character of Barbara Gordon into Oracle, and wrote her origin in the short story \\"Oracle: Year One\\" published in The Batman Chronicles #5 (Summer 1996). The two co-wrote Manhunter, a series which DC launched in the wake of the Millennium crossover. Their collaboration on Suicide Squad included the \\"Janus Directive\\" storyline in issues #27‚Äì30 and the creation of the character Dybbuk in issue #45 (Sept. 1990). Yale served as an editor for DC from 1991‚Äì1993 and oversaw licensed titles such as Advanced Dungeons and Dragons, Dragonlance, Forgotten Realms, Star Trek, and Star Trek: The Next Generation. === Friends of Lulu === Yale was heavily involved with the Friends of Lulu, an organization promoting women in comics that operated from 1994-2011. Yale served as a member of the board and Vice-President of the New York chapter. The Kimberly Yale Award for Best New Talent, an award given by the Friends of Lulu organization, was named in her honor. === Cancer === Yale wrote an ongoing column in the Comics Buyer's Guide, in which she detailed her battle against breast cancer. Following her diagnosis, the cancer spread to her abdomen and pelvis, a process she described in detail to the readers of the column. The cancer made it very difficult for her to write, and the origin story for Oracle included in The Batman Chronicles #5 (1996) was her last project. Yale died of breast cancer in 1997 at the age of 43. ==BibliographyAs writer=== DC Comics * The Batman Chronicles #5 (1996) * Comet #11 (1992) * Deadshot #1‚Äì4 (1988‚Äì1989) * Manhunter #1‚Äì24 (1988‚Äì1990) * Suicide Squad #23‚Äì24, 27‚Äì32, 34, 36‚Äì37, 39‚Äì43, 45‚Äì66 (1989‚Äì1992) Eclipse Comics * New America #1‚Äì4 (1987‚Äì1988) * Real War Stories #2 (1991) First Comics * The Gift: A First Publishing Holiday Special #1 (1990) * Grimjack #44‚Äì45, 48, 53, 58‚Äì59, 61, 64, 66, 70‚Äì81 (\\"Munden's Bar\\" backup stories) (1988‚Äì1991) * Munden's Bar Annual #2 (1991) Marvel Comics * Double Edge: Omega #1 (1995) * Excalibur Annual #2 (1994) WaRP Graphics * ElfQuest: Kahvi #1‚Äì6 (1995‚Äì1996) * ElfQuest: New Blood #9 (1993) ===As editor===  DC Comics  * Advanced Dungeons & Dragons #26‚Äì36 (1991) * Avatar #2‚Äì3 (1991) * Dragonlance #26‚Äì28, 33‚Äì34 (1991) * Forgotten Realms #17‚Äì25 (1991) * The Outlaws #1‚Äì8 (1991) * Peter Cannon, Thunderbolt #6 (1992) * Sgt.

Khodzhayev Fayzulla Ubaydullayevich Khodzhayev (, –§–∞–π–∑—É–ª–ª–∞ –£–±–∞–π–¥—É–ª–ª–æ–µ–≤–∏—á –•—û–∂–∞–µ–≤; ; b. 1896 Bukhara - March 1938, Moscow) was a Bukharan politician that served as the first head of the Bukharan People's Soviet Republic, which would later form part of the Uzbek Soviet Socialist Republic. He was later executed as part of the Great Purge during the Stalin period. ==Early years== Khodzhayev was born into an Uzbek family of wealthy traders in the City of Bukhara, Emirate of Bukhara in 1896. He was sent to Moscow by his father in 1907. There he realized the tremendous gap between contemporary European society and technology, and the ancient, tradition-bound ways of his homeland. He joined the Pan-Turkist Jadid movement of like-minded reformers in 1916, and, with his father's fortune, established the Young Bukharan Party. Seeing the Russian Revolution of 1917 as an opportunity, the Young Bukharan Party invited the Bolsheviks of the Tashkent Soviet to seize Emirate of Bukhara by force in 1917. When this attempted invasion failed, Khodzhayev fled to Tashkent, and was only able to return after the Emir of Bukhara fled in September 1920 after the Red Army had overthrown his administration on 2 September 1920, bombed the city of Bukhara and occupied it. ==The government years== After joining the Russian Communist Party about July‚ÄìAugust 1920, Fayzullo Khodzhayev was appointed head of the Bukharan People's Soviet Republic in September 1920. During his term, he barely escaped assassination by Basmachi Revolt leader Enver Pasha. With the reorganization of Soviet Central Asia into the new Uzbek Soviet Socialist Republic and after the purge of suspected Uzbek nationalists in 1923‚Äì1924, on 5 December 1924, Khodzhayev became Chair of the Revolutionary Committee of the Uzbek SSR ‚Äì at which time he was recognized as the head of government ‚Äì and then on 17 February 1925, he became Chair of the Council of People's Commissars of the Uzbek Soviet Socialist Republic. Then on 21 May 1925, he became one of the chairmen of the USSR Central Executive Committee once the Uzbek SSR was officially accepted into the USSR. However, Khodzhayev opposed Joseph Stalin's heavy-handed control, particularly in the matter of cotton monoculture. ==The final years== When the wave of political purges reached into the Uzbek SSR, the 7th Congress of the Uzbek Communist Party of Bolsheviks proclaimed Khodzhayev to be an enemy of the people. On 17 June 1937, he was dismissed from all offices ‚Äì including Chair of the Council of People's Commissars ‚Äì and was arrested by 9 July 1937, during the Great Purge on charges to which he confessed at the Trial of the Twenty-One in March 1938 in Moscow as a \\"Trotskyite and a Rightist\\" and he was executed on 13 March 1938.‚ÄúLined With Despair‚Äù, TIME Magazine, March 14, 1938 ==Legacy== Officially rehabilitated in 1966, he remains a controversial figure in modern Uzbekistan. There are few monuments to him in modern Uzbekistan, and although his father's house in Bukhara is preserved as a monument, it is styled as \\"House of a Wealthy Local Merchant\\", with very little emphasis on Khodzhayev himself. ==References== *World Statesmen ‚Äì Uzbekistan *Archontology ‚Äì Fayzulla Khodzhayev Category:1896 births Category:1938 deaths Category:Jadids Category:People from Bukhara Category:20th-century Uzbekistani people Category:Case of the Anti-Soviet \\"Bloc of Rightists and Trotskyites\\" Category:Communist Party of Uzbekistan politicians Category:Uzbekistani communists Category:Communist rulers Category:Communism in Uzbekistan Category:Great Purge victims from Uzbekistan Category:Soviet rehabilitations Category:Soviet show trials Category:Pan- Turkists Category:Bukharan People's Soviet Republic Category:Uzbek revolutionaries Category:Recipients of the Order of Lenin Category:Recipients of the Order of the Red Banner ","title":"Fayzulla Khodzhayev"},{"id":"2225712","text":"Cycloleucine is a non-proteinogenic amino acid.

The Whole Book of Psalmes Thomas Sternhold (1500‚Äì1549) was an English courtier and the principal author of the first English metrical version of the Psalms, originally attached to the Prayer-Book as augmented by John Hopkins. ==Life== Anthony Wood says that Sternhold entered Christ Church, Oxford, but did not take a degree. The first definite date in his life is 1538, when the name of Thomas Sternhold appears in Thomas Cromwell's accounts. He became one of the grooms of the robes to Henry VIII, and was a favourite, to whom a legacy of a hundred marks was bequeathed him by the king's will. He may have been the Thomas Sternell or Sternoll who was elected for Plymouth to the parliament that met on 30 January 1545, and was dissolved by Henry VIII's death in January 1547. Sternhold was born in Blakeney, Gloucestershire and died on 23 August 1549. His will, dated August 1549, was proved on 12 September following. Among the witnesses to his will was Edward Whitchurch, probably his publisher. His property consisted of land in Hampshire and at Bodmin in Cornwall. Part of the Hampshire property might have been inherited. Slackstead, however, had been purchased recently, as it had been granted, as part of the possessions of Hyde Abbey, to Sir Ralph Sadler in 1547. The Bodmin property also he had purchased from the crown in 1543, as part of the possessions of the dissolved priory of St. Petrock there. ==Psalm translations== His earliest metrical versions of the Psalms may have been composed in Henry's reign; Miles Coverdale had published his 'Goostly Psalmes,' a translation of Luther's psalm versions, as early as 1535. In 1540 the earliest Psalms by Marot, valet de chambre to Francis I, were known at the French court, and soon afterwards passed into Protestant worship at Geneva. Sternhold, Marot, and Coverdale all wished to substitute the Psalms of David for the ballads of the court and people. Sternhold (with the exception of Psalm cxx) used only one metre, and this the simplest of all ballad measures, the metre of Chevy Chace. This choice of metre became the predominant metre (common metre) not only of the old and new versions of England and Scotland, but of other metrical psalters and English hymns in general. Sternhold is said to have sung his psalms to his organ for his own solace. (Strype). The only edition which Sternhold lived to publish he dedicated to the young king Edward VI. In this dedication he expresses a hope of ‚Äòtravayling further,‚Äô and ‚Äòperforming the residue‚Äô of the Psalter; but his total contribution to the old version consists of only forty psalms. Sternhold is remembered as the originator of the first metrical version of the Psalms which obtained general currency alike in England and Scotland. The Versification of Certain Chapters of the Proverbs of Solomon has been attributed to him in error. Sternhold and Hopkins's version has had a larger circulation than any work in the language, except the authorised version of the Bible and the Book of Common Prayer. Sternhold's work forms its base. His first edition undated, but, as being dedicated to Edward VI, not earlier than 1547, contains nineteen psalms (i‚Äìv, xx, xxv, xxviii, xxix, xxxii, xxxiv, xli, xlix, lxxiii, lxxviii, ciii, cxx, cxxiii, cxxviii). It was printed by Edward Whitchurch, and is entitled ‚ÄòCertayne Psalmes chosƒì out of the Psalter of Dauid and drawƒì into Englishƒì Metre by Thomas Sternhold, grome of ye Kynges Maiesties Roobes‚Äô (Brit. Museum). The second edition, printed after his death‚Äîapparently by John Hopkins, who adds seven psalms of his own in order to fill in a blank space‚Äîadded to those of the former edition eighteen new psalms (vi‚Äìxvii, xix, xxi, xliii, xliv, lxiii, lxviii). It is entitled ‚ÄòAl such Psalmes of Dauid as Thomas Sternhold, late grome of the Kinges maiesties robes, did in his lyfetime drawe into English Metre,‚Äô and is printed by Edward Whitchurche in 1549 (Cambridge University Library). Three more psalms (xviii, xxii, xxiii) are added to these in a rare edition of the growing Psalter printed by John Daye in 1561, and the complete number (40) appears in the full editions of 1562, 1563, and all subsequent ones. The only one of his psalms which remains current is the simple rendering of Psalm xxiii (‚ÄòMy Shepherd is the Living Lord‚Äô). The text of his psalms, as found in all editions after 1556, follows the Genevan revision of that year. The Sternhold-Hopkins psalter continued in general use till Nahum Tate and Nicholas Brady's New Version of the Psalms of David of 1696 was substituted in 1717. ==See also== *Metrical psalter ==References== ;Attribution * ==External links== * (text only) * (scanned, text only) Category:English religious writers Category:1500 births Category:1549 deaths Category:Members of the Parliament of England for Plymouth Category:16th-century English writers Category:16th-century male writers Category:People from Forest of Dean District Category:English MPs 1545‚Äì1547 ","title":"Thomas Sternhold"},{"id":"2225744","text":"is a fictional monster, or kaiju, which first appeared in Ishir≈ç Honda's 1963 film Atragon, produced and distributed by Toho. Manda is based on a Japanese dragon, and is depicted as a giant sea-dwelling serpent which can survive on land. Manda's roars were created through recordings of lions bellowing. ==Overview== Manda is a Giant Sea Dragon about 150 meters (492.126 feet) long and weighs 30,000 metric tons (33069.339 short tons) in the Sh≈çwa period, and 300 meters (984.252 feet) long & weighs 60,000 metric tons (66138.679 short tons) in Godzilla: Final Wars. ===Sh≈çwa period=== In Atragon, Manda is a sea- dwelling dragon that is the guardian of Mu, an underwater kingdom. Manda is one of the primary antagonists along with the Empress. When the submarine warship Gotengo attacks, Manda attacks and wraps its body around the ship, trying to crush it. But the Gotengo discharges electricity on Manda and shocks it. Manda unwraps itself and tries to swim away, but the Gotengo pursues it, later firing its Absolute Zero Cannon to freeze Manda. Manda reappears again on Monsterland (along with several other monsters including Godzilla, Rodan, and Anguirus) in Destroy All Monsters. Aliens called Kilaaks come to Earth and take control of Manda and the other monsters, making them attack cities worldwide (Manda is used to attack London) until the humans manage to free the monsters from the alien mind control. After this, the monsters are sent to fight King Ghidorah, although Manda does not fight in the battle, merely watching from the sidelines with Varan and Baragon. After Ghidorah is killed, Manda and the other monsters return to Monsterland. The Manda prop used in Destroy All Monsters had no horns or whiskers on its face and the long fuzz running down its back was gone. ===Millennium period=== In the Millennium series, Manda is the first monster to be killed in Godzilla: Final Wars, playing a minor role, once again as an adversary of the Gotengo. The Gotengo attacks Manda which is wrapped around its hull. The super-submarine manages to shake it off and sails into an underwater volcano to see if it can lure Manda inside. The plan works, but Manda is merely injured and continues to pursue the Gotengo. The submarine then whips around and fires its Zero Cannon which hits Manda, causing it to freeze instantly, after which Gotengo uses its drill to easily pierce the frozen Manda, causing the monster to shatter and die. In this movie, Manda, along with Zilla and Kamacuras while flying, is computer generated. ===Reiwa period=== In the prequel novel: Godzilla: Monster Apocalypse, Manda inhabited the North Atlantic Sea and reclaimed the Dover Strait as its territory and it and sunk ships. Later the Gotengo engaged during \\"Operation: Eternal Light\\" and kill Manda. However, Manda or another Manda appeared in \\"Project: Mechagodzilla, it appeared in the Gulf of Persia during \\"Operation: Great Wall\\". ==AppearancesFilms=== * Atragon (1963) * Destroy All Monsters (1968) * All Monsters Attack (1969, stock footage cameo) * Terror of Mechagodzilla (1975, stock footage cameo) * Godzilla: Final Wars (2004) ===Video games=== * Kaij≈´-≈ç Godzilla / King of the Monsters, Godzilla (Game Boy - 1993) * Godzilla: Monster War / Godzilla: Destroy All Monsters (Super Famicom - 1994) * Godzilla Trading Battle (PlayStation - 1998) * Godzilla Defense Force (2019) ===Literature=== * Godzilla at World's End (novel - 1998) * Godzilla: Rulers of Earth (comic - 2013-2015) * Godzilla: Cataclysm (comic - 2014) * Godzilla: Monster Apocalypse (novel - 2017) ===Cultural references=== * Manda is used as the name for a giant snake, and boss of the Snake Summons, in the Naruto manga series. * The Manda suit is used in Ultra Q Episode 6 as a flame breathing dragon. ==References== Category:Toho Monsters Category:Fictional dragons Category:Fictional reptiles Category:Fictional snakes Category:Godzilla characters Category:Fictional characters who can move at superhuman speeds Category:Fictional characters with superhuman strength Category:Mothra characters Category:Science fiction film characters Category:Fantasy film characters Category:Film characters introduced in 1963 Category:Kaiju Category:Horror film villains ","title":"Manda (kaiju)"},{"id":"2225745","text":"Join Java is a programming language based on the join-pattern that extends the standard Java programming language with the join semantics of the join- calculus. It was written at the University of South Australia within the Reconfigurable Computing Lab by Dr. Von Itzstein. == Language characteristics == The Join Java extension introduces three new language constructs: * Join methods * Asynchronous methods * Order class modifiers for determining the order that patterns are matched Concurrency in most popular programming languages is implemented using constructs such as semaphores and monitors. Libraries are emerging (such as the Java concurrency library JSR-166) that provide higher-level concurrency semantics. Communicating Sequential Processes (CSP), Calculus of Communicating Systems (CCS) and Pi have higher-level synchronization behaviours defined implicitly through the composition of events at the interfaces of concurrent processes. Join calculus, in contrast, has explicit synchronization based on a localized conjunction of events defined as reduction rules. Join semantics try to provide explicit expressions of synchronization without breaching the object-oriented idea of modularization, including dynamic creation and destruction of processes and channels. The Join Java language can express virtually all published concurrency patterns without explicit recourse to low-level monitor calls. In general, Join Java programs are more concise than their Java equivalents. The overhead introduced in Join Java by the higher-level expressions derived from the Join calculus is manageable. The synchronization expressions associated with monitors (wait and notify) which are normally located in the body of methods can be replaced by Join Java expressions (the Join methods) which form part of the method signature. === Join methods === A Join method is defined by two or more Join fragments. A Join method will execute once all the fragments of the Join pattern have been called. If the return type is a standard Java type then the leading fragment will block the caller until the Join pattern is complete and the method has executed. If the return type is of type **signal** then the leading fragment will return immediately. All trailing fragments are asynchronous so will not block the caller. Example: class JoinExample { int fragment1() & fragment2(int x) { //will return value of x //to caller of fragment1 return x; } } === Ordering modifiers === Join fragments can be repeated in multiple Join patterns so there can be a case when multiple Join patterns are completed when a fragment is called. Such a case could occur in the example below if B(), C() and D() then A() are called. The final A() fragment completes three of the patterns so there are three possible methods that may be called. The **ordered** class modifier is used here to determine which Join method will be called. The default and when using the **unordered** class modifier is to pick one of the methods at random. With the **ordered** modifier the methods are prioritised according to the order they are declared. Example: class ordered SimpleJoinPattern { void A() & B()  void A() & C()  void A() & D()  signal D() & E()  } === Asynchronous methods === Asynchronous methods are defined by using the **signal** return type. This has the same characteristics as the **void** type except that the method will return immediately. When an asynchronous method is called a new thread is created to execute the body of the method. Example: class ThreadExample { signal thread(SomeObject x) { //this code will execute in a new thread } } == Related languages == Polyphonic C sharp is the closest related language. Cœâ the successor of Polyphonic C sharp. Hardware Join Java language further extended Join Java to implement Hardware semantics. This language extended the semantics of Join Java to FPGA applications. == References == * von Itzstein, G, Stewart. and Jasiunas, M (2003). On Implementing High Level Concurrency in Java.

Produced by Media Factory, GDH, IMAGICA Imageworks, Hakuhodo, Amber Film Works, and Fuji Television, the series was broadcast across Japan by the anime satellite television network Animax, and the terrestrial Fuji TV network. It has been licensed for North American distribution by Geneon Entertainment, and also aired on Anime Unleashed in 2005. With FUNimation's \\"New Show A Go-Go\\", they have acquired the distribution rights of the anime, and it was available in early 2009. ==Story== Several hundred years in the future, the natural resources of the Earth are exhausted, and the progression of the human race has stagnated. Hajiki Sanada, a delivery boy, lives with mother and sister in Unit Blue, in the impoverished part of the Unit known as 'Night Town'. While delivering a package, he unwittingly stumbles upon a 'Gad', a mysterious device that reacts to the strong feelings of a nearby person. The Gad transforms, taking on the form of a humanoid robot referred to as a 'Techode'. Hajiki soon discovers he isn't the only one who has had contact with a Gad, and that contact with one doesn't always end well. The series follows his struggles to cope with his new friends, his techode, and his life in Night Town. ==SettingUnit Blue=== The central Unit in which Gad Guard takes place is Unit Blue, which is separated into three levels: Gold Town, Day Town and Night Town. Gold Town is the upper-class area, where the wealthy and well-off live in comfort and luxury, and plays host to Global Electronics, the foremost provider of electricity in Unit Blue, a commodity not everyone can afford to have all the time. The characters Takumi Kisaragi and Aiko Mary Harmony live in Gold Town. Day Town is a middle-class area, equipped with running water and electricity and is busy and metropolitan in most places. The character Arashi Shinozuka is originally from this area where her father owns a karate dojo. While not as perfect as Gold Town, Day Town is seen by people on the other side of the tracks as the place where they'd rather be. Night Town is the ghetto of Unit Blue, and is called \\"Night Town\\" because all the electrical power shuts off at midnight and does not come back until dawn. In Night Town gangs and punks run the streets, and all the local kids go to school at a church, taught by a nun and a young teacher, in hopes of giving them what they need to escape their meagre living. Leaving something outside at night is guaranteed to have it stolen, and even walking around in broad daylight can be dangerous. Night Town is the dank and grimy setting for most of Gad Guard, where Hajiki and his family live along with Katana, the Jacque Bruno Gang and a host of other characters. ==Gads== Known in the Gad Guard world only as \\"powerful stones\\", everyone who knows of them desires Gads and believes that they can fulfill people's dreams. Though the real importance of a Gad is unknown, they are used as very high sums of currency and are usually only owned by the rich or powerful. A Gad has many peculiar abilities and can take shape into a number of things depending on the personality and thoughts of the owner. These creations are separated into three groups: Techodes, A-Techodes and Gadrians. It is unknown what initially triggers a Gad's transformation, while strong feelings are involved, other times there is no reaction at all. Upon a Gad's transformation into something, all metal and most other material around it are violently absorbed and used as a base for the final product. ===Techodes=== A Techode is one of the three things that sprout from a Gad, and is also called a \\"Gadrian\\" occasionally by characters who aren't aware of the difference between the two. It usually takes the form of a large, humanoid robot roughly tall fueled by the emotional bond between the robot and the owner. These robots are \\"born\\" after contact with the Gad's owner while they're having a strong or serious emotion in an area occupied by a lot of metal. Once it has transformed into a Techode, a Gad is considered 'lost' and 'useless'. Only a Techode's 'owner' is capable of controlling it, so it is nearly impossible to sell or trade Techodes. It is implied that those with pure or good intent end up with Techodes, while those with darker, more twisted feelings getting a hold of a Gad leads to the creation of A-Techodes or Gadrians. The five main Techodes of the series; Lightning, Zero, Thunderbolt, Messerschmitt and Hayate are all named after World War II-era fighter planes. ===A-Techodes=== An A-Techode is a manifestation of one's darker feelings. Most Gads take the form of A-Techodes, Techodes being very rare. They generally take the shapes of chaotic-looking monsters and are formed in the same way Techodes are, by absorbing the materials around them. Unlike Techodes, A-Techodes are independent creations. An A-Techode's creation can also be the result of a Gad falling into the hands of someone without any kind of strong, impacting emotions or intentions, such as a young child; the result is a sentient manifestation of whatever the child was thinking about at the time. ===Gadrians=== A Gadrian is what is formed when feelings of hate or greed completely consume the owner of a Gad, and likewise, the Gad itself. The Gad then absorbs these thoughts of greed and anger, usually killing the owner of the Gad and creating a monster, organic in nature with technological modification. Unlike Techodes, Gadrians are made of both inorganic and organic matter. Gadrians can be considered a sub-class of A-Techodes. ==Music== Opening theme: * \\"Boomerang Boogie ~Nanpudou no Ojisan~\\" by PE'Z Ending theme: * \\"Song for My Buffalo\\" by PE'Z ==ReferencesFUNimation Entertainment Official Site * Madman Entertainment's official Gad Guard website Category:2003 anime television series Category:2003 Japanese novels Category:ADV Films Category:Adventure anime and manga Category:Funimation Category:Geneon USA Category:Gonzo (company) Category:Light novels Category:Mecha anime and manga Category:MF Bunko J Category:Anime with original screenplays Category:Animax original programming Category:Fuji TV original programming ","title":"Gad Guard"},{"id":"2225754","text":"\\"Jet Boy, Jet Girl\\" is a song by Elton Motello about a 15-year-old boy's sexual relationship with an older man, who then rejects him for a girl. ==Composition== \\"Jet Boy, Jet Girl\\" has the same backing track as Plastic Bertrand/Lou Deprijck's \\"√áa plane pour moi\\".

She was previously a Progressive Democrats Teachta D√°la (TD) for the Longford‚ÄìRoscommon constituency from 2002 to 2007. ==Background== She is a native of the townland of Glack, near Longford town. ==Political career== Mae Sexton first became active in elected politics in 1991, when she stood as an independent candidate for Longford Town Council and Longford County Council and was elected to both bodies, receiving the largest number of votes in each case. She stood at the 1992 general election in Longford‚ÄìRoscommon as an independent candidate, but obtained only 1,160 first preference votes (2.6%), and was eliminated, failing to be elected. Prior to the 1997 general election, she joined the Progressive Democrats, and stood in the Longford‚ÄìRoscommon constituency for the party, obtaining 2,289 first preference votes (4.8%), and being eliminated on the second count. She was re-elected to both Longford Urban District and County Councils in the 1999 local elections, although her first preference vote for both bodies had declined. She stood again at the 2002 general election. Her first preference vote increased to 4,679 (9.4%), and she was elected to D√°il √âireann, finishing 54 votes ahead of a Fianna F√°il candidate for the final seat, having edged out the sitting Fine Gael TD, Louis Belton, by just over 200 votes at an earlier stage in the count. Her election in 2002, in a predominantly rural midland constituency for a party often associated with the urban middle classes was one of the major surprises of that election, and came after a series of near misses from elimination during the progress of the election count. ===In D√°il √âireann=== Sexton maintained an active profile within County Longford during her time as a D√°il deputy and built a minor profile nationally as a panellist on political discussion programmes on radio and television. In June 2005, she attracted attention by calling for the Irish government to abandon plans for a referendum on the European Constitution after the defeats of the referendums in France and the Netherlands. ===2007 general election=== Her political future was affected by changes in constituency boundaries which came into force at the 2007 general election. County Longford was included in a new Longford‚ÄìWestmeath constituency. At the local elections in 2004, in which Sexton was not allowed to stand because of legislation forbidding TDs and Senators to serve on local councils, her personal vote largely failed to transfer to her local party colleagues, with her former County Council seat being lost and only the Longford Town Council seat being held by the party. At the 2007 general election she lost her seat, polling only 2,298 first preference votes (4.2%) in the new constituency and being eliminated on the third count. Unofficial tally figures published in local newspapers showed that her vote had halved in her County Longford base, while she received negligible support in County Westmeath. After the poor performance of the PDs in the election, she said in an interview with local radio that she was still committed to the party. ===2009 local elections=== With the dissolution of the Progressive Democrats in 2009, Sexton stood as an independent candidate at the 2009 local elections in Longford. She regained her seats on both the Longford County and Town Councils. ===Labour Party (2010‚Äì2012)=== In April 2010, the Labour Party announced that Sexton had accepted an invitation to join the party. Sexton ran in the 2011 general election in Longford‚ÄìWestmeath alongside sitting Labour TD Willie Penrose. She was unsuccessful garnering 3,960 votes or 6.8% of the poll. She left the Labour Party in December 2012, citing concerns over the budget. ===2014‚Äì2019=== She was re-elected to Longford County Council at the 2014 local elections. She was an unsuccessful independent candidate at the 2016 general election for the Longford‚ÄìWestmeath constituency. She lost her seat on Longford County Council at the 2019 local elections. ==References== Category:1955 births Category:Living people Category:Progressive Democrats TDs Category:Labour Party (Ireland) politicians Category:Independent politicians in Ireland Category:Members of the 29th D√°il Category:21st-century women Teachta√≠ D√°la Category:Local councillors in County Longford ","title":"Mae Sexton"},{"id":"2225768","text":"Bell on Tohamsan Toham Mountain or Toham-san is a mountain with a height of in Gyeongju City in southeastern South Korea.
