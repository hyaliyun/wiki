In the case of honey simple syrup, a 1:1 ratio is used. This is similar to the process for making simple syrup with sugar, and the honey syrup can be used in place of simple syrup in many cocktails, such as the Bee's Knees. It can also be used in mojitos, iced tea, lemonade, and other cold drinks. Different types of honey can have different flavor profiles depending, e.g., on whether the bees consumed raspberry, blackberry, buckwheat, or clover flowers; raspberry- or blackberry-flavored honeys can be used when a mellow flavor is preferred. The reason for making syrup with the honey is that otherwise it might be too thick to mix well with other ingredients, especially in an ice-filled cocktail shaker (as opposed to, say, a hot tea). An advantage of honey over sugar, for making cocktails, is that it can impart floral notes and also pair well with spirits, citrus, and other cocktail ingredients. The Gold Rush is an example of a cocktail that uses honey syrup. Other ingredients can be added to honey syrup as well, such as lemon juice and lemon zest, e.g. for honey syrup that is to be poured over gingerbread. For mojitos, mint leaves may be added; for a rosemary gimlet, rosemary sprigs; for lavender lemonade, culinary lavender; etc. ==See also== * List of syrups ==References== Category:Honey Category:Syrup ","title":"Honey syrup"},{"id":"61319718","text":"The Maryborough meteorite is a meteorite that was found in the Maryborough Regional Park near the town of Maryborough in Victoria, Australia. At , the Maryborough meteorite is the second largest ever to be found in the state. It has a sculpted and dimpled outer surface due to the melting it experienced while plunging through Earth’s atmosphere, and its interior, consisting of dense forms of iron and nickel, is speckled with chondrules. It was discovered in May 2015 by Australian prospector, David Hole, while searching for gold using a metal detector. He was initially impressed by the density and extreme weight of the reddish rock, which was only identified as a meteorite in 2018. After a sliver was sliced off with a diamond saw, staff of the Melbourne Museum could confirm its identity. It was revealed to be an H chondrite, some 4.6 billion years old, which based on carbon-14 dating results, fell to earth between 100 and 1,000 years ago. There have been a number of historic meteor sightings in the Maryborough district, but none of them can be definitively tied to the find site. In one such sighting of June 1923, Harry E.

The site was designated a National Historic Site of Japan in 1980. ==Overview== Following the Taika reforms of 645 AD and the establishment of the Ritsuryō system, Japan was administratively divided into provinces which were further subdivided into districts, each with an administrative center and tax warehouses designed per a common template. The Shida County Administrative Complex site was discovered during construction work on a housing development in 1977 and was excavated starting in 1980. The foundations of 30 buildings, with a well, gates, and roads were uncovered. The site was compactly arranged on narrow alluvial land measuring 80 meters east- west and 60 meters north-south. The complex was destroyed in rebuilt several times through the Heian period. Artifacts included roof tiles and numerous items, such as pottery, wooden tags, and tableware with the word \\"Shida\\" written in black ink. Together with the layout of the ruins, it was determined that this was the government center for Shida County from the early 8th to late 9th century.

It is housed in a group of shops and commercial premises \\"unified by a classical parapet with classical cappings and balusters\\" constructed by the Windsor family in 1908. == Motor Museum== The museum was a proposal of James Harwood, who suggested Peter Briggs buy a building for his motor vehicle collection. Harwood and Briggs had been collecting vehicles since the 1960s. For Briggs, that involvement came through local motor sports. In the late 1960s he won the MG Car Club Annual Championship three times and established himself as a broker of vintage vehicles and aeroplanes. The museum opened on 8 December 1979 with 1,100 square metres of floor space. In 1984, the Museum won the Sir David Brand Award for tourism. For more than 15 years, the curator of the museum was Peter Harbin, who had a history of motor racing. The museum offers three main galleries of cars, motor bikes and bicycles, two general areas and one specialising in the history of motor sport. The museum has 60 cars and 16 motor cycles and other vehicles as well as motor memorabilia. A number of vehicles are on loan from the Western Australian Museum and other collectors but most vehicles are still part of Briggs' collection. The York Motor Museum is staffed by volunteers and is open every day from 9 am to 4 pm. There is a small admission fee. The museum started the York Festival of Motoring, which is now the York Motor Show. Although the museum remains very involved in it, the Show is now run by the York Branch of the Veteran Car Club of WA, and draws thousands of car enthusiasts. Since 2017 the museum has been owned by the non-profit Avon Valley Motor Museum Association and is a community venture. == Cars == Cars in the Museum include: *Australian Six 1919 *Bédélia 1910 *Benz 1901 *BSA cars 1910 *BMW Isetta 1956 *Cadillac 1906 *Cadillac Eldorado 1958 *Clément 1901 *Falcon XK 1962 *Ford Model T 1910 *Ford Prefect Ute 1951 *Holden FE 1957 *Holden FX 1951 *Holden Torana 1972 *Holsman 1906 *Hupmobile 1910 *Leyland P76 1974 *Maybach 1955 *Morris 1100 1968 *Morris Cowley 1926 *Morris Minor 1948 *Morris Oxford 1954 *Offenhauser 1954 *Oldsmobile 1903 *Packard 1927 *Peugeot Bébé 1913 *Porsche 356 *Rover 1904 *Studebaker 1926 *Subaru 1961 *Toyota Corolla 1978 *Toyota Corona 1967, 1977 *Toyota Prius pre December 1997 *Toyota S800 *Wolsley police car 1948 *Vauxhall Viva 1964 *Volvo 244 1976 *VW Beetle 1945 == History of the property == From the late 1830s to 1859, the property was part of the Government Farm surrounding various government buildings such as the court house and survey office.Perth Gazette and Independent Journal of Politics and News 30 November 1855, p.3. As York Town Lot 101, the property was granted by the government to builder, wheelwright and furniture maker George Wansbrough on 12 May 1859 for £10; he constructed a cottage on the site which also had an oven, indicating the original use for the building was as a bakery.Landgate Crown Grant ET 1655. The substantial increase in price on the sale to Joseph Hardey indicates that buildings had been constructed on the site before sale. Also refer to R Erikson: Dictionary of Western Australians re Henry Thielemann and the next reference. The first known baker at this location was Henry Beard in 1863.

He was 55 years old when he started the business. ==Business== Dashnau sold human skulls for $100 each in the 1970s, which he claimed to be from a medical supply firm that wanted to be nameless. The business was based out of his post office box under the trade name The Skull Man. He started the business because he wanted to become rich, a dream that he had had for many years, and he credited that being a science fiction fan may have helped him think of the idea. Dashnau said that he tried to think of the skulls as old bones and not as people. He did not sell the skulls for medical purposes, but rather as novelty items. Roger Simmons, of the Chicago Sun- Times, asked Dashnau why he would not reveal where the skulls were from. Dashnau said that he would not reveal where they came from because he did not want imitators using the same supplies. ==Human skulls== Each skull was treated to prevent decalcification. The cranium was made so that people could view the lower brain cavity and the lower jaw was fastened with springs which allowed someone to open and close the mouth. Dashnau had no idea how old the skulls were or where they came from, but that people bought them as pieces for conversation. Two of Dashnau's hopes were that business executives would buy a skull as an unusual desk ornament and to be able to expand his offered merchandise, including full human skeletons for $500 each. ==Death== Dashnau died on February 9, 2001, due to a stroke in Willingboro Township, New Jersey. He was buried at Monument Cemetery in Beverly, New Jersey, on February 14, 2001. ==Bibliography== In 1979 and again in a 1981 edition, Dashnau had an entry in the book Famous Americans You Never Knew Existed.

The character is depicted as a friend of Mike Wheeler, Lucas Sinclair and Will Byers. When Will goes missing, Dustin, Mike and Lucas go looking for their missing friend and come across Eleven, who helps search for Will using her telekinetic abilities. In the second season of the show, Dustin forms a strong friendship with Steve Harrington, a relationship that received positive acclaim from fans and critics. Dustin is also depicted as having cleidocranial dysplasia, a condition written into the character after Matarazzo's casting. ==Fictional character biographySeason 1=== On the night of November 6, 1983. Dustin was playing Dungeons and Dragons with his friends Mike Wheeler, Lucas Sinclair and Will Byers. Later that night, Will went missing. Will's disappearance prompted Dustin, Mike, and Lucas to go searching the woods for him, which led them to come across Eleven instead. They discover Eleven has psychokinetic abilities, which allow them to find out that Will is trapped in an alternate dimension known as The Upside Down. Though initially skeptical of Eleven's capabilities, he grows to admire her and defends her from Lucas's skepticism, but still teases Mike's fondness of her. Dustin, Mike, Lucas and Eleven witness Will's body being recovered from the lake, but then discover a transmission of Will singing in the Upside Down. The boys disguise Eleven to bring her to the Heathkit at Hawkins Middle School to be able to track Will. After discovering the possibility of the Upside Down is real, they follow their compasses \\"north\\" after a suggestion from Dustin in hopes of finding The Gate. They then discover that Eleven had been using her abilities to tamper with the compasses and lead them away from The Gate and imminent danger. This causes a disagreement between Lucas and Mike which ends with Eleven throwing Lucas away from Mike with her mind, causing Lucas to angrily storm off and Eleven to run away. While searching for Eleven, Dustin and Mike come across school bullies Troy and James who threaten to cut out Dustin's teeth if Mike does not jump off a cliff. This is settled when Eleven arrives and saves Mike in mid-air and breaks Troy's arm. Dustin and Mike console Eleven and reconcile. The boys and Eleven head back to Mike's house, but are warned by Lucas via radio that the agents at Hawkins Lab are on their way to re-obtain Eleven. The group hides out at an abandoned junkyard until they are rescued by Chief Jim Hopper. After returning to the Byers household and meeting up with Mike's sister Nancy and Will's brother Jonathan, Dustin realizes that for Eleven to be able to locate Will in the Upside Down, they would need to build a makeshift Sensory Deprivation Tank. They sneak into Hawkins Middle School to use the facilities and learn that Will is alive, but barely hanging on. As Joyce Byers and Chief Hopper sneak off to infiltrate Hawkins Lab, the rest of the group remains stationary at Hawkins Middle School. After a deal made by Hopper with Dr. Martin Brenner to be able to save Will, the group's location is given up to the agents of Hawkins Lab and they infiltrate the school. Eleven kills most of the guards but the scent of blood attracts the Demogorgon. Eleven used the last of her powers to kill the Demogorgon, but in the process ended up trapping herself in The Upside Down. Will is saved and the boys celebrate during Christmas by continuing their original game of Dungeons and Dragons. ===Season 2=== After a successful night of Trick or Treating on Halloween night, Dustin arrives home to discover that his trash can is moving and making unusual noises. After looking inside the trash can, Dustin discovers a reptilian like creature and hides it in his costume Proton Pack. He places the creature in his turtle tank and names it D'Artagnan, or simply \\"Dart\\". The next day Dustin brings D'Artagnan to school to show it to Mike, Lucas, Will, and new addition to the party, Maxine \\"Max\\" Mayfield. Dustin concludes that he has discovered a new species, but Will recognizes the creature from the Upside Down. After Mike attempted to attack Dart, Dart runs off throughout the school. Dustin eventually finds Dart and hides him under his signature cap and lies to his friends, saying he has not seen it. After returning home from school the next day, Dustin discovers that his new pet is actually a Demogorgon and has killed his family cat Mews. Dustin lures Dart out of his house and into the storm cellar. When he radios his friends for help, he is unable to reach them and leaves Dart in the cellar while he physically searches for them. After he fails to find either Mike or Nancy, Dustin runs across Nancy's boyfriend Steve Harrington and enlists his help. Once they arrive at Dustin's cellar, they find that Dart has grown yet again and broken free from captivity. Steve and Dustin lay bait for D'Artagnan on the train-tracks that lead to the abandoned junkyard. On the way, they bond while discussing how to talk to girls, and it is revealed that Dustin kept Dart in hopes of impressing Max. Steve and Dustin arrive at the junkyard and meet up with Lucas and Max, who assist in fortifying the abandoned school bus and laying a trap for Dart. Steve helps protect the group from the \\"Demodogs\\" until they are called away to Hawkins Lab. The group then heads to Hawkins Lab and regroup with Mike, Will, Nancy, Jonathan, Hopper and Joyce, and retreat back to the Byers household. The group attempts to question Will for a weakness by hiding him somewhere the \\"Mind Flayer\\" cannot track him. Will manages to subconsciously communicate to the group in Morse Code, deciphering his message to say \\"Close Gate\\". However, the Byers' house phone rings and gives away their location to the Mind Flayer. The house becomes swarmed with Demodogs, but Eleven returns to the household and saves the group. The group then splits into groups to help defeat the Mind Flayer with one group going to exorcise the Mind Flayer from Will, and with Eleven and Hopper heading back to Hawkins Lab to close the gate to the Upside Down, leaving Dustin, Steve, Mike, Lucas and Max back at the Byers residence. They come up with a plan to distract the Demodogs by setting fire to some of the tunnels in the Upside Down to allow Hopper and Eleven to safely reach the gate. Before they can put their plan into action, Max's step-brother Billy Hargrove arrives at the house looking for his step-sister. Steve attempts to protect the kids and fights Billy, however Steve is badly beaten. Max sedates her step-brother with a syringe, then steals his car and drives her friends to the tunnels. The group arrives at the hub in the tunnels and sets it ablaze. They soon encounter Dart, who recognizes Dustin and does not attack him, allowing the group to pass as Dart and Dustin say a final goodbye. After the campaign, Steve drops Dustin off at his school's \\"Snow Ball\\", and gives Dustin some final advice before he enters. Unfortunately, Dustin is rejected by every girl he asks to dance. Seeing Dustin alone and devastated, Nancy asks Dustin to dance and offers him some advice of her own. ===Season 3=== After returning from summer science camp, Dustin sets up an extremely powerful handcrafted radio that he created to talk to his girlfriend Suzie, and presents it to Mike, Eleven, Lucas, Will, and Max. Doubting Suzie's existence after failing to contact her, the other children leave Dustin alone with the radio. Shortly after they leave, Dustin comes across a Russian transmission. After reuniting with Steve, the two of them, alongside Steve's coworker Robin Buckley, translate the message and conclude that it is a code. While spying on mall patrons to find any Russian spies, Dustin tells Steve that he should ask out Robin because he enjoys her company. While Dustin and Steve fail to find any Russians, Robin manages to break the code, realizing that the Russians have a delivery coming to Starcourt Mall's loading dock that night. The trio spies on the armed guards, and, after narrowly escaping, decide to travel into the loading dock through the air vents during daytime, when the guards are not on duty. However, as none of them can fit through the vents, they enlist the help of Lucas's younger sister Erica Sinclair, who opens the door to them. However, as the group enters, the loading dock is revealed to be an elevator, which plunges downward with the four of them trapped inside. The elevator door opens to reveal a Russian base, and the group finds that the Russians are reopening the Gate to the Upside Down. Steve and Robin are captured, while Dustin and Erica narrowly escape through the air vents. Inside the air vents, Dustin explains the events of the previous two seasons to Erica. After Erica calculates how long it will take to get back to the elevator, Dustin convinces her that she is a nerd, and that she should fully embrace being one. The two return to the elevator for supplies to free Steve and Robin. They succeed, but Steve and Robin are drugged so that they could be interrogated. The four hide in a movie theater, showing Back To The Future while Dustin calls Mike for backup, but is unable to give his location before his Walkie-Talkie's batteries run out. After the movie finishes, a Russian guard catches them. However Eleven, who finds Dustin's group using her powers, arrives with her group, just in time to stop the Russians from shooting them. After a brief reunion with the rest of his friends, Dustin returns to his makeshift radio with Erica, Steve, and Robin to navigate Hopper, Joyce, and Murray through the air vents to shut off the machine opening the Gate. However, Planck's constant is the code to the machine's room, and as nobody can remember what it is, Dustin finally contacts Suzie. The two sing The Neverending Story by Giorgio Moroder before Suzie gives then Planck's constant, allowing the machine to be shut off, seemingly at the cost of Hopper's life. Three months later, while Dustin helps the Byers, Eleven prepares to move out of Hawkins, Lucas and Max tease Dustin about the song he sang with Suzie. ==Reception== In his review of season 2 for RogerEbert.com, Brian Tallerico praised Matarazzo's performance, saying he had \\"never been better\\". The character's relationship with Steve Harrington has received positive reviews. Dee Lockett of Vulture called their friendship \\"delightful\\", while Caitlin Gallagher of Bustle called it \\"beautiful\\" ==References== Category:Stranger Things characters Category:Television characters introduced in 2016 Category:Fictional characters from Indiana Category:Horror television characters Category:Male characters in television Category:Child characters in television Category:Fictional engineers Category:Fictional characters with musculoskeletal system disorders ","title":"Dustin Henderson"},{"id":"61320102","text":"Ga'ewa (or Ga‘ǝwa, Ge'ez: ጋዕዋ᎓), pp. 348–49. was a Muslim queen in the north of the Horn of Africa in the sixteenth century. Her kingdom stretched from Mätäma in the west to the area south of the Märäb river in the Ethiopian province of Tigray.. According to the Chronicle of King Gälawdewos, an account of the reign of the Ethiopian emperor Gälawdewos (1540–59), Ga'ewa was the queen of Säläwa, a region in central Tigray. According to the Futūḥ al-Ḥabasha (Conquest of Abyssinia), an account of the campaigns of Aḥmad Grāñ (died 1543), she was the queen of Mäzäga, a region that has not been conclusively identified. It has been located north of the Täkkäze river and bordering the Funj Sultanate in the west. After the death of her brother, Mäkättar, sultan of Mäzäga, she took over the regency on behalf of her nephew Nafî. The Futūḥ al-Ḥabasha describes her as \\"a woman of good counsel, intelligent and wise\\". She reportedly launched several raids against the Christian Ethiopian Empire. In 1557, the Ottomans under Özdemür Pasha took Massawa from the bahr negus Yeshaq and massacred the monks of Debre Damo. In a counteroffensive, Yeshaq defeated the Ottomans and invaded Mäzäga. Ga'ewa's troops were defeated and she fled to Debarwa and the protection of the Ottomans. She tried to persuade Özdemür to liberate Mäzäga by telling him where she had hidden her treasure, but Yeshaq took Debarwa before the Ottomans could mount an expedition., p. 92. In folklore and oral traditions, Ga'ewa is often confused with the semi- legendary tenth-century queen Gudit. In some places, such as the village of Addi Akaweh, they are explicitly identified as one and the same person. Another tradition makes her the wife of Aḥmad Grāñ. The oral traditions of the village of Sǝfra Ga‘ǝwa depict its namesake as a wealthy woman with several herds of cattle. ==Places named after her== *Addi Ga‘ǝwa (\\"country of Ga'ewa\\") *Qǝṣri Ga‘ǝwa (\\"enceinte of Ga'ewa\\") *Mǝ‘raf Ga‘ǝwa (\\"resting place of Ga'ewa\\") *Mäqabǝr Ga‘ǝwa (\\"tomb of Ga'ewa\\") *Sǝfra Ga‘ǝwa (\\"place of Ga'ewa\\") ==NotesFurther reading== * Category:African women in war Category:Women rulers in Africa Category:Islam in Ethiopia Category:Rulers of Ethiopia Category:16th-century monarchs in Africa Category:16th-century women rulers Category:Women in 16th-century warfare ","title":"Ga'ewa"},{"id":"61320113","text":"The Cheyenne Cyclone is a 1931 American western film directed by Armand Schaefer and starring Lane Chandler, Marie Quillan and Frankie Darro.Pitts p.205 It is a remake of the 1928 silent film Phantom of the Range. ==Main cast== * Lane Chandler as Bob Carleton * Marie Quillan as Patsy O'Brien * Frankie Darro as 'Orphan' McGuire * Jay Hunt as Patrick O'Brien * J.

Located in the central region of the Lower Peninsula, it encompasses approximately in segmented portions within Clinton, Gratiot, and Ionia counties. Governed by the Michigan Department of Natural Resources, the area is considered the state's longest contiguous wetland complex. The game area contains the only known salt marsh (classified as an inland salt marsh) in the state of Michigan. ==Location== The Maple River State Game Area follows the Maple River and several smaller creeks for a distance of approximately and a total area of . Its easternmost sections lies within Elba Township in Gratiot County and also contains areas in the county to the west in Washington Township and Fulton Township. Going southwest, the game area contains portions of Lebanon Township and Essex Township within Clinton County. A small isolated portion denotes the westernmost portion of the game area within Lyons Township in Ionia County. The area once contained numerous industrial factories and small settlements, but most have disappeared over time. The only incorporated settlement located directly within the state game area is the small village of Maple Rapids in Essex Township. In Washington Township, U.S. Highway 127 (US 127) passes through the area with a large marshland on both sides. The artificially created marshland is referred to as the Maple River Flooding. The city of St. Johns is to the south on US 127, and Ithaca is to the north. No other major roadways pass through the area, although there are numerous local roads and bridges. The state game area's headquarters are located within the Rose Lake State Wildlife Research Area in Bath Charter Township about to the southeast. At , the larger Gratiot–Saginaw State Game Area is located about to the northeast in Gratiot and Saginaw counties. The two are loosely connected by the small Maple River / Gratiot–Saginaw Connector State Game Area, which intends to connect the two areas into one continuous state game area. ==Wildlife== The Maple River State Game Area has a diverse environment consisting of old forests, wetlands, and grasslands centered along the Maple River. The game area is noted for its large bird populations, as well as an abundance of rabbits, turtles, deer, possums, coyotes, turkeys, snakes, and numerous rodents, such as muskrats, porcupines, squirrels, chipmunks, and beavers. The Friends of the Maple River—a citizen organization aimed at promoting the river—notes a small presence of reintroduced black bears. The Maple River is also a popular fishing destination. The river includes many common fish, including black crappie, bluegill, smallmouth and largemouth bass, northern pike, pumpkinseed, rock bass, yellow perch, bullhead and channel catfish, and bowfin. The Maple River is dammed in several locations, but none are within the river's course in the state game area. Water levels along the river and surrounding wetlands have started to dry up in recent years, leading to a sharp drop in the number of some animals. From 2010 to 2015, the area underwent an extensive restoration project to improve the depleting wetlands to provide a more hospitable animal refuge to accommodate increasing animal populations. The project increased water levels through a new water pumping system, upgraded miles of levees and hiking paths, and built boat launches for river access. The project was supported by a grant from the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service with contributions from Ducks Unlimited. ===Birds=== The Maple River State Game Area is popular among numerous bird species as a living or breeding environment. The following is a list of known bird species within the state game area, according to the National Audubon Society. *Bald eagle *Bobolink *Canada goose *Caspian tern *Great blue heron *Great egret *Green heron *Least sandpiper *Lesser yellowlegs *Marsh wren *Northern harrier *Osprey *Pectoral sandpiper *Ring-necked duck *Rough-legged hawk *Rusty blackbird *Sandhill crane *Semipalmated sandpiper *Short-billed dowitcher *Short-eared owl *Solitary sandpiper *Sora *Trumpeter swan *Tundra swan *Wood duck According to Birdwatching Magazine, the great horned owl, least bittern, prothonotary warbler, red-headed woodpecker, red-tailed hawk, and \\"the vast majority of Michigan's inland ducks\\" can also be found within the state game area. Even rarer species of birds can be found, including Hudsonian godwit, Eurasian wigeon, snowy egret, and king rail. ==Activities== The Maple River State Game Area is a popular fishing destination along the Maple River. Navigating the river is most suited for smaller vessels, such as canoes and kayaks. While it provides numerous shore fishing locations, there are four public access boat ramps along the river: Maple Road in Fulton Township, Dean Road in Washington Township, and two in Lebanon Township (French Road and Fitzpatrick Road). As a state game area, camping in non- designated areas is prohibited. The only public campground within Maple River State Game Area is the privately owned Maple River Campground in Lebanon Township in the southwestern portion along the Maple River. Numerous parking lots are dotted throughout the game area for day use. Seasonal hunting is permitted in various locations of the park, and common game include deer hunting, waterfowl hunting, turkey hunting, and small game trapping. Fishing is permitted year round. A small section within Washington Township east of US 127 is designated as a wildlife refuge, prohibits hunting, and is only accessible at certain times of the year (off limits from September 1 to December 1). Hiking, birdwatching, and photography are also popular activities. The game area includes several miles of marked trails. ==References== Category:Protected areas of Clinton County, Michigan Category:Protected areas of Gratiot County, Michigan Category:Protected areas of Ionia County, Michigan Category:State game areas of Michigan Category:Birdwatching sites in the United States Category:Wetlands of Michigan ","title":"Maple River State Game Area"},{"id":"61320143","text":"WXNV-LP (105.1 FM) is a Christian radio station licensed to serve the community of Loganville, Georgia, United States.

It is the oldest motor vehicle bridge in Santa Fe. ==History== The bridge was built in 1927–28. A prior bridge on the site was torn away by floodwaters on September 30, 1904. Prior to the flood, the city had raised concern about flooding and scouring of the banks. A 1903 ordinance directed adjacent property owners to build breakwaters to protect the river bank, but not everyone complied. After the flood, the city directed its resources to building the breakwaters. A project was planned in 1905 to build the breakwater, but the city council only had $500 available to do the work, which was not nearly enough. They appealed to the county, but the county didn't have enough money either. Since New Mexico was still a territory at that time, there was a paucity of taxable property and no federal aid. When New Mexico became a state in 1912, the city formed a planning commission with the vision of a \\"city different\\" emphasizing its traditional architecture and preserving its historic meandering streets. The plan included a park along the river and landscaped boulevards on both sides. This plan was not fully realized until the 1920s and 1930s. The Federal Aid Road Act of 1916 finally provided some federal government aid, and the State Highway Department was formed to supervise the construction, maintenance, and repair of bridges. Unfortunately, this aid was only available for state and federal highways, and was not available for local streets. The county was able to build a new bridge, the Bridge of Hidalgos at Grant Street, with the availability of federal aid in 1919, but this depleted the county's funding. During the 1920s, the city started to grow rapidly through migration and annexation, with its population doubling from 1910 to 1930, and the city began a program of beautification and infrastructure development. In 1926, residents petitioned the county commissioners to build a new bridge, and the board finally approved $15,000 to build three bridges over the Santa Fe River. On October 11, 1927, the board approved a bid of $6136.20 from the Levy Construction Company to build the bridge. The bridge was designed as a reinforced concrete deck girder bridge, which was suitable for to unsupported spans. The lack of a supporting pier meant that debris would not be caught during flooding. It was given distinctive paneled railings, creating a gateway-like appearance as the railings wrapped away from the entrances. ==References== Category:National Register of Historic Places in Santa Fe County, New Mexico Category:Road bridges on the National Register of Historic Places in New Mexico Category:Buildings and structures completed in 1928 ","title":"Delgado Street Bridge"},{"id":"61320176","text":"Maggie Dent (born March 28, 1955) is an Australian parenting author, educator and speaker. She has written a number of books, holds and speaks at events in Australia, and appears on radio and television. She is the host of the ABC’s Parental As Anything podcast. == Life and early career == Dent was born in Wandering, Western Australia, on a sheep and wheat farm, where she was raised with her five brothers and sisters. The siblings helped on the farm, and Dent attributes the farming lifestyle and working with animals to giving her an insight into life and death. Dent attended boarding school and then university in Western Australia, where she decided to study teaching instead of journalism as planned. She became a teacher, however, also became involved in palliative care and worked as a counsellor, in suicide prevention, and as a funeral celebrant. She has four sons. == Career and work == Dent is the author of 11 books on parenting. In her work she recommends that growing children receive plenty of fresh air, exercise, good food, freedom to take risks and explore. She advocates for limited screen time and more time spent with friends citing the health and psychological benefits of nature play. She also promotes play-based learning in the early years, claiming that the education system in Australia is behind that of other countries because it follows the UK and American models of one-size-fits-all, standardised testing and pushes formalised education into early years. She has stated that a ‘crisis’ exists in the education of boys which she claims has been acknowledged by the OECD (Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development), which found girls are less likely to drop out of school than boys and the gap in their reading levels was equivalent to one year's worth of schooling. She is an advocate for children’s rights, especially the right for children to play, to learn from their mistakes, and to learn to be resilient. Through this work she has been referred to as the “queen of common sense”. === Charity work === Dent is a patron of the Bold Park Community School in Perth, Peel Youth Services in Mandurah and the Western Australia Association of Teacher Assistants (WAATA). She is an ambassador for The Sanctuary – The Hills Women’s Shelter in New South Wales. Dent is an ambassador for Telethon in Western Australia, a trust established 50 years ago to financially support the medical & social welfare of children and which funds research into children’s diseases.

Formed in shallow seas, this sedimentary rock was pushed east and over the top of younger rock during the Laramide orogeny. ==History== The mountain was named in 1917 by the Interprovincial Boundary Survey after King George V (1865–1936).Mount King George, BC Geographical Names The name was officially adopted 23 February 1918. The first ascent of Mount King George was made 10 August 1919 by Val Fynn with Rudolph Aemmer as guide.Mount King George PeakFinder Owing in part to the remoteness of the peak and the difficulty of the first ascent, the second ascent of the mountain wasn't made until 1970 by Gerry Brown, William Hurst, and John Carter.The 11,000ers of the Canadian Rockies, Bill Corbett, Rocky Mountain Books, 2004. ==Climbing== Established climbing routes on Mount King George:Summitpost.org Mount King George * East Face-North Ridge (1919 route of the first ascent) * Southeast Ridge (1970 route of the second ascent) * Southwest Face-West Ridge (1971 route of the third ascent by D.

This climate supports the King George Glacier on the eastern slope of the mountain. Temperatures can drop below −20 °C with wind chill factors below −30 °C. Precipitation runoff from the mountain drains into tributaries of the Palliser River. In terms of favorable weather, the best months for climbing are July through September, with late summer being best for crossing the Palliser River. ==See also== * List of mountains of Canada * Geography of British Columbia * Geology of British Columbia ==ReferencesExternal links== * Mount King George photo: Flickr * Mount King George: weather forecast * BC Parks: Height of the Rockies Provincial Park King George King George ","title":"Mount King George (British Columbia)"},{"id":"61320289","text":"Patrick Luan Dos Santos (born 31 October 1998), known as Patrick Luan, is a Brazilian professional footballer who plays as a forward for the Swiss club FC Sion. ==Professional career== Luan made his professional debut with Fluminense in a 1-0 Brazilian Primeira Liga loss to Internacional on 8 February 2017.

When first called up for Donegal in 2016, he was based in Carlow and travelled from there to train with the team; by 2018 he had relocated to Monaghan. By 2019, he had returned home to work as a personal trainer at Donegal Strength and Conditioning Gym in a little area called Milford. ==Education== Ward is from Letterkenny. He attended St Eunan's College, where he played for the school team and learned to \\"kick the high ball in low\\" from team trainer Neil \\"Flash\\" Gordon. He later studied at IT Carlow and also played for their team. Ward was a member of Letterkenny Athletic Club until his late teens, where he competed against and relayed with Mark English, before focusing on his football.http://www.irishnews.com/sport/gaafootball/2019/08/03/news/commitment- starting-to-pay-off-for-ward-1676665/ Ward's father, Anthony, trained Ward at the local athletic club. Ward specialised in the long jump and was Ireland's best at under-9 level in 2001 and under-13 level in 2004. ==Playing careerClub=== Ward started as his club won the 2014 Donegal Senior Football Championship, dethroning defending champions Glenswilly in the final. ===Inter-county=== Ward played for the Donegal minor team in 2011. He grew up playing at half-back, which he has said is his preferred position; however, he has been used further back in a marking role for his county. He watched the 2012 All-Ireland Senior Football Championship Final from Croke Park's Upper Davin Stand. First featuring for his county at senior level under the management of Rory Gallagher, Ward was first called up ahead of the 2016 season, the eldest of twelve new recruits and travelling from Carlow to train with the team. He appeared as a late substitute against Mayo in the 2016 National Football League at MacCumhaill Park. That one minute, as well as injury time, was his total game play for Donegal in the 2016 season. Ward made his first league start for Donegal against Kerry in the opening fixture of the 2017 at O'Donnell Park (his club's home ground), completing the full match. He made his championship debut against Antrim in the quarter-final of the 2017 Ulster Senior Football Championship. By contrast, Patrick McBrearty (who is slightly younger than Ward) had reached a century of appearances for Donegal by the time Ward started an All-Ireland quarter-final in 2019. He started the 2017 All-Ireland Senior Football Championship qualifier defeat of Meath at Páirc Tailteann. He then started the qualifier loss to Galway at Markievicz Park. Ward continued to feature for his county under the management of Declan Bonner. He made a second half substitute appearance against Fermanagh in the final of the 2018 Ulster Senior Football Championship, claiming his first Ulster senior title. He had earlier started, and scored a point in, the preliminary round defeat of Cavan. He started the quarter-final defeat of Derry. He also started, and scored a point in, the semi-final defeat of Down. Ward appeared in the four 2019 Dr McKenna Cup matches that Donegal played. He then began Donegal's first six matches in the 2019 National Football League when others were out injured, before losing his place in the team when they returned. He made a late appearance against Cavan in the final of the 2019 Ulster Senior Football Championship, claiming his second title. He made another late appearance against Meath in the following game. Then he got to play at Croke Park in the 2019 All-Ireland quarter-final match against Kerry when the likes of Neil McGee and Eoghan Bán Gallagher were injured, leaving Donegal lacking their first-choice back line. He spent much of the game competing against Paul Geaney.

A former professional soccer player in the League of Ireland with Derry City, Finn Harps and Sligo Rovers, Patton changed to Gaelic football in 2018, playing for Naomh Adhamhnáin and the Donegal county team. He has twice won the Ulster Senior Football Championship with Donegal. ==Early life== Patton is from Letterkenny. He went to primary school at Lurgybrack in Letterkenny. He attended St Eunan's College for his secondary education. Patton played in a MacLarnon Cup Final for the College. He did so while on the books of Finn Harps, a soccer team. His teammates on an earlier St Eunan's College team (when Patton was 14) included future professional footballer Dale Gorman. He also played for the Republic of Ireland at schoolboy level. He made his League of Ireland debut at the age of 16 before becoming disillusioned with that game at the age of 22 and pursuing Gaelic football instead. He did not attend a third-level institution as he was playing full-time football. He joined Derry City in November 2014 in what was considered a surprise development, though he had lost his position in the Harps team after taking time off to study for his Leaving Certificate the previous year. Michael Murphy employed Patton to work in his shop in Letterkenny. Patton came out as a Garda in 2020. He was posted to Navan, a town in County Meath. ==Playing careerClub=== Upon being reappointed Donegal Gaelic football manager in 2017, Declan Bonner set about trying to recruit Patton. The goalkeeper had never before played a local league or championship game in the sport of Gaelic football, only appearing for Naomh Adhamhnáin in two Ulster club games against Roslea and Omagh during the 2014–15 All-Ireland Senior Club Football Championship. At the time of Bonner's request, Patton was negotiating the possibility of joining soccer outfit Cork City. He was doing so from a position of having played for one year for Sligo Rovers — where he deputised for Micheál Schlingermann when Schlingermann was injured — and had started 12 games for the Sligo soccer outfit in 2017. Patton said at the time: ===Inter-county=== Patton began training with Donegal for the first time in January 2018. He had fractured his ankle the previous October while playing for the Sligo soccer team against an outfit from Drogheda. Under the management of Declan Bonner (second spell), Mark Anthony McGinley was initially the first choice goalkeeper, having been brought in by Bonner's predecessor Rory Gallagher. However, during the opening fixture of the 2018 National Football League against Kerry, McGinley sustained an injury and second choice goalkeeper Peter Boyle came on as a substitute. Boyle then started against Galway in the second league fixture, and again started in the third fixture against Dublin (at Croke Park). Then, in the fourth league fixture against Kildare, manager Declan Bonner opted for Patton as Donegal's first choice goalkeeper, prompting Boyle to quit. Patton continued in goal for the remainder of the season. He made his Ulster Senior Football Championship championship debut from the start against Cavan, and played every minute against Derry and Down on the way to the final against Fermanagh, which Donegal won. He then played every minute of Donegal's 2018 All-Ireland challenge, making his Croke Park debut against Dublin in the quarter-final group stage on 14 July 2018, only for Donegal's challenge to come undone against eventual finalists Tyrone. Patton started the opening game of the National Football League, before briefly alternating with McGinley, until taking over completely as Donegal's first choice goalkeeper when McGinley withdrew from consideration in March due to his reluctance to commit in the competition against Patton. Patton won his second Ulster Senior Football Championship later that year, again completing every minute of play. He did so while competing against Paul Durcan (regarded as having the sport's closest ability in the goalkeeping position to Stephen Cluxton); Durcan had availed of McGinley's departure to seek a return to Donegal. ==Style== Patton's short and long range kick-outs, as well as his and shot-stopping abilities, have garnered him comparisons with Paul Durcan and Stephen Cluxton. His kicks have been likened to \\"laser darts\\". RTÉ noted as early as the 2018 Ulster Senior Football Championship victory over Derry that \\"Patton's long, accurate kick- outs were highly effective in setting Donegal back on the attack\\". His ability at saving was also on display against Down in the following match, when he used a trailing right boot to prevent a goal from a Donal O'Hare shot. In the next game, the final, Patton showed his saving ability again. ==Honours== ;Donegal *Ulster Senior Football Championship: 2018, 2019 *National Football League Division 2: 2019 ;Individual * All Star: 1 Ulster Schools All Star ** _Nominated_ in 2019 ==References== Category:1990s births Category:Living people Category:Association footballers from County Donegal Category:Association football goalkeepers Category:Derry City F.C. players Category:Donegal inter-county Gaelic footballers Category:Finn Harps F.C. players Category:Gaelic footballers who switched code Category:Gaelic football goalkeepers Category:Garda Síochána officers Category:League of Ireland players Category:People educated at St Eunan's College Category:People from Letterkenny Category:Republic of Ireland association footballers Category:Republic of Ireland youth international footballers Category:St Eunan's Gaelic footballers Category:Sligo Rovers F.C. players ","title":"Shaun Patton"},{"id":"61320386","text":"Gabriela Clesca Vallejo is a Haitian-Canadian model and beauty pageant titleholder who was crowned Miss Haiti 2019.

Originally built in Paradise Valley, Arizona, it was moved to Tempe in 2007-2009 to become the home of the Sandra Day O'Connor Institute and was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 2019. ==Description== The home was built in 1957 of adobe brick made from mud collected at the nearby Salt River. It is one-story with three bedrooms, floor-to-ceiling windows and is approximately . The design is mid-century modern with significant influences of Frank Lloyd Wright. O'Connor and her husband placed some of the brick during the construction, and applied skim milk as a preservative. The original location was on Denton Lane in the town of Paradise Valley, a suburb of Phoenix. In addition to Wright influences such as the large floor-to- ceiling windows that connect the inside to the outside environment, large overhangs to block the desert sun, and a modern \\"minimal palette of materials\\", the long narrow shape reflects the California ranch popularized by Cliff May. The house also features exposed adobe brick on the interior, red concrete floors and exposed wood structural beams. It was O'Connor's desire that the design of the house evoke memories of her childhood home, an adobe ranch house in Duncan, Arizona. A post-O'Connor owner of the property planned to demolish the home in order to build a larger residence on the lot. A preservation effort ensued which raised $2 million in private funding and the house was disassembled beginning in 2007. Each adobe brick was removed, individually numbered, and stacked for transport to the new location. Other parts were moved in large assemblies. In May 2008, land in Tempe's Papago Park was allocated by unanimous vote of the Tempe City Council. Reconstruction was completed in 2009. The house was rebuilt in its original geographic orientation. The new location is within the Carl Hayden Campus for Sustainability at the park, is adjacent to the Arizona Historical Society Museum, and overlooks the city of Tempe and the Salt River. The site was designed by landscape architect Christy Ten Eyck. ==Residence== O'Connor made her residence in the house from 1958 to 1981, when she was appointed to the Supreme Court by President Ronald Reagan. O'Connor frequently entertained political figures at the house, including U.S. Senator and Republican presidential nominee Barry Goldwater and former Democratic governor Bruce Babbitt. \\"Anyone who was anyone in Arizona politics in the 1960s, 1970s was in that house having dinner with Justice O'Connor,\\" according to Arizona State Preservation officer Kathryn Leonard. O'Connor loved to cook and liked preparing Mexican food including chalupas. The O'Connor's served guests on the large patio. According to Leonard, \\"This is where she had these very productive policy conversations. When people were breaking bread with each other ... and getting to know each other as individuals, she believed there was almost no problem that couldn't be solved over one civil dinner.\\" ==Nomination== The Sandra Day O'Connor Institute and the Arizona State Historic Preservation Office had been working to have the home listed for about ten years. Much of the delay was due to the fact that the home had been moved from its original location. The National Park Service normally does not consider properties that have been moved, nor those associated with a living person. Supporters countered that the move and renovation was done with the \\"input\\" of O'Connor and allowed the building to be used for \\"civic education\\". The institute uses the building for \\"workshops, meetings and special events.\\" Arizona State Preservation officer Kathryn Leonard said \\"In the case of Justice O'Connor, she is iconic and quite obviously a living legend. I think that was a very clear sell to the National Register folks.\\" The board chairman of the O'Connor Institute, Matt Feeney said \\"Her storied life is symbolized by this iconic structure that embodies her character and quest for civil discourse.\\" The nomination also had the support of Arizona's senators Martha McSally and Kyrsten Sinema. McSally hoped that listing the house would \\"preserve her legacy for generations to come.\\" Although moved from its original location, the house was still eligible for listing as \\"the singular surviving property most importantly associated with an historic person\\". O'Connor is one of Arizona's \\"most recognizable and influential public figures\\". She served as Arizona's attorney general for four years until being appointed to the Arizona Senate in 1969 where she won reelection twice. She became the Senate majority leader in 1972, and was the first woman in that position in any state. After the senate, she was a Maricopa County Superior Court judge and then served on the Arizona Court of Appeals. Becoming the first woman on the Supreme Court elevated her stature in Arizona and gave her national recognition. She was awarded the nation's highest civilian honor, the Presidential Medal of Freedom, in 2009. ==References== Category:Houses on the National Register of Historic Places in Arizona Category:Houses completed in 1957 Category:Buildings and structures in Tempe, Arizona Category:Houses in Maricopa County, Arizona Category:National Register of Historic Places in Maricopa County, Arizona ","title":"Sandra Day O'Connor House"},{"id":"61320610","text":"Oi Choong is an Australian landscape architect and urban designer, and a Fellow of the Australian Institute of Landscape Architects. == Biography == Oi Choong completed a Bachelor of Architecture at the University of Sydney, as well as graduate diplomas in both Landscape Design (UNSW) and Environmental Studies (Macquarie University). ==Professional career== Oi Choong was appointed as Head of Environmental Design and Landscape in the NSW Government Architect’s Office in 1986, which at the time, was one of the largest landscape practices in Australia.

On February 23, 2018, reports from the Philippine Department of Labor and Employment (DOLE) said that it had directed Nutri-Asia to \\"give regular employment to 914 employees\\" which had been hired under their contractors Alternative Network Resources Unlimited Multipurpose Cooperative; Serbiz Multi-Purpose Cooperative; and B-Mirk Enterprises Corp, because their work arrangements were considered labor-only subcontracting, which is not allowed by the Philippines' labor code. However, Nutri-Asia rejected this interpretation. Workers of B-Mirk Enterprises Corp, citing contractualization practices and unsafe conditions, decided to form a union. The officers of this union were laid off, and those suspected of being members said that they were threatened with suspensions. On June 25, 2018, DOLE Region 3 reversed the February decision, saying that the workers who went on strike had an employer- employee relationship with B-Mirk, rather than with NutriAsia. The protesters continued to picket the Marilao site. On June 30, 2018, the protesters held an ecumenical mass at the picket site, with about 300 people in attendance including the protesters and numerous supporters. As the mass ended, police forces arrived to disperse the crowd. The dispersal that followed saw at least 30 individuals injured. 19 persons were arrested, including 14 who were either workers or supporters; and five journalists who were covering the celebration of the mass. Two of the five journalists arrested were campus journalists Psalty Caluza and Jon Bonifacio, both students at the University of the Philippines Diliman. At the time, Caluza was a fourth year journalism student from the UP College of Mass Communication, who was taking an internship with media organization AlterMidya. Bonifacio, an Oblation scholar and who was vying for graduation with honors, was covering the event for Scientia, the student publication of the UP College of Science.

It is a proto-Greyhound highball. The recipe appeared in Patrick Gavin Duffy's The Official Mixer’s Manual. The substitution of raspberry syrup for grenadine was made by Ted \\"Dr. Cocktail\\" Haigh in his 2009 book Vintage Spirits and Forgotten Cocktails. Dr. Cocktail also specified that the cocktail should be made with white grapefruit juice, which is more bitter than pink or red varieties; however, if pink or red grapefruit juice is used, this can be offset by using less raspberry syrup. A variant also includes lemon juice and simple syrup. The cocktail can also be modified by using bourbon or whiskey instead of rye, or weakening it by adding more grapefruit juice and grenadine, or by adding maraschino cherries to round out the flavor.

Note the bifid end of the keel, also called \\"jaw\\", and the flat decorated face. Janggolan refers to two different type of perahu from Indonesia. One is from Madura, and the other from Bali. The Madurese janggolan is a type of indigenously constructed boat, meanwhile Balinese janggolan is an indigenous boat with western-styled hull construction. ==Madurese janggolan== Rear view of janggolan in Pasar Ikan, Batavia. Janggolan in Madura comes from the western half of the south coast of Madura, from Kamal to Sampang.Stenross. (2007). p. 96. It is the largest from the family of boats with double stempost, like lis-alis. They can be found plying to Singapore in the past, being called \\"old-style golekkan\\".Stenross. (2007). p. 83. === Etymology === The word janggolan means transportation.Horridge. (1981). p. 69. It is also called as parao janggol (meaning \\"transport perahu\\") by the Madurese.Stenross. (2007). p. 101. Like the alisalis, janggolan were regarded as \\"female\\" (parao bini - female boat), and ornamental motif used were connected with the feminine.Stenross. (2007). p. 277. ===Description=== left Madurese janggolan can be identified by flat decorated face between the double stempost in the boat and from the distance it can be identified by 2 supporting poles above the stern that's supported by temporary bamboo rod. Also, janggolan were not painted white like the leti leti. In the sea, janggolan has the same rig as golekan (lete rig), but the shape is bigger. Kroman is the same as janggolan, also with deckhouse, 2 triangular sails with the same rig, but usually with narrower bow with an elegant, high ascending frame and low \\"jawline\\". Kroman in the 19th century also had outrigger, and it might be that all the boats from the family of lis- alis are descendants of boats that had outriggers.Horridge. (1981). p. 70. Horizontal mast (tenjoran) is still used in the direction of the wind because it is a part of the rigging.Horridge. (1981). p. 71. Madurese janggolan is \\"large lis-alis\\", some of them having large solid mast. They are Madura's heaviest cargo boat. The carrying capacity is between 65-120 tons.Stenross. (2007). p. 236. The rudder post itself can be 3 meter long with 25x40 cm in thickness, with vertical pillar taller than human. Kroman weighing 100-200 ton constructed without ribs or floor because it's not possible in the past, but now the janggolan has a large number of heavy ribs placed close together like on the hull of western boats, with tying pole and covered them to keep the cargo from water. The wood carving pattern on the face of the boat comes from various sources, including the Dutch royal emblem. They are also very persistent and faithful in using it, a janggolan in 1978 is using the same pattern from an illustration of more than 60 years before.Horridge. (1981). p. 72. ===Role=== Batavia. Note the flat decorated face and the tenjoran. In the 19th century, janggolan is the main mean of transportation and is commonly used to transport egg of milkfish (Chanos chanos) caught near offshore and sold to fish farm owners along the coast of north Java. Janggolan had been involved in the carrying of timber from Kalimantan from the late 1960s, combining this with the transport of salt to Jakarta and other places in the western portion of the archipelago since early 20th century, and specializing in the transport of baulk timber or squared logs to ports in Java.Stenross. (2007). p. 141. There are indications that janggolan will be replaced entirely by leti-leti and no more janggolan will be constructed. The surviving ones carried cargo to small river estuary and passing through muddy shallow waters in Madura strait, where the frame is made better suited, protecting them from difficult conditions and its rig enable them to maneuver along the small river with the help of pole. In the sea, heavy laden janggolan can sail steadily in water, with the aft of the boat pulled down by its body shape, creating little waves or small ripples under the bow of the boat. ==Balinese janggolan== A 2D drawing of a Balinese janggolan photographed by Adrian Horridge. Balinese janggolan refers to small type of boat with western influence used in Bali, built using sekoci hull.Horridge. (1981). p. 119. The word sekoci likely comes from Dutch word schuitje (small boat). In the 19th century a sekoci means a small perahu with western-style construction, usually for the Dutch, and many of the type exported from Makassar to other islands.Horridge. (1981). p. 113. ===Description=== It is used as ferry boat, with sekoci hull, central rudder, and small single sail placed high in a mast. The stempost makes a 70 degrees angle against the straight keel. The planks were bent by heating using low temperature fire. The bow and stern is pointed, almost similar to each other, but a flat platform was placed at the stern above 2 or 3 flat poles. This is where the helmsman stood, with a pole in hand, one foot pressing the rudder, holding the sail. The hull is long, thin, and almost rounded at the middle of the boat. There are ribs and seating at the edge of the boat, a deck with two levels. A Balinese janggolan observed by Adrian Horridge is 11 m long, 2.75 m wide, with midhull draft of 76 cm. The planking is 2.5 cm thick, the ribs are 7.5x12.5 cm in cross section, the mast is 4.3 m high. The height of stempost and sternpost is 1.2 m.Horridge.

In 1943 she was the first woman to be appointed as a trustee of the Art Gallery of New South Wales. She was a noted advocate of contemporary art in Australia, and a student of André Lhote in Paris in 1938. Evatt did much to promote modernism in Australian public life in the 1930s to 1950s. With direct links to the centre of political power in mid 20th century Australia via her husband's legal and political career, she enjoyed unique public agency for an Australian woman artist in the mid 20th century and much of her career unfolded in the public spotlight. == Early life and early political activities == Evatt was born in Iowa to Samuel Sheffer (d.1929), manufacturing chemist, and his wife Alice Maud, née Holt. As a child, her family moved to New Zealand, then Melbourne, and finally settled in Sydney where her family enjoyed a comfortable life due to her father's business success. She enrolled in the architecture school at the University of Sydney but after meeting H.V. Evatt changed her course to legal studies to better engage with his interests. They married in 1919, against her father's wishes, as he regarded Evatt as from a lower social class, and travelled overseas for their honeymoon. Evatt also wrote poetry at this date and throughout her life, which remained unpublished. Throughout the 1920s she supported her husband by vigorously campaigning amongst women voters and also organising relief for families affected by the great depression. == Art career in the 1930s == Her husband's appointment as a judge of the Supreme Court of Australia in 1930 meant that the couple travelled frequently, allowing Evatt to spend time in classes at both of Australia's most radical art schools at that date, the Bell-Shore School in Melbourne and Crowley-Fizelle school in Sydney. A mature and diligent student, her art developed and consolidated rapidly and whilst her output was relatively small, her paintings easily match those of more prolific contemporaries. Her awareness of a broad range of modern art was unusual in an Australian context.Melissa Boyde Mary Alice Evatt MAS 1898–1973 exhibition catalogue p 7 In Melbourne she became close to the early Australian cubist Moya Dyring, and they remained friends throughout their lives. Evatt often visited Moya in Paris and the two women painted together in France. Art patrons John and Sunday Reed also were friends and through them Evatt and her high profiled husband became known in the Heide Circle. Through George Bell and John Reed both of the Evatts became active in the Contemporary Art Society. In 1938 Evatt studied with André Lhote in Paris and Hans Hofmann in New York. == Art Gallery of New South Wales trustee == Appointed a trustee of the Art Gallery of New South Wales (AGNSW) in 1943, she often voted against the conservative stance of the other trustees, including during the controversy about William Dobell's portrait of Joshua Smith. She was an ally and a supporter of the young Bernard Smith who managed the wartime touring exhibitions of Australian art sent out from the AGNSW into rural NSW, an initiative that Evatt advocated. Notably she was one of the strong women who facilitated and supported Smith's career. She held that post until 1970, and was the only female trustee during those years. Her public career and her political commitment made an early link between the Australian Labor Party and the art world, which would not be ratified until the election of the government of Gough Whitlam in 1972. Evatt's lobbying for Smith also enabled him to reach a highly influential position and established his career. Thus Mary Alice Evatt had a uniquely extended influence for a woman artist. == Public life and World War II== Evatt's activities extended beyond Australia onto a global stage when her husband was deputy leader in the Curtin Labor Government, spending time in the United States, and more so when H.V. Evatt became the first president of the United Nations General Assembly in 1946–1948. The couple had a home in Paris and spent much time in that city. She met Pablo Picasso in Paris and invited him to attend the UN assembly. Other significant figures whom she knew included F.D. and Eleanor Roosevelt, Charles de Gaulle, Winston Churchill. She bought Australian art on behalf of Queen Elizabeth II. After World War 2 in Paris she worked with curatorial teams bringing public artworks out of wartime safe keeping. In the 1950s, a conservative Australian government meant that the Evatts' political and cultural influence significantly diminished in Australia and globally. However Mary Alice had links to the conservative regime through her long friendship with Maie Casey, whom she saw, like Eleanor Roosevelt, as a like-minded colleague. H.V. Evatt's increasing ill-health also shaped her later years, limiting her time for public and cultural affairs, although she held some posts such as the Convenor of Art and Letters for the National Council of Women and presidencies of United Nations related bodied. Evatt judged a number of art shows. Some of her valuable art collection, including a Modigliani, were sold to fund H.V. Evatt's health care costs. Whilst settled in Canberra, she still found time to study with Desiderius Orban and later at the Canberra School of Art, where she specialised in sculpture. The latter medium became a focus in her later years. == Exhibitions == In 2002–2005 a major touring exhibition of her work, curated by Dr Melissa Boyde, was organised by the Bathurst Regional Gallery, with support from the Evatt Foundation. It presented a collection of her modernist works and toured to venues including Heide Museum of Modern Art, Canberra Museum and Gallery and the S.H Ervin Gallery, Sydney. In 2018 Boyde curated 'Art for the People: Mary Alice Evatt' shown at the Blue Mountains Cultural Centre Gallery. ==Play== In 2018 Evatt featured in a play by Peta Tait, Eleanor and Mary Alice, focusing on her friendship with Eleanor Roosevelt and their influence on world affairs. ==References External links == *Barbara Dale, Evatt, Mary Alice (1898–1973), Australian Dictionary of Biography, National Centre of Biography, Australian National University, Evatt, Mary Alice (1898–1973), published first in hardcopy 1996, accessed online 8 March 2020. *A fresh point of view, Melissa Boyde Category:20th-century Australian women artists Category:1898 births Category:1973 deaths Category:19th-century Australian women ","title":"Mary Alice Evatt"},{"id":"61321080","text":"The New Opera House is a historic building in Auburn, Nebraska.

His family moved to a farm in Braintree, Massachusetts in 1864, but quickly left for Boston's Charlestown neighborhood. He graduated from Charlestown High School in 1872. In 1878 he married Isabella M. Squire. They had three daughters. ==Journalism== After high school, O'Meara worked for The Boston Globe as its Charlestown reporter. After three months he was promoted to the city staff. He joined the Boston Journal in 1874 as a legislative, political, and shorthand reporter. From 1879 to 1881 he was the paper's city editor. From 1881 to 1891 he served as managing editor. On July 1, 1891, general manager W. W. Clapp retired from the paper and O'Meara was given control of both the commercial and editorial sides of the paper. Soon thereafter, O'Meara fell ill with severe acute Bright's disease. At one point he was pronounced dead. However, he eventually recovered and returned to the Journal. On March 15, 1895, O'Meara resigned from the paper and was replaced by Francis M. Stanwood. On January 1, 1896, a syndicate led by W. D. Sohler purchased 80% of the paper and O'Meara returned as editor-in-chief, publisher, and part owner. In 1899 he purchased majority ownership in the paper. In October 1902, O'Meara sold the paper to Frank Munsey and retired from publishing. ==Political career== On September 7, 1904, O'Meara declared his candidacy for the United States House of Representatives seat in Massachusetts's 11th congressional district. He lost the Republican nomination to Eugene Foss 2993 votes to 2271. Republicans considered nominating O'Meara in the 1905 Boston mayoral election, but he had no interest in running. On July 20 he and his family left the city for a year long vacation in Europe, where his children were to attend school. In 1910, O'Meara again ran for Congress in the 11th District. He ran as a progressive and opposed Republican Speaker of the House Joseph Cannon. He lost the Republican nomination to conservative W. Dudley Cotton Jr. 3,091 votes to 2,146. Cotton had run an energetic while O'Meara elected to not campaign at all. ==Police commissioner== In 1906, a new law went into effect which replaced the three-member Boston police commission with a single police commissioner. On May 23, 1906, Governor Curtis Guild Jr. cabled O'Meara, who staying in Dresden, informing him that he had been nominated for the position of police commissioner and asking him to return to the city at once. He departed from Liverpool on the SS Arabic on May 25. He arrived in Boston on June 2, 1906 and took office on June 4. After taking office, O'Meara instituted a number of reforms. During his first year, O'Meara barred officers from accepting rewards for routine action, replaced the disciplinary action of fining police officers with extra work assignments, forbid city hall officials from interfering with police business, eliminated bathhouse details, opposed veteran's preference for appointment to the police department, and issued new orders regarding his officers' use of firearms, arrest of juveniles, physical appearance. In 1915 he ordered that police officers no longer regulate dancing at hotels and other places that sold liquor. O'Meara's appointment expired in 1911. His reappointment was opposed by a group of 150 Boston ministers, led by Willard Francis Mallalieu, as well as a group of South End women, who wanted public education activist Florence Page appointed to the position over the \\"weak and inefficient\\" O'Meara. His reappointment was endorsed by the Good Government Association as well as another group of Protestant clergy, which included Thomas Van Ness, Herbert S. Johnson, and Adolf A. Berle Sr. On May 31, Governor Foss reappointed O'Meara. He remained commissioner until his death on December 14, 1918. ==References== Category:1854 births Category:1918 deaths Category:19th-century American newspaper publishers (people) Category:20th-century American newspaper publishers (people) Category:Canadian emigrants to the United States Category:Commissioners of the Boston Police Department Category:Editors of Massachusetts newspapers Category:Massachusetts Republicans Category:People from Charlestown, Boston Category:The Boston Globe people ","title":"Stephen O'Meara"},{"id":"61321241","text":"Kenny Griffin (January 27, 1912 - September 26, 2002) was an American gymnast.

Key results of his research include the following: * Finding intergenerational economic mobility to vary substantially across the United States, Kline, Emmanuel Saez, Raj Chetty and Nathaniel Hendren identify (i) residential segregation, (ii) income inequality, (iii) low primary school quality, (iv) low social capital, and (v) low family stability as key characteristics of areas with low mobility.Chetty, R. et al. (2014). Where is the land of opportunity? The geography of intergenerational mobility in the United States. Quarterly Journal of Economics, 129(4), pp. 1553-1623. Overall, while they conclude that mobility has remained stable over time, they highlight that some areas in the U.S. have persistently offered less mobility than most other developed countries.Chetty, R. et al. (2013). Is the United States still a land of opportunity? Recent trends in intergenerational mobility. American Economic Review: Papers & Proceedings, 104(5), pp. 141–147. * Kline, David Card and Jörg Heining argue that the rise in West German wage inequality is due to a combination of growing differences between workers, stronger dispersion between the wage premia paid by different firms, and an increased tendency of high-ability workers to sort into high- premium paying establishments.Card, D., Heining, J., Kline, P. (2013). Workplace heterogeneity and the rise of West German wage inequality. Quarterly Journal of Economics, 128(3), pp. 967–1015. In further work on wage inequality with Card and Ana Rute Cardoso, Kline finds evidence that gender differences in terms of workplace bargaining and sorting – e.g. men sorting themselves into firms with higher wage premia and women earning smaller wage premia than men within the same firm – account for about 20% of the gender wage gap in Portugal.Card, D., Cardoso, A.R., Kline, P. (2015). Bargaining, sorting, and the gender wage gap: Quantifying the impact of firms on the relative pay of women. Quarterly Journal of Economics, 131(2), pp. 633–686. Along with Heining, they further argue that firm-level drivers of wage inequality can be explained through workers' individual tastes for different workplaces.Card, D. et al. (2018). Firms and labor market inequality: Evidence and some theory. Journal of Labor Economics, 36(S1), pp. S13–S70. * Evaluating a programme of U.S. empowerment zones (EZ), Kline, Mathias Busso and Jesse Gregory find that EZ designation substantially raised employment and real wages in zone neighborhoods at modest efficiency costs.Busso, M., Gregory, J., Kline, P. (2013). Assessing the incidence and efficiency of a prominent place based policy. American Economic Review, 103(2), pp. 897–947. In another example of a local economic development programme, together with Enrico Moretti, Kline studies the impact of the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA); they find that the programme helped foster infrastructure improvements that yielded long-growing gains in manufacturing employment and raised U.S. manufacturing productivity though local agglomeration gains seem to cancel out with losses in the rest of the U.S.Kline, P., Moretti, E. (2013). Local economic development, agglomeration economies, and the Big Push: 100 years of evidence from the Tennessee Valley Authority. Quarterly Journal of Economics, 129(1), pp. 275–331. Overall, Kline and Moretti have argued that \\"place-based policies have the potential to profoundly affect the location of economic activity, along with the wages, employment, and industry mix of communities\\".Kline, P., Moretti, E.

In the ensuing years, but before 1979, there were three main sources of NASCAR telecasts: *ABC's Wide World of Sports, the sports anthology program, provided coverage of select NASCAR Winston Cup races in the 1970s. In 1971, it presented a 200-lap race at Greenville-Pickens Speedway in its entirety, the first such broadcast of a NASCAR race. Throughout the 1970s, ABC presented portions of the Daytona 500, Southern 500, and other important races. *In the late 1970s, CBS Sports Spectacular aired some races; like Wide World of Sports, they were taped and edited. *Car and Track, a weekly auto racing show hosted by Bud Lindemann, recapped all of NASCAR's top-series races in the 1960s and 1970s in a weekly 30-minute syndicated show. ==List of races televised1960=== { class= - Date Event Network Lap-by-lap Color commentator(s) - 2/12 Twin 100's CBS Bud Palmer  } In February 1960, CBS sent a \\"skeleton\\" production crew to Daytona Beach, Florida and the Daytona International Speedway to cover the Daytona 500's Twin 100 (now the Bluegreen Vacations Duel) qualifying races on February 12, 1960.

During the 1960s and early 1970s, the race was filmed and an edited highlight package aired the following weekend. In 1974, ABC began the first semi-live coverage (joined-in-progress) of the Daytona 500. Coverage was normally timed to begin when the race was halfway over. Brief taped highlights of the start and early segments were shown, then ABC joined the race live already in progress, picking up approximately the last 90 minutes of the race.

The velvety, aromatic broth is called sopa negra or caldo de frijol. A variation of the black bean recipe is to serve it as pot beans instead of soup; the leftovers from either will thicken and can then be mashed and cooked in oil or lard to make refried beans. Black bean soup is a classic part of both American and Cuban cuisine. A simple black bean soup recipe can include as few as five ingredients, but other recipes are more elaborate. Part of the convenience of the soup is that the recipe is flexible enough that it can be made with available ingredients. The recipe can take as little as 20 minutes to make, or can take days, depending on the method. Restaurants that have sold black bean soup have included Panera. ==Preparation== Flavor can be added through ingredients such as marinated chipotle chiles, jalapeno peppers, roasted poblanos, salsa, or chile powder (to add heat) or ground cumin or ground coriander. Vinegar can be added to make the soup creamier and give it a tang; vinegar or lime juice can also be used to cut the beans' intensity. The soup can either be vegetarian or contain meat products (e.g., a ham hock, bacon, or chicken stock). Other ingredients can include epazote, bay leaves, carrots, celery, chipotle sauce, onions, corn, green bell peppers, garlic, olive oil, salt, black pepper, cinnamon, thyme, or red wine. Like potatoes, the beans absorb salt and spice. The soup may be served with a side of rice, and garnished with sour cream, chopped red bell pepper, cilantro leaves, diced avocado, etc. A pressure cooker is typically not used as this would give the beans more of a pudding-like consistency by forcing moisture upon them. A typical approach would be to cook the carrots, bay leaves, and salt, then to add the onion and garlic, then to add the cumin, cinnamon, beans, corn, tomatoes and broth, and boil and then simmer the mixture, before stirring in the hot sauce and cilantro. ==See also== * List of bean soups ==References== Category:Bean soups Category:Cuban cuisine ","title":"Black bean soup"},{"id":"61321764","text":"Roman Hogen (born 12 December 1970) is a retired Czech football midfielder.Weltfussball ==References== Category:1970 births Category:Living people Category:Czech footballers Category:FK Chmel Blšany players Category:FK Viktoria Žižkov players Category:SK Slavia Prague players Category:1.

He played for JDR Stars, a Pretoria-based organization, on their second division team as goalkeeper, and now does so for Tornado F.C., also in the SAFA Second Division. He is Africa’s first openly gay male footballer, having come out publicly in July 2015. His nickname Phuti Minaj came from his mentor John Moshoeu, who caught him twerking while watching a video from Nicki Minaj. == Early life == Phuti Lekoloane was born in Moletjie, Polokwane in the Capricorn District Municipality, the largest Limpopo province in South Africa. He was raised in Tembisa. His family has a farm going back generations; their “extended family owns about 300 hectares in Mooiplaas, Mpumalanga, about 40km from Polokwane.” Lekoloane says he has always known he was gay, being born as such, and that his family was accepting and supportive. However, he was bullied at school for being gay. When he was about 13, he was playing netball and was pulled into being the football goalie when the team was short of players. He’s been playing football since he was fifteen. At seventeen he was playing for Highlands Park F.C. and realized he had a talent for the sport. He also played for Platinum Stars F.C.’s development team before they were moved to Royal Bafokeng Stadium. == Career  JDR Stars === Lekoloane played for JDR Stars, an ABC Motsepe League team, a Pretoria-based organization, on their SAFA Second Division team as goalkeeper. He wears the 91 shirt in honor of John Moshoeu, a South African Nations Cup champion in 1996, who was his mentor. \\"[Moshoeu] is fondly remembered for wearing the number 10 jersey\\", Phuti says, \\"9 plus 1 equals 10;\\" he sought permission from Moshoeu's family, and they gave their blessing. His nickname, Phuti Minaj, was given to him by Moshoeu who caught him twerking while watching a video from Nicki Minaj. He is South Africa’s first openly gay footballer, after coming out publicly in December 2015. His teammates have been mostly supportive, Lekoloane thinks because he has a good attitude and accepts himself. However opposition teams and their fans have taunted and harassed him. Lekoloane has learned to channel that hatred into motivation to make things better for other gay footballers. He left because of homophobia, including a teammate who believed being gay was on par with being a murderer. Being gay remains a crime in many African countries; he has met many closeted gay soccer players. South Africa was the first country on the continent to legalize same-sex marriage. Lekoloane’s goal is to be the first openly gay player in the South African Premier Division of the Premier Soccer League. === Dealing with homophobia === Lekoloane has dealt with homophobia in the sport; at a team’s trial in the mid-2010s, the organization’s representatives said they did not know how to accommodate him, and thought he would be bad for their image. , he has been on trial with five Premier Soccer League teams but they were concerned about his sexuality. Lekoloane noted that while European teams have tried to eradicate homophobia—for instance, the 2016 #RainbowLaces campaign developed by Skins sportswear, to raise awareness about homophobia in sport with Pride in Diversity, —South Africa has not; while they have worked on issues of racism in association football. Homophobia, and toxic masculinity has long existed in football, going back to before Justin Fashanu, the first professional gay footballer, who never came out but his sexuality was an open secret, faced it from his own coach in the 1980s. It continued to Robbie Rogers, and others since. The atmosphere for LGBTQ people in South Africa is still dangerous. The South African Institute of Race Relations (IRR) found that 40% “who identify as LGBTQIA+, 49% if they are black, know someone who has been murdered because of their sexuality. Those who aren’t murdered are discriminated against.” He feels the homophobia has held him back professionally from playing in the Premier Soccer League. He has vowed to be visible and stand up to the discrimination: === Tornado F.C. === Lekoloane joined Athlete Ally, a sports-focused LGBTQ advocacy organization. He left JDR Stars because of the homophobia, but was later recruited by Tornado F.C., another SAFA Second Division team. Doing so, he had to move from Johannesburg to East London, Eastern Cape, a place known for violence against LGBTQ people. The same IRR study showed LGBTQIA+ identifying people “are three times more likely to be attacked in the Eastern Cape than in any other province in the country”. Team manager, Yanga Nyobo, daughter of Tornado’s former chairman, Siphiwo “Mawawa” Nyobo, came out to him as gay, and stated the team strives for diversity. He has become the club’s top goalkeeper. In October 2018 he was nominated for the Feather Awards’ Sports Personality of the Year award for “iconic personalities and achievers who inspire” the LGBTQI communities. == See also == * Homosexuality in modern sports * Homosexuality in association football *LGBTQ rights in South Africa *Timeline of LGBTQ history in South Africa *Pride parades in South Africa *LGBTQ tourism in South Africa *LGBTQ pride flag of South Africa == References == Category:South African soccer players Category:LGBT people from South Africa Category:1990s births Category:Living people Category:Gay sportsmen Category:LGBT sportspeople from South Africa Category:LGBT association football players ","title":"Phuti Lekoloane"},{"id":"61321837","text":"Sagadapata railway station is a railway station on the East Coast Railway network in the state of Odisha, India.

Her father was an Englishman, James H. McQuaid. McQuaid's soprano voice became recognised as notable, and she began to take singing lessons from Elizabeth Mackell in Honolulu and performed in local recitals and plays. In the 1920s Mackell moved to California to teach singing at Mills College, and McQuaid went with her; her goal, she said, was to develop her voice as an accomplishment. She later moved on to study with Marcella Sembrich in New York. McQuaid returned to Honolulu regularly, and performed there in 1922 and 1924. In around 1925 McQuaid went to Europe to study voice further, taking lessons in Italy with Guiseppe Benvenuto and Pietro Mascagni. She performed in operas such as Puccini's La bohème and Madama Butterfly in Milan, Paris and other European cities. In Paris she debuted under the stage name Madame la Princesse Ululani and continued to perform under this name for several seasons, returning to Hawaii in 1933. Following her retirement from singing, McQuaid served the community of Honolulu on the City and County Board of Public Parks and Recreation, and was a member of the Hawaiian Civic Club, the Garden Club and the Outdoor Circle. === Personal life === In 1907, McQuaid married Alexander G. M. Robertson, a politician who later became Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of Hawaii. McQuaid was still a teenager at the time of her marriage, and Robertson was more than twice her age. In 1959, after Robertson's death, she married Jan Jabulka, a newspaper executive, and they lived in Washington D.C. for a number of years. ==References== Category:1890 births Category:1970 deaths Category:20th-century opera singers Category:20th-century women opera singers Category:Native Hawaiian musicians Category:American operatic sopranos ","title":"Ululani McQuaid"},{"id":"61321868","text":"Sakhigopal railway station is a railway station on the East Coast Railway network in the state of Odisha, India.

That vehicle was produced from 1938, being amongst the top-sellers in its first years, but was antiquated when it took the Thames brand. In the era of this model, there was a real need for something advanced in the light vans market segment. Automobiles in that segment were totally unprofitable. Aside from the fact that they were polluting and noisy, they needed skill to be driven. They had a very small turning radius, and when loaded they were dangerously unstable, so their owners were forced to load them with light loads. They were extremely fuel consuming, and this was increased highly with any load. Nicknamed the \\"bricks on wheels\\", their owners even preferred bigger trucks to transport goods, as they were slightly more advanced. This was noted by light van manufacturers (including Ford), but the most of them, instead of making a new model from ground-up, they preferred making models based on the existing ones, with modifications. These models were admittedly better than their predecessors, but they still used old technology and were still far away from what small enterprises wanted. Instead, following the path the other companies did, Ford decided to instead build a model from ground-up. === Thames 400E === The Thames 400E, the first real Thames product That model was the 400E, introduced in November 1957. It was considered a lot more improved from its predecessors. The new car, being a forward-control one, was more comfortable in driving, having much more stability and turning radius. It had not the archaic transverse leaf springs suspension system, although it retained the live rear axle, which however was located in a pair of longitudinal leaf springs. The beam axle had being replaced by an unequal level wishbones system, along with coil springs with telescopic dampers. Additionally, the torque tube was also replaced by an open propeller shaft. It was featuring the same 1703cc engine and the 3-speed gearbox also featured on the Ford Consul Mk2, but with modifications. This engine had larger capacity from the car's competitors, subsequently having better performance from them. One of the features of this van that further differentiated it from its competitors was its chassis. While other vans had unitary construction or monocoque one, the 400E had a ladder chassis design, thus allowing the fitment of customized bodies for various uses. Also, in addition with that, the separate chassis did not need the bodywork to keep it rigid, so the options for custom body was even broadened; The 400E, except the van-bus standard body and the custom bodies by Ford, could be offered just as chassis-front end or as chassis-cowl (with only the lower front panel and the floor pan-engine bay structure), so a custom body could be built inside the chassis. == See also == * Ford Transit *Ford Thames (disambiguation) == References == Category:Ford Motor Company Category:Commercial vehicles Category:Ford Motor Company Marques ","title":"Ford Thames (car)"},{"id":"61321911","text":"Matteo Berrettini and Daniele Bracciali were the defending champions, but chose not to participate this year.

Chapelle: The History Of American Sailing Ships. New York: W. W. Norton & Company, Inc. 1935 He had been trained as a merchant, and as apprentice in that matter had served at sea as supercargo for a few voyages. Having become interested in naval architecture while studying mathematics in school, the experiences of observing ships at sea furthered that interest. It would appear, however, that his designing of ships was more of a hobby, compared to his main trade as a successful merchant. Additionally, he was appointed inspector of saltpeter in Watertown, Massachusetts, around the time the American Revolution started.H. I. Chapelle: The History Of American Sailing Ships. Republished New York: Bonanza Books, 1982, p. 138 John Peck was married to Hannah Jackson, died 1770, with whom he had a son, William, born in 1763.H. I. Chapelle: The History Of American Sailing Ships. Republished New York: Bonanza Books, 1982, p. 142 == Designing ships == Peck's son stated that Peck Sr. never had laid eyes on drawings of ships, but developed his own method to draw plans. The same source admits that these plans later on were close to unintelligible even to Peck Sr. himself, and states that his father only ever owned one book on ship building, although probably not when the first ships of his design and ideas were being built.H. I. Chapelle: The History Of American Sailing Ships. Republished New York: Bonanza Books, 1982, p. 138-139 Most of Peck's ships were built at yards, in Boston, Plymouth and Newburyport. One was built abroad (Maréchal de Cartries), two on his own land, with a few of the others under his direct supervision in a private ship yard in Plymouth.H. I. Chapelle: The History Of American Sailing Ships. Republished New York: Bonanza Books, 1982, p. 139 For the majority, Peck served as naval architect, but he was not a shipwright. This distinguishes him from the other ship-designers of his time, and makes him the first naval architect of the United States, insofar as the term is understood for one who draws ships, but is not a shipwright or -builder as well. In designing ships, Peck appears to have had his own ideas, supported by the building of the Minerva as a means to evaluating them. According to Howard I. Chapelle, he was \\"secretive, egotistical and easily discouraged,\\" but was a \\"very clever designer,\\" his ships being reputed as fast, handy, and able to carry a large press of sail. In 1774, Peck had a ship built to test his own ideas on ship design. Minerva, of about 20 - 30 tons, was exceptionally broad compared to other ships of that time, but proved to be a fast and seaworthy vessel. When he learned that the Massachusetts legislature wanted to built ships-of-war, he submitted plans and proposals and was granted approval. One ship built thus was the brig, or brigantine, Hazard, with sixteen guns, that was constructed in Boston. This ship proved to be a very fast vessel, but her career ended short when she was burned during the Penobscot expedition. Another ship by Peck Sr. was the privateer Belisarius. Being intended for that particular trade, she too was to be fast, a goal achieved according to Joshua Humphreys, who is quoted by Chapelle as saying that she was one of the fastest sailing ships at sea. According to Humphreys, she was spelled Bellesarius and of length, with a breadth of . Belisarius was captured in 1781 by the British after, as Peck claimed, she had been sent out to sea without sweeps and was caught in a calm. She served in the Royal Navy as a 20-gun ship. A better-known Peck design was , the first American ship to arrive at China under the new flag of the equally new nation. Owned by Robert Morris, and others, of Philadelphia, she was built in Boston in 1783. Despite being a rather full ship, she had a reputation for being a fast sailer.H. I. Chapelle: The History Of American Sailing Ships. Republished New York: Bonanza Books, 1982, p. 140 Maréchal de Castries was a ship of 390 tons, built about 1781–1783 in France as an East Indiaman packet. She has the distinction of being the first ship built abroad to American plans.H. I. Chapelle: The History Of American Sailing Ships. Republished New York: Bonanza Books, 1982, p. 141 One ship that was probably, but not with certainty, built to his design was the large privateer Rattlesnake which later in the Royal Navy was known as a fast ship as well. According to Chapelle, she was built in Plymouth while Peck was there as well to supervise the construction of the Continental packet-ketch Mercury. Rattlesnakes lines differ from Belisarius, so it might be possible he was experimenting with the design. Around 1785, possibly earlier, Peck went to Portsmouth, or perhaps Kittery in Maine across the river, where he operated a small shipyard. In 1790, he fell ill and, by doing of his son, went back to Boston where he died in May of the same year. == References == Category:1725 births Category:1790 deaths Category:American naval architects Category:People of Massachusetts in the American Revolution Category:Engineers from Massachusetts ","title":"John Peck (naval architect)"},{"id":"61322073","text":"This is a list of Honorary Fellows of Magdalene College, Cambridge. * Simon Barrington-Ward * Sir John Boardman * Benjamin Britten * Lida Lopes Cardozo Kindersley * Sir David Clary * Dame Carol Ann Duffy * T.

It is historically important both as the progenitor of Hawick RFC; and as the instator of the Hawick and Wilton Sevens tournament - which was the fourth oldest rugby union Sevens tournament in the world. Hawick and Wilton RFC and Hawick RFC were two distinct teams and were rivals for a period. ==History== The Hawick and Wilton rugby club grew out of the associated Hawick and Wilton Cricket Club. In October 1872, members of the cricket club decided that in order to keep fit over the winter they should begin playing football. Both association and rugby union football were experimented with but the rugby format triumphed as it was considered \\"manlier and more congenial to the Border nature than the tamer association game\\". The club was formed on 8 December 1873. ===First match=== Hawick and Wilton played its first official match on 7 February 1874. This was against Langholm RFC; a club heavily influenced by the sons of Tweed manufacturers who were educated across the Scottish border in England. Scottish rugby clubs standardised most of today's rules of rugby union around the 1860s:- by formulating The Green Book in 1858; the Blairgowrie and Rattray Laws of 1865 and the Kilmarnock Rules of 1869.The Scotland Rugby Miscellany. Richard Bath. Vision Publishing. 2007. and these were adopted by almost all of Scotland's early rugby union clubs, including Hawick and Wilton. The club's captain at the time, Robert Michie, got copies of the Scottish rules and had several club meetings to make sure that these were being followed. Langholm RFC however then played the English variant of rugby union which had crossed the border from Carlisle. In the match between Hawick & Wilton and Langholm a dispute broke out regarding what would constitute a goal:- Langholm contending that a goal was scored by the ball going under the bar; Hawick & Wilton insisting that a goal was only scored by the ball going over the bar. Nevertheless, the match was played in good spirit. ==Splinter club== Hawick RFC began as a splinter club from Hawick and Wilton RFC in 1885. Rugby was gaining prominence and instead of being essentially a cricket club with a rugby club arm; the offshoot club focused purely on rugby union. Hawick RFC moved to the nearby Volunteer Park and played in green colours. Both Hawick clubs co-existed for a few years; initially, Hawick and Wilton RFC was the strongest of the two clubs. ==Disbanding of the club== The sole focus of rugby union meant that Hawick RFC gradually attracted the better rugby players. Although Hawick and Wilton RFC remained a strong club and won both the Hawick and Wilton Sevens and the Hawick Sevens in 1889, the members of the Hawick and Wilton club decided to disband the club in 1890 to solely focus on cricket. Hawick and Wilton Cricket Club remains today. ==Hawick and Wilton Sevens== The rugby club began its own Sevens tournament in 1885. It ran to 1889; the club itself folded in Spring 1890 after that season's fixtures and no Sevens tournament was run in 1890. The Hawick Sevens and the Hawick and Wilton Sevens were two distinct tournaments; the Hawick and Wilton Sevens founded first in 1885, the Hawick Sevens founded in 1886. By a quirk of fate in the period that both tournaments co-existed they shared similar winners. The Hawick and Wilton Sevens was the fourth rugby sevens tournament in the world:- behind the Melrose Sevens (1883); the Gala Sevens (April 1884) and the Selkirk Cricket Club Sevens (May 1884). ==Honours== * Hawick and Wilton Sevens ** Champions (1) : 1889 * Hawick Sevens ** Champions (1): 1889 ==References== Category:Scottish rugby union teams Category:Rugby union clubs in the Scottish Borders Category:Hawick Category:Rugby clubs established in 1873 Category:1873 establishments in Scotland Category:Defunct Scottish rugby union clubs Category:Sports clubs disestablished in 1890 Category:1890 disestablishments in Scotland Category:Rugby union clubs disestablished in 1890 ","title":"Hawick and Wilton RFC"},{"id":"61322294","text":"Doris Blake (2 November 1911 - 12 July 1983) was a British gymnast.

Some operated with railmotors, others with older passenger carriages such as the PL series. Between Kyabram and Echuca, the run was operated by a 153hp Walker railmotor hauling three trailer cars, only possible because the line was practically flat.

Trains would be split in the city with one portion unloaded at Footscray Road and the other at the Dynon terminal respectively; the latter loading was then transferred to National Rail freight trains running towards Sydney or Adelaide as required. The first service ran on 12 March 1996, using VQDW \\"Jumbo\\" container flat wagons which could each be loaded with two 40ft containers. The initial contract was worth about $1.6 million per year for five years, with 160,000 tonnes of goods expected to run in the first year (about 800 tonnes per train) of which about two-thirds was domestic and the balance interstate.Network Magazine, published by Australasian Railway Association Inc., May-June 1996 ed, p.30, barcode 9770159730011 In 1999 the contract transferred to Freight Victoria (later Freight Australia), who were purchased by Pacific National in 2004. In 2013 the contract was handed over to QUBE Logisticshttps://railgallery.wongm.com/qube-logistics-maryvale- train/E122_7883.jpg.htmlhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81D-zi0moAwhttp://www.latrobevalleyexpress.com.au/story/1705690/new- freight-gateway/, partially because Pacific National was withdrawing most of its Victorian operations. At the time, Australian Paper was transporting less than 300,000 tonnes of freight yearly by rail, with the balance by road. To cater for an additional proposed 100,000 tonnes per year of loading, QUBE invested in a fleet of 80ft skeletal flat wagons, some of which were deployed on the Maryvale run. http://www.latrobevalleyexpress.com.au/story/1705690/new- freight-gateway/ As of 2019, the most common operation uses two of the four locomotives VL356, VL360, G512 and G515, hauling the equivalent of around 30 40ft containers on about twenty Jumbo-length wagons.https://railgallery.wongm.com/qube-logistics-maryvale-train/ ===School Train=== This name was given to various trains around the state at different times, all on rosters explicitly designed to take children in the regional areas to and from schools. Some operated with railmotors, others with older passenger carriages such as the PL series. ===The Gippslander=== The Gippslander was a named passenger train operated by the Victorian Railways from Melbourne through the Gippsland region to Bairnsdale. Operating along the Gippsland line daily except Sundays it had buffet car facilities provided. The train was named in 1954 to celebrate the electrification of the main line as far Traralgon, but 66 years after the passenger service had commenced along the line. The train was originally hauled by an L class electric locomotive from Melbourne to Traralgon, where an R class steam locomotive took over for the journey to Sale, with the final leg to Bairnsdale hauled by a J class steam locomotive. Steam traction on the service was later replaced by T class diesel locomotives. Throughout the 1970s until the 1980s buffet car Moorabool was a regular on the train. After the decommissioning of the overhead system in the 1980s a variety of diesel locomotives could be seen hauling the train. The Gippslander name continues in use today for V/Line intercity services along the line but no special facilities are provided.Bairnsdale - Melbourne V/Line timetable ===The Snow Train=== This train runs yearly from Melbourne to Traralgon, generally using double R Class locomotives and hauling 10-14 carriages. ==Excursion trains== This section covers a handful of VicRail-era services and the majority of modern-era excursion and themed trips which operate to various destinations without a set route or schedule, and which are not restricted to one of the above regions. ===Explorer trains=== The Explorer trains are a range of heritage tours operating from Melbourne along the remaining broad gauge regional mainlines, providing day or overnight trips using heritage vehicles.

The consists use sleeping and dining carriages drawn from the pools of various heritage operators. On the weekends between the outbound and return trips the carriages are sometimes used to provide local shuttles, such as between Bendigo and Castlemaine. These trips tend to run once or twice per year. ==Other trainsBetter Farming Train=== The Better Farming Train was an agricultural demonstration train which toured Victoria, Australia in the 1920s and 1930s to promote better farming practices.

The concept was promoted by Harold Clapp, Chairman of Commissioners of the Victorian Railways with the city leaders travelling on the train to various parts of the state. It was complemented by the Better Farming Train from 1924. The first train ran to Swan Hill and Mildura in August 1922.\\"Railway Cruising in Australia\\" Railway Gazette 24 August 1934 pages 305-307 A typical consist in 1934 when the train was making its 22nd journey, accommodated 60 passengers with the train made up of a parlor car, three sleeping carriages, a dining car, an office car, a staff car and a van.

In addition to living quarters and normal doctor facilities the carriage included a black, 26ft long corridor with red, yellow and green lights at the far end which was used to test for colour and distance sighting.Yates, T. (2004), What a Journey, pp.155-157 ===The Weedex and Fire Attack trains=== This train ran around the state each year spraying weed- killer along the trackside. This was done to prevent growth of weeds which could later dry out and become a fire hazard. During the fire season some of the train vehicles could be mobilised to form a consist that could spray water lineside, although this was rarely used. ==ReferencesExternal links== *Geelong Flyer at Rail Geelong website ===Photos=== 'Classic' Gippslander: *The Gippslander, electric hauled in 1981 *The Gippslander, loco changeover in 1986 *The Gippslander, diesel hauled in 1988 Category:Named passenger trains of Victoria (Australia) Category:Australian railway-related lists Category:Victoria (Australia)-related lists ","title":"List of named trains in Victoria"},{"id":"61322377","text":"Clara Bimbocci (born 16 April 1919) was an Italian gymnast.

Although the first kindergartens were opened around 1883, it was not until after the revolution that they became generally accepted within the education system. Zapata collaborated with Justo Sierra, with José Vasconcelos and other Secretaries of Public Education to found schools in different parts of the country. By 1928, Zapata called upon Espinosa Berea to establish a kindergarten in the colonia del Valle, which was then a growing population area of Mexico City. She opened Brígida Alfaro on Mier and Pesado streets. She named the school after the teacher, Alfaro, who died in 1925. In this way, she was a pioneer of early childhood education in Mexico. Espinosa Berea served as director until 1949, when she retired. After her retirement, she opened her own kindergarten in the same neighborhood of Valle, at 415 Morena Street. She named the school after herself, \\"Helena Espinosa Berea\\", and directed it until her death, in Mexico City, ca.1960. The Elena Espinosa Berea Garden is named in her honor. == References  Bibliography === * Colonia del Valle.com.mx Archivo fotográfico de la Colonia del Valle. *Diccionario Porrúa.

She holds over 100 US patents and was awarded the ASME Kate Gleason Award. Stern was a child prodigy, who read the Encyclopædia Britannica at the age of 5 and was the youngest ever graduate of Florida Atlantic University at the age of 15. == Early life and education == Stern's father, the scholar Aaron Stern, had been in concentration camps during World War II. He married Stern's mother, Bella, in a ghetto in Warsaw. Aaron Stern suffered from cancer and was treated at the Mayo Clinic because of a request from Albert Einstein. He encouraged his daughter to become an academic, in a technique he referred to as total education immersion. She used flashcards to communicate messages before she could talk, including expressing her age at 11 months old, had mastered the alphabet by the age of two, and played chess by the age of three. She used a homemade abacus to learn mathematics, and was simultaneously taught ethics and compassion for people from different backgrounds. Despite her father not supporting IQ tests, Stern's IQ was said to be 205 at the age of 5. By the age of 6 Stern had read Plato, Freud and Darwin. Stern enrolled in college at the age of twelve, and earned a degree from Miami-Dade Junior College by the age of 15. She earned a bachelor's degree in mathematics at Florida Atlantic University in 1967, and was their youngest ever graduate. She was part of the Florida Atlantic University Chess Team. Stern went on to obtain a master's degree in mathematics at Michigan State University. Her father, who dubbed raising his daughter the Edith project, wrote a book about her upbringing, The Making of a Genius, which was published by Hurricane House Publishers in 1971. He gave a series of lectures at Stanford University about his ideas on education. The pressure of being in the public eye from an early age disrupted her family life. == Career == Stern taught mathematics at Michigan State University before she turned twenty. She joined IBM as an intern in the early 1970s and was eventually promoted to Vice President for research and development. She worked on real-time computing for IBM, and is credited for creating direct dialing and last-call return. Stern worked on health informatics for IBM Watson. She was also involved with a team that won a Technology & Engineering Emmy Award for their work on digital commercials for the Warner Bros. Television network. === Awards and honors === Stern has over 120 US patents. Stern was the first woman to be made a full member of the American Society Of Mechanical Engineers (ASME). In 1998 Stern was named an IBM master inventor, and was elected to the IBM Academy of Technology in 1999. In 2012 Stern was awarded the AMSE Kate Gleason Award for her lifetime of developing new technologies. She was awarded the Florida Atlantic University Talon Award in 2013. In 2015 Stern was listed by Business Insider as one of the Smartest People of All Time. == References == Category:Women mathematicians Category:Jewish women Category:Florida Atlantic University alumni Category:IBM Research computer scientists Category:Michigan State University alumni Category:1952 births Category:Living people ","title":"Edith Stern"},{"id":"61322755","text":"Margaret Duff (born October 19, 1917, date of death unknown) was an American gymnast.

It took place on the same day as other council elections in Wales and England. These were the first elections since the re-organization of local government in Wales. Though the Conservative Party had led the previous council, their representation was decimated at the 1995 election, with Labour winning a majority. The next full elections took place in 1999. ==Overview== These were the first elections held following local government reorganisation, which created new 'super authorities' and would lead to the abolition of South Glamorgan County Council on 1 April 1996. Vale of Glamorgan councillors would act in a shadow capacity to the new Vale of Glamorgan Council, until the following April. 47 council seats across 22 electoral wards were up for election. The ward boundaries for the new authority were based primarily on the previous Vale of Glamorgan Borough Council, though there were some boundary changes. Ewenny transferred to the Vale, with the Llandow ward becoming Llandow/Ewenny. The St Brides Major and Wick communities, was which was previously within the Borough of Ogwr, transferred to become a new Vale ward of St Brides Major, increasing the number of Vale councillors by one. ==Election result== Twenty Conservative councillors had been elected at the 1991 election. At the 1995 election their number was reduced to six, in what the South Wales Echo described as an unanticipated \\"annihilation\\" at the hands of the Labour Party.

She was a consistent performer at eight to ten furlongs who improved through her four seasons on the track. After running unplaced on her only start as a two-year-old she won four races including the Upavon Fillies' Stakes as a three-year-old in 2002. She improved in the following year when she took the Hoppings Stakes, Golden Daffodil Stakes and Blandford Stakes. At the age of five in 2004 she reached her peak with wins in the Pipalong Stakes and Pretty Polly Stakes as well as finishing second in the Champion Stakes. After her retirement from racing she became a successful broodmare. ==Background== Chorist was a chestnut mare with a narrow white blaze and a white sock on her left hind leg bred and owned by the Newmarket based Cheveley Park Stud. She was sent into training with William Haggas at Somerville Lodge stable in Newmarket. Her sire Pivotal was a top class sprinter who won the King's Stand Stakes and the Nunthorpe Stakes in 1996. He went on to become an \\"excellent\\" sire, getting the winners of more than a thousand races across a range of distances including Sariska, Somnus, Farhh, Kyllachy and Immortal Verse. Chorist's dam Choir Mistress was unraced daughter of the Yorkshire Oaks runner-up Blessed Event and produced several other winners as a broodmare. Blessed Event was a daughter of the Preis der Diana winner Friedrichsruh. ==Racing career2001: two-year-old season=== On her first and only appearance as a two-year-old Chorist contested a maiden race over one mile at Redcar Racecourse on 19 October. Starting at odds of 12/1 in a nineteen-runner field she was never in serious contention and finished eleventh, more than twenty-four lengths behind the winner Macadamia. ===2002: three-year-old season=== On 25 April Chorist began her second season in a maiden at Beverley Racecourse when she threw off her jockey Michael Hills and bolted on the way to the start. Despite her misbehaviour she recovered to win the race, taking the lead in the final strides to beat the favourite Thaqib by a neck. After running second in a handicap race at Hamilton Park Racecourse in May Chorist was partnered by Kieren Fallon in a minor race at Newbury Racecourse on 6 June and her recorded her second victory as she led from the start and came home one and three quarter lengths ahead of Silence Is Golden. Sixteen days later the filly started 6/1 favourite under a weight of 119 pounds for the Sandringham Handicap at Royal Ascot and finished second to the John Dunlop- trained Tashawak. On 19 July Chorist won her third race of the season rode her to a three length victory in a handicap race over ten furlongs at Newmarket Racecourse, but in a similar event at Goodwood Racecourse two weeks later she finished sixth after being badly hampered three furlongs from the finish. At Salisbury Racecourse twelve days later the filly was stepped up in class for the Listed Upavon Fillies' Stakes in which she was partnered by the veteran Irish jockey Pat Eddery and was matched against older fillies and mares. Starting the 7/2 favourite in an eight-runner field she took the lead approaching the final furlong and kept on well in the closing stages to win by one and three quarter lengths from Fraulein (later to win the E. P. Taylor Stakes). In September Chorist was sent to Ireland and moved up to Group 3 class for the Blandford Stakes at the Curragh in which she led for most of the way before being overtaken inside the final furlong and beaten half a length by the Ribblesdale Stakes winner Irresistible Jewel. She ended her season in the Group 2 Sun Chariot Stakes at Newmarket on 2 October when she briefly led three furlongs out before fading to finish eighth of the ten runners. ===2003: four-year-old season=== In 2003 Chorist began her season on 14 May at York Racecourse when she was ridden by Eddery and finished second to Zee Zee Top in the Listed Middleton Stakes, beaten a length by the winner. On 28 June the filly was partnered by Fallon in the Hoppings Stakes over ten furlongs at Newcastle Racecourse and started favourite against six opponents headed by the Fillies' Trial Stakes winner Monturani. After taking the lead two furlongs out Chorist held off the challenge of Monturani to win the Listed prize by a head. The Group 3 Golden Daffodil Stakes at Chepstow Racecourse on 25 July saw Chorist start the 9/4 second favourite behind Favourable Terms in four-runner field which was completed by Monturani and the 20/1 outsider Cuddles. Ridden by Darryll Holland, Chorist took the lead from the start and was never seriously challenged, coming home two and a half lengths clear of Favourable Terms. Chorist was moved up in class and distance for the Group 1 Yorkshire Oaks over one and a half miles at York in August in which she disputed the lead for most of the way before fading in the last quarter mile and finishing last of the eight runners behind Islington. At the Curragh on 14 September Chorist was ridden by Holland when she ran for the second time in the Blandford Stakes and started the 11/8 favourite. She led from the start and drew away from her five opponents to win by four lengths from Dossier (Platinum Stakes) with the Lancashire Oaks winner Place Rouge a length and a half away in third place. On 11 October the filly started joint-favourite for the Princess Royal Stakes at Ascot but faded badly in the last quarter mile and came home third behind Itnab and Summitville, beaten eleven lengths by the winner. ===2004: five-year-old season=== Chorist returned as a five-year-old in the Listed Pipalong Stakes over one mile at Pontefract Racecourse on 7 June and started odds-on favourite against six opponents. Ridden by Fallon, she soon went to the front and pulled well clear in the straight before being eased down to win by one and a quarter lengths from Ice Palace. Nineteen days after her victory at Pontefract, Chorist ran for the third time at the Curragh and started the 7/4 second favourite behind Alexander Goldrun in the Pretty Polly Stakes, a race which had been elevated to Group 1 class for the first time. The other four runners were Soldera (Valiant Stakes), Hanami (winner of the race in 2003), Livadiya (runner-up in the Tattersalls Gold Cup) and Ivowen. With Holland in the saddle, Chorist led from the start and held off a strong and persistent challenge from Alexander Goldrun in the last quarter mile to win by half a length, with a gap of six lengths back to Ivowen in third. William Haggas described the performance as \\"terrific\\" while Holland commented \\"the runner-up got up to me but I always knew I had her beat\\". On 31 July Chorist started favourite for the Nassau Stakes at Goodwood but was beaten a short head and a neck by Favourable Terms and Silence Is Golden in a three-way photo finish. In August the mare was sent to France for the first time and finished third to Whortleberry and Pride in the Group 1 Prix Jean Romanet over 2000 metres on very soft ground at Deauville Racecourse. On her final racecourse appearance Chorist was matched against male opposition in the Champion Stakes at Newmarket on 16 October and started a 20/1 outsider in an eleven-runner field. She produced arguably the best performance of her track career as she went to the front three furlongs out before being overtaken and beaten into second by Haafhd with Azamour, Refuse To Bend, Doyen and Lucky Story finishing behind. ==Breeding record== At the end of her racing career, Chorist returned to the Cheveley Park Stud to become a broodmare. She produced at least even foals and four winners: *Kings Chorister, a chestnut colt (later gelded), foaled in 2006, sired by King's Best. Won one race on the flat and six National Hunt races. *Church Melody, bay filly, 2007, by Oasis Dream. Unraced. *Figaro, chestnut colt (gelded), 2008, by Medicean.

That same year, the Representative Squadron of the President of Poland founded to serve the leadership of the Provisional Government of National Unity. It followed the customs of Polish-Lithuanian light cavalry. It was disbanded the following July due to the rise of the creation People's Republic of Poland and the usurpation of power by the Polish United Workers' Party. After the Fall of Nations and the Soviet Union between 1989-1991, there was hope from civil society and military historians that the military would expand to allow Polish cavalry units once again. After a public effort by enthusiasts, including negotiations between the Ministry of National Defense and the Association of Horse Squadrons on 12 November 1996, a Representative Squadron under the auspices of the Land Forces was raised in 2000.https://preprwp.wp.mil.pl/pl/pages/pododdzia-kawaleryjski-2018-04-12-o/ Originally, it was part of the 2nd Mińsk Mazowiecki Brigade of Territorial Defense Forces.

It was commissioned by the National Portrait Gallery in London following Diana's engagement to Charles, Prince of Wales in February 1981 while the gallery was under the directorship of John Hayes. It presently hangs as part of the National Portrait Gallery's permanent collection. The painting was seen by an estimated 100,000 visitors to the gallery in the time between its unveiling and the wedding of Prince Charles and Lady Diana Spencer three days later. ==Description== The painting consists of acrylic paint on canvas and measures 178 x 178 cm. The portrait depicts Diana sitting on a chair in the Yellow Drawing room of Buckingham Palace dressed in a trouser suit and an open necked blouse. It was painted at the time of Diana's engagement to Charles, Prince of Wales and commissioned to accompany the National Portrait Gallery's painting of Charles which had been completed by Organ in 1980. The frame of the portrait is a large 'hockey frame' finished in English gold leaf that cost £431.25. It was made by Michael Carleton and is identical to the frame for the portrait of Prince Charles. ==1981 attack== In August 1981 the portrait was vandalized by Paul Salmon, a 20-year-old man from Northern Ireland. The portrait was slashed down the middle of the canvas in the attack. Portraits of Queen Elizabeth and Prince Charles were subsequently temporarily removed from public display. The painting was restored and put back on public display behind a plastic covering. Salmon stepped over a rope and cut the painting without saying anything, though guards at the gallery later claimed that he said \\"I did it for Ireland\\". An eyewitness said that \\"The whole of the middle was ripped out. He was still hanging onto the canvas when the security guards grabbed him\\". After being held in custody after being denied bail Salmon pled guilty to a charge of causing criminal damage and was sentenced to 6 months in prison and ordered to pay $1,900 towards the painting's restoration. The trustee of the National Portrait Gallery Lord Kenyon said of the damage that \\"There is a horizontal slash across the picture and a vertical cut which runs a long way from head to foot. But today, techniques of art restoration are very sophisticated\\" Organ commented that he was \\"...just very sad and very disillusioned by what has happened...I don't understand it\\". ==Reception== John Cooper writing in 2009 described the portrait as \\"striking an informal pose within a tight geometric setting\\" and that it is \\"relatively informal and utterly devoid of royal regalia\\". Officials from the National Portrait Gallery hailed the painting as a \\"portrait of the '80s\\" at its unveiling. Contemporary commentary focused on the depiction of Diana in trousers, then a novelty for a female member of the British royal family. In his book Eyewitnessing: The Uses of Images as Historical Evidence, Peter Burke describes the crossing of Diana's legs as taken as 'normal' in contrast to the shocked reaction of people to Thomas Gainsborough's 1760 portrait of the musician and singer Anne Ford. In his entry for the 2002 book Great Britons: The Great Debate, John Cooper wrote of the portrait that \\"In different circumstances she would have grown older and more regal, the subject of dozens of dignified, official portrait paintings. The National Portrait Gallery would have collected a series of canvases milestoning her advancing years...Bryan Organ's portrait stands alone, and now seems to symbolise the world from which she escaped, the tight frame of the background prophetically constricting.\\" Following Diana's death in 1997 Vanessa Thorpe wrote in The Independent that \\"This week, Organ's picture of the teenage bride-to-be has never looked more pathetic, yet it is perhaps more poignant still to contemplate the details of a portrait that will now never be\\". Niall MacMonagle writing in 2014 in the Irish Independent wrote that \\"She was \\"Shy Di\\", still a teenager, when this portrait, by Bryan Organ, was painted. Diana...must have wondered what she was letting herself in for, what was all before her. And she didn't know the half of it. The plumpish cheeks, the big hair, the crossed legs in tailored trousers, the sideways and elegant chair, the ornate classical backdrop combine the traditional and contemporary...Now we know it all, the whole sorry mess. The disappointments, the broken hearts, the affairs. In Roman mythology Diana was the virgin goddess of hunting; in the end, this Diana, modern and unfortunate, was the one hunted and hounded. A victim of circumstance, a prisoner in a gilded cage. She broke free but she never managed to escape.\\" ==References== Category:1981 paintings Category:Vandalized works of art in the United Kingdom Category:Portraits of the British Royal Family Category:Cultural depictions of Diana, Princess of Wales Category:Portraits of women ","title":"Diana, Princess of Wales (Bryan Organ portrait)"},{"id":"61323233","text":"The 2019 European Mountain Bike Championships was the 29th holding of the European Mountain Bike Championships, an annual mountain biking competition organized by the Union Européenne de Cyclisme (UEC).

Following the death of the Islamic prophet Muhammad, Shurahbil and his father loyally served the nascent Medina-based Muslim state and fought with distinction during the Ridda wars against the Arabian tribes that had defected from Medina.Friedmann 1992, pp. 17–18. As a result, their star rose in Medina at the expense of al-Ash'ath ibn Qays, a rival Kindite chief who fought against the Muslims in the Ridda and repented following his defeat and capture in Yemen.Friedmann 1992, p. 18. While in the mid to late 630s, Simt played a role in the Muslim conquest of Syria, Shurahbil fought in the Muslim conquest of Iraq. The overall Muslim commander of the Iraqi front, Sa'd ibn Abi Waqqas, appointed the young Shurahbil as commander of the Muslim army's left wing at the decisive Battle of al-Qadisiyya in 636.Friedmann 1992, p. 17. Following the victory over the Sasanians in Iraq, Shurahbil was appointed by Sa'd the governor of the Sasanian capital at Ctesiphon (al-Mada'in in Arabic).Friedmann 1992, p. 144. He settled in the newly-established Arab garrison town of Kufa, but emerging as the weaker Kindite against al-Ash'ath in the rivalry for the leadership of the tribe in the city, he moved to join his father in Homs. After moving to Syria, he became a committed partisan of its governor Mu'awiya ibn Abi Sufyan during the latter's conflict with the Kufa-based Caliph Ali () in the First Muslim Civil War. He served as one of Mu'awiya's envoys to Ali in June 657, a month before the Battle of Siffin between the two sides, which ended in a stalemate.Hawting 1996, pp. 24–25. During Mu'awiya's caliphate (661–680) he was a member of the caliph's inner circle, though at point he was surpassed in influence with the Umayyads by his Syrian Kindite rival, Husayn ibn Numayr al- Sakuni. Indeed, there is no record of Shurahbil or his family until the revolt of Yazid ibn al-Muhallab in Iraq in 720 when an unnamed son of Shurahbil was taken prisoner and executed by the rebels and then again during the Third Muslim Civil War in 744, during which a great-grandson of Shurahbil, Simt ibn Thabit ibn Yazid joined his erstwhile rival Mu'awiya ibn Yazid, a grandson of Husayn ibn Numayr, in opposition to Caliph Yazid III. Simt ibn Thabit was later crucified for leading a revolt in Homs against Caliph Marwan II (). The descendants of Shurahbil or rather, his father, temporarily took over Homs during the Fourth Muslim Civil War in the early 9th century.Crone 1980, p. 102. ==ReferencesBibliography== * * * Category:7th-century Arabs Category:7th-century Umayyad people Category:Generals of the Rashidun Caliphate Category:Kinda Category:People from Homs Category:People of the First Fitna Category:People of the Muslim conquest of Persia Category:Ridda wars ","title":"Shurahbil ibn Simt"},{"id":"61323384","text":"Mosha Gaolaolwe (born 25 December 1993) is a Motswana footballer playing as a centreback for National First Division side TS Galaxy.

This method involves the use of essential oils, a growth medium, a selection of bacterial or cultures and an incubator. ==Method== In this microbiological procedure, theoretically, the antibacterial or anti-fungal activity of the volatile oils from a chosen plant may be tested against a selection of gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria or a species of fungi. The growth of the bacteria or fungi are then monitored on a timely basis to measure the bacteriostatic or anti-fungal activity of the volatile oils.

Fast Screening method for assessment of antimicrobial activity of essential oilsin vapour phase. Food Research International47, 161 –165 This method was developed on the premise that essential oil vapours exert critical biological activity. These methods offer rapid screening protocols for the antimicrobial assessment of plant essential oils. It has been suggested that essential oils in the vapour phase possess the greatest degree of antimicrobial activity since the active constituents are highly volatile in nature and thus, the vapour is therefore the contributing attribute for its biological activity. . Each individual constituent has differing volatility, therefore when the mixtures are introduced into a free, non-saturated state in a closed micro-environment; the volatile constituents begin to disperse at differing rates in the vapour phase within the headspace according to their degree of volatility until they reach equilibrium.Kloucek, P., Smid, J., Frankova, A., Kokoska, L., Valterova, I., Pavela, R. (2012). Fast Screening method for assessment of antimicrobial activity of essential oils in vapour phase. Food Research International47, 161 –165 Preliminary research involving the essential oils of citronella yielded promising results when tested against a selection of Gram-positive bacteria and Gram-negative bacteria. The use of such extracts can be explored especially in the development of cost-effective treatments of respiratory illness, specifically of those caused by bacterial or fungal infection. Preliminary tests exhibit complete inhibition of the growth of certain bacterial strains. ==Anti-fungal activity== Kirby-Bauer testing: White wafers containing antibiotics shown on plate of bacteria. Circles of poor bacterial growth surround some wafers, indicating susceptibility to the antibiotic In a separate research, the micro-atmosphere method was used to investigate the anti-fungal efficacy of the essential oils from the cinnamon, a plant belonging to the genus Cinnamomum. The procedure was employed to ensure that the active films, the material containing the active compound, does not come into direct contact to the tested fungal suspension.Balaguer et al., 2013. M.P. Balaguer, G. Lopez-Carballo, R. Catala, R. Gavara, P. Hernandez-Munoz Anti-fungal properties of gliadin films incorporating cinnamaldehyde and application in active food packaging of bread and cheese spread foodstuffs International Journal of Food Microbiology, 166 (2013), pp. 369-37 The micro- atmosphere method was performed, in order to evaluate the indirect effects of active films against P. digitatum. Addition of 0.5% cinnamon essential oil, led to 12% inhibition of fungal growth. Higher anti-fungal effects were obtained by adding higher amounts of the essential oil. An inhibition of fungal growth between 28% and 50% were observed for the films incorporated with 1.5% and 3% essential oil, respectively. In this particular research, the potential anti-fungal agent was subjected to both disk diffusion test and the micro-atmosphere method for comparison and to get an idea of how the active compound may be utilized. The active compound exhibited higher anti-fungal effects in the disc diffusion test compared to the micro-atmosphere assays. This could be attributed to the fact that in the disc diffusion test, both direct contact and migration of active compounds from the film to the outside induced the observed antimicrobial effects. On the other hand, only the migration of the volatile compounds to the headspace, may cause the anti- fungal effect in the micro-atmosphere method.Fasihi et al., 2019.

It situated on the right bank of the river Aragvi, on the north of Mtskheta. In ancient time the fortress was called ″Belti″. Vakhushti Bagrationi calls it ″Beltistsikhe″. The fortress was built to protect Mtskheta and Tbilisi from the north, from the side of the Greater Caucasus Range.Джанберидзе Н., Мачабели К. (1981) Тбилиси. Мцхета. Москва: Искусство, 255 c. (In Russian) The fortress naturally fits into the landscape, built to imitate a continuation of the mountain.Закарая, П. (1983) Памятники Восточной Грузии. Искусство, Москва, 376 с. (In Russian) The walls, over 2 m thick, are built with almost equal-size stones. The fortress has two levels: citadel and the lower courtyard. The citadel has a triangular shape. Three towers were erected at each corner of the triangle. The eastern tower originally had square shape, but it was destroyed and rebuilt in 18th century. The southwestern tower was the largest and also served as a donjon. It has four levels with embrasures, split by wooden ceilings. The walls of the lower courtyard are largely in ruins, but the fortress obviously had a multifaceted shape, following the complicated terrain. Its only tower was built from the east side to protect from the former road side. A part of the tower wall still remains. In the neighborhood of Bebris Tsikhe, archeological layers of ancient and feudal periods are identified. There is no written document about the origin of the fortess'es name. A legend about the Bebris Tsikhe says that once this territory belonged to a prince called Simon, who built the fortress in a narrow part of the ravine and put guards inside it. He had a pretty and kind daughter – Makrine, and a cruel and heartless son Mamuka. After death of the father, Mamuka imposed an enormous tax on peasants. Who was not able to pay a tax was tortured cruelly by Mamuka. In vain begged kind Makrine her brother to mercy the peasants. The cruel brother didn't have a pity for her and imprisoned her in a tower. Once, while peasants were making watery meal in a huge saucepan, unexpectedly two crows came over, flew into the saucepan and were boiled in it. The peasants pored the meal away. When Mamuka learned about it he got very angry and was about to whip them, but in this very moment, from the saucepan emerged snakes and twisted around him. Desperate Mamuka prayed God: ″Just save me and I’ll build a church in your name.″ Makrine watched her brother’s troubles from the window, who also prayed to God to save him. Merciful God accepted prayers and set Mamuka free from snakes. Saved Mamuka gave away his fortune, became a monk and began to collect donation for a church construction. His sister Makrina became a nun in Mtskheta. Many years passed, Makrine died, on her funeral came a white-beard old man, gave a kiss to the deceased and said: ″My sister, we kept our promise″. As soon as he pronounced those words he went on knees and gave his soul to the God. Since that the fortress is called ″Bebris Tsikhe″ (Fortress of an old man). The road was originally passing by the east side of the fortress, along the river bank. In the 19th century a new road was cut through the mountain, now passing by the west side of Bebristsikhe. In 2004, Bebris Tsikhe was indicated as a National Cultural Monuments of Georgia. ==References Literature == * Bebris tsikhe// Georgia:encyclopedia -Tbilisi.,1997. pg. 386 * Bebris tsikhe – Beltis tsikhe // description of Georgian historical and cultural monuments -Tbilisi., 1990, pg. 242 *Закарая, П.

It became the engineer component of the 44th (Home Counties) Division of the Territorial Force, but its units saw action with Regular Army formations on the Western Front, at Salonika and in Italy during World War I, and in North Russia and Turkey after the war ended. During World War II its units were in the Battle of France and at Alamein, in Sicily, on D Day and the subsequent campaign in North West Europe, including the Rhine crossing. Detached companies fought in Tunisia, Italy, and Burma, where one was involved in the decisive Battle of Kohima and the assault crossing of the Irrawaddy. The unit continued in the postwar Territorial Army until 1967. ==Volunteer Force== The enthusiasm for the Volunteer movement following an invasion scare in 1859 saw the creation of many Rifle, Artillery and Engineer Volunteer units composed of part-time soldiers eager to supplement the Regular British Army in time of need.Beckett.Spiers, pp. 163–168. However, it was not until 1890 that an Engineer Volunteer Corps (EVC) was raised in Sussex. Its instigator was George Frederick Chambers, a barrister from Eastbourne, with the support of the Commanding Royal Engineer (CRE) for the South-East District and against opposition from local dignitaries and the 2nd Sussex Artillery Volunteers, who feared competition for recruits in the town. Towards the end of 1889 Chambers called a meeting to get the minimum 60 volunteers required, obtaining 105 names including a complete fife and drum band. The requisition was sent to the War Office, and the 1st Sussex Engineer Volunteer Corps officially came into existence in Eastbourne on 24 May 1890. Initially the company headquarters (HQ) was at Eastbourne Redoubt, then from April 1891 at 38 Commercial Road, Eastbourne. It was attached for administrative purposes to the 1st Middlesex EVC. It formed two additional companies in 1892, B at Newhaven and C at Seaford. From 1892 it was attached to the 1st Hampshire Engineers EVC and then became an independent unit from May 1895.Westlake, p. 13.Lord & Watson, pp. 150–154.Monthly Army List, various dates.Morling, pp. 8–9. Frederick Savage, headmaster of Seaford College, was commissioned as a Captain in the 1st Sussex EVC in 1891 and formed a Cadet Corps at the school that year. In July 1895 he was promoted to Major in command of the 1st Sussex EVC. Further cadet companies were formed at University and St Leonards Collegiate Schools, Hastings, in 1906 and 1907 respectively.Sussex Express, 19 February 2004. D Company of the 1st Sussex EVC was formed at Chalvington in 1896, but attempts the following year to raise three or four more companies were unsuccessful. ===South Africa=== After Black Week in December 1899, the Volunteers were invited to send active service units to assist the Regulars in the Second Boer War. From 70 volunteers, the 1st Sussex Engineers selected its detachment of one officer, one sergeant and 25 other ranks to work with the Royal Engineers (RE).Morling, pp. 13–18.C.M. Watson, pp. 42–43. They were sworn in on 18 January 1900, underwent training at the RE depot at Chatham, Kent, and embarked at Southampton aboard the Tintagel Castle with similar sections from 11 other EVCs on 10 March. The ship arrived at Cape Town on 31 March where the first duty for the sappers was to unload balloons and gas cylinders for the RE Balloon Section. The Sussex Section was then given its assignment, which was to 23rd Field Company, RE, at Ladysmith. This entailed re-embarking and sailing to Durban, then proceeding by rail via Pietermaritzburg. The section spent three weeks repairing siege damage at Ladysmith, then with 23rd Fd Co it joined 4th Division's advance towards Newcastle. The main job for the sappers was to repair drifts (fords) so that the transport and artillery could cross the numerous rivers, but providing water supplies for the horses was also important. During the four-day Battle of Belfast the sappers were involved in digging trenches and gun positions. The force then drove the Boers out of Lydenburg into the Mauchsberg Mountains, where the sappers were employed to get the guns forward from ridge to ridge. After reaching Kruger Post, the column returned to Lydenburg, where the sappers built a six-span square timber bridge over the Crocodile River, sangars and water supplies. The Sussex Section was now ordered to return to England, so it was marched back to Machadorp (the only unit on foot in a mounted column) and then went by train to Pretoria. There it assisted 9th Fd Co in laying a pipeline and carried out guards and patrols. After three weeks at Pretoria it was obvious that the Boers were not defeated, and the orders to return home were cancelled. The Sussex Section rejoined 23rd Fd Co at Middelburg, where it was chiefly engaged in manufacturing and erecting corrugated iron blockhouses, but also putting Middelburg Town Hall into a state of defence. Three Sussex sappers died of Enteric fever while at Middelburg, and another four were evacuated home with sickness before the end of the section's term of service. At the end of March 1901 the first sections of Volunteer sappers were ordered to return home at the completion of their year's service. The Sussex section travelled by train to Durban, then by ship to Cape Town, where the survivors embarked on the St Andrew for Southampton. Before they left Cape Town, the second Sussex Section arrived on the Saxon from England, having been raised (from the enlarged 1st Sussex Engineers) in March. The Boers having adopted prolonged Guerrilla warfare, the second section saw less movement than the first, being chiefly engaged with 9th Fd Co at Naampoort on the blockhouse system. After the end of its year's service the second section embarked on the Roslin Castle at Cape Town on 29 May 1902 and reached Southampton on 18 June.Morling, p. 17. The wave of patriotism at the time of the Boer War led to the formation of eight more companies for the 1st Sussex Engineers in 1901: E, F and G at Brighton, H and J at Eastbourne, K at Tonbridge in Kent, L and M at Hastings. Shortly afterwards the HQ moved to 40 Junction Road, Eastbourne, with another drill station at Seaford.Eastbourne at Drill Hall Project.Seaford at Drill Hall Project. ==Territorial Force== When the Volunteers were subsumed into the new Territorial Force (TF) under the Haldane Reforms of 1908,Beckett, pp. 247–253.Dunlop, Chapter 14.Spiers, Chapter 10. the 1st Sussex EVC provided the divisional engineers for the TF's Home Counties Division with the following organisation:London Gazette, 20 March 1908.Becke, Pt 2a, pp. 49–54.Morling, 'The Family Tree' (front endpapers).Morling, pp. 19, 249.Nalder, p. 598.Watson & Rinaldi, p. 11.

The 1st Sussex also provided (from B & C Companies) the Sussex Fortress Royal Engineers, a single Works Company based at the Drill Hall, Queen's Hall, Broad Street, Seaford,Watson & Rinaldi, p. 13. while K Company at Tonbridge formed the basis for the Kent Fortress Royal Engineers. All three cadet corps continued to be affiliated to the Home Counties Divisional Engineers. The Telegraph Company was redesignated a Signals Company in 1911. ==World War IMobilisation=== The Home Counties Division was on its annual training on Salisbury Plain when mobilisation orders were received on 4 August 1914, and its units returned to their HQs. The Home Counties Divisional RE was embodied on 5 August 1914 under Lt-Col W.F. Cheesewright, who had been its Commander, RE, (CRE) since 12 July 1913. It went to its war station of Dover to work on defences, and then on 24 August to the Home Counties Division's concentration area around Canterbury.Morling, pp. 24–30. Shortly after the outbreak of war, TF units were invited to volunteer for overseas service. Early in September battalions of the Home Counties Division began to relieve Regular units at Gibraltar, then in October the infantry and artillery of the whole division embarked for garrison service in India. Although it did later receive a number (44th), the Home Counties Division never operated as a formation during the war: its units remained scattered in colonial garrisons or were attached to Indian divisions. The Divisional RE went to France on 21 December 1914 as GHQ Troops for the British Expeditionary Force (BEF) on the Western Front and were later assigned as individual companies to Regular divisions.44 Division at Long, Long Trail.Morling, pp. 22–23.Watson & Rinaldi, p. 34. Meanwhile, the formation of a reserve or 2nd Line unit was authorised for each 1st Line unit where 60 per cent or more of the men had volunteered for Overseas Service. The titles of these 2nd Line units would be the same as the original, but distinguished by a '2/' prefix. In this way duplicate battalions, brigades and divisions were created, mirroring those TF formations being sent overseas. The 2nd Home Counties Division was one of the first organised, as soon as the 1st Line had departed for India. Later 3rd Line units were formed to supply drafts to the 1st and 2nd Lines.Becke, Pt 2b, p. 6.Becke, Pt 2b, pp. 75–82.Morling, pp. 36–37. ===1/1st Home Counties Field Company=== On 2 February 1915 the 1/1st Home Counties Fd Co was transferred from GHQ Troops at Racquenham to join 8th Division in the Lys sector. This division had been formed in the autumn of 1914 from Regular units returned from colonial garrisons, including two Regular RE companies. The decision had now been made to give each infantry division a third RE company, so that one could work with each of the brigades. 1/1st HC Field Co served with 8th Division on the Western Front throughout the rest of the war.Becke, Pt 1, pp. 89–95.8 Division at Long, Long Trail.Watson & Rinaldi, p. 28.Watson & Rinaldi, p. 65. The company's first duties were to build breastworks rather than trenches in the waterlogged front line and to make extemporised mortars and Jam tin grenades. By the end of the month the division went into training for the planned Battle of Neuve Chapelle and the RE prepared depots of battle stores including trench bridges and ladders. 1/1st Home Counties Fd Co built a Pontoon bridge over the Lys to carry the extra traffic. The attack on 10–13 March advanced the line by about . The company then carried out preparations for further attacks at Fromelles and at Aubers Ridge, including provision of splinter-proof shelters, footbridges, mine galleries, gun emplacements, roads and approach trenches. The division's attack at Rouge Bancs was a costly failure. 8th Division was then moved north to a quieter sector. In September it prepared a limited attack at Bois-Grenier as a diversion from the main Battle of Loos. Once again 1/1st (HC) Fd Co built a pontoon bridge across the Lys to aid traffic flow. Although none of the enemy positions was held at the end of the day's fighting, the company wired and consolidated a new shorter defence line in No man's land.Boraston & Bax, pp. 46–53. Somme Preparations for the 'Big Push' (the Battle of the Somme) began in April 1916, with the RE Sapping towards the enemy positions, preparing dugouts and assembly positions, and making gaps in the wire. 1/1st Home Counties Fd Co was not engaged in 8th Division's disastrous attack on the Ovillers Spur on the First day on the Somme (1 July), but was sent up in the evening to help hold the line. The sappers spent the night bringing in wounded, of whom there were over 3000 across the division's front.Edmonds, 1916, Vol I, p. 391. Royal Engineers laying a Pontoon bridge during the German retreat, March 1917. After this disaster 8th Division was withdrawn, and 1/1st HC Fd Co was put to work on defences at Loos and in front of the Hohenzollern Redoubt. Later in July it rejoined 8th Division in the Ginchy sector. The division returned to the Somme for the Battle of Le Transloy (23–30 October), with the sappers preparing additional communication trenches before the attack. The company went in with the attack, which was only partly successful. The company spent the winter building Nissen huts and carrying out improvements to trenches and wire. It was redesignated 490th (Home Counties) Field Company when the TF RE companies were numbered on 1 February 1917.Watson & Rinaldi, p. 61. 8th Division carried out an attack at Bouchavesnes on 4 March, and then followed up the German Retreat to the Hindenburg Line (Operation Alberich) (14 March – 5 April). Ypres In May the division went into reserve to prepare for the Third Ypres Offensive, the RE work including burying signal cables, building roads, forming dumps of stores, and assisting an RE Tunnelling Company building deep dugouts. The division made a daylight raid on Bellewaarde Farm on 24 July, and then participated in the Battle of Pilckem Ridge that opened the offensive on 31 July. It was then relieved on 2 August to refit and train for a renewed attack to complete the capture of the first objectives. On the night of 10 August, just before going back into the line, Divisional HQ (DHQ) suffered an air raid, and a bomb killed the officer commanding 490th (HC) Fd Co, Maj C.C. Bryan, and wounded two other officers and six other ranks. Major D.L. Herbert took over command of the company.Boraston & Bax, pp. 141–142. Zero hour for the Battle of Langemarck was 04.45 on 16 August, and 490th (HC) Fd Co laid out tapes to help the men of 25th Bde to find their forming-up positions in the mud and craters in the dark. The infantry crossed the Hanebeek stream and began dealing with enemy pillboxes. But the divisions on either flank were unable to advance as far, and 8th Division was left in front with its flanks exposed. Dangerous German counter-attacks began to come in, and by nightfall the division was practically back on its starting positions.Boraston & Bax, pp. 142–153.Edmonds, 1917, Vol II, pp. 192–194. The division spent the rest of the offensive making demonstrations without actually attacking. The sappers spent the winter in Ypres. Spring Offensive The German Spring Offensive opened on 21 March 1918. 8th Division had just come out of the line for rest, but after the initial German breakthrough it was sent up on 23 March to hold the Somme crossings, blowing up the bridges after the retreating troops had crossed back over them. The divisional frontage was very wide, and there were no reserves, so when 25th Bde was hard pressed the only troops to hand were 490th (HC) Fd Co. The sappers were ordered to take up position across the Morchain–Pertain road to act as a rallying point. After further severe fighting, 25th Bde fell back to hold this position in the afternoon. However, the river line had been penetrated elsewhere, and by 26 March the division was fighting at Rosières. After a week's fighting retreat it was relieved at Moreuil Wood on 2 April.Blaxland, pp. 64, 78, 86.Boraston & Bax, pp. 178–181. 8th Division was next in action at Villers-Bretonneux on 24–25 April, when 490th (HC) Fd Co was in action, losing numerous casualties to Mustard Gas. The division was then moved south, where it faced another heavy German attack and consequent retreat at the Aisne (27 May – 6 June). The exhausted division was then withdrawn into reserve, with the sappers at St Quentin and Le Treport. Hundred Days 8th Division entered the Allied Hundred Days Offensive at the Battle of the Scarpe (26–30 August). It followed up by forcing the Rouvroy–Fresnes Line (7–8 October). After the attack on the Drocourt-Quéant Switch Line on 4 October the Germans in this sector suddenly retreated and 8th Division participated in the capture of Douai on 17 October. On 30 October, 8th Division was pursuing the defeated Germans and sent 23rd Brigade to establish a bridgehead across the Scheldt opposite Odomez. 490th (HC) Field Co constructed a light cylinder bridge by 21.00 that evening. but it collapsed, and was not fully repaired until 04.00 the following morning, so the lead battalion crossed by rafts. However, it came under heavy attack on 31 October and was ordered to withdraw. Although the bridge was again broken, all the wounded were got away.Edmonds & Maxwell-Hyslop, 1918, Vol V, p. 397. On 4–5 November the division concentrated round Marchiennes, where the sappers were engaged in improving roads and canal and river crossings. When the Armistice with Germany came into effect at 11.00 on 11 November, 8th Division was 3–4 miles NNE of Mons. On 16 November it was relieved and went back to Tournai, then moved to the Ath–Enghien area by 18 December. Here demobilisation began, and the cadre of 490th (HC) Fd Co returned to England in May 1919 after the division was disbanded. ===1/2nd Home Counties Field Company=== On 2 February 1915 the 1/2nd Home Counties Fd Co was transferred from GHQ Troops at Blendiques to join 5th Division at Bailleul. This Regular division was part of the original BEF that had gone to France in 1914; it was now given 1/2nd HC as a third field company, which served with it for the rest of the war. Becke, Pt 1, pp. 65–71.5 Division at Long, Long Trail.Morling, pp. 31–34. Hill 60 The company was at work in the line as soon as it arrived, suffering casualties at Messines Ridge and at Hill 60, where it assisted in the mining operations preceding its capture on 17 April. 5th Division was then engaged during the German offensives (the Second Battle of Ypres) including the battles of Gravenstafel Ridge (23 April) and St Julien (24 April – 1 May). The division was not involved in any major actions for the next year, but suffered a steady trickle of casualties as it held the line in the Ypres sector from May to July, around Bray from August 1915 to February 1916, and the Arras front from March to July 1916. Somme 5th Division was moved south to join in the Somme Offensive and was engaged in the Attacks on High Wood (20 July – 1 August). During these actions the RE were engaged in building positions round Longueval and sections were attached to the infantry for each advance, in which they acted as riflemen as well as sappers.Hussey & Inman, p. 117. The division then continued in the September battles, in all of which the company suffered casualties, at Guillemont (3–6 September), Flers–Courcelette (18–22 September) and at Morval (25–26 September). 5th Division was stationed in the Béthune sector from October 1916 to March 1917. On 1 February 1917, 1/2nd HC Fd Co was designated as 491st (Home Counties) Field Company. The division was moved into position on 7 April to take part in the Battle of Vimy Ridge (9–14 April). After the successful advance, the RE made plank roads over the shell holes. The Germans knew the lost positions intimately, and were able to shell the new artillery positions accurately, so the divisional RE built deeper dugouts for the gunners and built dummy ammunition dumps to divert enemy fire.Hussey & Inman, pp. 156–157. The division then took part in the attack on La Coulotte (23 April), the Third Battle of the Scarpe (3–4 May), and the Capture of Oppy Wood (28 June). Ypres 490th (HC) Field Company was used for road building before the Third Ypres Offensive. 5th Division took part in several of the battles that autumn: Polygon Wood (1–3 October), where it was subjected to mustard gas; the advance along the Reutelbeck during the Battle of Broodseinde (4 October); the first attack on Poelcappelle on 9 October,;the second attack on Polderhoek (26 October); and the Second Battle of Passchendaele (26 October – 10 November), including the third attack on Polderhoek on 6 November. Italy On 23 November the division was warned that it was to be moved to the Italian Front. It began entraining on 27 November and by 20 December it had concentrated to the east of the River Brenta, not far from Padua. The divisional RE built bridges over the Brenta. 5th Division later took over part of the line along the River Piave on 27 January 1918 and the RE worked to improve these positions until the division was relieved on 18 March. During this period the sappers were involved in bridgebuilding and in revetting the trenches dug into shingly ground.Hussey & Inman, pp. 196, 202. Spring Offensive On 24 March 5th Division was warned to return to the Western Front, where the German Spring Offensive had been launched. It began entraining on 1 April and completed its concentration on 9 April between Doullens and Frévent, just in time for the Battle of the Lys. It took part in the Battle of Hazebrouck, including the Defence of the Nieppe Forest (12–15 April). After the fighting died down the division held the forest, and the divisional RE extended a Decauville Railway to bring up supplies, repairing it after frequent breaks due to enemy shelling.Hussey & Inman, p. 216. On 28 June, in its first offensive operation since the Great Retreat, the division gained space clear of the forest and pushed patrols and outposts forward (the Action at La Becque, Operation Borderland). Then under cover of darkness the divisional RE went forward to destroy the bridges over La Plate Becque in front of the outposts. Later they were used to strengthen various HQ dugouts.Blaxland, p. 149.Hussey & Inman, pp. 224–225. Hundred Days Shortly after the start of the Allied Hundred Days Offensive 5th Division was moved into the Authie–Doullens area. It took part in the Second Battle of Albert (21–23 August) and continued advancing thereafter. The Second Battle of Bapaume followed from 31 August to 3 September. The division followed up to the Hindenburg Line, attacking the outposts in the Battle of Épehy (18 September) when it captured 'African Trench'. It then played a part in breaching the Hindenburg Line at the Battle of the Canal du Nord (27 September – 1 October) and the subsequent pursuit to the River Selle, followed by the Battle of the Selle (17–23 October). From 5 November the division slowly fought its way through the Forêt de Mormal, crossed the Sambre and advanced across the Maubeuge–Avesnes road, where it was relieved on 10 November. After the Armistice it was in reserve near Le Quesnoy. Between 13 and 21 December it moved into Belgium and was cantoned in villages between Namur and Wavre. It remained in these billets until demobilisation began in February 1919. The last troops left for England on 10 May. ===1st Home Counties Signal Company=== A Royal Engineers Signal Company at work on the Western Front. 28th Division was formed in December 1914 – January 1915 primarily from Regular units returned from service in India, with support units provided by the TF. On 5 January 1915 the division was joined at Winchester by the 1st Home Counties Signal Company, which provided its communications until beyond the end of the war.Becke, Pt 1, pp. 106–116.Lord & Watson, p. 222.Morling, p. 35. The division embarked at Southampton 15–18 January, disembarked at Le Havre 16–19 January and concentrated between Bailleul and Hazebrouck by 22 January. While on the Western Front it participated in the following actions: * Battle of Gravenstafel Ridge (22–23 April) * Battle of St Julien (24 April – 4 May) * Battle of Frezenberg Ridge (8–13 May) * Battle of Bellewaarde Ridge (24–25 May) * Battle of Loos (27 September – 5 October) On 19 October 1915 the division was ordered to entrain for an unknown destination. Units began embarking at Marseille on 24 October and by 22 November the whole division was at Alexandria in Egypt. It then embarked again for the Macedonian front, completing its disembarkation at Salonika on 4 January 1916. It spent the rest of the war on this front, where there were few major actions but the troops suffered steady attrition through trench warfare casualties and sickness. On 18 and 19 September 1918, 28th Division took part in the Battle of Doiran and the subsequent pursuit of the defeated Bulgarian Army up the Strumica Valley. On 29 September Bulgaria concluded the Armistice of Salonica with the Allies. This was followed a month later by the Armistice of Mudros with the Turks. Early in November the 28th Division was sent to occupy Constantinople and the Dardanelles Forts, with Divisional HQ at Chanak (Çanakkale). 28th Division remained in these positions, though its units (including 28th Divisional Signal Company of the new Royal Corps of Signals) were progressively staffed by Regulars after the remaining TF men were demobilised. In July 1922, 28th Division was moved to interpose between the Greek and Turkish armies (the Chanak Crisis). After a ceasefire was arranged, the British troops were progressively reduced. On 2 October 1923 the final evacuation took place, and 28th Division was disbanded. ===67th (2nd Home Counties) Divisional Engineers=== 2/1st Home Counties Fd Co was formed at Brighton and Eastbourne, and 2/2nd (HC) Fd Co at Hastings in October 1914. 2nd Home Counties Signal Co was formed at Brighton. The 2nd Home Counties Division began to assemble around Windsor in November 1914 and Lt-Col E.G. Hales was appointed CRE on 12 December. There was a shortage of equipment with which to train – only a few old .256-in Japanese Ariska rifles were available. In July 1915 the units had to be reorganised as TF men who had only signed up for Home Service were transferred to Home Defence brigades (termed Provisional Brigades). 9th Provisional Fd Co, predominantly an East Lancashire unit, was formed in Kent and absorbed details from Home Counties RE units. It later became 648th (East Lancashire) Fd Co in 73rd Division. When that division was disbanded in March 1918, the field company was reorganised as 648th (Home Counties) Army Troops Company, RE, and went to join the BEF on 23 June.Becke, Pt 2b, pp. 111–116.Watson & Rinaldi, p. 64. The 2nd HC Division was redesignated 67th (2nd Home Counties) Division in August 1915 and the signal company became 67th (2nd HC) Signal Co. The divisional RE was further reorganised with the addition of 1/3rd Home Counties Fd Co, a new 1st Line company that had been formed at Newhaven on 21 August; it joined at Southborough on 6 November. By that time the division was part of Second Army, Central Force, and was quartered in Kent, with the other two field companies at Tonbridge, and the Signal Co HQ with divisional HQ (DHQ) at Canterbury. 67th (2nd HC) Division had the dual role of home defence and supplying drafts to units serving overseas. It was twice warned for service in Ireland and in April 1917 for service on the Western Front, but these deployments never materialised and the division spent the whole war in England. By September 1916 the three field companies were based at the villages of Broomfield, Preston and Northbourne in Kent. In February 1917 the field companies were numbered: 492nd (1/3rd), 493rd (2/1st) and 494th (2/2nd). In October 1917, 492nd (1/3rd HC) Fd Co was detached from the division and joined 71st Division, the 67th receiving 645th (West Lancashire) Fd Co in exchange. During the winter of 1917–1918 the division moved to Essex, where it joined XXIII Corps. DHQ and Signals were at Colchester, and the field companies at Colchester and Driffield. The units maintained these dispositions until after the Armistice when demobilisation began. In March 1919 the remaining divisional RE began to disband, and the process was soon completed. ===492nd (Home Counties) Field Company=== In October 1917, 492nd (HC) Fd Co joined 71st Division, a training and coast defence formation that was forming a special brigade (214th Bde) for possible service in Murmansk as part of the North Russia Intervention. In the event, 214th Bde remained in the UK, but 492nd (HC) Fd Co did proceed to Russia as part of Syren Force, landing at Murmansk on 29 September 1918. In the closing months of World War I the force defended the ice-free port facilities of Murmansk and the Murmansk–Petrograd railway as far as Kem on the White Sea, against the threat of attacks by German and Finnish White Guard forces. It continued this duty during the complex postwar political and military exchanges with local Bolsheviks and Finnish Red Guards. The company joined Syren Force in June 1918 and served in Russia until at least July 1919.Becke, Pt 2b, pp. 101–105.WO 154/335 catalogue entry at The National Archives, Kew.Lincoln, pp. 176–182, 268–273, 278–279. ==Interwar== 44th (Home Counties) Division began to reform at home in 1920. When the TF was reconstituted as the Territorial Army (TA) in 1921, the field companies were renumbered and the divisional RE adopted the following organisation:Titles & Designations.Watson & Rinaldi, pp. 90, 99.Morling, pp. 44–45, 171. * HQ at 10 Queen's Square, Brighton * 208 (Sussex) Field Co at Ordnance Yard, Eastbourne, also recruiting from Bexhill and Rock-a-Nore, Hastings * 209 (Sussex) Field Co at 10 Queens Square, Brighton * 210 (Sussex) Field Co initially at Harrow, Middlesex, then at Queen's Hall, Seaford, also recruiting from Lewes and Newhaven * 211 (Sussex) Field Park Co, Brighton, absorbed into HQ Divisional RE (HQRE) 1924; reformed at Worthing 1939 The signal company transferred to the new Royal Corps of Signals as 44th (Home Counties) Divisional Signals. The Sussex Fortress Engineers began to reform on 1 November 1920, but a year later 210 Fd Co was moved from Middlesex back to Seaford and absorbed the Fortress Co. The CRE of 44th (HC) Division, appointed on 16 February 1920, was Lt-Col H.C. Saunders, who had commanded the HC Signal Company before World War I. He was promoted to Brevet Colonel on 16 February 1924 and after retiring was appointed Honorary Colonel on 17 July 1926. The Sussex RE found it difficult to obtain enough officers, and Saunders returned to the command for a further four-year term on 16 February 1932, before reverting to the Honorary Colonelcy. ==World War IIMobilisation=== Following the Munich Crisis the TA was doubled in size. Once again, 44th (HC) Division formed a duplicate, 12th (Eastern) Division, with the following RE organisation:Eastern Command 3 September 1939 at Patriot Files.Joslen, pp. 71–72.Joslen, p. 56.Morling, pp. 47–45, 210.Watson & Rinaldi, pp. 92, 101, 138. * HQ at Hastings, with a new drill hall converted from properties named 'Concordia Hall' and 'Stepping Stones' at St Leonards * 262 (Sussex) Field Co at Hastings (from 208 Fd Co) * 263 (Sussex) Field Co at Steyning (from 209 Fd Co) * 264 (Sussex) Field Co at Lewes (from 210 Fd Co) * 265 (Sussex) Field Park Co at Hastings (from 208 Fd Co) 44th (HC) Division was mobilised on 3 September 1939 and 12th (E) Division became active on 7 October 1939. ===44th (Home Counties) Divisional RE=== 44th (Home Counties) Division's formation sign Shortly after mobilisation, 44th (HC) Division formed the 'Ashdown Forest Mobile Group' as an anti-invasion reserve at Groombridge, with 208 Fd Co as its RE component, joining on 14 September. On 29 September it was announced that each of the 1st Line TA divisions would send one field company to France to build defences for the new British Expeditionary Force (BEF). 208 (S) Field Co was selected from 44th (HC) Division and made its way from Groombridge to Southampton, where it boarded the Mona's Queen on 26 September and landed at Cherbourg the following day.Morling, pp. 55–59. The rest of 44th (HC) Division RE moved to Dorset for training under the CRE, Lt-Col R.H. Parsons, with 209 Fd Co at Bridport, 210 at Beaminster and Wetherby, and 211 Fd Pk Co establishing its stores and workshops at Larkham Hall. In January 1940 the division was ordered to prepare to embark for France in February, but the departure was delayed. The first RE parties left on 19 March, but 210 Field Company only embarked on 8 April, and 211 Fd Park Co's bridging section did not follow until 30 April. After landing at Cherbourg the field companies moved into France with their brigade groups (209 Fd Co with 132 Bde and 210 Fd Co with 133 Bde).Morling, pp. 170–172, 184, 196, 205. Battle of France Once 44th (HC) Division had concentrated, HQRE was established at Estaires on 1 May, where 208 Fd Co briefly rejoined. As the training of the recently doubled TA formations was still weak, GHQ instituted a policy of exchanging some of their units with Regular formations. Having already been detached during the training period, the CRE selected 208 Fd Co as the one to be exchanged, and it was replaced in 44th (HC) Division on 4 May by 11 Fd Co from 2nd Division. This Regular company remained part of the divisional engineers for the rest of the war, usually supporting 131 Bde.Joslen, pp. 39–40.Pakenham-Walsh, Vol VIII, pp. 23–25.Watson & Rinaldi, p. 139.Watson & Rinaldi, p. 161. When the German offensive in the west opened on 10 May, the BEF advanced into Belgium in accordance with 'Plan D'. 44th (HC) Division moved up to the Escaut, where it was in reserve, with 11 and 210 Fd Cos preparing bridges for demolition.Ellis, France & Flanders, Chapter III.Pakenham-Walsh, Vol VIII, pp. 27–28. However, the German Army broke through the Ardennes to the east, forcing the BEF to withdraw again, and by 19 May the whole force was back across the Escaut, and the sappers began blowing up the bridges while under shellfire and bombing.Morling, pp. 173, 185, 196.Ellis, France & Flanders, Chapter IV. 44th (HC) Division tried to hold the most dangerous point, but the Germans established bridgeheads across the Escaut at dawn on 20 May. The attack was renewed on 22 May and the division was badly chewed up, but there was no breakthrough: it was the deep penetration further east that forced the BEF to withdraw. That night the sappers began to lay anti-tank mines and prepare the bridges over the River Lys for demolition, and next day the BEF fell back to the 'Canal Line'. 44th (HC) Division was then withdrawn into reserve.Ellis, France & Flanders, Chapter VI.Ellis, France & Flanders, Chapter VII.Ellis, France & Flanders, Chapter VIII. Cut off, the BEF fell back towards the coast, with 44th (HC) Division given the responsibility of defending the area round Hazebrouck. On 26 May the decision was made to evacuate the BEF through Dunkirk (Operation Dynamo). 44th (HC) Division was heavily attacked by German Panzer divisions on 27 May, but fought on doggedly until ordered to withdraw, by which time the enemy's advanced columns had penetrated between its widely-spread units. With its flanks 'in the air' after neighbouring French formations retreated during the night of 28/29 May, the divisional commander decided to withdraw some to Mont des Cats, a strong position held by the divisional artillery and the divisional RE. 210 Field Co was absent with 133 Bde (and some of the company were captured during the retreat), but 11 and 209 Fd Cos, reinforced by the RE Chemical Warfare Group (58, 61 and 62 Chemical Warfare Cos), 100 Army Fd Co and 216 ArmyTroops Co were deployed as infantry to defend this position, with 211 Fd Park Co in reserve, though only DHQ and scattered elements managed to join them by dawn. This rearguard was subjected to intense mortar fire next morning, then by dive-bombing, but held its position for 30 hours while the rest of the division withdrew. The remnants of the division reached the beaches for embarkation, landing in England on 1 June.Morling, pp. 174, 185–186, 197–198, 206.Ellis, France & Flanders, Chapter IX.Ellis, France & Flanders, Chapter XI.Ellis, France & Flanders, Chapter XII.Ellis, France & Flanders, Chapter XIII.Ellis, France & Flanders, Chapter XIV.Pakenham-Walsh, Vol VIII, p. 37. Home Defence Back in England, 44th (HC) Divisional Engineers assembled at Port Meadow Camp, Oxford, on 6 June, and then the companies joined their brigade groups. 209 Field Co went to Castle Bromwich with 132 Bde, 210 Fd Co to Gloucester with 133 Bde, and 211 Fd Park Co to Shrivenham; later 11 Fd Co joined 131 Bde at Fosdyke. Re-equipment began in July, after which 44th (HC) Division moved to Northern Command. The sappers were soon engaged in building anti-invasion defences. 209 Field Co moved to Ollerton in Nottinghamshire, where it worked on pillboxes and other defences along the River Trent. It also put a ferry into operation in case the bridges were destroyed by bombing. 210 Field Co worked on pillboxes and preparing bridges for demolition around Castleford and Snaith while 211 Fd Park Co was at Pontefract; both then moved to continue the work around Doncaster.Collier, Maps 17 & 20. In November 1940 44th (HC) Division was transferred to XII Corps in invasion-threatened South East England; 209 Fd Co went to Tenterden, while 210 moved around Kent. The next year was spent alternately training and working on beach defences. On 27 July 1941 the CRE, Lt-Col W.G.R. Nutt, was wounded and the OC (Maj Becher) and another officer of 209 Fd Co were killed while inspecting a mine on Dover beach. In January 1942 the unit was relieved of its operational duties and concentrated on training for crossing minefields and anti-tank ditches. In February the whole division concentrated at Mote Park, Maidstone, and on 29 May it embarked for Egypt, via Freetown, Cape Town and Aden. North Africa 44th (HC) Division arrived at Suez on 24 July, shortly after Eighth Army had retreated to the El Alamein position. At first its engineers worked on the Delta defences in the rear, then on 14 August the division was called forward by General Bernard Montgomery and the following day assigned to XIII Corps. The division was positioned on the vital Alam Halfa ridge, where General Rommel was expected to attack the El Alamein line. Its positions were protected by minefields through which 'gates' had been left to allow patrols to come and go. At each 'gate' there was an infantry picquet; if the enemy approached the picquet would place mines in ready-made holes and an attached sapper would arm them. When the attack came in on 30 August (the Battle of Alam el Halfa), the Panzers spent hours attempting to break through in the darkness. On the morning of 31 August a German tank was seen approaching one of these gates in front of 133 Bde. The infantry left their cover to place the mines, but were all disabled by the tank's machine-gun. Sapper K. Stansfield of 210 Fd Co calmly walked down the forward slope, armed and placed 12 mines under continuous fire from the tank's main gun, and then walked back unharmed. Stansfield was awarded the Distinguished Conduct Medal (DCM). Over the next two days the Panzers made repeated attacks but 44th (HC) Division held its position. Detachments of the field companies went out at night to destroy disabled enemy tanks in front of their positions to prevent their recovery. By 3 September the division was counter-attacking.Morling, pp. 175–176, 187, 198–199, 206.Pakenham-Walsh, Vol VIII, pp. 378–381.Playfair, Vol III, pp. 384–390. Sappers using mine detectors in North Africa, 1942. For Eighth Army's counter-offensive (the Second Battle of Alamein), 44th (HC) Divisional RE was reinforced by the attachment of 577 Army Fd Co from XIII Corps Troops RE (CTRE), while 11 Fd Co was detached with 131 Bde to 7th Armoured Division. 44th (HC) Division was to lead one of XIII Corps' thrusts through the enemy minefields on the first night, 23/24 October (Operation Lightfoot), but without sufficient electronic or mechanical aids the sappers had to find and lift the mines by hand under intense fire. With the armour, however, 11 Fd Co had the assistance of three 'Snail' lorries from 211 Fd Park Co, which left a trail of diesel oil over the desert that was visible in the moonlight to mark the cleared lane. As the RE historian wrote: 'Thus we had the unusual sight of a field park company leading an army into battle'. The section came under heavy fire, however, so its commander, Lt R.B. Hoskyns, made a fresh attempt with a small party. Although they were working in the middle of a firefight, they succeeded in clearing a lane to allow a carrier platoon through. Thus a route was found through the first belt of minefields ('January') on the first night of the battle. 44th (HC) and 7th Armoured Divisions' sappers succeeded in passing the second minefield ('February') the next night, but the armour was unable to exploit beyond. The sappers continued working on the gaps until they were completed on 28 OctoberJoslen, p. 570.Morling, pp. 177–179, 188, 199, 207.Pakenham-Walsh, Vol VIII, pp. 382–390, 394.Playfair & Molony, Vol IV, pp. 42–43, 46–47.Watson & Rinaldi, p. 171. The second phase of the offensive, Operation Supercharge, was launched on the night of 27/28 October. On 2 November 133 Bde alongside the New Zealand 28th Maori Battalion, secured objectives covering the flanks of the attack, after which the sapper units began clearing gaps for the armour through the minefields. 133 Brigade advanced through the 'February' minefield on 3 November with No 2 Section of 209 Fd Co clearing the route, but got held up on the 'Avon' minefield until 5 November. By now the enemy was withdrawing and the exhausted sappers were given a week's rest.Morling, p. 188.Pakenham-Walsh, Vol VIII, pp. 390–392. XIII Corps was short of transport and was left behind as Eighth Army drove westwards. The sappers were left with the task of clearing the battlefields. 11 and 209 Field Cos were sent up to Benghazi on 19 November, arriving on 25 November where 209 Fd Co began the task of clearing and re-opening the harbour as an advanced supply base for Eighth Army. The company remained on this work until April 1943, joined by the other units of 44th (HC) Divisional RE as they completed their mine-clearing tasks and moved up in early December. 211 Field Park Co used its own and captured machinery such as road rollers.Morling, pp. 180, 188–189, 199.Morling, p. 207.Pakenham- Walsh, Vol VIII, p. 396.Playfair & Molony, Vol IV, pp. 103–104. ===XXX Corps Troops RE=== XXX Corps' formation sign Shortly after Alamein 44th (HC) Division HQ was disbanded, and its units distributed to other formations. On 26 November 1942, 44th (HC) Divisional RE (11, 209, 210 Fd Cos and 211 Fd Park Co) became XXX Corps Troops RE (XXX CTRE), replacing a number of South African Engineer Corps units that had fulfilled the role up to that point.Watson & Rinaldi, p. 133.Morling, p. 181.Playfair & Molony, Vol IV, p. 220. XXX Corps had led Eighth Army's pursuit across Tripolitana to Tunisia in early 1943. The advance was delayed by enemy demolition and mines, entailing much work for the sappers. In March XXX CTRE moved up to Tripoli to work on improving the road behind the advance, dealing with 68 demolitions and craters, one of which required a bridge of five spans. XXX Corps launched Eighth Army's assaults on the Mareth Line on 20 March and the Wadi Akarit position on 6 April. The Tunisian Campaign ended with the Axis surrender on 12 May. Morling, pp. 189, 200.Pakenham-Walsh, Vol VIII, pp. 405–406, 411–412, 415, 469.Playfair & Molony, Vol IV, pp. 220–221, 224, 338, 369–371. Sicily In May 1943 XXX CTRE moved up to Sfax in Tunisia to join its corps, which was training to land in the first wave of the Allied invasion of Sicily (Operation Husky) on 9/10 July. The engineers followed later: 209 Field Co sailed from Sousse on 18 July and landed on Beach 20 near Porto Bello, south of Syracuse, on 21 July; 211 Fd Park Co also landed at Port Bello, but 210 Fd Co did not arrive until 4 August. The engineering required included mine clearance, bridge building and road repair as XXX Corps advanced to Catania and Mount Etna. The last Axis forces evacuated from the island on 17 August, leaving behind much destruction of communications. On 15 August XXX CTRE reconnoitred the important coastal route at Taormina, which had been damaged by British naval gunfire and then by enemy demolitions. The road was cut into a cliff, overhanging a railway line, part of which ran through a tunnel whose mouth had been blown in. Calculating that a bridge was required across the gapped road, the CRE ordered up one field company and a Bailey bridge platoon. A Canadian tunnelling company was also called up to widen the approach road by removing the cliff above it, and a bomb disposal section had to check the tunnel for mines and booby-traps. Eventually, the bridge assembly could start on the morning of 21 August, the road being opened two days later.Pakenham-Walsh, Vol IX, pp. 8–9. XXX Corps did not take part in the invasion of the Italian mainland, and in November 1943 XXX CTRE sailed from Augusta for the UK, 209 Fd Co sailing direct to Glasgow, where it disembarked on 26 November, the remainder travelling via Algiers and arriving during December.Morling, p. 201. North West Europe XXX Corps now began to prepare for the Allied invasion of Normandy, Operation Overlord. The corps' leading troops landed on D-Day and the build-up of forces began thereafter: 209 Fd Co landed on 'King' Sector on Gold Beach during the early hours of D+2 (8 June), losing some men drowned. 210 Field Co landed at Sword Beach later the same day, and on 10 June a reconnaissance party of five sappers captured an enemy machine gun post and five prisoners. The field park company disembarked in four groups between D+3 and D+6, acquired equipment for roadmaking and airfield construction at Bayeux and based itself there during the Normandy campaign, handling stores for road- and bridge-building, and manufacturing all manner of objects required by the army. The field companies operated behind the lines, maintaining roads and clearing mines. 210 Field Co began to take up sleepers to convert a railway into a road, but after objections from the French railway authorities they had to be replaced and the railway reinstated. 209 Field Co spent 7–16 August at Aunay- sur-Odon, clearing of rubble-strewn road with bulldozers, making of diversions, spraying roads to keep down dust, and building a Class 40 Bailey bridge. The company then moved up to deal with roads washed out by the flooded River Odon, and on 17 August No 2 Platoon built a Bailey bridge across the River Orne.Morling, pp. 190, 208.Morling, p. 191. After the breakout from the Normandy beachhead, XXX CTRE under Lt-Col R.E. Black was called on to assist in the major bridging operation on the River Seine at Vernon. Their role was to clear the road to the crossing site, including replacing blown road and rail bridges over the River Eure at Pacy-sur-Eure that threatened to hold up the whole operation. 11 Field Co was sent to begin the work, first clearing a road block at St Acquilin; unfortunately this had been booby-trapped and five sappers were killed in the explosion. XXX CTRE then spent the next two days working continuously on the Pacy bridges until the sappers were exhausted. XXX CTRE continued worked on road repairs and bridging along the 'Club' and 'Heart' routes through Northern France and across Belgium into the Netherlands.Ford, pp. 35, 37, 43, 109.Morling, p. 202.Pakenham-Walsh, Vol IX, pp. 379–380. After the failure of Operation Market Garden, vital road and rail bridges at Nijmegen were damaged by German swimmers who attached mines to the piers. A hole was blown in the roadway of the road bridge, but was swiftly repaired by the insertion of two Bailey spans by XXX CTRE and 15th (Kent) GHQ TRE; the bridges were also camouflaged. On 21 October 209 and 210 Fd Cos paddled assault boats across the Nederrijn to rescue 138 men of 1st Airborne Division who had been sheltered by Dutch civilians since the failure of Market Garden. For the rest of the year the sappers were engaged in bridge-building, encountering considerable problems at Beringen bridge when the flooded river washed away the approach roads and threatened the bridge.Pakenham-Walsh, Vol IX, pp. 407–408. During the German Ardennes Offensive, XXX Corps was moved down to defend the line of the River Meuse, and the corps RE prepared the bridges for demolition. Once the situation had stabilised XXX Corps advanced to recover the lost ground, with the RE re-establishing communications and clearing minefields. The latter task was especially dangerous in the frozen ground, and resulted in many casualties.Morling, pp. 192, 208.Pakenham-Walsh, Vol IX, pp. 443–444. 21st Army Group returned to the offensive with Operation Veritable to clear the Reichswald, led by XXX Corps. A few days before the attack was due, a thaw set in, and the vital supply roads collapsed. All available engineers were put to roadbuilding to maintain the traffic flow for the concentration of troops, ammunition and supplies. The attack began on 8 February, but that evening rain began to fall and water levels rose by . The mass of engineers worked continuously to keep roads open to sustain the offensive. As the divisions fought their way forward, XXX CTRE was sent in to reinforce the divisional engineers. By 13 February the whole of the Reichswald had been cleared and the first phase of Veritable completed. The companies then returned to clearing and maintaining the main routes, and were back at Nijmegen by early March.Morling, pp. 193–194, 203.Pakenham-Walsh, Vol IX, pp. 458–463. A Bailey pontoon bridge across the Rhine nearing completion on D+1. By mid-March 21 Army Group had closed up to the Rhine. Now it paused to prepare for an assault crossing (Operation Plunder). The bridges to be constructed on XXX Corps' front after the initial crossings were codenamed after famous London bridges: XXX CTRE under Lt-Col Black was responsible for 'Lambeth' (named after Lambeth Bridge), a Class 15 Bailey pontoon bridge. 211 Feld Park Co constructed equipment such as cradles to transport naval Tugboats, and acted as a reserve of manpower for the bridging parties. Work began at 03.00 on 25 March, but enemy fire from the uncaptured town of Rees on the far bank caused casualties equivalent to a platoon's strength with 30 minutes. After daylight the work continued under a smokescreen and despite a collision from an out-of-control tugboat the bridge was opened at 08.30 on 26 March.Morling, p. 209.Pakenham-Walsh Vol IX, pp. 479–496.Pakenham-Walsh, Vol IX, p. 501, Map 22. Across the Rhine 209 Fd Co worked with 51st (Highland) Division and 210 Fd Co with 43rd (Wessex) Division to help with their route maintenance, and then on 5 April 209 Fd Co with a platoon of 11 Fd Co built a bridge over the River Ems under fire; this was open for traffic the next day. The whole of XXX CTRE was required for the bridge over the River Weser. The site was still in enemy hands on 20 April when the reconnaissance was carried out, but work began at 12.00 on 22 April for a Class 40 bridge, and the bridgehead was defended and patrolled by the sappers themselves, 'mopping up' a number of prisoners.Pakenham-Walsh, Vol IX, pp. 510–514. As the rapid advance continued, 209 Fd Co filled craters and built a 110-foot treble/single Bailey at Hassel on 1 May, replaced a 30-ft Bailey at Bremervörde with two 20-ft single/double Baileys starting at 21.30 on 3 May and completing the job at 04.30 on 4 May. By 6 May it was looking after 11 bridges and collecting surplus bridging materials from nearby sites as it upgraded them for heavier traffic. Immediately after news arrived of the German surrender at Lüneburg Heath, 209 Fd Co started building a large Prisoner of War (PoW) camp. Postwar, the companies carried out many tasks, from clearing bridge wreckage and building PoW camps, to running trade schools. Demobilisation by age and call- up group reduced the companies to cadre strength by early 1946. 211 Field Park Company was put into suspended animation on 28 March 1946, with some of its remaining personnel transferring to 11 Fd Co, and next day the remainder together with the cadres of 209 and 210 Fd Cos transferred to two field squadrons (4 and 621) of 7th Armoured Division, which took over the TA numbers of 209 and 210 before eventually being placed in suspended animation.Morling, p. 180, 194–195.Morling, p. 204. 2nd Division's formation sign. ===208 (Sussex) Field Company=== 208 (Sussex) Fd Co joined 2nd Division on 4 May 1940, and by 12 May it was deployed on the Dyle Line (see above). During the retreat to Dunkirk its role was to destroy bridges and create anti-tank obstacles.Morling, pp. 69–81, Map II. Some of the volunteers who stayed behind to blow 'last minute' bridges were unable to make it back to Dunkirk, where the rest of the company was evacuated by 31 May.Ellis, France & Flanders, Chapter XV.Morling, pp. 96–108. The company served in home defence until April 1942 when it embarked for India with 2nd Division. In India it trained for amphibious operations on the coast of Burma, but when the Japanese launched a pre-emptive attack (the U Go Offensive) against Kohima and Imphal in March 1944, 2nd Division was among the reinforcements rushed to the Central Front.Morling, pp. 109–124.Woodburn Kirby, Vol II, pp. 235, 331–356, 390. The company fought with the division to break through and relieve the defenders of Kohima and then to drive the Japanese off of Kohima Ridge. 2nd Division then continued its campaign through Monsoon rain to relieve Imphal, with 208 Fd Co clearing roadblocks and building bridges.Morling, pp. 123–147.Pakenham-Walsh, Vol VIII, pp. 215, 220.Woodburn Kirby, Vol III, pp. 190–191, 235, 241–245, 299–306, 330–339, 345–346, 352, 359–371. The Dorsets cross the Irrawaddy by assault boat, 26 February 1945. Operations resumed in November, and 208 Fd Co operated ferry services and repaired roads and bridges behind the advancing Fourteenth Army. On 24 February 2nd Division made a moonlight assault crossing of the Irrawaddy River with 208 Fd Co manning the assault boats under heavy fire. It then began a ferry to get tanks and vehicles across the river.Morling, pp. 148–161.Pakenham-Walsh, Vol IX, p. 242, 267–268.Woodburn Kirby, Vol IV, pp. 156, 160, 177, 262–263. The division advanced towards Mandalay before being disengaged and airlifted back to India for reorganisation. The Japanese surrendered before it saw action again, and the company went into suspended animation on 31 January 1946.Morling, pp. 162–167.Pakenham-Walsh, Vol IX, p. 271.Woodburn Kirby, Vol IV, pp. 325, 331, 352, 374, 399.Woodburn Kirby, Vol V, p. 65. ===12th (Eastern) Divisional RE=== 12th (E) Divisional RE mobilised as follows in September 1939, under the command of Lt-Col W.E. Dewdney as CRE:Morling, pp. 210–214, 220, 225–226, 232.Pakenham-Walsh, Vol VIII, pp. 14–15.Watson & Rinaldi, pp. 165–166. * 262 (Sussex) Fd Co from Hastings embodied at Eastbourne * 263 (Sussex) Fd Co at Brighton * 264 (Sussex) Fd Co at Seaford * 265 (Sussex) Fd Park Co at Eastbourne The unit moved to Milton Barracks, Gravesend, to guard the airport, undergo training, and receive reinforcements. 12th (Eastern) Divisional sign. Battle of France 262 Field Co was ordered to proceed to France independently and arrived at Le Havre from Southampton on 20 March 1940. The company was put to work building accommodation for the new BEF. The infantry of 12th (E) Division arrived in April as labour troops to work on airfields and lines of communication. On 17 May, after the BEF was forced to withdraw from the Dyle Line, 262 Field Co joined 36 Bde near Doullens, where it began constructing road blocks and preparing a massive fuel dump for destruction. It then cratered the main road and laid anti-tank mines. By 20 May the Germans had taken Doullens and the sappers were part of a long retreating column fighting off German attacks. On 22 May about 100 men of 262 Fd Co and 50 men of the 7th Battalion Royal West Kent Regiment reached Boulogne, where 20th Guards Bde had just landed to defend the port. 262 Field Co took up position between two Guards battalions, with parties of 50 sappers posted either side of the Boulogne–Desvins road, while a party remained out to blow the last bridge over the river before joining their unit. 262 Field Co covered the retreat of 7th Royal West Kents into the defended perimeter. The defenders were attacked from all sides and by the evening of 23 May the Royal Navy was ordered to evacuate them. The last parties who could not be evacuated finally surrendered on 25 May.Ellis, France & Flanders, Chapter II.Ellis, France & Flanders, Chapter X.Pakenham-Walsh, Vol, VIII, p. 32. The rest of 12th (E) Divisional RE sailed from Gravesend and arrived at Le Havre on 20 April. They were sent to Rouen, where 263 Fd Co was put to building camps and 265 Fd Park Co set up an RE depot and workshop. When the German invasion began 12th (E) Division (less 36 Bde and 262 Fd Co) was ordered to concentrate at Amiens. The RE were entrained but never reached Amiens, which was already on fire after air raids. They were then withdrawn via Le Mans to Blain on the Atlantic coast, where they began building a new camp at Chateau Pont Pietin. The infantry of 12th (E) Division fought as part of 'Petreforce', holding up the German advance at the coast of heavy casualties before being evacuated through Dunkirk. The rest of the BEF remaining on the Atlantic coast then began to be evacuated through Cherbourg, 12th (E) Divisional RE moving via Caen to get there early on 7 June. They embarked on the RMS Duke of Argyll and arrived at Southampton that evening.Ellis, France & Flanders, Chapter V. The divisional RE was moved to Hexham in Northumberland, where 262 Fd Co rejoined, then returned to the south coast to work on anti-invasion beach defences along the South Coast and inland stop lines in Sussex and Kent. 12th (Eastern) Division's casualties in France had been so severe that it was broken up on 10 July, when the divisional RE was converted into XII Corps Troops RE, the field companies formally being termed 'Army Field Companies'.Watson & Rinaldi, p. 132.Order of Battle of the Field Force in the United Kingdom, Part 4: Royal Engineers, 1940, The National Archives (TNA), Kew, file WO 212/16. ===XII CTRE=== XII Corps' formation sign XII Corps HQ was formed in Aldershot Command in July 1940, and XII CTRE served with it for the rest of the war. 264 Field Co transferred to VIII CTRE in December 1941, and was replaced a year later by 280 Fd Co from 15th (Scottish) Infantry Division.Watson & Rinaldi, p. 166. The unit moved around the UK working on defences, laying minefields and supervising civilian contractors digging anti-tank ditches. On one occasion an infantry party wandered into a minefield near Chichester and some were killed and wounded. 262 Field Co was called upon for help and the officer commanding, Maj A.H.M. Morris, led a detachment and personally went into the crater to try to locate displaced mines, then disarmed others so that the casualties could be recovered. Major Morris was awarded the George Medal.Pakenham-Walsh, Vol VIII, p. 139. By July 1943 XII Corps formed part of 21st Army Group, training for Operation Overlord. In mid-October 1943 XII CTRE settled at Mote Park, Maidstone, and began intensive training in clearing mines and underwater obstacles.Morling, pp. 214, 221, 233.Order of Battle of the Forces in the United Kingdom, Part 2: 21 Army Group, 24 July 1943, with amendments, TNA file WO 212/238. Normandy Transport crossing 'London Bridge' into the Orne bridgehead during Operation Goodwood. For the Normandy landings, XII CTRE's field companies were loaned to the assaulting divisions as obstacle clearance parties. Shortly after 07.45 on 6 June (D-Day) 262 Fd Co landed with troops of 3rd Canadian Division on Juno Beach, 263 Fd Co with 5th Assault Regiment, RE, supporting 3rd British Division on Sword Beach and 280 Fd Co with 6th Assault Regiment, RE, supporting 50th (Northumbrian) Infantry Division on Gold Beach. Once ashore, the sappers began the dangerous task of clearing the beach obstacles before they were covered by the rising tide, and constructing exits so the follow-up troops could quickly get into action. At Colleville-sur-Orne 263 Fd Co's sappers had to clear snipers from nearby houses while working on the exits, then cleared a nearby glider landing zone.Ellis, Normandy, pp. 169–186.Morling, pp. 182–183, 214–215, 221.Joslen, pp. 581–585.Pakenham-Walsh, Vol IX, pp. 333–339, 344–345, 347, 356. From 7 to 10 June 263 Fd Co operated raft ferries at Bénouville, then on 10 and 11 June it assisted 71 Fd Co in building two Class 40 bridges ('London I & II') to duplicate Pegasus and Ranville bridges across the River Orne and Caen Canal. On 8 June 262 Fd Co established company HQ at Bernieres while the platoons continued beach clearance. They reverted to XII CTRE command around 11 June, and spent the rest of the campaign clearing roads of mines and debris, filling craters and minor bridgebuilding. 265 Field Park Co and the rear parties of the field companies joined the unit later. 265 Field Park Co operated quarries for road- building material and prepared bridging equipment for the field companies.Morling, pp. 215, 221, 233.Pakenham-Walsh, Vol IX, p. 365. North West Europe Sappers place the final planks of a Bailey pontoon bridge over the Rhine. After the breakout from the Normandy beachhead, XII crossed the Seine, with 262, 263 and 265 Cos building a Class 40 pontoon bridge over the river at St Pierre de Vouvray on 28 August.Morling, p. 216. XII Corps drove on towards Antwerp, bypassing German garrisons along the coast. On 6 September, Instead of building bridges, 280 Fd Co together with 621st Fd Squadron of 7th Armoured Division was given the task of destroying all bridges on the Lys and Escaut as far south as Oudenaarde and Deinze to prevent these Germans from threatening the flank of the advance. All these were successfully destroyed, except a large concrete bridge at Deinze that the Germans themselves later blew.Pakenham-Walsh, Vol IX, p. 392. XII CTRE spent the autumn clearing roads and building bridges across the many watercourses of the Low Countries. During Operation Colin 51st (Highland) Division pushed through Schijndel to Boxtel, 262 and 263 Fd Cos building Class 40 Bailey bridges across the Halsche and Dommel rivers respectively; 262 had to use four bulldozers to clear away the old bridge before beginning work. XII CTRE supported 51st (H) Division again during Operation Ascot on 11–14 November, building a Bailey at Neder. The winter of 1944–1945 was spent keeping roads open during snow and floods.Ellis, Germany, p. 124.Morling, pp. 217, 222. In February and March 1945 the unit received special training in rafting and Folding Boat Equipment (FBE) bridging in preparation for the Rhine crossing, where XII Corps was to make an assault crossing alongside XXX Corps (see above). XII CTRE under Lt-Col C.J. Gardiner (together with 85 and 184 Gd Cos from 7th GHQ TRE) was allotted the task of building a Class 12 pontoon Bailey (codenamed 'Sussex') at the extreme left of the corps' area. The main bridge was long, with an additional across a minor gap. The start of construction was held up by enemy fire, but once work began the bridge was completed with the assistance of naval tugs on 26 March in just under 43 hours.Morling, pp. 218–219, 222–224, 234.Pakenham-Walsh, Vol IX, p. 500; Map 21. XII CTRE then took its turn on bridge maintenance until moving to Haffen to bridge the River Aa and remove concrete road blocks. It followed XII Corps' advance across Germany, building bridges especially across the Weser and Elbe. After the German surrender the unit was involved in bridgebuilding at Hamburg Docks.Pakenham-Walsh, Vol IX, pp. 515–519. During the summer of 1945 XII CTRE prepared to return to the UK to reorganise for service in the Far East. It got as far as handing in its equipment and concentrating at Ghent before the Japanese surrender ended the war. With reduced equipment the sappers assisted other units in erecting and dismantling Bailey bridges and other civil engineering works in rebuilding the occupied zone of West Germany. The unit and its companies were disbanded by 25 March 1946. ===264 (Sussex) Field Company=== After it left XII CTRE, 264 Fd Co moved to VIII CTRE and then in July 1942 it joined 2nd GHQ TRE forming for the Allied landings in North Africa (Operation Torch), where it landed on 23 November. It remained in North Africa after the Tunisian Campaign until December 1943 when it moved to Italy, supporting 15th Army Group, with a detachment on the island of Vis where it worked for several weeks with the Yugoslav Partisans. The company spent 1944 working on road improvements and bridging with 4th Indian Division and I Canadian Corps. In the winter of 1944–1945 the Allies began Operation Goldflake, secretly transferring I Canadian Corps from Italy to reinforce 21st Army Group in North West Europe. 2nd GHQTRE was among the units selected, and 264 Fd Co travelled via Livorno and Marseilles to Belgium, where it worked on supply routes and bridging. It continued this work in occupied Germany until disbandment in December 1945.Morling, pp. 227–231.Watson & Rinaldi, p. 120. ==Postwar== When the TA was reconstituted in 1947, 44th (HC) Divisional RE was reformed as 119 Field Engineer Regiment with its seniority derived from the 1st Sussex Engineers of 1890. It had the following organisation:118–432 Rgts RE at British Army 1945 onwards.Watson & Rinaldi, pp. 289, 294.Morling, pp. 231, 235–236.Watson, TA 1947. * Regimental HQ at Queen Square, Brighton * 208 Field Squadron at Ordnance Yard, Eastbourne, with a detachment at Hatherley Road Drill Hall, Hastings * 209 Field Park Squadron at Queen Square, Brighton * 210 Field Squadron at Seaford, with a detachment at the Old Naval Prison, Lewes; a number of men from the wartime 264 Fd Co joined the unit; after 1950 a Troop was stationed at Worthing with some personnel from 211 Fd Sqn * 211 Field Squadron at Worthing; in 1950 it became 211 (Thames & Medway) Fd Sqn and was transferred to 120 (Kent) Construction Regiment (the former Kent Fortress RE). In 1959, 210 Fd Sqn was awarded the freedom of Seaford, together with a Freedom Sword. In the 1961 reorganisation of the TA, the division became 44th (HC) Division/District and 119 Rgt once again became 44th (HC) Divisional RE. Headquarters remained at Brighton with 209 Fd Park Sqn, 211 (T&M;) Fd Sqn rejoined (though still based at Northfleet, Beckenham and Swanley in Kent), and 208 and 210 Fd Sqns were amalgamated, with a recruiting area covering Hastings, Eastbourne, Seaford, Lewes and Worthing. To avoid argument, both numbers were scrapped and the amalgamated squadron revived a World War I number as 490 Fd Sqn. Divisional RE at British Army 1945 onwards. When the TA was reduced into the Territorial and Army Volunteer Reserve (TAVR) on 31 March 1967, the division/district was disbanded and its remaining RE companies absorbed (together with 559 Sqn Royal Corps of Transport) into a new TAVR unit at Eastbourne designated B Company (Royal Engineers), 9th Territorial Battalion, The Queen's Regiment (Royal Sussex), except 209 Fd Park Sqn, whose personnel joined C Company; other personnel joined the London and Kent Regiment, Royal Artillery. B Company was disbanded on 31 March 1969. ==Commanding officers== The commanding officers of the unit include the following: 1st Sussex Engineer Volunteers * Lt-Col Frederick Savage, July 1895 * Lt-Col Alfred A.

The vessel was largely employed on the Gulf Coast of the United States to Europe route until 1930 when she was laid up. In late 1940 the ship together with 15 other vessels was acquired by the British government to alleviate significant shortage of tonnage due to an ongoing German U-boat campaign. In May 1941 the freighter was torpedoed and sunk on her first war trip to the United Kingdom. ==Design and construction== After the United States entry into World War I, a large shipbuilding program was undertaken to restore and enhance shipping capabilities both of the United States and their Allies. As part of this program, EFC placed orders with nation's shipyards for a large number of vessels of standard designs. Design 1015 cargo ship was a standard cargo freighter of approximately 9,400 tons deadweight designed by Moore Shipbuilding Co. and adopted by USSB. Cockaponset was part of the order for 10 vessels placed by USSB with Pacific Coast Shipbuilding Co. on 16 November 1917 and was laid down at shipbuilder's yard on 15 June 1918 and launched on 4 May 1919 (yard number 3), with Mrs. John T. Scott, wife of vice-president of the Pacific Coast Shipbuilding Co., being the sponsor. Just as with many other vessels being built for the Shipping Board, her name was picked by Mrs. Woodrow Wilson who often chose Native American words for naming purposes. The ship was shelter-deck type, had two main decks and was built on the Isherwood principle of longitudinal framing providing extra strength to the body of the vessel. The freighter had four main holds and also possessed all the modern machinery for quick loading and unloading of cargo from five large hatches, including ten winches and a large number of derricks. She was also equipped with wireless apparatus, had submarine signal system installed and had electrical lights installed along the decks. As built, the ship was long (between perpendiculars) and abeam, a depth of . Cockaponset was originally assessed at and and had deadweight of approximately 9,627. The vessel had a steel hull with double bottom throughout with exception of her machine compartment, and a single turbine rated at 2,800 shp, double-reduction geared to a single screw propeller that moved the ship at up to . The steam for the engine was supplied by three single-ended Scotch marine boilers fitted for both coal and oil fuel. The sea trials were held in the San Francisco Bay on 26 and 27 December 1919 with the ship performing satisfactorily. Following their successful completion, the ship departed on her maiden voyage to Rotterdam. ==Operational history== While the steamer was still under construction she was allocated by the USSB on 15 August 1919 to Williams, Dimond & Co. to serve on the West Coast to Europe routes. Upon delivery to the USSB the ship loaded 8,200 tons of general cargo consisting mostly of canned and dried fruit, brandy and wine and was initially supposed to depart for France and Belgium at the end of November. In the early morning of December 9 a fire was discovered in No.2 hold and a fire-fighting system was employed. However, the flames fueled by the casks of brandy stored in the hold soon spread to hold No.3 and a fireboat was dispatched to assist in fighting the fire. The flames were finally extinguished by noon and the cargo had to be discharged to assess the damage. The cause of the fire was never established but was believed to be caused by a lit cigarette thrown in the holds by one of the stevedores. After being further delayed by foggy weather, Cockaponset finally sailed out for her maiden voyage on 28 December 1919 bound for Le Havre, Rotterdam and Antwerp. Upon reaching her destinations and unloading of her cargo, the freighter left Antwerp on 24 March 1920 bound for the West Coast where she was to take cargo of grain and flour. On her way back she first called at Pensacola and Mobile to discharge part cargo of potash and to load general cargo and iron pipes and continued on to San Francisco. On May 28 she received a distress call from another USSB steamer, SS City of Omaha, who laid disabled about 120 miles off Cabo San Lucas with boiler problems. Cockaponset took the disabled vessel in tow and brought her into San Pedro on June 4. Cockaponset sailed out from San Pedro on June 10 on the last leg of her journey and arrived at San Francisco a few hours later finalizing nearly 30,000-mile long maiden journey. For her next trip Cockaponset departed San Francisco on June 28 laden with 7,400 tons of flour bound for Alexandria. She returned from her trip back to New York on October 11 and remained berthed in port before being laid up at the end of 1920 and relocated to Prall's Island in January 1921. On 12 August 1922 it was reported that the Shipping Board had decided to reactivate many vessels due to ongoing coal emergency to bring coal from Great Britain. Three vessels were allocated to Gulf operators, with Cockaponset being assigned to Lykes Brothers. At the time of allocation the freighter was berthed at New Orleans where she was sent for reconditioning from New York at the end of July 1922. The freighter eventually departed New Orleans on September 13 with general cargo bound for England and arrived at London on October 5, then proceeding to Hull reaching it on October 16. Upon return she loaded 2,471 tons of phosphate pebble at Tampa, continued on to New Orleans to embark general cargo and left for United Kingdom in early January 1923. She made one more trip to England in April 1923 with 2,675 tons of phosphate rock from Tampa and general cargo from Mobile and New Orleans. On that trip she started experiencing engine problems and arrived at Gravesend with her machinery defective on 26 May 1923 and had to be towed into port to unload cargo and undergo repairs. She continued to experience problems with pumps and engine but managed to departed for New Orleans on July 16. On August 20 when she was off Great Isaac's Key in the Bahamas she became disabled due to water in her fuel oil. She was taken into tow on August 22 by another steamer, SS Radnor, and brought into Key West for repairs. After refueling, cleaning boilers and other miscellaneous repairs, the freighter departed Key West on August 30 and arrived at New Orleans a week later. She was scheduled for another trip to England, but it never materialized and the ship remained idle berthed in New Orleans for almost a year. On 8 August 1924 it was reported that the Shipping Board had allocated Cockaponset to Daniel Ripley & Co., a subsidiary of Lykes Brothers acquired by them in 1923, to serve on their Galveston to French Atlantic ports as part of their Texas Star Line. The ship arrived at Galveston on August 21 to load 136,000 bushels of wheat in addition to 10,364 bales of cotton and cleared from port on August 30 bound for Ghent, Antwerp and Le Havre. Cockaponset remained a part of Texas Star Line through the early part of 1927 carrying wheat and cotton to ports in Low Countries and occasionally to Bremen. In early March 1927 Cockaponset while on her return trip to United States became disabled about 480 miles east southeast of Galveston due to engine problems. Another Shipping Board vessel, SS West Cobalt, sped up to her aid, took the disabled freighter in tow and safely brought her into Galveston on March 10. After unloading and quick repairs, the ship sailed for Mobile but again became disabled due to a loss of turbine shaft on March 28 and had to be towed in. The vessel was subsequently laid up in Mobile for the remainder of 1927 and most of 1928. At the end of November 1928 it was reported that Cockaponset was again allocated to Daniel Ripley & Co. and was brought in to Galveston from Mobile to undergo extensive repairs. The vessel continued sailing largely on the same routes carrying the same cargo. For example, on 27 August 1929 she cleared from Galveston for the Low Countries carrying 184,000 bushels of wheat in addition to other cargo. The freighter continued sailing on her trade routes through the first half of 1930, but was eventually laid up. ===Sinking=== On 14 November 1940 the U.S. Government through the Maritime Commission offered fifteen old World War I era laid up vessels in their possession for sale to the British firms. The ships were offered on \\"as is, where is\\" basis, and the ownership had to be transferred within six months of purchase. On 13 December 1940 the bidding process for 16 vessels was opened, and the next day a variety of British shipping operators through their New York agent made a joint bid for all the vessels in the amount of 3,010,800 and additionally placed individual bids for each ship offered for purchase. Cockaponset was among the vessels and the bid offered for her was 216,000. On 18 December 1940 the Maritime Commission announced that all sixteen vessels were sold to British interests for a total amount of 3,295,800. The freighter was then taken over by the Ministry of War Transport with Lamport & Holt being retained as operators. She was also transferred into British registry per requirements established by the Maritime Commission. Following the sale, Cockaponset who was laid up in New Orleans, was brought into Galveston to undergo repairs and reconditioning. Upon the completion of the work, she sailed for Houston on 1 April 1941. From there she proceeded to Halifax where she loaded a cargo consisting of 2,700 tons of steel, 1,924 tons of carbon black, 250 tons of TNT, 223 tons of trucks in crates and 1,162 tons of general cargo. The freighter was under command of captain Benjamin Green and had a crew of forty one including the captain and two gunners armed with Lewis machine guns. Initially, Cockaponset was set to be part of convoy HX-123 which left Halifax on April 23, but she was instead moved on to next convoy, HX-124. The freighter, however, did not sail with that convoy either, and finally was able to depart with convoy HX-125 leaving Halifax on 6 May 1941. Upon departure, the vessel developed problems with her engines, and had to return into port for repairs. She finally sailed with Convoy HX 126 in the early afternoon on May 10 bound for Liverpool escorted only by the British armed merchant cruiser . The journey was uneventful until the night of May 19. The ships in convoy were proceeding at a speed of about , the weather was fine with great visibility. In the early morning of May 20 one of the last ships in the convoy column, SS Norman Monarch, was torpedoed which led to the whole convoy to start evasive maneuvers and laying smoke to conceal the vessels. At around 12:50 German submarine fired three torpedoes in quick succession at two large tankers, with both of them being hit within two minutes of each other and being set on fire. Cockaponset resumed evasive maneuvers also trying to stay clear of burning oil. Meanwhile, U-556 loaded her last torpedo and fired it at around 13:06 at a large freighter right in front of her. Cockaponset was struck on her starboard side near No. 4 hatch a few minutes later. The vessel immediately started taking on water and began listing, prompting the engineers to stop the engines. Two lifeboats were launched and the entire crew disembarked the freighter in orderly fashion. Cockaponset sank stern first at approximately 13:35 in approximate position . The crew was picked up by Dutch rescue ship Hontestroom in the morning of May 21 and taken to Rejkjavik where they were landed on May 27. == Notes == Category:Design 1015 ships Category:1919 ships Category:Ships built in California Category:Merchant ships of the United States Category:Ships of the United States Category:Maritime incidents in May 1941 Category:Ships sunk by German submarines in World War II Category:Shipwrecks in the Atlantic Ocean ","title":"SS Cockaponset"},{"id":"61324035","text":"Skubic is a Slovenian surname.

He was born to the Banu al-Hakim family, a branch of the Abbadid dynasty. While his brothers ruled his home town, he went east to study in major cities of the Islamic world in 1284, returning two years later. In 1287, he entered service in the court chancery of Sultan Muhammad II () as katib (secretary). In addition to secretarial and literary work, he also served as mediator to reconcile his brothers with the sultan when they rebelled. He became a co-vizier on the accession of Muhammad III (), and became sole vizier and titled dhu al-wizaratayn (\\"holder of the two vizierates\\") when his co-vizier died in 1303. His power grew and at the end of his life he was the actual ruler of the emirate. He orchestrated a foreign policy change, first by making peace with Castile, and then taking Ceuta in North Africa from the Marinids. These actions backfired and soon Granada was confronted with a triple alliance of Castile, Aragon, and the Marinids. The citizens of Granada, angered by his policy and his extravagant lifestyle, invaded his palace and that of the sultan on 14 March 1309. The sultan was deposed, and Abu Abdallah was killed by his political rival Atiq ibn al-Mawl. == Early life and origin == Muḥammad ibn Abd al-Rahman was born in 1261 (660 AH) in Ronda. He was a descendant of a branch of the Abbadid dynasty, which had ruled the Taifa of Seville in the 11th century. Abu Abdallah's ancestors moved to Ronda (Arabic Runda). One of them had become a doctor (hakim), after whom the entire lineage was subsequently named. Abu Abdallah had two older brothers, Abu Zakariya and Abu Ishaq, who remained in Ronda. They had large estates there and became the town's semi-autonomous rulers, recognizing first the overlordship of the Marinids and later of the Nasrids. Abu Abdallah left his home town in 1284 for the eastern Islamic world, where he studied for many years. He and his friend, Muhammad ibn Rushayd of Ceuta, visited and studied in Mecca, Medina, Damascus, and several cities of North Africa, earning diplomas and assembling a considerable library. He particularly loved the study of poetry and often recited his own verses to Ibn Rushayd. == Service under Muhammad II == He returned to Ronda in 1286, while his friend continued his journey. When the Sultan, Muhammad II (), visited Ronda shortly after his return, Abu Abdallah recited a qasida praising the Sultan's recent victory over the rebel Banu Ashqilula. His education impressed the Sultan, who invited him to enter his service in the capital, which he accepted in 1287. Abu Abdallah began his career in the court chancery as katib al-insha and then as sahib al-qalam al-a'la, the highest post in the chancery, responsible for composing and editing royal correspondence. He demonstrated his literary skill in writing a risala about the Sultan's conquest of Quesada from Castile (1295). On another occasion, some verses satirizing the ruling dynasty circulated in the capital and were attributed to Abu Abdallah. The crown prince, the future Muhammad III, ordered the katib to be severely punished forcing him to flee and hide in abandoned buildings. He returned to his job only after the prince's anger had subsided. When his brothers defied Muhammad II and declared for the Marinid sultan Abu Yaqub Yusuf, and a Nasrid attempt to retake Ronda by force failed, Abu Abdallah was sent to negotiate with his brothers. The negotiations appear to have been successful because they ended with the brothers resubmitting to Muhammad II and being allowed to continue ruling the city. The Banu al-Hakim family were the governors of Ronda until its conquest by Isabella I and Ferdinand II in 1485. == Rise and downfall under Muhammad III == Muhammad II died in 1302 and was succeeded by his son Muhammad III (), a sultan with a mixed reputation for high culture, cruelty and a sense of humour. The new sultan appointed Abu Abdallah as co-vizier along with his father's vizier Abu al-Sultan ibn al-Mun'im al-Dani. The old vizier wanted the qa'id (military chief) Atiq ibn al-Mawl to succeed him on his death as the sole vizier. However, after Abu al-Sultan's death in 1303, Muhammad III named Abu Abdallah as vizier anyway. Because he controlled the two powerful posts of vizier and katib, he received the title dhu al- wizaratayn (\\"holder of the two vizierates\\"). As dhu al-wizaratayn, Abu Abdallah's power grew considerably, and at the end of Muhammad III's reign he was regarded as the actual ruler of the realm. It is unclear exactly when or how he assumed absolute power, but it was due partly to the Sultan's blindness (or poor eyesight). In any case, Granada's foreign policy changed dramatically during Muhammad III's reign and Abu Abdallah's vizierate. The Sultan inherited a war against the Christian Crown of Castile, as well as an alliance with the Christian Kingdom of Aragon and the Muslim Marinid state. Muhammad II had captured several fortresses in the Castilian frontiers, and the new sultan followed up with a conquest of Bedmar two weeks after his accession. However, Granada soon sued for peace, resulting in the Treaty of Cordoba of August 1303. Signed by Abu Abdallah in the name of the Sultan, it established Muhammad III as a tribute-paying vassal of Castile, in exchange for the recognition of Granada's war gains. This antagonized Aragon, which, deprived of an ally, had to sign its own treaty later with Castile. In 1306, Granada conquered Ceuta in North Africa from the Marinids, and it was Abu Abdallah rather than the Sultan who visited the city after its conquest. In the short term, this strengthened Granada's control on the Strait of Gibraltar, but this upset Granada's neighbours so much that Aragon, Castile and the Marinids formed a coalition against it. Each of the three powers was larger than Granada, and they began their preparations for war. At court, Abu Abdallah had become the most powerful man in the realm. The court poets dedicated their verses to him rather than the Sultan, and he lived an extravagant life in a palace full of riches. However, the people of Granada despised him because of his disastrous foreign policy and his lifestyle. The qa'id Atiq ibn al-Mawl, whom he had passed over for the post of vizier, began a conspiracy against Abu Abdallah and Muhammad III. On Eid al-Fitr of 708 AH (14 March 1309), an angry mob of Granada's citizens attacked the palaces of both the Vizier and the Sultan. Abu Abdallah's palace was sacked, and he was killed by Ibn al-Mawl; his corpse was defiled by the mob and lost so that he could not be buried. The Sultan was allowed to leave but forced to abdicate in favor of his brother Nasr; he was permitted to live in Almuñécar. Ibn al-Mawl became the new sultan's vizier, but he soon had to flee to North Africa because he felt his life was threatened. Later, the historian al-Maqqari (–1632) wrote a poem, which according to modern historians María Jesús Rubiera Mata and L. P. Harvey could only refer to Abu Abdallah ibn al-Hakim: ==ReferencesSources== * . * * * Category:1261 births Category:1309 deaths Category:13th-century Arabs Category:14th-century Arabs Category:13th-century births Category:People from Ronda Category:People of the Emirate of Granada Category:Abbadid dynasty Category:Viziers of the Emirate of Granada Category:Murdered politicians Category:Poets of Al-Andalus ","title":"Abu Abdallah ibn al-Hakim"},{"id":"61324114","text":"Thais in Singapore refers to people who are holding Thai citizenship or people of Thai descent who were born or residing in Singapore.

They arrived by bus into Singapore by the thousands from Thailand to work on infrastructure projects around the country. Golden Mile Complex was a common pick up and drop off point for these buses resulting in the emergence of more Thai businesses such as restaurants, tour agencies, Thai newspaper stands around the area and the place was colloquially known by locals as 'Little Thailand'.
