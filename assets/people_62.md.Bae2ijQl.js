He is the founder of the Brazilian Labour Renewal Party (PRTB) and ran for president of Brazil in the elections of 2010 and 2014. He is particularly known in Brazil for his promise of building a bullet train system connecting S√£o Paulo and Rio de Janeiro (the aerotrem) and for his controversial declarations about homosexuals during a political debate in 2014. He has run for several political posts but to date has never won one. ==Biography== Fidelix was born in the town of Mutum, Minas Gerais in 1951 to Jarbas Fidelix, a merchant who worked in the field of transportation, and Lecy Ara√∫jo, an educator. He moved to Rio de Janeiro, then the capital of Brazil, and studied communication science at the Fluminense Federal University, but he did not graduate. He later became a journalist and professional advertiser. Fidelix is a Roman Catholic. At the age of 24, he founded the advertising agency Staff Publicidade and also worked as a design director at Art&Som; and Vogue Publicidade. As a journalist, he worked for Correio da Manh√£ and √öltima Hora, where he revised the Di√°rio Oficial da Uni√£o. Fidelix worked for the government as a communications assistant and created Agricultura Urgente, the first national bulletin of agriculture. Through Agricultura Urgente, he launched Brazil's first ecological campaign, which earned him a presidential medal. He co-founded the business magazine Governo e Empresa and the political magazine O Poder. Around 1976, he was the chief communications officer of Estanave, a company related to Petrobras. In 1982, he founded Interface, the first Brazilian magazine about informatics. In 1983, he moved to S√£o Paulo, where he worked for two years as an anchorman for TV Inform√°tika, a TV program about informatics, in which he interviewed specialists and politicians. ===Political career=== In 1984, he co-founded the Liberal Party with √Ålvaro Valle. In 1986, he disputed his first political election, running for State Deputy of S√£o Paulo, and received 735 votes. He later switched to the Renovator Labour Party and disputed his second election running for Federal Deputy. He received 541 votes. In 1989 and 1990, he worked as a communications assistant for Fernando Collor's presidential campaign. In 1994, he founded PRTB, his current party, and tried to run for president for the first time but was unable to register. He subsequently ran for Mayor of S√£o Paulo in 1996 (receiving 3,608 votes or 0,068% of the total), Governor of S√£o Paulo in 1998 (receiving 14,406 votes) and 2002 (8,654 votes), Alderman of S√£o Paulo in 2004 (3,382 votes), Federal Deputy in 2006 (5,518 votes) and Mayor of S√£o Paulo in 2008 (receiving 0,09% of the vote). In 2010, he ran for president of Brazil for the first time and was the seventh candidate to get the most votes (57,960 or 0,06% of the total). He ran for Mayor of S√£o Paulo in 2012 and again for President of Brazil in 2014, supporting the Brazilian military dictatorship. He received 446,878 votes (0,43% of the vote) and was again the seventh most voted; this was the closest he was in his career to winning an election. ==Statements about homosexuals== On September 29, 2014, during a debate among candidates of the 2014 presidential election hosted by RecordTV, Levy Fidelix stated that homosexuals \\"need psychological care\\" and were better kept \\"well away from [the rest of] us\\". He also said that Brazil's population of 200 million would be reduced by half if homosexuality were encouraged because \\"the excretory system\\" does not function as a means of reproduction.\\"Brazil presidential candidate airs homophobic rant during TV debate\\". The Guardian. 29 September 2014 He was asked to apologize but refused, believing that his statements were not offensive. Fidelix's statements were condemned by opponents like Jean Wyllys (PSOL), Marina Silva (PSB), A√©cio Neves (PSDB) and Dilma Rousseff (PT), who later won the election, as well as organizations such as ABGLT, the Green Party and even the Ministry of Human Rights. On the other hand, other notable conservative politicians, such as Jair Bolsonaro (PP) and religious personalities, like Silas Malafaia, declared their support for Fidelix. On March 13, 2015, S√£o Paulo's Court of Justice fined Fidelix with R$1 million for hate speech in his declarations. The court lifted the fine on February 3, 2017 but imposed a revised fine of R$25,000 on February 22. == Electoral performancePresidential=== { class= style=\\"text-align: right;\\" - !rowspan=2Election !rowspan=2Candidate !colspan=4First round !colspan=4Second round - !Votes !% !Position !Result !Votes !% !Position !Result - ! 2010   57,960  0.06%  7/9  Lost  ‚Äî  ‚Äî  ‚Äî  ‚Äî - - ! 2014   446,878  0.43%%  7/11  Lost  ‚Äî  ‚Äî  ‚Äî  ‚Äî - } == References == - - - - Category:1951 births Category:Living people Category:Brazilian anti-communists Category:Candidates for President of Brazil Category:Brazilian Labour Renewal Party politicians Category:Brazilian Roman Catholics Category:S√£o Paulo (state) politicians Category:Right-wing populism in South America ","title":"Levy Fidelix"},{"id":"56829586","text":"The 1936 World Table Tennis Championships ‚Äì Women's Doubles was the ninth edition of the women's doubles championship.

By cross-referencing his available filmographies, considering the timeline and references to his largely undocumented pre-Hollywood stage performances (1917-1929), and factoring in his uncredited work as a crowd extra in productions not included in his filmographies, Dorr's total appearances in the cited media no doubt far exceed 500 productions. His extensive filmography attests to his versatility as a supporting actor and reliability as a bit player. Although Dorr's screen roles are at times credited, the great majority of his work is uncredited, consisting of characters who have limited dialogue or appear briefly as extras. ==Early life and stage work== Harry Lester Dorr was born in Massachusetts in 1893, the oldest of 11 children of Mary E.

Later, in 1942, the 49-year-old Dorr registered again with the draft as a ‚Äúfree-lance actor‚Äù, but the record of his extensive work in Hollywood films between 1942 and 1945 attests that he also did not serve militarily in World War II, most likely due to his age. He was living then in Chicago, and on his registration papers he identified his occupation as \\"Theatre Producer\\", indicating that he was already involved in or was pursuing a career in entertainment by that time.‚ÄúLester Dorr‚Äù, Internet Movie Database (IMDb), a subsidiary of Amazon, Seattle, Washington.

Dorr married in 1920 and during the late 1920s‚Äîbefore moving to California to act in films‚Äîhe worked in stage productions in New York, including in Broadway dramas and musicals.

Dorr continued to appear regularly in studio productions throughout the 1940s, but with reduced frequency when compared to the preceding decade; nevertheless, he still added more than 140 Hollywood films to his r√©sum√© in that decade. His work on the \\"big screen\\" decreased even further in the 1950s as acting opportunities increased on television. He was, though, cast in at least 45 feature films and shorts during the 1950s, including small roles in some notable productions, such as Ace in the Hole, The Greatest Show in Earth, and East of Eden. In another, far more modest film-noir production from that period, Quicksand, Dorr portrays ‚ÄúBaldy‚Äù, a smooth-talking jeweler. His on- screen sales pitch in that role, in which he convinces the story's leading character Dan (Mickey Rooney) to buy a wristwatch, is typical of the concise, quick-study performances that defined Dorr‚Äôs career and made him so popular in cost-conscious studio casting offices. Dorr‚Äôs film work, however, began to draw to a close by the 1960s, when he served in bit parts in only five films.

His earliest work on television was in two 1951 episodes of the televised crime drama Boston Blackie, starring Kent Taylor. Dorr's supporting role as Tommy in an episode of that series titled \\"Blind Beggar\\" is formally credited, although his other role in \\"Oil Field Murder\\" is uncredited. As with his film career, Dorr‚Äôs 15 years of being cast in television series consisted predominantly of brief appearances on screen and portraying characters who had relatively few lines. Yet, his characterizations on television, like in films, were highly diverse and can be seen in at least 84 episodes of Westerns, crime and detective series, courtroom and hospital dramas, adventure programs, and sitcoms of the period.‚ÄúLester Dorr‚Äù, TV.com, CBS Interactive, San Francisco, California.

This may be due to its close proximity to the Missouri State University campus. The neighborhood's name derives from the N.M.

Although the decision is cited most frequently in relation to the potential liability of a bank to their customer, in the case itself the bank was a claimant, and the customer and its guarantor were seeking to defend their own liability on the basis of the bank's breach of duty. The decision attracted much comment, and the duty of banks outlined in the decision has come to be referred to as the Quincecare duty. Although the case was decided in February 1988, it was not subsequently reported in any of the major law reports until 1992, and even then it was reported solely in the All England Law Reports and none of the official law reports. However the significance of the case was recognised by the judiciary much earlier; shortly after the decision was handed down it was extensively cited with approval by the Court of Appeal in Lipkin Gorman (a Firm) v Karpnale Ltd [1989] 1 WLR 1340 (overturned by the House of Lords on other grounds). ==Facts== The main facts of the case appear in the judgment. Barclays Bank agreed to lend ¬£400,000 to Quincecare Ltd, a company formed specifically to purchase four chemists shops. The chairman of the company, Mr Harry Stiller, caused a sum of about ¬£340,000 to be drawn down and to be misapplied for his dishonest purposes. Mr Stiller was later sentenced to four years' imprisonment, but almost the entire sum was lost. The bank then sued the company as principal debtor, and its guarantor (a company called UniChem). Both the principal debtor and the guarantor defended the claim, and put forward counterclaims. The central issues related to the question whether the bank acted in breach of duty towards either the principal debtor or the guarantor. The trial judge, Steyn J summarised the principal issue as follows: ==Decision== The decision of the court was given by Steyn J. Having identified the central issue from the outset, much of the decision was a detailed review of the evidence to consider to what extent the bank knew, or ought to have known, of the fraudulent designs of Quincecare's chairman. This included a review of the dealings of the bank with Mr Stiller, and also consideration of expert evidence of the usual customs and practices of bankers. Although the company and its guarantor advanced a number of different defences, all of which were addressed in the judgment, the most important aspect of the judgment in terms of jurisprudence was the decision in relation to whether or not the bank was in breach of its duty to its customer by failing to be alive to possible fraud, and the test laid down by the court to be applied. The judgment briefly reviewed the principal authorities, being Selangor United Rubber Estates Ltd v Cradock (No 3) [1968] 1 WLR 1555 and Karak Rubber Co Ltd v Burden (No 2) [1972] 1 WLR 602, and the more recent first instance decision in Lipkin Gorman (a firm) v Karpnale Ltd [1987] 1 WLR 987 (subsequently appealed after the decision in Quincecare was handed down). In an oft-cited passage, Steyn J held that: He went on to stress that \\"trust, not distrust, is also the basis of a bank's dealings with its customers\\",[1992] 4 All ER 363 at 377E citing with approval similar comments from Bowen LJ in Sanders Bros v Maclean & Co (1883) 11 QBD 327 at 343.Bowen LJ's exact words were: \\"any one who attempts to follow and understand the law merchant will soon find himself lost if he begins by assuming that merchants conduct their business on the basis of attempting to insure themselves against fraudulent dealing. The contrary is the case. Credit, not distrust, is the basis of commercial dealings\\". Accordingly, he dismissed the defences and counterclaims of the defendants and gave judgment for the bank in the amount of the loan, plus interest and costs. ==Authority== The decision in Quincecare has been broadly accepted as authoritative ever since it was handed down. It is recognised as authoritative by leading academic texts. It was cited with approval almost immediately after it was decided by the Court of Appeal in Lipkin Gorman (a Firm) v Karpnale Ltd [1989] 1 WLR 1340, which is now the leading authority in this area of the law. It has also been cited with approval in various other cases including, , and . Despite the consternation the decision caused, since Quincecare was decided there has been only one judicial decision in the United Kingdom where a bank has been held to be liable for breaching the Quincecare duty. ==Footnotes== Category:1988 in British law Category:1988 in case law Category:English banking case law Quincecare Ltd ","title":"Barclays Bank plc v Quincecare Ltd"},{"id":"56830210","text":"The 1939 World Table Tennis Championships ‚Äì Women's Doubles was the 12th edition of the women's doubles championship.

It is a terrestrial species, with a small tuber and small greenish flowers, found in damp places. It has a complicated taxonomic history, having been transferred between genera several times. When placed in a genus on its own it is correctly known as Dithrix griffithii. In 2015, it was transferred to the genus Gennaria. ==Description== Gennaria griffithii is a terrestrial orchid, up to 17 cm tall. It has a small underground tuber, 20‚Äì30 mm in diameter. There are two or three leaves, 16‚Äì18 mm long by 7‚Äì14 mm wide. The inflorescence consists of a raceme of 7‚Äì12 flowers on a stem (scape) 12‚Äì16 cm tall. The flowers which appear in early April in their native habitat are greenish, 5‚Äì8 mm long, opening only slightly. The lateral sepals are fused at the base with the labellum, which is tri-lobed, the middle lobe being longer. A small spur is present, 1 mm long. ==TaxonomyNomenclature=== The nomenclature of this species is complicated, as was explained by Kanchi Gandhi and Paul Omerod in 2012. The species was first described by Joseph Dalton Hooker in 1890. He initially called it \\"Habenaria decipiens\\", but later realized that this name had already been published for a different species, and so named it Habenaria griffithii. In 1899, Friedrich Kraenzlin transferred H. griffithii to Diphylax as Diphylax griffithii. In 1929, K√°roly So√≥ von Bere attempted to transfer the species to its own separate genus, under the name \\"Dithrix decipiens\\". This was doubly invalid, because the genus name \\"Dithrix\\" had not been validly published, and griffithii rather than \\"decipiens\\" was the published epithet for the species. However, the invalid names were incorrectly included in various sources, including Names in Current Use for Extant Plant Genera published in 1993. This led to the \\"inadvertent validation\\" of Dithrix , although this was not understood until Gandhi and Omerod's paper in 2012. Unaware that Dithrix had been validated, Xiao-Hua Jin and De-Zhu Li published a new genus name and combination for the species, calling it \\"Nujiangia griffithii\\". However, this was a superfluous name. If Hooker's Habenaria griffithii is placed in a separate monotypic genus, then the name that should be used is Dithrix griffithii . ===Phylogeny and classification=== Gennaria griffithii was known for a long time to be isolated within the original genus in which it was placed (Habenaria). In his original description, Hooker had proposed a separate section, Habenaria sect. Dithrix, which later became the genus Dithrix. Kraenzlin placed it in the genus Diphylax (now subsumed into Habenaria). Phylogenetic studies in 2012 and 2014 suggested that it was most closely related to Gennaria, falling outside the main clades containing Habenaria species. This finding was initially used to justify placing H. griffithii in a monospecific genus as Dithrix griffithii. In 2015, an alternative proposal was put forward, namely to move the species into Gennaria. , this proposal has been accepted by sources such as the World Checklist of Selected Plant Families, and Plants of the World Online. A 2014 cladogram for the subtribe Habenariinae shows the two species now placed in Gennaria to be basal within one of the three main \\"superclades\\" (labelled C, D and E) making up the tribe: ==Distribution and habitat== Gennaria griffithii is native from Afghanistan through Pakistan and the western Himalayas into China (Yunnan). It is also found in south-west India. It typically grows along the banks of rivers. ==References External links == * * Category:Orchideae Category:Flora of Afghanistan Category:Flora of South- Central China Category:Flora of India (region) Category:Flora of Pakistan Category:Flora of West Himalaya Category:Plants described in 1890 ","title":"Gennaria griffithii"},{"id":"56830249","text":"The 2018 Copa Colsanitas (also known as the 2018 Claro Open Colsanitas for sponsorship reasons) was a women's tennis tournament played on outdoor clay courts.

His paternal family, formed by cattle ranchers and owners of refrigerators, had provided political pictures to the former Parana Republican Party. His grandfather, Affonso Alves de Camargo, was a state deputy for four terms (1898-1914), federal deputy (1921-1922), senator (1922-1927), and president of the State of Paran√° twice (1916-1920) and 1928-1930) during the Old Republic. It occupied this last position when the outbreak of Revolution of 1930. Affonso Camargo Netto was married to Gina Flores de Camargo, daughter of Fernando Flores, constituent of 1946 and federal deputy for Paran√° between 1946 and 1955, with whom she had five children, of whom two adopted. He married for the second time in March 1994 with Nadir de Santa Maria de Camargo, with whom he had a son. == Biography == Civil Engineer graduated from the Federal University of Paran√° in 1952, worked in the private initiative until approaching the then governor Ney Braga who named him successively director of the Department of Water and Electric Energy of Paran√° and Secretary of Justice being elected deputy governor in 1964. Political opponent of Paulo Pimentel, changed the old Democratic Christian Party by the Brazilian Democratic Movement after the institution of bipartisanship by the military dictatorship in Brazil (1964-1985). Such political option made him break with Ney Braga being by this one derelict in the dispute to the Senate in 1966. Later, Ney Braga and Paulo Pimentel broke up politically, and Afonso Camargo recomposed his alliance with his former political godfather, a fact that led him to the presidency of the State Bank of Paran√° and to be Secretary of Finance (1973-1974). Elected president of the regional directory of the ARENA in 1975 was indicated [bionic position] in 1978.

Secretary General of the party, was indicated in 1985 after the election of Tancredo Neves to the Presidency of the Republic and with the death of this one was kept in the portfolio by Jose Sarney. In this period, he created the vale-transporte and thus became known by the nickname of \\"the father of the transport valley\\". After leaving the government was reelected senator in 1986. Afonso Camargo left the PMDB in the first year of his new term and was candidate to the presidency of the Republic in 1989, without passing the first shift. In the next round he supported the candidacy of Fernando Collor, whom he served again as Minister of Transport during the last months of his administration when he also held the Communications portfolio.

Workplace robotics safety is an aspect of occupational safety and health when robots are used in the workplace. This includes traditional industrial robots as well as emerging technologies such as drone aircraft and wearable robotic exoskeletons. Types of accidents include collisions, crushing, and injuries from mechanical parts. Hazard controls include physical barriers, good work practices, and proper maintenance. == Background == Many workplace robots are industrial robots used in manufacturing. According to the International Federation of Robotics, 1.7 million new robots are expected to be used in factories between 2017 and 2020. Emerging robot technologies include collaborative robots, personal care robots, construction robots, exoskeletons, autonomous vehicles, and drone aircraft (also known as unmanned aerial vehicles or UAVs). Advances in automation technologies (e.g. fixed robots, collaborative and mobile robots, and exoskeletons) have the potential to improve work conditions but also to introduce workplace hazards in manufacturing workplaces.[1] Fifty-six percent of robot injuries are classified as pinch injuries and 44% of injuries are classified as impact injuries. A 1987 study found that line workers are at the greatest risk, followed by maintenance workers, and programmers. Poor workplace design and human error caused most injuries. Despite the lack of occupational surveillance data on injuries associated specifically with robots, researchers from the US National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) identified 61 robot-related deaths between 1992 and 2015 using keyword searches of the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) Census of Fatal Occupational Injuries research database (see info from Center for Occupational Robotics Research). Using data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, NIOSH and its state partners have investigated 4 robot-related fatalities under the Fatality Assessment and Control Evaluation Program. In addition the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) has investigated robot-related deaths and injuries, which can be reviewed at OSHA Accident Search page. Injuries and fatalities could increase over time because of the increasing number of collaborative and co-existing robots, powered exoskeletons, and autonomous vehicles into the work environment. Safety standards are being developed by the Robotic Industries Association (RIA) in conjunction with the American National Standards Institute (ANSI).[2] On October 5, 2017, OSHA, NIOSH and RIA signed an alliance to work together to enhance technical expertise, identify and help address potential workplace hazards associated with traditional industrial robots and the emerging technology of human-robot collaboration installations and systems, and help identify needed research to reduce workplace hazards. On October 16 NIOSH launched the Center for Occupational Robotics Research to \\"provide scientific leadership to guide the development and use of occupational robots that enhance worker safety, health, and well being\\". So far, the research needs identified by NIOSH and its partners include: tracking and preventing injuries and fatalities, intervention and dissemination strategies to promote safe machine control and maintenance procedures, and on translating effective evidence-based interventions into workplace practice. == Hazards == Many hazards and injuries can result from the use of robots in the workplace. Some robots, notably those in a traditional industrial environment, are fast and powerful. This increases the potential for injury as one swing from a robotic arm, for example, could cause serious bodily harm. There are additional risks when a robot malfunctions or is in need of maintenance. A worker who is working on the robot may be injured because a malfunctioning robot is typically unpredictable. For example, a robotic arm that is part of a car assembly line may experience a jammed motor. A worker who is working to fix the jam may suddenly get hit by the arm the moment it becomes unjammed. Additionally, if a worker is standing in a zone that is overlapping with nearby robotic arms, he or she may get injured by other moving equipment. There are four types of accidents that can occur with robots: impact or collision accidents, crushing and trapping accidents, mechanical part accidents, and other accidents. Impact or collision accidents occur generally from malfunctions and unpredicted changes. Crushing and trapping accidents occur when a part of a worker's body becomes trapped or caught on robotic equipment. Mechanical part accidents can occur when a robot malfunctions and starts to \\"break down\\", where the ejection of parts or exposed wire can cause serious injury. Other accidents at just general accidents that occur from working with robots. There are seven sources of hazards that are associated with human interaction with robots and machines: human errors, control errors, unauthorized access, mechanical failures, environmental sources, power systems, and improper installation. Human errors could be anything from one line of incorrect code to a loose bolt on a robotic arm. Many hazards can stem from human-based error. Control errors are intrinsic and are usually not controllable nor predictable. Unauthorized access hazards occur when a person who is not familiar with the area enters the domain of a robot. Mechanical failures can happen at any time, and a faulty unit is usually unpredictable. Environmental sources are things such as electromagnetic or radio interference in the environment that can cause a robot to malfunction. Power systems are pneumatic, hydraulic, or electrical power sources; these power sources can malfunction and cause fires, leaks, or electrical shocks. Improper installation is fairly self-explanatory; a loose bolt or an exposed wire can lead to inherent hazards. ===Emerging technologies=== Emerging robotic technologies can reduce hazards to workers, but can also introduce new hazards. For example, robotic exoskeletons can be used in construction to reduce load to the spine, improve posture, and reduce fatigue; however, they can also increase chest pressure, limit mobility when moving out of the way of a falling object, and cause balance problems. Unmanned aerial vehicles are being used in the construction industry to do monitoring and inspections of buildings under construction. This reduces the need for humans to be in hazardous locations, but the risk of a UAV collision presents a hazard to workers. For collaborative robots, isolation is not possible. Possible hazard controls include collision avoidance systems, and making the robot less stiff to lessen the impact force. == Hazard controls == There are a few ways to prevent injuries by implementing hazard controls. There can be risk assessments at each of the various stages of a robot's development. Risk assessments can help gather information about a robot's status, how well it is being maintained, and if repairs are needed soon. By being aware of the status of a robot, injuries can be prevented and hazards reduced. Safeguarding devices can be implemented to reduce the risk of injuries. These can include engineering controls such as physical barriers, guard rails, presence-sensing safeguarding devices, etc. Awareness devices are usually used in conjunction with safeguarding devices. They are usually a system of rope or chain barriers with lights, signs, whistles, and horns. Their purpose it to be able to alert workers or personnel of certain dangers. Operator safeguards can also be in place. These usually utilize safeguarding devices to protect the operator and reduce risk of injury. Additionally, when an operator is within close proximity of a robot, the working speed of the robot can be reduced to insure that the operator is in full control. This can be done by placing the robot in the manual or teach mode. It is also crucial to inform the programmer of the robot of what type of work the robot will be doing, how it will interact with other robots, and how it will work in relation to an operator. Proper maintenance of robotic equipment is also critical in order to reduce hazards. Maintaining a robot insures that it continues to function properly, thereby reducing the risks associated with a malfunction. == Regulations == Some existing regulations regarding robots and robotic systems include: * ANSI/RIA R15.06 * OSHA 29 CFR 1910.333 * OSHA 29 CFR 1910.147 * ISO 10218 * ISO/TS 15066 * ISO/DIS 13482 == External links == * Center for Occupational Robotics Research of the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, in the U.S. == References == Category:Industrial robotics Category:Occupational hazards Category:Workplace Category:Robotics Category:Military robots Category:Cybernetics Category:Occupational safety and health ","title":"Workplace robotics safety"},{"id":"56830464","text":"C√©cile Hernandez-Cervellon (born 20 June 1974), who also competes as C√©cile Hernandez, is a French para-snowboarder and three-time Paralympic medallist, with a silver medal from Sochi 2014 and both a silver and a bronze from PyeongChang 2018.

The film stars Douglas Booth, Colson Baker, Daniel Webber, and Iwan Rheon. Talks of a M√∂tley Cr√ºe biopic began as early as 2006, when Paramount Pictures and MTV Films purchased the rights to the book The Dirt: Confessions of the World's Most Notorious Rock Band by the band and Neil Strauss. However the project then languished in development hell for over a decade, going through numerous directors and cast members before Netflix purchased the rights in March 2017. Filming began around New Orleans in February 2018. The Dirt was released digitally on Netflix on March 22, 2019. It received generally negative reviews from critics, who said the film would please fans but that it hesitated \\"in handling the more troubling aspects of the band's history.\\" ==Plot== In 1973, Frank Carlton Feranna Jr. walks away from his drunk mother Deana after years of abusive stepfathers and moves from Seattle to Los Angeles in 1978. After a failed attempt to connect with his biological father, Frank legally changes his name to \\"Nikki Sixx\\" in 1980. A year later, after a falling out with members of London at the Whisky a Go Go, Nikki befriends drummer Tommy Lee and reveals to him that he is forming a new band. Joining the band is guitarist Mick Mars, who suffers from ankylosing spondylitis. The trio then recruit lead vocalist Vince Neil from the cover band Rock Candy, and after some brainstorming, the quartet name themselves M√∂tley Cr√ºe. Despite being involved in a brawl with some crowd members, M√∂tley Cr√ºe's first gig at the Starwood becomes well-received, and they progressively sell out all over L.A.'s night clubs until rookie producer Tom Zutaut of Elektra Records approaches them with a five-album deal and they sign Doc McGhee as their manager. During their first national tour, the band is given advice by Ozzy Osbourne to know the limits of their partying before he snorts some ants and licks his and Nikki's urine on the pool floor. Before long, the band's albums go platinum and they each spend millions of dollars as fast as they earn them. Vince marries mud wrestler Sharise Ruddell, while Tommy announces his engagement to a woman named Roxie, but after his mother calls her a groupie, they get into a heated argument with Tommy punching Roxie in the face. On December 8, 1984, during a party at Vince's home in Redondo Beach, California, Tommy meets Heather Locklear. Vince and Hanoi Rocks drummer Razzle drive out to buy more drinks and get into a car accident that kills Razzle and has Vince sentenced to 30 days in jail for vehicular manslaughter, which is subsequently reduced to 19 days. Nikki becomes addicted to heroin and starts to display destructive behavior towards his bandmates. He fires McGhee for bringing Deana to visit him. On December 23, 1987, shortly after Tommy and Heather's wedding, Nikki overdoses on heroin and is initially declared dead, but a paramedic who is a big fan of the band brings him back to life with two shots of adrenaline. Following this, Nikki has the band go to rehab. A sober M√∂tley Cr√ºe rebounds in 1989 with Dr. Feelgood, which becomes their first number one album on the Billboard 200, followed by a lengthy world tour. The months of touring and staying sober take their toll on Vince and Tommy, who resort to drinking again after being away from their families for too long. Following the tour, Vince discovers that Sharise and their daughter Skylar have left him, causing him to miss several rehearsals and eventually part ways with the band in 1992. The band then hires John Corabi as his replacement. In 1995, Skylar dies of stomach cancer at the age of four. Heather divorces Tommy after he is caught having an affair with a porn star. Seeing the backlash by fans over Vince's departure from the band, Nikki negotiates with Zutaut to give them back the rights to their songs in exchange for their release from Elektra Records. After visiting his father's grave, Nikki regroups with Tommy and Mick, who has had hip surgery, before they reconcile with Vince.

At the time, Larry Charles was tapped to direct the film. However, production on the film stalled and in 2008 Sixx spoke of his frustration in an interview stating: In November 2013, Jeff Tremaine signed on to helm The Dirt, with the film having been dropped by MTV Films and Paramount Pictures. In January 2015, Focus Features picked up rights to the film. However, production languished in development hell until March 2017, when Netflix bought worldwide rights to the film. At the time, Liam Hemsworth, Emory Cohen, and Douglas Booth were being eyed for lead roles in the film. In November 2017, Booth officially signed on to star in the film. In January 2018, Machine Gun Kelly, Iwan Rheon and Daniel Webber joined the cast. In February 2018, Tony Cavalero joined the cast. In March 2018, Rebekah Graf, Leven Rambin, and David Costabile joined the cast. Principal production commenced in February 2018 in New Orleans, Louisiana. ===Accident=== On March 11, 2018, Louis DiVincenti, a rigging grip for the production team, suffered an electric shock while de-rigging a set during the New Orleans shoot. According to DiVincenti, he was passing metal pipes to other crew members when one pipe he held made contact with a nearby power line, causing an electrical current that arced through his body and blew out through his right foot. As a result, he sustained second- and third-degree burns over 50 percent of his body, which required numerous surgeries and skin grafts, and his right foot had to be amputated. On March 1, 2019, DiVincenti sued Netflix and M√∂tley Cr√ºe for $1.8 million to compensate for his medical bills. ===Marketing=== The trailer was released on February 19, 2019 and featured glimpses of some of the stories including the infamous hotel TV throwing incident, Vince Neil's vehicular manslaughter charges in 1984, and Nikki Sixx's drug overdose in 1987. ==Critical reception== On Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 38% based on 72 reviews, with an average rating of 4.65/10. The website's critical consensus reads, \\"The Dirt celebrates the rude debauchery that M√∂tley Cr√ºe's fans enjoy -- but does so with the dispiriting lack of substance that the group's critics have long decried.\\" On Metacritic the film has a weighted average score of 39 out of 100, based on 17 critics, indicating \\"general unfavorable reviews\\". David Fear of Rolling Stone gave the film a rating of two out of five stars, saying that \\"This is rock bad-boy lore as a rocking bore, an endless parade of recreated afterparty ecstasy and emptiness that robs The Dirt of the vicarious thrill it had on the page ‚Äî the sense that you shouldn‚Äôt be having this much of a second-hand high reading about musicians acting like horrible people but still seeming living-the-dream heroic.\\" Owen Gleiberman of Variety called the film \\"a thinly written, generically staged VH1-style sketchbook of a movie ‚Äî which is to say, it's a Netflix film, with zero atmosphere, overly blunt lighting, and a threadbare post-psychological telegraphed quality that gives you nothing to read between the lines.\\" Brian Tallerico of RogerEbert.com gave the film one out of four stars, saying that \\"You could listen to Dr. Feelgood two full times during the run time of The Dirt and learn just about as much about the band as you do in this R-rated Wikipedia article of a movie. And you'd have way more fun.\\" Chris Nashawaty of Entertainment Weekly gave the film a B, saying that \\"This movie won't win any awards. Nor should it. But for two hours it's a nostalgic blast to sit back and revel in the idiocy of these glorious, big-haired jackasses.\\" Rafer Guzm√°n of Newsday gave the film three out of four stars, calling it \\"a funny, foul-mouthed, whirlwind ride through one of the last great eras in rock history, when wretched excess was part of the job description and bad behavior was a badge of honor.\\" ==Soundtrack== The Dirt Soundtrack was released by M√∂tley Records and Eleven Seven Records on March 22, 2019, on CD, LP, and digital formats. == References  External links == * * Category:2019 films Category:2010s biographical films Category:2010s comedy-drama films Category:2010s coming-of-age films Category:2010s musical films Category:American films Category:American biographical films Category:American comedy-drama films Category:American musical films Category:American rock music films Category:Biographical films about musicians Category:Coming-of-age drama films Category:Coming-of-age films based on actual events Category:Cultural depictions of American men Category:Cultural depictions of rock musicians Category:Drama films based on actual events Category:English- language films Category:Films about cancer Category:Films about drugs Category:Films about heroin addiction Category:Films about musical groups Category:Films set in 1967 Category:Films set in 1971 Category:Films set in 1973 Category:Films set in 1978 Category:Films set in 1980 Category:Films set in 1981 Category:Films set in 1982 Category:Films set in 1983 Category:Films set in 1984 Category:Films set in 1985 Category:Films set in 1987 Category:Films set in 1989 Category:Films set in 1990 Category:Films set in 1992 Category:Films set in 1995 Category:Films set in Los Angeles Category:Films set in Seattle Category:Films set in Sydney Category:Films shot in Los Angeles Category:Films shot in New Orleans Category:Heavy metal films Category:M√∂tley Cr√ºe Category:Musical films based on actual events Category:English-language Netflix original films Category:Self-reflexive films Category:2019 comedy films Category:2019 drama films ","title":"The Dirt (film)"},{"id":"56830501","text":"Lillian Holland Harvey, Dean of Tuskegee School for Nurses Lillian Holland Harvey (1912‚Äì1994) was an American nurse, educator and doctor known for her contributions to medical education. She was an activist for the equal rights of African Americans. Harvey's accomplishments were achieved at a time in history when both African Americans and women faced extreme discrimination in academics and the medical field. She was seen as a leader in her community and led a successful professional and personal life. == Education and career == Harvey was an African American woman born in the town of Holland, Virginia.Harris, Duchess, and Duchess Harris. Black Feminist Politics from Kennedy to Clinton. Basingstoke: Palgrave Macmillan, 2011. pg78 After graduating from high school she moved to New York to attend the Lincoln Hospital School of Nursing. Harvey received her nursing diploma in 1939, going on to study at Columbia University where she eventually graduated and earned her bachelor's degree in the year 1944. Her dedication to further her own knowledge as well as teaching others led to the completion of a master's at Columbia University's Teachers College in 1948. Later, she re-enrolled at Columbia to receive her doctorate degree in 1966. Established in September 1892, Tuskegee School for Nurses was a historically black nursing school that offered only a three-year nursing program beginning 1908. Harvey became director of nurse training in 1945 and in 1948 became Dean. In 1949 she initiated a process of turning the diploma program into a baccalaureate program. It would be the first of its kind in the state of Alabama. In 1953 nursing students were now able to receive a Bachelor's of Science in Nursing. The program was fully accredited by the National League for Nursing in 1957. Within the program, students could gain hands on experience both in their home state at the John A. Andrew Hospital as well as outside, which included medical practices in Massachusetts, Florida, New York, and Connecticut. Harvey served as the Dean of Nursing at Tuskegee Institute for twenty five years before retiring in 1973. After retirement she was active in the National Negro Business and Professional Women's club. In addition to this, Harvey went on to serve as a member of the Board of Directors of the National League for Nursing. She was involved in multiple distinguished organizations including American Red Cross, the Kellogg Foundation, and the American Journal of Nursing Company. Harvey was also an advisor in the U.S. Public Health Service's committee for Professional Traineeships. == Accomplishments == Throughout her career and afterwards Harvey received much accolade for her contributions. She was a recipient of the Mary Mahoney Award from the American Nurses Association National Awards Program in 1982 and in 1992 the Tuskegee University Board of Trustees named the Nurses Home ‚ÄúLillian Holland Harvey Hall‚Äù in Harvey's honor. In 1999, Harvey was elected into the Alabama Healthcare Hall of Fame. She was also a 2001 Alabama Nursing Hall of Fame Inductee and the Alabama State Nurses' Association had an award set up in her name. == Civil rights == Harvey was involved in civil rights activism and desegregation. During WWII, she used her position as the Dean of the Tuskegee School for Nurses to train black nurses for military service and created opportunities for them to enter the Army Nurse Corps. She worked to desegregate the Alabama Nurses‚Äô Association by attending their meetings, an 80-mile drive from Tuskegee to Montgomery and at these meetings, she was required to sit in a separate section. Despite this discrimination, she still made her voice prominent in these meetings and advocated for nurses and nursing students. Harvey was also a member of the education committee of the President's Commission for the Status of Women (PCSW). The PCSW, founded by Esther Peterson during the Kennedy administration, focused on the changing social roles of American women in the 1960s regarding employment, home and family life, and civil and political rights143. Peterson ensured that black women were included in the Commission; however, Harvey was the only African American woman on the education committee. The primary purpose of the education committee was to discuss social concerns such as ‚Äúthe need for day care, the value of volunteers, the nature of women‚Äôs home life, and preparation for female adulthood.\\" Specifically, Harvey advocated for the improvement of urban settings, and wanted ‚Äúthe African American community to support its own needs.\\" == Personal life == Harvey was married to Baptist minister Reverend Raymond Francis Harvey and together they had three children.Shaw, Stephanie J. What Women Ought to Be and Do: Black Professional Women Workers in the Jim Crow Era. Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1996. Pg 234 Harvey died in 1994 at the age of eighty-two, just two years after her husband. ==Legacy== Harvey's leadership impacted the lives of many young African Americans and her dedication as Dean of Nursing influenced progression towards equal opportunity in both education and civil rights. == References  Further reading == * Bellamy, Verdelle B.

Originally residing in Illinois, Vasen moved to Philadelphia for a few brief years before relocating to Los Angeles in 1905. Vasen became interested in obstetrics and gynecology at a very young age. Vasen was exposed to pregnancy and raising children because her mother had nine children. Women choosing a career in the medical field was uncommon at this time. In 1911, Vasen met Saul Frank, a newly retired businessman. The couple married in 1915 and settled in Glendale. Frank died of a heart attack on August 24, 1924, Vasen never remarried. Vasen died on August 21, 1944 from complications of a cerebral hemorrhage. She was buried in East Los Angeles in Home of Peace Memorial Park. == Education == Until age 16, Vasen attended public school in Quincy. After finishing her public school education, Vasen began studying with Dr. Melinda Knapheide-Germann. Knapheide-Germann was one of the first female doctors to practice medicine in Quincy. Vasen trained with Knapheide- Germann for the next two years. In 1890, Vasen began studying medicine at the Keokuk College of Medicine. Keokuk was the first coeducation American medical college specializing in gynecology and obstetrics practices. She graduated on March 8, 1892, the first Jewish female graduate in the college history. In 1897, Vasen enrolled in postgraduate training in obstetrics in Philadelphia. During this time, Vasen began a physician and then the superintendent at the Jewish Maternity House. == Medical career == Upon graduation, she moved back to her hometown of Quincy, Illinois and began practicing as an obstetrician at the local hospital. Vasen had spent her life invested in the Jewish community, and in 1898 she accepted a position as a physician and superintendent at Philadelphia's Jewish Maternity Home. In 1904, Vasen made the decision to move to California and there she continued her medical career. Upon arrival in California, she began working as a physician and supervisor at Kaspare Cohn Hospital. She was the second Jewish female to practice medicine in California. Vasen was the first Jewish female to hold a supervising position and a position as a physician at Kaspare Cohn.Rodman, E. J. (2014, November 12). Three pioneering Jewish women doctors. Retrieved from http://jewishjournal.com/news/los_angeles/140304/ She was recognized publicly for her incredibly efficient and careful work at Kaspare Cohn. Vasen enjoyed her work as an OBGYN and supervisor, but in 1910 she decided to take a different route. She opened a private maternity clinic which she ran successfully for many years. Vasen also spent much of her time volunteering her services to help the poor Jewish community. She was very active in the Jewish community and the Los Angeles community as a whole. Vasen retired from her medical career in 1915, shortly after her marriage to Saul Frank.Abrams, J. E. (2006). Jewish women pioneering the frontier trail: A history in the American West. New York, NY: New York Univ. Press. === Work in the Jewish community === Sarah Vasen was raised in a Jewish home and Jewish community. She devoted her medical career to the underprivileged in the Jewish community of Los Angeles, specifically the women and children. Vasen contributed a great deal to the Jewish community when she served as a physician and superintendent at Philadelphia's Jewish Maternity Home in the years following her graduation from medical school. The Jewish Maternity Home was a place for Jewish immigrants seeking medical care, but that were too poor to afford it anywhere else. Sarah Vasen also devoted her time to the education of the Jewish community. She was a prominent figure in the Jewish religious school for children. Vasen, then residing in Glendale, took part in organizing a religious school for the children of the town's Jewish community. == References == Category:1870 births Category:1944 deaths Category:American women physicians Category:Jewish physicians Category:Jewish women ","title":"Sarah Vasen"},{"id":"56830609","text":"Misia Summer Soul Jazz 2017 was a concert tour by Japanese singer Misia to promote her second extended play, Misia Soul Jazz Session.

It was introduced in 2014 by Frederic Laloux in his book on Reinventing Organizations. It also rests on previous studies done by evolutionary and social psychologists including Jean Gebser, Clare W. Graves, Don Edward Beck, Chris Cowan and Ken Wilber who explored the stages of development and impact of human consciousness.\\"Human Nature Prepares for a Momentous Leap\\", by Clare W. Graves, in The Futurist, 1974\\"Charted Levels of Existence as seen by Clare W. Graves\\", in The Futurist, 1974 == Overview == A Teal organisation is defined by the three following ideas in contrast to the paradigms of Amber, Orange and Green organisations.: # self-management suggests a system based on peer relationships with no need for hierarchy, consensus, nor central command and control;https://bizzmarkblog.com/teal-management-use-traditional-business- processes/ # wholeness is about enabling employees to present their full personas rather than just their work personas; # evolutionary purpose is the idea to follow the natural evolution of how the organization growshttps://bizzmarkblog.com/teal-management-use-traditional-business- processes/ The paradigm is that an organization is similar to an organism in that the inner biology of the organism operates autonomously to sustain its health. This includes adapting to change, enabling employees to bring all their skills to the organization and to do so without direct leadership. == Examples == A number of notable organisations around the world have adopted and operate with the Teal organisation model including The Morning Star Company (food processing, United States), Patagonia (apparel, United States), Sounds True (media, United States), AES (energy sector, international), Buurtzorg Nederland (health care, Netherlands), ESBZ (K‚Äì12 school, Germany), Heiligenfeld (mental health hospitals, Germany), Nucor (steel manufacturing, international), Varkey Foundation (non-profit organisation with expertise in Education), Thomsen Trampedach (brand protection, Denmark). ==See also== * Alternative Theory of Organization and Management * Holacracy * Holistic management * Organizational culture * Organization development * Organizational theory * Workers' self-management == References Further reading== *Frederic Laloux, Reinventing Organizations: A Guide to Creating Organizations Inspired by the Next Stage of Human Consciousness.

She was married to Wu Chun-li, who was elected to the Taitung County magistracy in 2005. Wu was suspended immediately after inauguration on charges of corruption and subsequently divorced Kuang so she could run for his post in her own right, as Taiwanese law forbid the appointment of spouses or other relatives as a magisterial deputy. Kuang joined the Kuomintang and won the Taitung magisterial by-election in April 2006, over three independent candidates. During her term, broadband internet access was installed throughout Taitung County. During the transitional justice referendum of 2008, she was a proponent of two-step voting, in which voters mark one ballot for political candidates before receiving a separate ballot for referendum questions. Kuang presided over the eighth Festival of Austronesian Culture and the Taitung portion of the 2007 Wan-an exercise, an annual air-raid drill. She became well-known for promoting tourism to Taitung County. Kuang was often abroad, and, when Typhoon Fung-wong hit Taiwan in July 2008, she was criticized for remaining in Italy on junket. Shortly after an investigation into her travels led by the Kuomintang's Evaluation and Discipline Committee began in August 2008, Kuang met with the Taitung County Prosecutors' Office for questioning. It was found that Kuang spent over NT$10 million on eight junkets abroad since taking office as magistrate. The Kuomintang suspended her party membership in August 2008. The Taitung Prosecutors' Office continued investigating Kuang into January 2009. Later that month, the Control Yuan impeached her, after choosing not to do so in December 2008. Throughout 2009, Kuang ranked low in performance polls run by the China Times and Global Views. Despite losing a KMT primary to Justin Huang in May 2009, she was expected to campaign for a full term in that year's magisterial elections. In October, a month after the Taitung District Prosecutors Office stated that Kuang would not be indicted on corruption charges, she announced that she would support Huang's magisterial candidacy. Speculation that the Kuomintang had offered to nominate Kuang or Wu Chun-li to contest Huang's vacant legislative seat if Kuang withdrew from the magisterial election soon arose. The Kuomintang chose to run polls that would decide the nomination. Kuang registered for the election before poll results were revealed, managing to win the Kuomintang's support because her opponent was deemed ineligible to contest the nomination. Kuang faced Democratic Progressive Party member Lai Kun-cheng in the legislative election, and lost. The Central Election Commission released a list of candidates contesting the Taitung magistracy on 31 August 2018, which included Kuang. After the Kuomintang expelled her on 28 September, Kuang chose to remain in the race as an independent candidate. {class=\\" collapsible\\" style=\\"text- align:center\\" - ! colspan=\\"6\\"2018 Taitung County mayoral results - !width=35 No. !width=150 Candidate !width=120 Party !width=75 Votes !width=75 Percentage !width=49 -  1 Kuang Li-chen20px Independentstyle=\\"border-left:4px solid #000000;\\" align=\\"right\\"3,049 align=\\"right\\"2.55% align=\\"center\\" -  2 Liu Chao-hao (ÂäâÊ´ÇË±™)Democratic Progressive Partystyle=\\"border-left:4px solid #1B9413;\\" align=\\"right\\"44,264 align=\\"right\\"37.04% align=\\"center\\" -  3 Huang Yu-pin (ÈªÉË£ïÊñå)20px Independentstyle=\\"border-left:4px solid #000000;\\" align=\\"right\\"640 align=\\"right\\"0.54% align=\\"center\\" -  4 Peng Chuan-kuo (ÂΩ≠Ê¨äÂúã)20px Independentstyle=\\"border-left:4px solid #000000;\\" align=\\"right\\"988 align=\\"right\\"0.83% align=\\"center\\" -  5 Rao Ching-ling20px Kuomintangstyle=\\"border-left:4px solid #000099;\\" align=\\"right\\"70,577 align=\\"right\\"59.05% align=\\"center\\"20px - bgcolor=EEEEEE  colspan=\\"3\\" align=\\"right\\"  Total voters  colspan=\\"3\\" align=\\"left\\"  179,706 - bgcolor=EEEEEE  colspan=\\"3\\" align=\\"right\\"  Valid votes  colspan=\\"3\\" align=\\"left\\"  119,518 - bgcolor=EEEEEE  colspan=\\"3\\" align=\\"right\\"  Invalid votes  colspan=\\"3\\" align=\\"left\\"  - bgcolor=EEEEEE  colspan=\\"3\\" align=\\"right\\"  Voter turnout  colspan=\\"3\\" align=\\"left\\"  66.51% } ==References== Category:1963 births Category:Living people Category:Kuomintang politicians in Taiwan Category:Magistrates of Taitung County Category:Taiwanese women in politics Category:Expelled members of the Kuomintang ","title":"Kuang Li-chen"},{"id":"56830807","text":"Abe Bonnema (6 September 1926 ‚Äì 9 August 2001) was a Dutch architect.rkd.nl He studied architectural engineering at the Delft University of Technology.

The team began play in the 2018‚Äì19 ECHL season with home games at Mile One Centre. They are members in the North Division of the Eastern Conference and are affiliated with the Toronto Maple Leafs of the National Hockey League and Toronto Marlies of the American Hockey League. ==History== The search for a new professional hockey team for St. John's began after the departure of the St. John's IceCaps of the American Hockey League. In July 2016, the Montreal Canadiens, who owned the franchise used by the club, confirmed the relocation of the team to the newly constructed Place Bell arena in Laval, Quebec, for the start of the 2017‚Äì18 season. Danny Williams, who ran the IceCaps and owned the team's intellectual property, stated his intentions to find another franchise with the AHL or another league. From that point two rival groups formed. The first were the operators of the St. John's Edge basketball team and current occupants of the Mile One Centre, who looked to secure a Quebec Major Junior Hockey League franchise for the arena. The other, led by local businessman Dean MacDonald and including ice hockey executive Glenn Stanford of the former IceCaps, were looking to secure an ECHL team. The ECHL franchise was conditionally approved for the Stanford-led group pending an arena deal but was delayed in late January 2018 after a dispute with the St. John's Edge ownership group over arena rights that led to arbitration. After the lease issue was settled, the ECHL officially approved St. John's for entry into the league on March 13, 2018, to begin with the 2018‚Äì19 season, placing them in the North Division of the Eastern Conference. The ECHL ownership group reportedly created a partnership with the Toronto Maple Leafs, which would bring the organization back to St. John's for the first time since the team relocated their American Hockey League affiliate, the St. John's Maple Leafs, to Toronto in 2005. The affiliation would eventually be confirmed on June 14. Among the names considered for the new franchise were Shamrocks, Storm, Regiment, and Newfoundland Growlers. The team announced its name as the Newfoundland Growlers on May 22, the name in reference to the Newfoundland dog, specifically the World War I mascot of the Royal Newfoundland Regiment, Sable Chief. Ryane Clowe, a Newfoundland native, previously an assistant coach with the New Jersey Devils, was named head coach on June 20. John Snowden was added as assistant coach on July 19 after serving in the same capacity for the Maple Leafs' previous ECHL affiliate, the Orlando Solar Bears. The Growlers played their first game on October 12, 2018, a 3‚Äì2 win over the Florida Everblades in front of a sold-out arena. In January 2019, Clowe stepped down due to health concerns and was replaced by assistant coach John Snowden. The Growlers finished the season in first place within their division with 94 points. The Growlers then advanced through the 2019 playoffs to the league finals where they defeated the Toledo Walleye in six games to win the Kelly Cup. The Growlers were the first team since the 1989‚Äì90 Greensboro Monarchs to win the ECHL championship in an organization's first season of operations. They are also the first Canadian team to win the Cup. ==Mascot== Buddy the Puffin is the mascot of the Growlers. Buddy, a longtime sports mascot in St. John's was previously the mascot of the St. John's Maple Leafs and later the St. John's IceCaps. Buddy's number is 92, which represents 1992, the year that he was introduced as the mascot of the St. John's Maple Leafs. Buddy is also the mascot for the St. John's Edge basketball team. ==Season-by-season records== {   - !colspan=10Regular season !colspan=5Playoffs - ! Season !! GP !! W !! L !! OTL !! SOL !! Pts !!

She played college basketball for the Oregon Ducks. She is the NCAA all-time leader in career triple-doubles, the Pac-12 Conference all- time leader in assists, and the only NCAA Division I basketball player to record 2,000 points, 1,000 assists, and 1,000 rebounds in a career. ==Early life== Ionescu was born in Walnut Creek, California to Romanian-American parents. Her father, Dan Ionescu, fled Communist Romania around the time of the 1989 revolution, seeking political asylum in the United States. He hoped that his then-wife, Liliana Blaj, and their son Andrei could join them in a few months, but they were unable to move to the US until 1995. By that time, Dan owned a limousine service in Northern California, where he had chosen to settle because he had several extended family members in that area. Sabrina was around three years old when she first picked up a basketball. She has a twin brother Edward (\\"Eddy\\"), who was born 18 minutes after her. Eddy played basketball at the City College of San Francisco before transferring to Oregon; he was solely a student in the 2018‚Äì19 school year before walking on to the Ducks men's basketball team in 2019‚Äì20. In a 2019 interview with Ava Wallace of The Washington Post, Ionescu admitted to being a \\"natural scorer\\", but said that most of the rest of her skill set came from playing alongside both boys and older girls in her childhood: Ionescu attended a middle school that did not have enough players to field a girls' team, and her school refused to allow her to play on the boys' team. She recalled, \\"My middle school said I should be playing with dolls. Seriously, word-for-word.\\" She responded by recruiting enough girls to enable her school to have a team. ==High school career== Sabrina Ionescu as MVP of the 2016 McDonald's All-American Girls Game Ionescu was four-year varsity basketball letter winner at Miramonte High School in Orinda, California under head coach Kelly Sopak. As a freshman in 2012‚Äì13, she started 14 of 29 games and averaged 13.8 points, 3.9 assists and 3.9 steals per game to help her team to a 27‚Äì3 record and a Northern California Section Division II runner-up finish. As a sophomore in 2013‚Äì14, Ionescu helped her team to a 30‚Äì2 record. During her junior year, Ionescu averaged 18.7 points, 7.7 rebounds, 4.2 assists and 4.7 steals per game, and helped Miramonte High School to a 30‚Äì2 record with an appearance in the CIF open division semifinals. In her senior year, she led Miramonte to the CIF open division title game after averaging 25.3 points, 8.8 assists, 7.6 rebounds, 4.5 steals and 1.3 blocks per game. She posted a triple-double in the championship game loss to Chaminade with 24 points, 10 assists and 10 rebounds. Ionescu also made a first half buzzer beating shot from half court. She received national honors including the USA Today Girls Basketball Player of the Year, Max Preps Player of the Year, Cal-Hi Sports Ms. Basketball State Player of the Year and Gatorade State Player of the Year. Ionescu was named a McDonald's All-America and Jordan Brand All-American selection. She was named the McDonald's All-America game MVP after scoring a record 25 points, including seven three-pointers, with 10 rebounds. Ionescu left Miramonte with a career win-loss record of 119‚Äì9 and a school-record 2,606 points scored. She is also the all-time leader in assists (769), steals (549) and triple-doubles (21). In addition to the career record, Ionescu also held the Miramonte top three single season scoring records with 598 (2013‚Äì14), 760 (2014‚Äì15) and 834 (2015‚Äì16). Ionescu also held the single-game scoring record of 43 points vs. Pinewood High School while being double- and triple-teamed and the single game record in assists with 19 at Dublin High School. Ionescu was the No. 1 ranked point guard and No. 4 overall player in the recruiting class of 2016. According to Ava Wallace of The Washington Post, Ionescu chose Oregon \\"because she wanted to be the all-American at Oregon, not just an all-American somewhere else.\\" At the time, she was the highest-ranked recruit ever to commit to Oregon basketball. However, she had difficulty making a college choice, not signing a National Letter of Intent with any school during either the early signing period in November 2015 or the late period in April 2016. Ionescu finally committed to Oregon just before the school's 2016 summer term began, driving with her father for 8 hours from their Bay Area home to Eugene, making an unannounced visit to Matthew Knight Arena and telling head coach Kelly Graves that she would join the team. ==College careerFreshman season=== As a freshman, she was named the 2017 Pac-12 Freshman of the Year as voted on by league coaches. Her Freshman of the Year honor was the first Oregon Duck since 1999 and is the second Duck to earn the honor all-time. Ionescu recorded four triple-doubles, one shy of the Pac-12 record and two less than the NCAA record. She averaged 14.6 points, 6.6 rebounds and 5.5 assists per game, ranking second on the team in scoring and rebounding, and first in assists. She also posted seven double-doubles, ranked third in the Pac-12 and 29th in the NCAA with 183 assists on the year. Her 1.93-to-1 assist-to-turnover ratio was second-best in the Pac-12. She was named Pac-12 Freshman of Week four times and was named USBWA National Player of the Week. Additionally, she was awarded the USBWA National Freshman of the Year as the top freshman in the nation. ===Sophomore season=== On February 26, 2018, Ionescu was named ESPNW's college basketball player of the week. Ionescu led the Ducks to their third regular-season league crown all-time and first-ever No. 1 seed in the Pac-12 Women‚Äôs Basketball Tournament. She led the Pac-12 in scoring (19.2) and assists, dishing out 7.8 assists per game which was fifth- most in the country. She had 16 double-doubles this season and 14 20-point games. She has recorded 10-assist games 13 times this season, handing out a league season-high 14 twice. Following her second season, she was named the Pac-12 Conference Women's Basketball Player of the Year, and was also named a first team All-American by ESPN. Ionescu's Oregon Ducks also won the Pac-12 championship for the first time since 2000. She was named the winner of the Nancy Lieberman Award as the top Division I women's point guard after the season, and was also a finalist for the Naismith Award. Ionescu became NCAA women's all-time leader in triple-doubles, trailing only former BYU men's player Kyle Collinsworth (with 12) among all NCAA players. ===Junior season=== On November 6, 2018, Ionescu recorded her 11th triple-double in a victory against Alaska-Fairbanks. Twelve days later, she would tie the NCAA triple- double record, with her 12th triple-double in a win against Buffalo. On December 20, 2018, Ionescu recorded her 13th triple-double in a game against Air Force and broke the NCAA triple-double record for both men and women basketball. She was later named ESPNW Player of the Week. Since that game on December 20, 2018, Ionescu has added five more triple-doubles for a season total of eight, and has broken the Oregon women's basketball assist record (formerly 608 assists) in a Pac-12 conference game against USC. In the 2019 NCAA Tournament, Ionescu leads the Ducks to their first Final Four appearance after their 88‚Äì84 victory over Mississippi State. Ionescu finished the game with 31 points, eight assists, seven rebounds and a steal. In the NCAA Tournament Final Four, the Ducks lost to the eventual national champion Baylor 72‚Äì67. After the conclusion of the season, Ionescu was named the 2019 John R. Wooden Award winner along with Duke's Zion Williamson. The award is given annually to the most outstanding male and female collegiate basketball player that year. Despite having only played for three seasons at this point, Ionescu was eligible for the 2019 WNBA draft by age. Additionally, she would receive her bachelor's degree that June. However, believing that she had \\"unfinished business\\" at Oregon, she chose to come back for her senior season. This announcement came shortly after Ionescu accepted a place in a newly-launched one-year master's degree program in brand creation in UO's School of Journalism and Communications. ===Senior season=== In the second game of her senior season on November 13, 2019, Ionescu surpassed the 2,000 points, 800 assists mark for her college career with a 109‚Äì52 win over Utah State. She fell short of another triple-double with 16 points, 12 assists and 9 rebounds in the game but recorded her 2,012 career points and 810 career assists. In a win over then #3 Stanford (87‚Äì55), Ionescu scored a career high 37 points along with 11 rebounds and 7 assists, and broke Alison Lang's Oregon all-time career scoring record of 2,252 points in the third quarter. In the rivalry game against Oregon State on January 24, 2020, Ionescu had 24 points, 9 assists and 4 rebounds and broke Oregon State and NBA star Gary Payton's Pac-12 all-time record of 938 assists. Payton personally congratulated Ionescu on the achievement. On February 14, 2020, Ionescu recorded her 1,000th career assist in a game against #7 UCLA and joined Courtney Vandersloot as the only players in NCAA men's and women's basketball history with 2,000 plus points and 1,000 plus assists. Ten days later in the Ducks' 74‚Äì66 win at #4 Stanford, she became the first NCAA player ever with 2,000 points, 1,000 assists, and 1,000 rebounds in a career. Ionescu also recorded her eighth triple-double of the season, tying her own NCAA single-season record from last season. Earlier that day, she had been a featured speaker at the memorial service for Kobe Bryant, who had become a close personal friend within the previous two years, flying from Los Angeles to the Bay Area immediately after her speech. On April 14, 2020, Ionescu was named the winner of the Honda Sports Award as the best collegiate female basketball player in the nation. ===Impact at Oregon=== According to Ducks coach Kelly Graves, in 2019 Ionescu had \\"a chance to be a Marcus Mariota, that level of player and an esteemed Oregon Duck when it‚Äôs all said and done.\\" He noted that attendance at Oregon women's games had dramatically increased during Ionescu's career at the school. In the season before she arrived, the average announced home attendance for the Ducks was 1,501. Her sophomore season saw an average attendance of over 4,200; it went up to over 7,100 in her junior season and over 10,000 in her senior season. Ionescu was also a significant draw when Oregon went on the road; for example, when the Ducks visited Washington during her junior season, the crowd for that game was 3,000 more than the Huskies drew two nights earlier against Oregon State. Graves' remarks about Ionescu's future iconic status at Oregon proved to be prophetic. Shortly after the premature end of her senior season, the university polled fans on social media, asking them to name the four Oregon alumni they would put on a notional Mount Rushmore for the university. According to a 2020 story in the university's web journal Around the O, more than 70 suggestions were provided, but the four top choices were Mariota, Steve Prefontaine, Phil Knight, and Ionescu. As the story's author Damian Foley put it, ==Professional career== Because Ionescu turned 22 in December 2019 she was eligible to declare for the 2019 WNBA draft. A January 2019 mock draft by ESPN, incorporating input from WNBA personnel and ESPN women's basketball analysts, concluded that Ionescu was a possible top pick should she declare. However, Ionescu announced in an open letter published in The Players' Tribune on April 6, 2019, the day after Oregon's loss to Baylor in the Final Four and four days before the draft, that she would return to Oregon for her senior season. ===WNBA=== On April 17, 2020, the New York Liberty selected Ionescu with the first overall pick in the 2020 WNBA Draft. She played her first game with the Liberty on July 25. In her second WNBA game on July 29 against the Dallas Wings, she recorded 33 points, 7 assists, and 7 rebounds in 34 minutes of play. On August 1, 2020, Ionescu injured her left ankle in the second quarter against the Atlanta Dream. She was diagnosed the next day with a grade 3 sprain, and was expected to miss about one month while recovering. ==National team career== In late April 2018, Ionescu and Oregon teammates Erin Boley, Otiona Gildon, and Ruthy Hebard entered the USA Basketball women's national 3x3 championship tournament at the United States Olympic Training Center in Colorado Springs, Colorado. Ionescu had never before played under FIBA 3x3 rules, admitting after the tournament, \\"I had to ask the rules before the games started.\\" She adjusted quickly to the unfamiliar format, leading her team to the championship while going unbeaten and also being named tournament MVP. Ionescu and her Oregon teammates would be named as the US team for the 2018 3x3 World Cup to be held in June in the Philippines. At the World Cup, they were the youngest team in the field, but swept their pool, defeating Cup holders Russia along the way. ==Career statisticsCollege=== -  style=\\"text-align:left;\\"2016‚Äì17  style=\\"text-align:left;\\"Oregon  33  33  32.9  .390  .420  .825  6.6  5.5  1.3  .2  2.9  14.6 -  style=\\"text-align:left;\\"2017‚Äì18  style=\\"text-align:left;\\"Oregon  38  38  35.6  .468  .438  .805  6.7  7.8  1.7  .3  3.0  19.7 -  style=\\"text-align:left;\\"2018‚Äì19  style=\\"text-align:left;\\"Oregon  38  38  35.9  .443  .429  .883  7.4  8.2  1.3  .2  2.5  19.9 -  style=\\"text-align:left;\\"2019‚Äì20*  style=\\"text-align:left;\\"Oregon  33  33  33.7  .518  .392  .921  8.6  9.1  1.5  .3  3.0  17.5 - class=\\"sortbottom\\"  style=\\"text- align:center;\\" colspan=\\"2\\"College Totals  142  142  34.6  .455  .422  .851  7.3  7.7  1.5  .3  2.8  18.0 * 2020 NCAA tournament canceled due to COVID-19 pandemic ==Personal life== Ionescu is a Christian.

It lies within the civil parish of Mungrisdale and is known locally as 'Moor End' as it is at the end of the Hutton Moor on an old route-way between Penrith to Keswick. == Hamlet and its listed buildings == Hutton Moor End is built around two listed buildings just 25 metres apart, (I) Low House and No.1 Low Moorend (1681) and its close neighbour (II) Moor End Farmhouse and Adjoining Barns (1719). Moor End Farmhouse was for many years a busy coaching inn named 'The Sun Inn', used regularly by stage coaches from Lowther Hall to Keswick. The mounting steps for the horses still remain as does a ring for tethering. An inscription high on an outside wall gives the building's age in Roman numerals. Low House's dated lintel is on its side- gabled stone porch cover's entrance. == Placement on the old route-way == These two listed buildings were built upon an old route-way between Penrith and Keswick on a section known as the Hutton Moor Road. The two listed building's placement on this old-route way can clearly be seen on Thomas Donald's map of Cumberland, 1774 and Clarke's 1787 map as they are the only buildings of Moor End. Apart from a milestone, the Troutbeck Roman sites and a boundary stone they are the only listed buildings on the old road from the east of Threlkeld village to Stainton just outside of Penrith, a distance of 11 miles. The Hutton Moor Road was part of the A594 that was bypassed in the early 1970s by the A66, however the hamlet and a 1.5 mile stretch of the old road remained untouched. The Sea to Sea Cycle Route, which runs from the west coast of Cumbria to the north-east coast, now passes through the hamlet continuing the use of this old route-way. Hutton Moor End's only 2 listed buildings on the Hutton Moor Road, 1787 map. (Moorend).jpg Hutton Moor End, surveyed 1861, published 1867.jpg Hutton Moor End's listed buildings shown on old maps. == Setting == Hutton Moor End is set in an open area with wide views towards the centre of the north Lakes. Looking north and west from Hutton Moor End are uninterrupted views of Sharp Edge on Blencathra, Souther Fell, the vale of Keswick and Castlerigg Stone Circle. There is a view in-between the Listed Buildings towards the south east of Great Mell Fell showing an ancient tumulus at its summit. Another old route-way, the Old Coach Road can be seen looking south running below Clough Head, Wolf Crags and along the base of Great Dodd. Although Moor End's setting is in a wide open area unusually no towns or villages can be seen from it only small settlements and farms are visible. To the north of the hamlet runs the river Glenderamackin and very near to the east of Hutton Moor End are the Troutbeck Roman temporary or marching camps proving the immediate area's importance as a transport corridor. This group of Roman sites played an important military role in the policing of the Lake District and its indigenous population and controlling access into the northern Lakes. Since the recent discovery of a Roman camp, said to be of national significance close to Castlerigg Stone Circle, historians now believe that it could prove right their previous predictions that the Roman road continued from Troutbeck to Keswick passing straight through the setting of Hutton Moor End. Sharp Edge, Blencathra from Hutton Moor End. Looking west on the Hutton Moor Road at Hutton Moor End. == Present day == To this day Hutton Moor End's roadside has never expanded and is still just the two listed buildings with their attachments. The hamlet has no public amenities, the nearest church being over 2 miles away at Mungrisdale and the nearest pub being the White Horse Inn at Scales more than a mile away. A caravan site's holiday usage is set off the hamlet's roadside towards the small Troutbeck river running to the east. The attachment to Low House is its old converted barn and attached to the old farmhouse is a cottage once used as a forge. The Lake District National Park, which Hutton Moor End is a part of, became a UNESCO World Heritage Site under the Cultural landscape category in 2017.Low House & Number 1 Low Moorend Moor End Farmhouse == See also == * Listed buildings in Mungrisdale == References == Category:Hamlets in Cumbria Category:Eden District ","title":"Hutton Moor End"},{"id":"56830958","text":"Radim Kolou≈°ek (born 9 December 1941) is a Czech alpine skier.

From 1617 to 1621 he studied in the Collegium Germanicum at the Pontifical Gregorian University in Rome and graduated with a doctorate. On 8 December 1621, he was ordained a priest in Nikolsburg and was appointed on 9 September 1630 auxiliary bishop in Olm√ºtz and titular bishop of Ioppe. The episcopal ordination was received on 5 September 1635. He was also a canon in Olm√ºtz, Wroclaw and Regensburg, and Provost in Brno. Emperor Ferdinand III appointed him Prince-Bishop of Vienna on 5 May 1639, Pope Urban VIII confirmed it on 5 September 1639. On 26 December 1639, he was installed in St. Stephen's Cathedral. He is described as a pious bishop, concerned with pastoral care and the preaching activity of priests. For the growing suburbs of Vienna, he redefined the parish boundaries. He was able to complete in 1641 the new building of the Episcopal Palace, begun by Prince-Bishop Anton Wolfradt in 1632 according to the plans of Giovanni Coccapani. The Prince- Bishop erected the monumental high altar in St. Stephen's Cathedral and concluded a contract with the stonemason and sculptor Johann Jacob Pock from Constance on 1 March 1641. His first master builder was Simon Humpeller, followed by Hans Herstorffer in 1641, followed by Adam Haresleben in 1654. The large altarpiece was painted by Tobias Pock, brother of the sculptor. After some delays, he was able to solemnly dedicate this work on 19 May 1647. His marble coat of arms was attached to the altar, and he also had the new cathedral stalls carved. On 18 May 1647, he consecrated the column, crowned by the statue of the Immaculate Conception in front of the church on the courtyard (model of the Marian Column of Munich in front of the town hall). Emperor Ferdinand III resolved to celebrate the feast of the Immaculata Conceptio on 8 December in his dominions. Prince-Bishop Breuner is buried in the women's choir of St. Stephen's Cathedral in Vienna. ==Bibliography== * Rudolf Leeb u. a.: Geschichte des Christentums in √ñsterreich.

Ace's work includes mixed media paintings, and mixed media textile and sculptural work that combines traditional Anishinaabe textiles and beadwork with found electrical components. Ace has a strong interest in combining traditional and contemporary technologies, aesthetics, and techniques in his artwork. == Early life == Barry Ace was born in 1958 in Sudbury, Ontario. He is a band member of M'Chigeeng First Nation, Manitoulin Island. Ace's surname is pronounced \\"Es\\" and translates to the Ojibwe word for \\"clam,\\" also relating to the word for \\"small clam\\" spelled \\"esiins\\" or \\"esens.\\" Ace's heritage links him to Chief Assance (alternatively spelled Aisance, Aissance, and Essens) of the Nigig (Otter) clan, the otter being an important messenger figure in Anishinaabe history. Ace was first introduced to techniques that he would later employ in his artistic practice at the age of seven or eight when he helped his great- aunt Annie Owl-McGregor to make Anishinaabe splint-ash baskets. He also found inspiration from the beadwork, quillwork, and basketry made by his grandmother Mary McGregor-Ace. == Education == Barry Ace initially studied to be an electrician at Cambrian College but switched to graphic arts. Ace's background knowledge in electricity did however later play a role in his artwork in his mixed media works that include electrical components. Ace has lectured at the University of Sudbury in the Indigenous Studies Program, and at Laurentian University, and Carleton University in Canadian Studies. In 2015 he taught a workshop at the Ottawa Art Gallery where participants made a collective mixed media map of the city of Ottawa. He also led a workshop for children from an Ojibwe immersion school in the fall of 2016 where the artwork produced by the children was later displayed at the Ojibwe Cultural Foundation. Ace is participating in the Nigig Visiting Artist Residency put on by the Indigenous Visual Culture Program at OCAD University in the winter of 2018. == Themes == Much of Barry Ace's work uses found materials like capacitors, resistors, and light-emitting diodes, and traditional Great Lakes-style floral beadwork to comment on \\"cultural endurance undeterred by centuries of colonial oppression and rapid social change.\\" Ace's work explores the relationship between historical techniques and traditions and contemporary materials and subject matter. By referencing the history of Anishinaabe textile art in works that use contemporary mass-produced materials, among other themes Ace investigates the dialogue between Indigenous and European cultures, much like fellow artists Rosalie Favell and Jeff Thomas do. One example of this is the history of the use of glass beads from European traders in Indigenous beadwork that Ace references in his textile pieces. Some of Ace's work explores the particular aesthetic of technology and popular culture in Indigenous art, something that fellow artist Rosalie Favell also incorporates in her work. In 2010, Ace performed A Reparative Act, a performance of four solo dances in the traditional Woodland style in Paris referencing the nineteenth-century dance performances of Chief Maungwadaus in Britain and Continental Europe. Ace's performance and essay was part of Robert Houle's Paris/Ojibwa research project which opened at the Canadian Cultural Centre in Paris. == Exhibitions == Barry Ace's artwork has been exhibited at galleries such as the National Gallery of Canada, including Abadakone in 2019, the Ottawa Art Gallery, Karsh-Masson Gallery, the Art Gallery of Southwestern Manitoba, Winnipeg Art Gallery, the Royal Ontario Museum, and the Canadian Museum of History. Ace's work has been collected by the Canada Council Art Bank, Woodland Cultural Centre, the Royal Ontario Museum, the Ottawa Art Gallery, Indigenous Affairs and Northern Development Canada, the National Gallery of Canada, Nordamerika Native Museum, the City of Ottawa, and Global Affairs Canada. Some notable exhibitions that Ace has been included in have been the Canadian Biennial at the National Gallery of Canada (2017), Insurgence/Resurgence at the Winnipeg Art Gallery (2018), raise a flag: works from the Indigenous Art Collection (2000 - 2015) at OCAD University (2017), It's Complicated with 007 at Central Art Garage (2017), Always Vessels at Carleton University Art Gallery (2017), Every.Now.Then: Reframing Nationhood at the Art Gallery of Ontario (2017), Native Fashion Now: North American Indian Style at the Peabody Essex Museum (2016), Memory Landscape at Museu Nogueira da Silva, Universidade do Minho (2016), and In/Digitized ‚Äì Indigenous Culture in a Digital World (007 with Special Agent Robert Houle) at SAW Gallery (2013). An earlier exhibition that Barry Ace was featured in was Emergence from the Shadows: First Peoples Photographic Perspectives (1996) held at the Canadian Museum of History and curated by Jeff Thomas. The exhibition involved six contemporary Indigenous photographers addressing representations of Indigenous culture through their engagement with and display of their work alongside historical photographs from the museum, including portraiture. The artists that Ace exhibited with were Mary Anne Barkhouse, Rosalie Favell, Greg Hill, Shelley Niro and Greg Staats. Ace has curated several shows himself, including A Celebration: The Art of Canada's First Peoples (Rideau Hall, Ottawa, 1996-1997), Perpetual Bundle (Hull, 1996), and inter/SECTION (Hull, 1998). He served as Chief Curator for the Aboriginal Art Centre, Aboriginal Affairs and Northern Development Canada from 1994 to 2000. == Selected works == * 2006 Reaction ‚Äì footwear * 2010 A Reparative Act ‚Äì performance * 2013 Healing Dance 1 ‚Äì painting * 2013 Urban Bustle ‚Äì mixed media * 2014 Nigik Makizinan - Otter Moccasins * 2016 Bandolier for M'Chigeeng ‚Äì mixed media * 2016 Nayaano- nibiimaang Gichigamiin: The Five Great Lakes ‚Äì mixed media * 2017 Bandolier for Alain Brosseau ‚Äì mixed media == Awards == In 2015, Barry Ace won the K.M. Hunter Artist Award for visual arts. Ace won the Ontario Association of Art Galleries' Curatorial Writing Award in 2012 for his essay \\"A Reparative Act,\\" which was written for Robert Houle's Paris/Ojibwa exhibition catalogue. He also won the Deputy Minister's Outstanding Achievement Award with his team in 1999 for the artist-in-residence and exhibition program that they launched at Aboriginal Affairs and Northern Development Canada. == Organizations and groups == With Ryan Rice, Ron Noganosh, and Ahasiw Maskegon-Iskew in 2006, Barry Ace co-founded the non-profit Aboriginal Curatorial Collective (ACC). Connecting Indigenous curators and cultural producers across Canada, the ACC has played an important role in gathering a strong Indigenous arts community and supporting curatorial and writing projects that share the many voices that make up that community. Barry Ace also co-founded the OO7 (Ottawa Ontario Seven) Collective, a group of Indigenous artists that includes Ariel Smith, Rosalie Favell, Frank Shebageget, Leo Yerxa, Michael Belmore, Ron Noganosh, and invited \\"special agents.\\" The group provides an alternative and experimental space for Ottawa-based Indigenous artists at different stages in their careers. == References  Further reading == McIntosh, David, Nelcya Delano√´, Barry Ace, Robert Houle, Carla Garnet, and Celeste Scopelites.

Beginning in 2011, she worked as an assistant for Aleksandr Torshin, a former member of the Federation Council, a member of Vladimir Putin‚Äôs United Russia party, and a deputy governor of the Central Bank of Russia. In this role, she worked to infiltrate conservative groups in the US, including the National Rifle Association, as part of an effort to promote Russian interests in the 2016 United States presidential election. The Senate Intelligence Committee later concluded that she attempted to persuade the Trump campaign to establish a secret communications back channel with Russia. In July 2018, while residing in Washington, D.C., Butina was arrested by the FBI and charged with acting as an agent of the Russian Federation \\"without prior notification to the Attorney General.\\" In December 2018, she pled guilty to felony charges of conspiracy to act as an unregistered foreign agent of the Russian state under 18 U.S.C. ¬ß951. In April 2019, a federal judge sentenced her to 18 months in prison.cnn.com: Alleged Russian agent Maria Butina sentenced to 18 months in prison on conspiracy charge She served more than 5 months in Tallahassee Federal Correctional Institution and was released in October 2019, and deported back to Russia. She denied accusations that she was a Russian agent. == Early life and education == Butina was born on November 10, 1988, in the Siberian city of Barnaul, in Altai Krai, about north of the present Kazakhstan‚ÄìRussia border. Her mother was an engineer and her father was an entrepreneur who established a furniture manufacturing business in Barnaul. She studied political science at Altai State University and also received a teaching degree. At age 19, she was elected to the public council of Altai Krai in the last direct election for the council. == Business and politics careers == Butina, at age 21, launched a furniture retail business in Altai Krai. In 2011, she moved to Moscow and sold six of her seven furniture stores to start an advertising agency. That same year, she participated in the Youth Primaries organized by the Young Guard of United Russia, the youth wing of the United Russia party, which she has described as \\"the current ruling political party in Moscow.\\" Further in 2011, Butina founded Right to Bear Arms () described as a Russian gun-rights organization. She began traveling back and forth to the US, initially with Aleksandr Torshin, who was then a Senator in the Federation Council of Russia and a leading member of United Russia. He had hired her as his \\"special assistant\\" that year. In 2012, they lobbied the council to expand gun rights. Butina resigned from her position as the head of Right to Bear Arms in late 2014. According to Russians interviewed by RFE/RL, the organization was notable for avoiding opposition to Putin during the 2011‚Äì2013 Russian protests, for its \\"quixotic\\" support for a cause with little public support and strong government opposition ‚Äì Putin himself had told Russians \\"I am deeply convinced that the free flow of firearms will bring a great harm and represents a great danger for us\\" ‚Äì for introducing legislation in the Russian parliament that \\"never went anywhere\\", and for receding from public view after Butina stepped down as its head. According to US prosecutors who prosecuted Butina on charges of conspiracy and acting as a foreign agent, her love of guns was a ruse to advance Russia's agenda within the Republican Party. Anders √Öslund described Right to Bear Arms as a \\"front organization with the purpose of infiltrating American groups and forging cooperation with the NRA.\\" In 2013, she met Republican political operative Paul Erickson in Russia. The two became close, started dating, and eventually moved in together. In 2015, she emailed him a description of a proposed project to influence the Republican Party to be friendlier to Russia, through the NRA. In January 2015, Torshin became deputy governor of the Central Bank of Russia, and Butina worked as his special assistant until May 2017. In 2017, Butina told The Washington Post that she never worked for the Russian government. In August 2016, she moved to the US on a student visa, and enrolled as a graduate student in International Relations at American University in Washington, D.C. While a student at American University, Butina got drunk on at least two separate occasions and bragged to her fellow students about her contacts in the Russian government; on both occasions, her classmates reported her to law enforcement, sources told CNN. In February 2016, Butina and Erickson began a South Dakota business, Bridges LLC. Erickson later said the company was established in case Butina needed any monetary assistance for her graduate studies, which Butina commenced in mid-2016 American University in Washington, D.C. In 2018, she completed a master's degree in international relations. == Involvement in U.S. politics  National Rifle Association === As part of her work as a foreign agent, Butina worked to infiltrate the National Rifle Association on behalf of Russia. Torshin and Butina established a cooperative relationship between the NRA and Right to Bear Arms. Torshin has attended NRA annual meetings in the United States since at least 2011. Following the 2011 meeting, then NRA President David Keene expressed his support for Torshin's \\"endeavors\\" and extended an invitation to the 2012 meeting. Torshin also attended NRA annual meetings in 2012 and 2013. In November 2013, Keene was a guest at the conference of the Right to Bear Arms in Moscow. Butina and Torshin attended the 2014 NRA annual meeting as special guests of former NRA president Keene. Butina attended the Women's Leadership Luncheon at the 2014 meeting as a guest of former NRA president Sandy Froman. Butina presented to then NRA president Jim Porter a plaque from Right to Bear Arms. Afterwards, she tweeted \\"Mission accomplished.\\" As Keene's guest, Butina rang the NRA's Liberty Bell, saying, \\"To the right to bear arms for citizens of the whole world.\\" Butina and Torshin also attended the 2015 NRA annual convention. In 2015, a number of NRA officials attended Right to Bear Arms's annual gun conference in Russia. Among them were Keene, gun manufacturer and NRA first vice president Pete Brownell, conservative American political operative Paul Erickson, and Milwaukee County sheriff David Clarke. One of their hosts was Russian Deputy Prime Minister Dmitry Rogozin, who in 2014 was sanctioned by the White House following Russia's annexation of Crimea. Clarke's trip cost $40,000, with all expenses paid by the NRA, Pete Brownell (an NRA board member and CEO of a gun-parts supply company) and Right to Bear Arms. According to a disclosure Clarke filed, Right to Bear Arms paid $6,000 to cover his meals, lodging, transportation and other expenses. During the meeting, Clarke met the Russian foreign minister and attended a conference at which Torshin spoke. In November 2016, Torshin tweeted that he and Butina were lifetime NRA members. === Republican Party === Butina has attempted to develop ties to conservative American politics. In a supporting affidavit to the government's support for pre-trial detention following her indictment in United States of America v. Maria Butina, the FBI stated that she had successfully sought ties to the Republican Party, where it is referred to as \\"POLITICAL PARTY 1\\". According to The Daily Beast, she has presented herself as a \\"Russian central bank staffer, a leading gun rights advocate, a 'representative of the Russian Federation,' a Washington, D.C. graduate student, a journalist, and a connection between Team Trump and Russia\\" in order to gain access to \\"high-level contacts\\" in Washington. At the 2014 NRA annual meeting, Butina took pictures with Louisiana Governor Bobby Jindal and former U.S. Senator and 2016 presidential candidate Rick Santorum. At the 2015 NRA annual meeting, she met Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker, and in July 2015, she was present at the launch of Walker's 2016 presidential campaign. === Obama administration officials === In 2015, Torshin, then the Russian Central Bank deputy governor, and Butina met the Treasury undersecretary for international affairs, Nathan Sheets, to discuss U.S.-Russian economic relations. Separately, they also met with a Federal Reserve vice chairman, Stanley Fischer and with a State Department official. === Donald Trump campaign === In a June 2015 article published in The National Interest, a conservative American international affairs magazine, just before Trump announced his candidacy for president, she urged better relations between the United States and Russia, saying, \\"It may take the election of a Republican to the White House in 2016 to improve relations between the Russian Federation and the United States.\\" Her biography on the article did not mention that she worked for the Russian government. The next month, Butina attended FreedomFest, where Trump gave a speech, and asked him from the audience about ending U.S. sanctions against Russia, to which he replied, \\"I don't think you'd need the sanctions.\\" Butina hosted a birthday party attended by Erickson and Trump campaign aides shortly after the 2016 election. == United States of America v. Mariia Butina, aka Maria Butina  Complaint === On July 15, 2018, Butina was arrested in Washington, and charged with acting in the United States as an agent of a foreign government; specifically the Russian Federation, without prior notification to the Attorney General, a conspiracy to commit an offense against the United States, to wit, 18 U.S.C. ¬ß951 (foreign relations, agents of foreign governments), in violation of 18 U.S.C. ¬ß371 (conspiracy). After her arrest, it was mistakenly reported she was charged with a violation of the Foreign Agents Registration Act (22 U.S.C. ¬ß11 foreign agents and propaganda). United States law dictates that all lobbyists representing foreign governments must register as such with the Department of Justice. Her attorney said that \\"the allegations of the indictment are essentially that her only illegal act was not registering.\\" On July 18, Butina pleaded not guilty, and a District Court judge ordered her jailed pending trial. She was also said to be cooperating in a federal fraud investigation in South Dakota. Maria Butina was held in solitary confinement in Alexandria Detention Center. === Affidavit === According to the affidavit in support of the complaint, from as early as 2015 and continuing through at least February 2017, Butina worked at the direction of a high-level official in the Russian government, who, according to The New York Times, was believed to be Torshin. The court filings detail the Russian official's and Butina's efforts for Butina to act as an agent of Russia inside the United States by developing relationships with U.S. persons and infiltrating organizations having influence in the Republican Party and in conservative politics‚Äîsuch as the National Rifle Association, the National Prayer Breakfast and some religious organizations‚Äîfor the purpose of advancing the interests of the Russian Federation. The filings also describe certain actions taken by Butina to further this effort during multiple visits from Russia and, later, when she entered and resided in the United States on a student visa. The filings allege that she undertook her activities \\"without officially disclosing the fact that she was acting as an agent of Russian government, as required by law.\\" Butina, Torshin, and Erickson have been subjects of an investigation by the United States Senate Select Committee on Intelligence into Russian interference in the 2016 United States elections. Erickson is referred to in Butina's indictment as \\"Person 1.\\" In addition, George D. O'Neill Jr., a conservative writer and Rockefeller heir, is \\"Person 2.\\"Rockefeller Heir Was Contact of Alleged Russian Agent , Wall Street Journal, Aruna Viswanatha and Julie Bykowicz, July 26, 2018. Retrieved July 29, 2018. Torshin has also been the subject of a probe by the FBI into whether the Russian government attempted to illegally funnel money to the NRA in order to help Trump win the presidency. The FBI began to monitor Butina in August 2016, after she had moved to the United States on an F-1 student visa. Rather than confront her immediately, the FBI chose to track her movements and gather information on whom she was meeting, and what her end goals were to be. === Plea deal === Butina's attorneys and federal prosecutors declared in a November 16, 2018, court filing that they had entered into plea negotiations. On December 13, she pleaded guilty to conspiracy to act as an illegal foreign agent, while the original charge of failing to register as a foreign agent was dropped. She faced a maximum sentence of five years in prison and, according to a CNN report, will \\"likely be deported after serving any time.\\" On April 26, 2019, Butina was sentenced to 18 months in prison by Judge Tanya S. Chutkan, in accordance with the recommendations of prosecutors. Butina later complained that in the U.S., she was forced to sign a plea-deal. She claimed that she was sentenced for simply being Russian. === Russian reaction === Russian President Vladimir Putin said he had no prior knowledge of Butina. Russian foreign minister Sergey Lavrov made a statement saying that Butina's arrest was designed to undermine the \\"positive results\\" of the Helsinki summit between U.S. President Trump and Russian President Putin. She was arrested a day before Trump met his Russian counterpart. Butina's father has called the accusations against her \\"a witch-hunt\\". Leonid Slutsky, head of the lower house of the Russian parliament's foreign affairs committee, called Butina's case a \\"modern political inquisition.\\" Russia's Foreign Ministry accused the United States of forcing false confession from Butina. According to the foreign ministry spokesperson, Maria Zakharova, \\"having created unbearable conditions for her and threatening her with a long jail sentence, she was literally forced to sign up to absolutely ridiculous charges.\\" RT supports Zakharova's view, alleging that most innocent people in U.S. federal custody \\"plead guilty to a lesser charge just to have some hope of ever getting out\\". == Timeline  2011 === * Maria Butina founds the \\"\\" organization. * April 29 ‚Äì May 1: Nashville lawyer G.

Latoya Ammons, her mother, Rosa Campbell, and her three children claimed paranormal activity occurred in the residence. The story was publicized in January 2014 and received national attention. ==Background== In November 2011, Latoya Ammons, her mother, Rosa Campbell, and her three children then ages 7, 9 and 12 moved into a house located at 3860 Carolina Street in Gary,Indiana. Days after the family moved in, they claimed black flies swarmed the porch in December and kept returning even after the family believed they were killed. Campbell initially heard footsteps in the basement and doors creaking. Later, she alleged to have witnessed a \\"shadowy figure of a man pacing in the living room\\" and found a \\"boot print\\". Campbell claimed she was choked by an unknown force. Ammons' 12-year-old daughter was claimed to have levitated above her bed unconscious during a sleepover with a friend. They were said to have prayed until the girl returned to the bed. The daughter had no memory of the incident. The older son was allegedly thrown across the room by an unknown force. The younger son allegedly had his eyes roll into the back of his head and was growling saying \\"it's time to die,\\" and \\"I will kill you\\". The family reached out to their physician, Geoffrey Onyeukwu, on April 19, 2012. When he visited the house during the supposed haunting, he noted their behavior was \\"delusional\\". Someone from his office contacted police, after the police arrived, the children were taken to the hospital. The older boy was described as acting rationally, while the younger boy \\"screamed and thrashed\\". In 2012, the Department of Child Services (DCS) was alerted to the family. The DCS believed that the children were performing for their mother. Sensational stories published in outlets such as the New York Daily News reported that DCS personnel had allegedly witnessed the youngest boy \\"walking up the wall backwards\\". 37 year police captain, Charles Austin, believed paranormal activity occurred in the house. A photo published by the Indianapolis Star claimed to show a \\"shadowy figure\\" when no one was home. The family hired Father Michael Maginot to perform an exorcism. He interviewed the family on April 22, 2012 and concluded they were being \\"tormented by demons\\". He eventually performed three exorcisms, two in English and one in Latin. One exorcism was performed on Latoya Ammons. The Ammons family moved to Indianapolis in 2012 after which the events were said to have stopped. == Skeptical analysis == Physician Geoffrey Onyeukwu had been skeptical of the entire incident and failed to witness any paranormal incidents. In his medical notes he wrote, \\"delusions of ghost in home\\" and \\"hallucinations\\". Ammons' children had a history of \\"irregular school attendance\\" with a complaint filed against Ammons in 2009. In 2012, she blamed her children's continued irregular attendance on the purported demonic activities. According to skeptical investigator Joe Nickell, police chief Charles Austin was \\"an admitted believer in the supernatural, including ghosts\\". Nickell reported that the photo published by the Indianapolis Star and captioned ‚ÄúPhoto by Hammond Police‚Äù was, according to the Hammond police chief, not an official photo and was not taken by Hammond police authorities. Nickell also interviewed a number of witnesses and concluded that there were a number of non-supernatural explanations for the claimed supernatural events. Charles Reed, the landlord, stated he had never experienced any supernatural events at the house. His prior tenants also claimed to never have such experiences. At the time, Ammons was behind on lease and used the claimed paranormal activities to avoid payments. The tenant who moved in after Ammons had not noticed any paranormal events, either. Reed believed the events were a hoax. The children were interviewed by psychologists, and several professionals concluded \\"the children were acting deceptively and in accordance with their mother‚Äôs beliefs\\". Tracy Wright, a psychologist, noted that the youngest son \\"acted possessed\\" whenever he was challenged or was asked \\"questions that he did not wish to answer\\". ==Documentary film== In 2014, Zak Bagans purchased the house for $35,000 and demolished it in January 2016 after filming a documentary in it, titled Demon House that was released on March 16, 2018. Dread Central's Steve Barton called it \\"one of the single most compelling documentaries on the existence of the supernatural that I‚Äôve ever witnessed.\\". Los Angeles Times reviewer Noel Murray called the film \\"hooey\\". According to skeptical investigator Kenny Biddle, the film has been characterized as a pseudo-documentary, \\"meaning it is filmed in a documentary style but doesn‚Äôt portray real events\\". ==See also== *Indiana ghostlore *List of haunted locations ==References== Category:American ghosts Category:History of Gary, Indiana Category:2014 in Indiana ","title":"Ammons haunting case"},{"id":"56831587","text":"Balam Ajpu is a hip-hop group from Guatemala, whose music is often in mostly Tz ºutujil and Spanish along with other Mayan languages, including Quich√© (K ºiche º) and Kaqchikel.

It is the type species of the genus Todarodes, the type genus of the subfamily Todarodinae of the pelagic squid family Ommastrephidae. It is a species which is targeted by some fisheries, although it is more often a bycatch. ==Description== The European flying squid is a large species squid with a maximum reported size of 750mm measured by mantle length for an unsexed specimen, although this was probably a female, the largest mantle length known for a male is 640 mm, and these animals commonly have mantle lengths of between 250mm and 350 mm. It has a slender, long and muscular mantle with wide and strong fins, the length of the fins being equivalent to 45% of the mantle length, and is just slightly wider than it is long, tapering to a point posteriorly. The funnel groove has a foveola which does not have side pockets. The tentacular club is very long and extends over three quarters of the length of the contracted tentacle, the club's suckers are held on the elongated carpus in 10 to 12 pairs, the sucker rings of the medial manus suckers have 17 to 20 long pointed teeth; the suckers of the manus are arranged in four series of 14 to 18 rows; the suckers on the dactylus are also arranged in 4 rows. The arm suckers have an enlarged central tooth, 7 to 9 regular teeth and have almost no small alternating teeth. There are no light organs on the viscera. The arms are slender and are more than double the length of the head. The fourth right arm is hectocotylised in males and has the terminal suckers modified into fleshy papillae. The body is dark purplish in colour. ==Distribution== The European flying squid is found in the eastern Atlantic from Greenland and Iceland to the Arctic waters of the Russian Federation, in the lower Barents Sea and Kara Sea, to 13¬∞S to the south of the Gulf of Guinea and to about 40¬∞W; its distribution also includes the North Sea, Mediterranean Sea and the Sea of Marmara. ==Habitat and biology== The European flying squid is an oceanic, neritic species of squid that can be found from the surface to depths in excess of 1000 metres and it has been taken in United Kingdom territorial waters at 4,595 m. It is occasionally recorded among the fauna of the seabed on the continental shelf or the upper continental slope, for example off northwest Africa where it is commonly found between 350‚Äì700 metres. This species undertakes migrations for feeding and as it matures in the North Atlantic. Large schools appear offshore near southern Iceland, the Faroe Islands, Norway and sometimes Scotland in the early summer, and they stay in these areas until the onset of winter. The stranding of large numbers of European flying squid along nearby coastlines is relatively frequent in the summer months in these areas. With the arrival of winter, the squid move to deeper water further offshore where they spend the winter. The populations of the warmer seas off the northwestern African coast and in the western Mediterranean are more sedentary by comparison. The European flying squid is recorded in large numbers from March to May on the fishing grounds around Madeira, as well as in other areas of the eastern central Atlantic Ocean. Here the squid make ontogenetic movements as well, from the continental shelf to the continental slope and deep waters. This species is also known to undertake daily vertical migrations being found near the sea bed or at depths during the day and moving up to the surface and near- surface waters at night, however they are caught at night in deeper waters indicating that a proportion of the population do not always undertake vertical migrations. Squids of this species may be found solitarily or in small groups but as their trophic migration progresses they form large schools on the continental shelves in the waters of the northern Atlantic and off northwest Africa. The sex ratio of the European flying squid almost always shows a preponderance of females and there are very few males captured. This appears to be mainly a result of ecological factors as the feeding grounds are sexually segregated and they only meet during spawning. The males may be sedentary, living most of their lives in the breeding areas where they may not participate in the daily vertical feeding movements and remain at depth. The males attain sexual maturity at a smaller size and younger age than the females. In general, the larger animals are found in the cooler areas of its distribution. In the European flying squid spawning is most likely to be continuous throughout the year on the continental slope, but there are distinct seasonal peaks in late winter or early spring in the northeastern Atlantic. In the Catalan Sea and the Balearic Islands of the western Mediterranean spawning peaks between September and November. The length of the spermatophore depends on the size of the males and on their geographic origin ; being relatively larger (48 to 54 mm) in the Catalan Sea than in the population off North Africa (20 to 29 mm). The female fecundity is high, and each bears up to several hundred thousand eggs, depending on the size of females. The females reduce their feeding activity before spawning, and their spawning is characterized by intermittent egg laying, with the numbers of eggs in each egg mass decreasing. Spawning occurs in depths between 200 m and 800 m) and apparently takes place near the bottom. The early life cycle is not well known but observations on juveniles over the mid-Atlantic Ridge suggests that they are carried by currents and spread in the upper layers of the water column between 50‚Äì150 m), although they may go deeper in the daylight hours. Paralarvae observed in coastal waters off North Africa have been observed to rise to the layer just below the surface over the continental slope to feed before migrating as juveniles to the continental shelf. Their growth rate is high, especially in their early life phases but slows as they attain sexual maturity. Their life cycle is thought to take just over a single year to complete, based on statolith analysis but the larger squid of over 500mm mantle length are thought to be 18 months to two years old. T.sagittatus juvenile The European flying squid preys on fish, crustaceans and cephalopods. In the more northerly part of its range small Atlantic herring (Clupea harenqus) are the main prey as are Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua). Other studies have shown that prey includes pelagic species of fish, for example blue whiting (Micromesistius poutassou) and herring as well as mesopelagic fish like Maurolicus muelleri, they also prey on pelagic crustaceans, and cephalopods with cannibalism being quite frequent, with conspecifics being the second most common cephalopod prey. Abstract. In the Macaronesian Islands lanternfish were the most common and diverse prey, while off northern Norway the most common prey were fish, crustaceans and polychaetes. Its predators include a variety of top Oceanic predators such as tuna, swordfish, sharks, seals and cetaceans. It is an important prey for some species of dolphin and this species along with Illex coindetii and Todaropsis eblanae, are the most important intermediate host for Anisakid nematodes, which are intestinal parasites. ==Fisheries== The European flying squid is predominantly taken as a bycatch of trawl fisheries for other species, but it is also fished by jigging and purse seining. In the summer months it is targeted by commercial and recreational fishermen in southern Italy. The flesh is eaten either fresh or boiled, it preserved by commercial freezing, salting or drying. The species is also utilised as bait in fisheries for cod and halibut. The population is not subject to any specific management measures and the total population consists of several geographically distinct populations. The stocks vary over time as the environment varies. From the late 20th Century to the present the mean catch has been 3,000 tonnes, although this has varied widely, with the largest catches being recorded in 1981-1985. Off Europe the species is taken in association with other members of the family Ommastrephidae and much of the catch is not identified to species. Over the 25 years to 2014 no obvious trend in stocks could be identified and it is therefore assessed as least concern. ==References== Category:Squid Category:Cephalopods described in 1798 Category:Marine molluscs of Europe Category:European Cephalopods ","title":"European flying squid"},{"id":"56832001","text":"Julia Frifield (born 1962) is an American government official who previously served as Assistant Secretary of State for Legislative Affairs from October 21, 2013 to January 20, 2017.

This development led to a more actively interventionist foreign policy for England, going forward in its history. In addition to concerns about expanded Spanish power in the Netherlands, which was supposed to threaten England itself, French intrigue in the region under the Duke of Anjou also mattered, It became a consideration for Elizabeth's government in addressing its policy towards the Netherlands. Prominent officials, including Robert Dudley, the Earl of Leicester, and Francis Walsingham, as well as the Queen herself, discussed the situation openly. They took it that the future of the Netherlands was pertinent to English sovereignty. Internal disagreements between the Earl of Leicester and the Queen on the best approach became a controversy on whether direct involvement was necessary, or monetary support and sanctuary to Dutch rebels was better. ==English political concerns around the NetherlandsConcerns with the Spanish and Spanish Allies=== Philip II, the King of Spain, as well as Elizabeth's contemporary during her reign The primary external concern came from worries around the potential actions of Spain. Initial discussion on the necessity of English involvement within the then- ongoing Dutch Revolt was elevated through fear on the part of the Queen's Privy Council to the possibility of the Netherlands to be used by Spain as a staging ground for an invasion into England as a means to depose Elizabeth and reinstate the Catholic Church. Questions were raised among the advisors to the degree of the Spanish King's religious resolve to Catholicism, and as a result, the potential alignment to the wishes of Pope Pius V after Elizabeth's excommunication and the subsequent loss of her legitimacy in the Regnans in Excelsis in 1570.Pope, Pius V. 1570. ‚ÄúRegnans in Excelsis‚Äù.

Outside of England, and despite a deep common hatred of Spain within England, English Catholic √©migr√©s that fled to the Netherlands as a result of Elizabeth's government, put faith into Phillip to be the catalyst of a return to Catholicism, most strongly so with the de-legitimization of Elizabeth's cousin and next heir at the time, Mary, Queen of Scots.(p. vi; Correspondence of Robert Dudley) ===Governors of the Spanish Netherlands=== Fernando √Ålvarez de Toledo, the 3rd Duke of Alba, became as governor a symbol for oppression among the Protestant Dutch, having this exemplified in the popular imagination among that population by the executions of Lamoral, Count of Egmont and Philip de Montmorency, Count of Horn.(p. v; Correspondence of Robert Dudley) Don John of Austria, a half-brother of Phillip II, was viewed as having been appointed governor by Phillip in light of his own ambition, having himself ‚Äúdreamed of a throne of his own.‚Äù(p.218; MacCaffrey 1572-1588) Don John was also considered by English Catholic √©migr√©s ‚Äúas early as 1572‚Äù to be a good suitor to Mary, Queen of Scots, legitimizing a claim to the English throne.(p.218-220; MacCaffrey 1572-1588) This unofficial candidacy was definitely a cause for concern among the Privy Council under Elizabeth. ===House of Croye=== From within the Netherlands, the House of Croye rooted itself as the prominent Catholic family, contrasting to the Protestant House of Orange. Led by the brothers Charles Philippe de Cro√ø, Marquis d‚ÄôHavr√© and Philippe III de Cro√ø, the House supported Spanish intervention within the Low Countries in the interest of working against French influence.(p. 224-225; MacCaffrey 1572-1588) In the interests of leadership, they favored a relative of Phillip's, the Archduke Matthias of Austria as the Dutch governor, which he became in January 1578 as Governor-General of Brussels. However, the leader of their rivals in the House of Orange, William the Silent, became the Lieutenant-General underneath Matthias as a result in seeking out a joint Catholic-Protestant solution.(p. 227; MacCaffrey 1572-1588) The House also took a particular stance on English assistance, leading other Catholic noble families in accepting English monetary assistance, but not English manpower, especially expeditions led by the Earl of Leicester, who was friendly with the House of Orange.(p.225; MacCaffrey 1572-1588) They succeeded to have the Council of State bar the acceptance of English men in late 1577, yet held onto a promise made by Elizabeth of ¬£100,000 to be spent in the conflict.(p.225-226; MacCaffrey 1572-1588) This resolve was later reversed by the States, however, and manned English assistance was allowed on November 19 of that year.(p.226-227; MacCaffrey 1572-1588) ===Assassination of William the Silent, the Prince of Orange=== (see also: William the Silent: Assassination) The assassination of William of Orange in 1584 by a Catholic supporter of Philip II acting upon an edict by the latter to have William killed, led to an emboldening of Protestant fervor against the Spanish government despite the action seeming to decapitate the initial resistance movement.(p. vii; Correspondence of Robert Dudley) Elizabeth responded to the assassination of the Prince of Orange with strengthening her policies assisting in the revolt. ==Possibility of French influence== Even though the Kingdom of France itself was not of an immediate threat or direct concern to the Elizabethan government as Spain was seen to be, its potential ability to utilize the Netherlands against the interests of England caused Elizabeth's government to also consider France in its exterior assessments. France at this time had a similar level of religious conflict in its own borders, between the Catholic establishment of the French Crown and the Protestant Huguenots. Yet despite this, concern existed on the proximity and subsequent power of France: > For Englishmen the specter of French domination of the Low Countries was a > frightening one. It would give that kingdom a throttle-hold on England‚Äôs > main trading partner and secure to her the great financial and industrial > resources of these rich provinces. And strategically England would be > flanked at every angle from Biscay to the Ems by the single power of France. > This last consideration weighed heavily in all English decisions about their > neighbors‚Äô affairs. There could be no neutrality towards the troubles of the > seventeen provinces nor towards those of France so long as the probability > of French intervention in the former remained.(p.163: MacCaffrey, Wallace T. > Queen Elizabeth and the Making of Policy, 1572-1588. Princeton, New Jersey: > Princeton University Press, 1981.) ===The Duke of Anjou=== Francis, the Duke of Anjou (see also: Francis, Duke of Anjou) Interest in the Duke of Anjou to English interests began at the end of April in 1578, when commissioners representing the States were negotiating with representatives of the Duke, where the States wished for the Duke to be involve himself in the conflict by invading other Habsburg-held territories that were not part of the Revolt, such as Burgundy.(p.230; MacCaffrey 1572-1588) Although these discussions yielded no result in practice, it led to reaction by Elizabeth in turn. When these dealings were brought to the Queen's attentions, William Davison was given orders by Elizabeth to approach the States and amend the terms of the monetary assistance that England would give through Prince Casimir of the Palatinate, who was receiving funding from England in increments of ¬£20,000 for soldiers to help the States, requiring now that it would be on the condition that the States can no longer deal with the Duke if a second ¬£20,000 were to be sent. By late May, the Duke attempts to engage in a treaty with the States to commit ‚Äúfor two months with 10,000 foot soldiers and 2,000 horsemen under his own direct control.‚Äù This made Elizabeth furious with the States, ordering Davison to freeze English assets to the States and order Casimir to stay idle until dealings with the Duke are completely ceased and when representatives Walsingham and Cobham will arrive.(p.230-231; MacCaffrey 1572-1588) At the same time, in the spring of 1578, a series of Protestant insurrections arose in the southern, Spanish- controlled Netherlands, which led to them having ‚Äúseized churches for their use, expelled the religious orders, smashed altars and images, and demanded the right to public observance and promulgation of their faith.‚Äù(p. 232; MacCaffrey 1572-1588) From these insurrections, the fear of a Spanish advantage from the Dutch disunity as a result of the mass protests caused Elizabeth to promptly reconsider her stance on the Duke, allowing ‚Äúclandestine agents‚Äù to establish a direct line, as well as giving freedom to the States to deal with the Duke.(p. 232-233; MacCaffrey 1572-1588) ==Sympathies of leaders and other prominent peopleQueen Elizabeth I=== Queen Elizabeth I During her reign, the Queen would evolve her strategies surrounding English involvement in the Low Countries at a gradual pace, growing in the amount and type of assistance she was willing to give as time progressed. The concerns levied by her Privy Council about the desire of Phillip II to conduct a Spanish expedition into England were particularly strengthened with the assassination of William, the Prince of Orange, in 1588, where it seemed to be established in the mind of Elizabeth that Phillip was willing to go on an offensive. In beginning her moves towards intervention, the Queen desired on taking an indirect approach to the situation in the Netherlands, seeking to preemptively establish a formal alliance built among Protestant member princes of the Holy Roman Empire to develop a solidified pan-Protestant solidarity for when it seemed appropriate to act.(p. 197-200: Elizabeth I, Queen of England. Elizabeth I‚Äôs Foreign Correspondence: Letters, Rhetoric, and Politics, edited by Carlo M. Bajetta, Guillaume Coatalen, and Jonathon Gibson. New York: Palgrave MacMillan, 2014.) In this, she approached various German princes to forge the alliance: Frederick II of Denmark, a German prince of the Empire as Duke of Holstein, was considered by Elizabeth to be a key ally. Initially refusing on September 12, 1577, the direct and formal alliance with England that Elizabeth had anticipated, Frederick began during the rest of the 1570s and into the 1580s to come round to Elizabeth's idea of Protestant cooperation.(p. 196-199: Elizabeth‚Äôs Foreign Correspondence) In a series of exchanges, Frederick resolved to mediate between England and Spain in the Dutch conflict: if Frederick's aid was not accepted by Philip II of Spain, \\"he would close the Sound to their traffic and (if necessary) offer direct military support to their protestant adversaries, including Elizabeth.\\" Duke Casimir of the Palatinate was one of Elizabeth's closest allies from her earliest approaches to the conflict. In early 1578, with Elizabeth unwilling use English forces after the defeat of the Protestant Dutch army at the Battle of Gembloux and concerned about such a move provoking the French, she approached the Duke with funds to recruit ‚Äú6,000 Swiss and 5,000 ‚Äòreiters‚Äô to the provinces‚Äù to assist the Dutch.(p. 228; MacCaffrey 1572-1588) The Duke, who was already aligned to the Protestant cause, took advantage of the opportunity, with payment by Elizabeth being ‚Äú20,000 pounds immediately and the same sum in addition on days of musters, to be charged against the loan of 100,000 pounds.‚Äù This payment would later be halted in response to the States' initial dealings with the Duke of Anjou, and then later returned upon the thaw of Elizabeth's opinion on the Duke of Anjou being involved in the conflict. The Protestant states of the Netherlands under William also dealt officially in the agreement to solidarity which Elizabeth attempted to foster with the other German states. The Prince of Orange, through Daniel Rogers, suggested a deal with Elizabeth on a direct military alliance against Spain. It anticipated war, and looked to act preemptively against Philip II and his ‚Äòcrusade of Catholic re-conquest.‚Äô(p.224; MacCaffrey 1572-1588) Elizabeth rejected the offer, and instead made a counter-proposal, as a means to draw the Netherlands into unity with the other Protestant states of continental Europe.(p.223; MacCaffrey 1572-1588) Other German states within the Holy Roman Empire that were potential allies in direct alliances included Brunswick, Hesse, W√ºrttemberg, and Saxony.(p. 193-199: Elizabeth's Foreign Correspondence) Direct involvement became a change in the policy precedence with Elizabeth with the Leicester Expedition into the Low Countries, allowing for English troops directly under the control of an English leader to be present in the region. Publicly, and to avoid the anxiety around direct involvement in the eyes of the Spanish, Elizabeth had released her intentions with the move on the basis of a cultural defense of the Protestant Dutch: > to give aid to the defence of the people afflicted and oppressed in the Low > Countries, were not any desire of aggrandizing either herself or her > subjects, but to aid the natural people of those countries to defend their > towns from sacking and desolation, and thereby to procure them safety, to > the honour of God, whom they desire to serve sincerely as Christian people, > according to his word, and to enjoy their ancient liberties; to free herself > from invading neighbours; and to ensure a continuance of the old-standing > intercourse of friendship and merchandise betwixt her people and the > inhabitants of those countries.(p. viii; Correspondence of Robert Dudley) In November 1585, she wrote a letter to the States-General within the Netherlands for her declaring her candidacy of Robert Dudley, the Earl of Leicester, to lead the expedition, as well as declaring her favor towards the interest of the Low Countries.(Letter IX; p.21 of Correspondence of Robert Dudley) Later into the campaign, however, she would take contention with the Earl's approaches in objective to the Expedition, in seeking to establish an entirely new government within the Netherlands independent entirely of the Spanish, an option the Queen did not wish to take.(Letter XXXV and Letter XXXVII; p. 95, 103-104; Correspondence of Robert Dudley) ===Robert Dudley, the Earl of Leicester=== Background with the Low Countries Robert Dudley, the 1st Earl of Leicester Before the Leicester Expedition was to take place, Robert Dudley, the Earl of Leicester, already had interactions in the Low Countries, being sympathetic to the Protestant cause led by the House of Orange. This intimacy between the Earl and the House of Orange caused him to be a source of fear among those in contest with Orange, such as the House of Croye. The success of the latter Dutch House in blocking direct English aid in the States-General in late 1577 came as an offence to the Earl, who came to division with William of Orange, viewing it as offensive, until William Davison cooled tensions between the two men.(p.226; MacCaffrey 1572-1588) Tension would also arise as well between the Earl and the Queen during the Leicester Expedition over the actions that were taken by the former during the campaign. The Leicester Expedition (see also: The Leicester Expedition) The impetus behind what would become the Leicester Expedition came about from advice given to her by the Privy Council to operate with a stronger active role within the Low Countries. According to John Bruce of the Camden Society, the advice of the Privy Council was to: > send over a considerable body of auxiliary forces, and to place them under > the command of some eminent person, who should not merely direct the > military operations, but should also assist the States-General with his > counsel, and put them in the way of correcting many errors of government > into which they have fallen. Elizabeth had initially disagreed with this advice, fearing primarily of the precedent that could be set in assisting rebellions against a sovereign ruler, especially against Phillip II in consideration to the danger she was in with the Catholic world. By September 1585, it was guaranteed that the Queen would nominate Robert Dudley to the Privy Council and to the States-General within the Netherlands, due to his perceived intimate knowledge and level of connection to the Queen herself, being a ‚Äúpersonal favorite‚Äù of hers that also did not have a necessary and irreplaceable role in her Court.(p. vii-viii; Correspondence of Robert Dudley) Direct correspondences between Robert Dudley and the Court began on December 1585, in a letter from Francis Walsingham addressed to Dudley, reporting on the Queen's direct instructions for the campaign: stabilize the government, to not engage in battles without ‚Äúgreat advantage‚Äù assured, to maintain discipline and punishing those who do not honor that call for discipline, to make leaders responsible that forces under their command are at full capacity, to pay soldiers ‚Äúby the head‚Äù with payment disbursed to the captains first, punish leaders who abuse their posts, employ ‚Äúsome well chosen persones‚Äù that organize collecting contributions to the war effort, to respect the authority of Dutch nobles as well as especially the children of the late William (of Orange), to clarify that England will not take dominion over the Netherlands at the end of this expedition, and to be available to advise Dutch nobility whenever needed.(p.12-15; Letter VI: Correspondence of Robert Dudley) The Earl, however, desired to see a return to the Netherlands of the government exercised under the Prince of Orange, who was assassinated the year earlier.(p.19-20; Letter VIII: Correspondence of Robert Dudley) This angered the Queen to the Earl's actions, which would become evident when he writes to Walsingham, as well as Elizabeth's Lord Treasurer, Lord Chamberlain, and Vice Chamberlain, acknowledging that the Queen does not appreciate the Earl's own support of this separate Dutch government. Despite understanding this and begging for forgiveness from the Queen, he implores the men he writes to that he is coming solely from a place to benefit the Queen and England as a whole.(p.95-98; Letter XXXV: Correspondence of Robert Dudley) The height of Elizabeth's discontent with Dudley is explained in letters directly from the Queen to the Earl and delivered by Sir Thomas Heneadge, dated February 10, 1585-6, where she demands him to publicly resign his authority and to inform the States that the actions in accepting the government that Dudley had undertaken did not reflect her wishes as Queen.(p.105-110; Letters XXXVIII and XXXIX: Correspondence of Robert Dudley) ==References== *Bucholz, Robert, and Newton Key.

Robin Schofield began his first-class career in 1959-60 as a bowler of left- arm wrist-spin, when he played three matches and took five wickets. He then disappeared from first-class cricket until he re-emerged in 1964-65 as a wicket-keeper. Against Wellington in the first match of the Plunket Shield season he took seven catches in the first innings and nine in the match, setting new records for New Zealand first-class cricket.Wisden 1966, p. 881. He kept wicket for Central Districts for most of the next ten years, and made useful runs in the lower order. He also played Hawke Cup cricket for Hawke's Bay from 1960 to 1974, scoring a century when they took the title from Marlborough in 1968. He was a schoolteacher in Taradale, near Napier. He died in an accident while cutting firewood at his home in Puketapu. The cricketers Sara McGlashan and Peter McGlashan are his grand-children. ==References * Category:1939 births Category:1990 deaths Category:People from Hokitika Category:New Zealand cricketers Category:Central Districts cricketers Category:Hawke's Bay cricketers ","title":"Robin Schofield"},{"id":"56832336","text":"The knockout phase of UEFA Euro 2020 will begin on 26 June 2021 with the round of 16 and end on 11 July 2021 with the final at Wembley Stadium in London, England.

Her research combines bioinformatics, computational biology and systems biology, specifically in the fields of gene regulation in bacteria and eukaryotes. == Education == Margalit earned her B.Sc degree (in Mathematics and Biology, 1974) and MSc degree (in Genetics, with distinction, 1977) from the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. In 1985, she completed her PhD in computational molecular biology, under the supervision of Norman Grover, the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. ==Career and research== Margalit completed postdoctoral research at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) in the laboratory of mathematical biology under the supervision of Charles DeLisi, where she developed the first computational algorithm to predict antigenic peptides recognized by immune cells. In 1989, she returned to Israel and established her independent research group at the Faculty of Medicine, the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. Her early research included development of computational algorithms for predicting binding of antigenic peptides to MHC molecules, computational models of protein-DNA binding preferences, also in collaboration with Nir Friedman, identification of domain pairs as the building blocks of protein-protein interaction networks, analysis of the integrated network of protein-protein and protein-DNA interactions (in collaboration with Uri Alon), as well as computational models for predicting small regulatory RNA molecules in bacteria, which were verified experimentally in collaboration with Shoshy Altuvia and Gerhart Wagner. More recently, Margalit's lab studied the dynamics of regulation by small RNAs (in collaboration with Ofer Biham), and computationally predicted that there are viral microRNA molecules that repress the human immune system, a mechanism that was experimentally validated in collaboration with Ofer Mandelboim. Since 2012, Margalit has combined experimental and computational research for studying small RNA-target interactions in bacteria. Margalit was one of pioneering researchers of Bioinformatics and Computational Biology in Israel and worldwide. At the Hebrew University she co-founded the ‚ÄúComputer Science and Life Sciences‚Äù program in Bioinformatics and Computational Biology (in 1999) and the graduate ‚ÄúGenomics and Bioinformatics‚Äù program (in 2000). In 2002 she was elected as the first president of the Israeli Society of Bioinformatics and Computational Biology (2002-2004). Margalit has mentored over 50 graduate students, many of them holding faculty positions in bioinformatics in Israel and abroad. ===Awards and honors=== In 2008 she was awarded the Michael Landau prize in Systems Biology. In 2018, Margalit was elected a fellow of the International Society for Computational Biology (ISCB) for outstanding contributions to the fields of computational biology and bioinformatics. ==Personal life== Margalit is married to Avi and a mother of three children. ==References== Category:Living people Category:Israeli bioinformaticians Category:Hebrew University of Jerusalem faculty Category:Year of birth missing (living people) ","title":"Hanah Margalit"},{"id":"56832589","text":"Christopher Naliali (born 8 March 1992) is an Ivorian naturalized French sprinter who specializes in the 100 and 200 metres.

This mixture made their only traceable release, Black Power, which was recorded ca 1973/1974 and released 1975 on ZMPL, unique within the zamrock scene, a somewhat late echo of the flower power era, fueled by a revolutionary spirit. In 1976, The Peace went on a three-week tour in Botswana, on which they made more money than on the entire release of their debut album.

He had also served in the latter position between 2002 and 2004. Originating from the town of Sukadana in West Kalimantan, he built a career as a businessman before entering politics, founding the Regional Unity Party and later joining Hanura, where he has served as chairman since December 2016. ==Personal life== Oesman, often nicknamed Oso, was born in the town of Sukadana in West Kalimantan province on 18 August 1950 to parents from other parts of Indonesia. His father Odang originated from Palopo while his mother Asnah Hamid was of Minang descent, originating from Solok. As a child, he worked on rubber plantations and as a cigarette vendor. He did not complete formal education, and only earned his high school degree through a special package (\\"Paket C\\") in 2006 at the age of 56. He obtained an honoris causa degree from the now-defunct Rutherford University in 1999. He competed as a racing car driver in the 1980s, winning national and international level competitions. ===Family=== He is married to Serviaty Oesman and the couple has five children. In 2015, his eldest son Raja Septa Sermando died at the age of 41 due to a heart attack. ==Career== He began his business career by trading agricultural commodities such as coconut and ginger between West Kalimantan and Jakarta. At the age of 22, he moved on to the construction industry. As his business grew, he expanded to other sectors, forming the Oso Group. In 2012, he resigned as CEO of the group. In 2002, he reported his wealth to the Corruption Eradication Commission as Rp 54.6 billion (US$6 million). GlobeAsia placed him on its list of 150 richest Indonesians, placing him 103rd with estimated wealth of US$350 million. According to an official report to the Indonesian government, his wealth amounted to Rp 335.6 billion in April 2015. ===Politics=== He became a member of the People's Consultative Assembly (MPR) for the 1999-2004 period, and was appointed deputy speaker of the body on 11 August 2002. He was part of the regional envoys' faction. Following this, he founded the Regional Unity Party on 18 November 2002 and it participated in the 2004 elections, but only gathered 0.58 percent of votes and failed to secure seats in the People's Representative Council (DPR). The party achieved similar results in the 2009 elections, and merged with nine other minor political parties to form the National Unity Party. Following the 2014 election, he was elected into the Regional Representative Council (DPD) as a senator from West Kalimantan, winning 188,528 votes. He was chosen as a deputy speaker for the MPR on 8 October 2014 for the 2014-2019 period. On 22 December 2016, he was elected chairman of Hanura for 2016-2020, replacing Wiranto. He was elected DPD speaker in April 2017 following the expiry of Bengkulu senator Mohammad Saleh's appointment. His appointment received criticism, since Oesman then held two major parliamentary positions in addition to being chairman in Hanura. According to speaker Zulkifli Hasan, Oesman would resign from the deputy speaker position. It was not until February 2018 however that he submitted his resignation. His replacement was left for the Regional Representative Council to decide. In January 2018, Hanura Secretary General Sarifuddin Sudding (id) gave him a motion of no confidence. Oesman fired him from the party in response. Deputy chairman of Hanura Wishnu Dewanto said Oesman had violated the party's internal procedures and caused Hanura's popularity to decline. Some others accused him of embezzling Rp 200 billion (US$15 million) of party funds. Following the split, multiple members holding positions in the People's Representative Council were replaced with Hanura legislators in Oesman's faction. The other faction moved to support candidates not initially endorsed by the party in the 2018 regional elections, such as in East Java. Oesman has proposed Wiranto as incumbent President Joko Widodo's running mate in the upcoming 2019 elections. He was set to run for reelection, but the General Elections Commission removed his name from the ballot as he was still affiliated to political parties. ==References== Category:1950 births Category:Living people Category:People from West Kalimantan Category:People's Conscience Party politicians Category:Speakers of the Regional Representative Council ","title":"Oesman Sapta Odang"},{"id":"56832744","text":"J√∂rg Hickl (born 16 April 1965) is a German chess grandmaster.

The episode aired on June 12, 2017 on AMC in the United States. Outside of the United States, the episode premiered on streaming service Netflix in several countries. ==Plot== Jimmy discovers from Irene, one of his former elder law clients who represents the class in the Sandpiper Crossing lawsuit, that the company has offered a settlement which if accepted by D&M; and HHM will result in a payment to Jimmy of $1.16 million. Irene has refused to accept because the lawyers have advised her they believe they can get Sandpiper Crossing to offer more. Jimmy tries to persuade Howard to accept, but he refuses. Howard and Chuck meet with their malpractice insurance agents, who inform them that because of Chuck's electromagnetic hypersensitivity he will need to be supervised by another attorney at all times or HHM will face a substantial premium increase. Chuck wants to fight the insurance company, but Howard disagrees and says he will force Chuck to retire since his judgment can no longer be trusted. Chuck sues HHM for $8 million, the value of his share of the partnership. Mike becomes a contracted security consultant for Madrigal, a paper transaction designed to launder his stolen money by having him give his cash to Lydia and then receive monthly fees. Kim takes on Gatwood Oil as a second client to cover office expenses in case Jimmy can't pay his half while his law license is suspended. Nacho admits to his father that he is working for Hector and begs him to follow Hector's orders. Nacho's father refuses and orders Nacho to leave his house. Jimmy pulls a series of psychological and social manipulation tricks to turn Irene's friends against her, so that she believes refusing the Sandpiper settlement is against the interests of her fellow clients. She decides to accept it, meaning Jimmy will receive his much needed share. He returns to his office to give Kim the good news, but she is too busy preparing for an important meeting with Gatwood Oil and leaves in a rush. Due to fatigue from overwork, Kim falls asleep at the wheel and drives her car off the side of the road, crashing into a boulder. ==ReceptionRatings=== Upon airing, the episode received 1.47 million American viewers, and an 18‚Äì49 rating of 0.5. ===Critical reception=== The episode received critical acclaim.

She had two brothers, one of whom died in infancy, and the other of whom was Edward Henry Roscoe, with whom she was very close. Their paternal grandfather was the historian William Roscoe and her family were prominent members of Unitarian society in Liverpool. Margaret married Henry Robertson Sandbach on 4 May 1832. He was then living at Hafodunos, an estate in Denbighshire, North Wales, that had been bought two years previously by his father, the slave-owner, merchant and Mayor of Liverpool, Samuel Sandbach. In time, her husband became a Justice of the Peace for Caernarvonshire and, in 1855, like his father, High Sheriff of Denbighshire. Margaret's mother's book Floral Illustrations of the Seasons had been published in 1829. Her own first book was Poems, written in 1840 and dedicated to her brother Edward. Her primary literary theme throughout her career was that of the brother-sister relationship, although one of her best efforts - \\"The Appeal of the Wounded Amazon\\", contained in Poems - was inspired by the Welsh sculptor John Gibson, who had been assisted in his early career by William Roscoe and whom she and Henry had befriended in Rome in the 1830s. Gibson was the dedicatee of a later collection, Aurora and Other Poems, that was published in 1850, and in 1851 she commenced writing his autobiography, based on his dictation, while he was staying as a guest at Hafodunos. This last project came to nothing because Gibson had to return to Rome upon the death of his brother and Margaret was increasingly unwell with breast cancer. Although she did write some fiction, notably Hearts in Mortmain (1850), it was in poetry that Sandbach excelled. Her novel Spiritual Alchemy, published in 1851, caused Elizabeth Gaskell to comment in a review on \\"the folly exhibited by many an author of a moderately successful novel who hurries forward the second on the reputation of the first\\". Sandbach died at home on 23 June 1852 and was buried at nearby Llangernyw. == Recognition == Sandbach's initial documentation of Gibson's life, together with letters between them as friends, formed a significant part of Elizabeth Eastlake's Life of John Gibson, R. A., Sculptor, published in 1870. The historian Mark Baker and the singer Linda Lamb collaborated on a collection of songs based on the poems of Sandbach, and Lamb released an album title The Daughter of Fire and Water. Baker and Dewi Gregory also co-authored a book based on her life, published in 2013 as Margaret Sandbach: A Tragedy in Marble and Ink. == References  Further reading == * == External links == * Category:1812 births Category:1852 deaths Category:Poets from Liverpool Category:People from Denbighshire Category:19th-century English women Category:19th-century English poets Category:19th-century English novelists Category:Deaths from breast cancer Category:19th-century British women writers ","title":"Margaret Sandbach"},{"id":"56832908","text":"Gogbeu Francis Kon√© (born 10 November 1991) is an Ivorian sprinter who specializes in the 100 metres.

It lies on the Naviglio Grande axis toward Milan. From its towers the navigation along the canal could be controlled. In the 15th century it was one of the preferred residences of the dukes and duchesses of Milan. ==History== The Visconti Castle of Abbiategrasso was probably built at the end of the 13th century on the site of a previous fortification (Castro Margazario) near a Benedictine monastery. First Azzone Visconti (1329-1339), lord of Milan, and then Gian Galeazzo Visconti (1378-1402), the first duke of Milan, enlarged the castle. In 1438 it was restored and embellished by Duke Filippo Maria Visconti, son of Gian Galeazzo. Having lost any defensive function, and being easily reachable from Milan by water along the Naviglio Grande, it became his favorite country mansion. The castle had the typical Visconti castle's structure: a quadrangular layout, with an internal courtyard and portico, and four towers, one on each corner. Bricks were the primary construction material, while the stone was limited to structural or decorative elements, as the slender columns of the mullioned windows, the brackets (beccatelli), or the Biscione on the facade over the old entrance. To the castle had some inclination the duchesses of Milan. Here (as an alternative to Cusago) had a stable residence Agnese del Maino, mistress of Duke Filippo Maria and mother of Bianca Maria Visconti. The Sforza, dukes of Milan and descendants of Bianca Maria, favored the castle of Abbiategrasso to enhance their Visconti origins. After the Visconti-Sforza period, the castle progressively assumed the role of a stronghold again, especially during the years of the Italian Wars (1494-1559). In 1658 three towers were demolished, while the fourth was cut off. In 1862 it was sold to the Abbiategrasso municipality, which in the following years obliterated the ramparts to make space to the new train station while also taking care of some restorations. ==Today== Although deprived of the south wing and three towers, the castle is today in good condition and open to the public. It houses the offices and the City Council of the Abbiategrasso municipality. == References Sources== * * ==External links== * Beni Culturali ‚Äì Castello Visconteo, Abbiategrasso (MI) * Virtuali Abbiategrasso ‚Äì Castello Visconteo Category:Castles in Lombardy ","title":"Visconti Castle (Abbiategrasso)"},{"id":"56832952","text":"Laubach is a river of Rhineland-Palatinate, Germany.

It has two folded leaves and up to eight yellow flowers with blackish marks. After its collection in a Sydney suburb in 1888, no further collections were made and the species was presumed extinct until 2004 when it was rediscovered near Gosford. ==Description== Diuris bracteata is a tuberous, perennial herb with two linear leaves long, wide and folded lengthwise. Between two and eight, usually three yellow flowers with blackish markings, wide are borne on a flowering stem tall. There are about five curved, linear bracts along the flowering stem. The dorsal sepal is more or less erect, egg-shaped, long and wide with two brown blotches near the base. The lateral sepals are linear, long, wide, turned downwards and are parallel to or cross over each other. The petals are ear-like with an elliptic to egg-shaped blade long and about wide on a blackish stalk long. The labellum is long and has three lobes. The centre lobe is egg-shaped to diamond-shaped, long and wide and the side lobes are linear to oblong, long and about wide. There are two ridge-like calli about in the mid-line of the labellum. Flowering occurs in August and September. ==Taxonomy and naming== Diuris bracteata was first formally described in 1888 by Robert D. FitzGerald from a specimen collected near Gladesville by Henry Deane. The description was published in Fitzgerald's book, Australian Orchids. The specific epithet (bracteata) is a Latin word meaning \\"small leaf\\". ==Distribution and habitat== This orchid occurs in grassy woodland and forest near Gosford. ==Conservation== No specimens of this species were collected in the twentieth century and in the year 2000 it was listed as \\"extinct\\" under the Australian Government Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 (EPBC Act). Some specimens collected in the Sydney region in 1998 and subsequently, have been re-examined and found to be Diuris platychila. The species is listed as \\"endangered\\" under the New South Wales Biodiversity Conservation Act 2016. The threats to its survival include its small population size and limited distribution, and disturbance associated with roadworks since some populations occur on roadsides. ==References== bracteata Category:Orchids of New South Wales Category:Flora of New South Wales Category:Plants described in 1888 ","title":"Diuris bracteata"},{"id":"56833081","text":"Souk El Sayaghine (Arabic:ÿ≥ŸàŸÇ ÿßŸÑÿµŸäÿßÿ∫ŸäŸÜ) or the Jewelry makers souk is one of the souks of the medina of Sfax.

The 10,000 metres event was hosted separately at the Sheffield Hallam UCA Stadium. Organised by the British Athletics Federation (BAF), the competition was limited to British athletes only and marked a replacement to the UK Athletics Championships, which had last been held in 1993. The BAF British Championships overshadowed that year's AAA Championships, which was open to foreign competitors and typically the most prominent meet on the domestic calendar. This has led some statisticians, such as the National Union of Track Statisticians (NUTS), to judge the British Championships event as the main national championships for the country for 1997. Many of the athletes below also competed at the 1997 AAA Championships.UK Championships. GBR Athletics. Retrieved 2018-02-25.AAA WAAA and National Championships Medalists. NUTS. Retrieved 2018-02-25.

This election was a part of national Italian general election of 1979 even if, according to the Italian Constitution, every senatorial challenge in each Region is a single and independent race. The election was won by the centrist Christian Democracy, as it happened at national level. Seven Lombard provinces gave a majority or at least a plurality to the winning party, while the agricultural Province of Pavia and Province of Mantua preferred the Italian Communist Party. ==Background== For the first time the Italian Communist Party lost votes, after a period of terroristic attacks by the Red Brigades. Even the far-right Italian Social Movement was weakened. Between other minor parties, the Radical Party obtained its first seat. ==Electoral system== The electoral system for the Senate was a strange hybrid which established a form of proportional representation into FPTP-like constituencies. A candidate needed a landslide victory of more than 65% of votes to obtain a direct mandate. All constituencies where this result was not reached entered into an at-large calculation based upon the D'Hondt method to distribute the seats between the parties, and candidates with the best percentages of suffrages inside their party list were elected. ==Results== -

He states that his legal name was Isaac Aizenberg (the surname, with z and n), and his pseudonym, Guiche Aizemberg (the surname, with m).(22 January 1918 ‚Äì 26 December 1997) was a writer, screenwriter and Argentine dramatist. Among his most outstanding contributions is his collaboration in the adaptation for the film Hombre de la esquina rosada of Jorge Luis Borges and his novel Cuestion de dados. ==Biography== Aisemberg was born in General Pico (province of La Pampa), made his primary and secondary studies between C√≥rdoba and Buenos Aires and went through the universities of Buenos Aires and La Plata. He was an advisor to the Ministry of Culture of the Nation, a jury in film festivals, a contributor to the International Film Festival of Mar del Plata, a member of the screenwriting tribunal at the Cinematography Institute, a professor in journalism schools, and was in charge of the Circle of the Press and was president of Argentores (General Society of Authors of Argentina). He wrote numerous stories, novels and plays, among them Es m√°s tarde de lo que crees, No hay rosas en la tumba del marino, No hay ojos aqu√≠ and La guerra del cuarto mundo. Some of his works were translated for North American editions and his novel Cuestion de dados, as well as his volume of stories Jaque mate in two plays, appear in important international anthologies. He was awarded as the Prize of Honor of Argentores. Among other scripts he wrote the films El bote, el r√≠o y la gente, La Rabona and Bajo el signo de la patria. When he was writing this last script ‚Äì in 1971, during the dictatorship of Lanusse -, a general named Gonz√°lez Filgueira ‚Äì president of the Belgraniano Institute ‚Äì told him that from the SIDE (State Intelligence Service) he had objected to a Jew writing on the motherland and the flag, for which Aisemberg chose to sign it under the name of Ismael Monta√±a.[Pe√±a, Fernando (1993); Ren√© Mugica (page 36), 1993, Buenos Aires, Centro Editor of Latin America, .] The critic Fernando Pe√±a has said about that film that \\"it can humiliate almost all the examples that the genre produced at that time.\\" Rhetoric is avoided with laconic texts that manage to gambol on marble, while the image maintains a clear and dusty tone.[Pe√±a, Fernando (page 36).] Among the unspecified projects is a version of Una excursi√≥n a los indios ranqueles (who worked with Mario Soffici) and an adaptation of the story La intrusa by Jorge Luis Borges (performed with Ren√© Mugica). His collaboration with Ren√© Mugica (which Aisemberg considered very pleasant) were also two libretti presented in the contest of the Institute of Cinematography in 1979, El se√±or Brown y El despoblado, one won first prize and the other a mention. He was a great speaker, memorable and captivating to those who listened to him.

He is the founder of the UT Planetary Geosciences Institute and was also its director until late 2017. Taylor was a graduate of the Indiana University at Bloomington, where he obtained a Bachelor's Degree in Chemistry and a Master's Degree in Geology. He would move on to receive a PhD from Lehigh University, perform pre-doctoral experimental petrology research at the Geophysical Laboratory of the Carnegie Institution of Washington, and finally a Fulbright Fellowship at the Max- Planck-Instit√ºt f√ºr Kernphysik in Heidelberg, Germany. In December 1972, Taylor was offered to be in the ‚Äúback room‚Äù of Johnson Space Center during the Apollo 17 mission where he had the opportunity to directly advise astronauts on their extravehicular activities on the Moon. Subsequently, Taylor became very close friends with Harrison Schmitt, the last man to step on the lunar surface and the sole geologist to ever reach the Moon. The two would collaborate throughout their careers with Schmitt playing an influential role in helping Taylor develop the Department of Earth and Planetary Sciences at UT. In 1973, after 2 years of being an Assistant Professor at Purdue University, Taylor would arrive at the University of Tennessee, near the very beginning of the institution's dive into research. Taylor would remain at the University of Tennessee for the latter half of his life and become ‚Äúone of the true giants in the field‚Äù of lunar science and the Director of the University of Tennessee Department of Earth and Planetary Sciences until his retirement in 2017. == Early life (1938‚Äì1958) == Taylor was born September 14, 1938, in Paterson, New Jersey and was raised in Port Jervis, New York, over a bar owned by his father. At the beginning of his senior year in high school, Taylor was involved in an automobile accident that forced him to get a hip replacement and left him hospitalized for around 10 months. However, after returning to school, Taylor was still able to pass his final exams and graduate. After high school, Taylor began his higher education with night school at Orange County Community College in Middletown, New York. == Education and early academic career (1958‚Äì1973) == In 1958, Taylor left New York City \\"one step ahead of the law\\" and started additional education at the Indiana University in Bloomington. In 1961, Taylor graduated but decided to stay and achieve a master's degree in geology due to a friend's persuasion. During this period, Taylor took on many miscellaneous occupations that included: driller, rocker shovel loader, powder-monkey, and geologist in mines in Ontario, Canada. In 1965, Taylor's two children, Kelly and Jeff, were born, and he was introduced to planetary geology at Lehigh University in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania. Taylor would continue his studies at various universities and institutes until 1971, when he was hired as an assistant professor at Purdue University. Just two years later (1973), Taylor would move to the University of Tennessee. == Later career and death (1973‚Äì2017) == At the University of Tennessee, Taylor would achieve tenure after only two years and then become a full professor after another two years (1977). In 1993, Taylor married Dong-Hwa (Dawn) Shin. Throughout the rest of his career, Taylor would produce 542 peer-reviewed research papers, and would eventually partially retire in 2017 after 46 years of work. Taylor died on September 18, 2017, four days after his 79th birthday. Taylor's longtime colleague, Hap McSween, remembers him as a \\"diamond in the rough\\" and states that his \\"constant presence in the department will be missed.\\" == Works == Taylor led a prolific 46-year career with more than 100 articles published in science journals including: * Nature * Earth and Planetary Science Letters * Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta * Meteoritics and Planetary Science * Planetary and Space Science * Lithos * Acta Astronautica * Polar Science * Current Science.

This bay is mainly located in the township of Levasseur, except the entrance (west side) of the bay located in the canton of Aubin. Following the erection completed in 1948 of the Gouin Dam, the \\"Kikendatch Bay\\" became an extension of Brochu Lake located further north-west, i.e. at the extreme east of Gouin Reservoir. Recreotourism activities are the main economic activity of the sector. Forestry comes second. A civilian seaplane base is located at the top of the Gouin Dam. The route 400, connecting the Gouin Dam to the village of Parent, Quebec, serves the southern part of Kikendatch Bay, as well as the valleys of Jean-Pierre River and Leblanc River; this road also serves the peninsula which stretches north in the Gouin Reservoir on . Some secondary forest roads are in use nearby for forestry and recreational tourism activities. The surface of Kikendatch Bay is usually frozen from mid-November to the end of April, however, safe ice circulation is generally from early December to late March. == Geography Toponymy== This hydronym identifying this bay under the specific \\"Kikendatch\\" (graph \\"Kirkendatch\\" used in the introduction of Description of surveyed townships ... (1889)) originated the transfer of the name of the trading post that had been established 20 km northwest of the Gouin Dam. In 1832, the map of Arrowsmith (entitled British North America) identifies this post, as \\"mission center of Haut-Saint-Maurice\\" by the priest of Yamachiche, Quebec, Severin-Nicolas Dumoulin (1793-1853), first missionary, in 1837, to visit the population of Atikamekw since the voyage of the father Jacques Buteux in 1651. In his 1806 diary, Jean-Baptiste Perrault speaks of Kik√®nd√¢che. One of his sketches indicates a lake Kik√®nd√†tche.

By 1962, the chain was a subsidiary of New York- based Mangel and operated thirty-five stores in twelve states, with nine of those thirty-five being located in Michigan. In 1971, Shoppers Fair reached an agreement with Borman's Inc., owner of the Yankee Stores chain, to acquire eight stores closed by Yankee in the metro Detroit area due to unprofitability. One of the eight, in Roseville, had never opened for business as Yankee. The Shoppers Fair chain was part of two lawsuits: one in 1960 against a department store in Flint, Michigan called The Fair, and another four years later against an owner of an IGA store in Fort Smith, Arkansas also called Shoppers Fair. Both cases ruled in the other stores' favors. Mangel filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in March 1974. At the time, the company had 46 Shoppers Fair stores and 94 Mangels clothing stores.

Of Finnish missionaries, only Martti Rautanen and his wife Frieda and daughter Johanna have served longer in the mission field. Nenonen spent most of her childhood in Kuusankoski, but she graduated from high school in Imatra in 1954. She obtained a degree in theology from the University of Helsinki in 1960. Soon after this she departed for Ovamboland. ==Career as a teacher in Ovamboland== Ulla Nenonen arrived to Ovamboland, one of the mission fields of the Finnish Missionary Society, in 1961, and began by studying Afrikaans and Oshindonga. At first she worked at the Oniipa Printing Press, but soon she was transferred to Okahao, to work the local women‚Äôs teacher training seminary, and she soon became the principal of the seminary. She later also taught as a teacher in the local secondary school. At that time, the government had no schools in the north of Namibia, so the mission schools were the only possibility for the locals to get education. Life in Ovamboland was peaceful, until the aspirations of the SWAPO to achieve independence for the country turned into guerrilla warfare. ‚ÄúI had to make the decision of whether my life was more valuable that the life of someone else. I came to the conclusion that it certainly wasn‚Äôt,‚Äù she said the Finnish Broadcasting corporation Yle in an interview in 2011. Once she defied the night time curfew established by South Africa and drove a patient to a government hospital, since she could not expect that a local driver could be assumed to undertake such a task. She was stopped by the authorities and was given a strenuous interrogation, but in the end she was allowed to proceed. During 1980‚Äì83 Nenonen worked as the vice-rector of the Oshigambo High School. During 1983‚Äì93 she acted as the head of the mission in Oniipa. She was there in one of the most important places with regard to the independence process of Namibia. She hosted the General Secretary of the United Nations, various emissaries, ministers and presidents from different countries, among them Martti Ahtisaari, who was overseeing the transfer from South African to Namibian rule. Nenonen was able to provide these people with accurate information on what was going on in the country. ==Work as a Bible translator during retirement== After retiring from the FMS, Nenonen did not return to Finland, as other missionaries had done, as she was invited by Bishop Kleopas Dumeni of the Ovambo-Kavango Church to assist in Bible translation to the Dhimba language in Opuwo, Kunene Province, where she worked until 2015. Dhimba is closely related to the Herero language and somewhat more distantly related to the Ovambo language. Her collaborator in this work was the Dhimba pastor Johannes Tolu, the only Dhimba to have studied to become a pastor. At the time, the Dhimba language did not have a writing system, so their first task was to devise one. The work was supported by the Lutheran Bible Translators from the United States, the United Bible Societies and a Finnish association called Support for the Namibian Church. The work of Pastor Tolu was supported by the Tampere Cathedral Congregation. The New Testament was completed in 2011, but due to difficulties in its printing, it appeared only in January 2014. After that the team began to translate the Old Testament. Study of the Dhimba language has also been a part of the project, as well as collecting of stories and songs, and the team has also produces primers, reading books, songbooks, and put out Compact Cassettes, which contain texts from both the Old and the New Testament read aloud in Dhimba. One aspect of the work has been the development of the Dhimba language with a view toward its preservation and a literacy programme. Even after her return to Finland in 2015, Nenonen assisted the Dhimba translation team via e-mail, and proof read translations and helped in compiling a dictionary of the language. Yle has made a television documentary of the Dhimba Bible translation programme with the title ‚ÄúDhimba translators‚Äù. It was broadcast on YLE 1 in 2003. The work of Ulla Nenonen has received attention from e.g. President Martti Ahtisaari, when he spoke in the 140th anniversary festivities of the Finnish Missionary Society in 1999. {  style=\\"font-size:95%; text-align:center; background:#FFFACD \\" -  CCCCFF;\\" width=20 colspan=5 Ulla Nenonen‚Äôs tasks in Namibia - !width=80 style=background:#cff3e4  Place !width=80 style=background:#cff3e4  Years !width=350 style=background:#cff3e4  Tasks -  align=left Oniipa  1961‚Äì62  Printing press -  align=left Okahao  1963‚Äì74  Teacher at women‚Äôs seminary and secondary school -  align=left Okahao  1974‚Äì79  Rector at women‚Äôs seminary and secondary school -  align=left Oshigambo  1980‚Äì82  Vice rector of high school -  align=left Oniipa  1983‚Äì93  Superior of the mission field -  align=left Opuwo  1993‚Äì2015  Bible translation } ==References *Obituary of Ulla Nenonen in Helsingin Sanomat (in Finnish) Category:Translators of the Bible into Bantu languages Category:Missionaries of the Finnish Missionary Society Category:Lutheran missionaries in Namibia Category:Finnish Evangelical Lutheran Mission Category:Finnish expatriates in Namibia Category:1933 births Category:2018 deaths Category: Oshigambo High School alumni ","title":"Ulla Nenonen"},{"id":"56833458","text":"Nevada Van der Veer, from a 1921 publication.

It also ranks number one on points in the national placing tables. As one of the foremost nations in the sport internationally, its delegations for the championships are among the largest. The most decorated athlete of the competition's history is American: Allyson Felix has won sixteen World Championships medals, eleven of them gold, competing across the individual and relay sprint events. Among men, the United States has three of the four most decorated men (after Usain Bolt), all of them sprinters; LaShawn Merritt has eleven medals, Carl Lewis won ten and Michael Johnson won eight. All three won eight gold medals. Johnson is the nation's most successful athlete individually (and the third most successful overall), having won six gold medals in the 200-meter dash and 400-meter dash. American Gail Devers is the second most successful woman individually, with four golds and two silver medals from the 100-meter dash and 100-meter hurdles. Felix and Amy Acuff have made the most appearances for the United States, each having represented their country at eight separate editions. The United States team was affected by doping during the period from 1997 to 2003, principally in sprinting events.

Between 2009 and 2011, Papadimitriou co-hosted, with John Rogers, two series of a radio show on Resonance FM entitled Ventures and Adventures in Topography. The first series examined a number of early-twentieth-century 'rambling' books which explored the suburbs of London through the eyes of forgotten authors such as S. P. B. Mais and Gordon S. Maxwell, while the second series took a more general if still somewhat esoteric approach to walking in the urban fringes of the capital.

The festival celebrates African and African-American heritage. It has continued for more than forty years, expanding from one block long to a dozen, and drawing as many as 500,000 people to South Philadelphia. Fernandez' contributions were publicly applauded in the 2000 Congressional record : proceedings and debates of the Congress by the Hon. Robert A. Brady. She was publicly recognized during Women's History Month, March 2009, by the General Assembly of Pennsylvania. Her memoir Recollections (part one) was published in 2016. ==Life== Lois Fernandez was one of 10 children. Her mother was the first black woman to serve as a Democratic party committeewoman in Philadelphia. Her family was high Episcopalian. Lois attended South Philadelphia High School for Girls. Her first paying job was as a clerk typist at the Philadelphia Quartermaster Depot. The Black Power movement was becoming influential, and Fernandez was an active worker for civil rights and social justice. One outward indicator of her pride in being African was that she cut her hair and let it grow out naturally in an Afro. It was a radical choice at that time, causing her to be ostracized by some of her co-workers. Fernandez lived in the South Street area of Philadelphia, one of the oldest communities of free African-Americans in the United States, dating back to the 17th century. W. E. B. Du Bois described the area of the Seventh Ward in his ground-breaking sociological work, The Philadelphia Negro (1890), recognizing its distinct black identity. In 1963, Fernandez bought her own house on Fernon Street. In 1966, Lois Fernandez, her sister Sylvia Green, her cousin Gerri Fernandez, and her friend Ruth Arthur opened a boutique, the Uhuru Hut, at 500 South 23rd Street. They felt that a store focused on Afrocentric clothes, jewelry and fine art would complement consciousness raising and increased black cultural awareness. At the same time, she and Ruth Arthur began to think about possibilities for some sort of neighborhood gathering in the area. In 1967, Lois Fernandez bore a son as a single mother. She brought forward a lawsuit in federal court and was ultimately successful in having the designation ‚Äúillegitimate‚Äù removed from Pennsylvania birth certificates. By the 1970s, Fernandez was employed by the Department of Public Welfare. She worked with street gangs in South Philadelphia to decrease violence in the community. Throughout her career she held various positions with the Philadelphia Department of Human Services, including social worker, foster care placement officer, gang prevention worker and parent counselor. She believed in lifelong learning, and earned an associate degree in applied science from the Community College of Philadelphia, and a master‚Äôs in urban education from Antioch University. She also earned parent education certification at St. Louis University, certification for AIDS training from the AIDS Activities Coordinating Office, and certification in arts management from the University of Massachusetts. She became an adjunct faculty member at Lincoln University in their master's degree program in human services. In the 1990s, she noticed the need for senior housing in her neighborhood. She worked with city and state officials and developers to rally support and raise funding. Osun Village, a four-story complex for low-income seniors, opened in South Philadelphia on December 13, 2010. Anna C. Verna, president of the City Council credited Fernandez, stating \\"This would never, never have become reality without the constant, constant persistence of Lois Fernandez.\\" Fernandez struggled with ill health during her life. She suffered from rheumatic fever as a child. Later in life she fought rheumatoid arthritis and breast cancer. After hip and knee replacements she had to use a motorized scooter for mobility. ==Forming Odunde== Fernandez had met Nigerian practitioners of the Yoruba religion as early as 1963. In January 1972, Fernandez traveled to Oshogbo, Nigeria, West Africa, where she was inspired by the Oshun Festival of the Yoruba people. She visited the Osun River with Nigerian artist Twins Seven-Seven as part of a local celebration honoring Oshun, and thought that something similar could be done with Philadelphia's rivers. After returning to Philadelphia, Fernandez and her friend Ruth Arthur organized the first Odunde Festival. It took place in April 1975, as the \\"Oshun Festival\\". Their goal was to bring together the community and to foster awareness of and pride in black history and culture. The first procession started from Fernandez‚Äôs house on Madison Square. The officiant was Obailumi Ogunsey, a Yoruba priest who Fernandez had met in 1963. Fernandez invited choreographer Arthur L. Hall and his dance troupe to participate. Fernandez' idea for a community procession was initially met with expressions of disbelief. Some members of the black community were incredulous at the idea that the city would give a black parade permission to stop traffic. \\"Ain't gonna let nobody go across that bridge, shut off that bridge and let y'all walk to the river.\\" Others were afraid of gang violence, but the actual event was both successful and peaceful. In 1975, their first year, they received $100 from the Philadelphia‚Äôs Southwest Center City Community Council and raised some neighborhood donations. The second year, they were awarded a $5,000 grant by Councilman John Anderson. From then on, the festival expanded rapidly. By Odunde's second decade, there was some opposition from people who found it too large and too loud. Fernandez strenuously and successfully opposed attempts to move the Odunde Festival from its original location. She emphasized the importance of keeping it in its neighborhood, close to its cultural roots. Its closest analog in the city was the Mummer's Parade which had formed out of white ethnic neighborhoods in the Seventh Ward around 1900. The local tradition of public parades also included African American Elks Lodge parades, and Catholic saint's parades. Fernandez identified gentrification as an impetus behind attempts to move the festival, and pointed out the racism of responding differently to white and black-based traditions. By creating Odunde and repeatedly emphasizing its place in a continuum of African-American history on South Street, Fernandez played an important role in the reappropriation of South Street and its signification as an important black cultural space. The Odunde Festival has provided an important source of visible continuity in the African and African-American community. In 1983, South Philadelphia-based ODUNDE Inc. was formed to support local cultural activity. The name ODUNDE comes from a Yoruba language word meaning ‚ÄúHappy New Year‚Äù. Fernandez served for many years as president of ODUNDE Inc., while her daughter, Oshunbumi Fernandez served as executive director. During this time, Fernandez and ODUNDE worked with the Philadelphia Folklore Project to document and preserve African American art and culture from South Philadelphia. In 1996, Lois Fernandez turned over the work of building an African-American cultural movement to her daughter Oshunbumi Fernandez. Oshunbumi Fernandez was a year old when her mother led the first ODUNDE festival. ==ODUNDE traditions== Held on the second Sunday in June, the celebration is now the largest African celebration on the east coast of the United States, and one of the \\"largest and longest-running African American street festivals\\" in the United States. It begins with a procession, usually starting from Twenty-Third and South Streets, over the South Street Bridge to the Schuylkill. There fruit, flowers, honey and other offerings are thrown into the river to honor the Yoruba river orisha Oshun. Participants tend to wear white or dress in traditional African clothing. They are accompanied by drummers, dancers, and vendors. After ceremonies at the river, the procession returns to a festival area, reminiscent of a Nigerian market, for music and other entertainment. Entertainers often perform at both South Street and Grays Ferry Avenue, and have included international artists such as drummer Babatunde Olatunji. ==Autobiography== Lois Fernandez worked with folklorist Debora Kodish to publish a memoir of her early life in South Philadelphia in the 1930s, 1940s and 1950s: Recollections (part one) (2016). It was released in 2016 with signings at the Mayor's reception room in Philadelphia City Hall, and the African American Museum in Philadelphia. ==Death== Lois Fernandez died peacefully at home on August 13, 2017. Several hundred people attended her \\"home-going service\\" at the Universal Audenried Charter High School.

They are put into suspended animation until they arrive. However, due to a systems malfunction, Carter is the last one left alive. When he makes it to the planet he finds that he has been in deep sleep for about 1,000 years. The ship is controlled by the minds of three volunteers, a monk, a scientist and a grande dame, who gave up their bodies as a way to control the ship. Upon awakening, Carter finds that the ship refuses to return to Earth. He meets the ship's robot, Nicodemus, but the only living thing he encounters is the alien Carnivore, who claims he came there through a time tunnel. He also states that he had a previous companion on the planet, a human named Shakespeare. Shakespeare took his name from a book of plays. Others arrive via the time tunnel; however, it is much more difficult to leave the planet in that manner. Several other alien species are also discovered living on the planet. ==Review== SF Book Reviews found the book lacking action and more interested in character actions or reactions to each other or their surroundings.

He served as a foreign correspondent for the Central News Agency (CNA) from 1974 until 1989, as well as the President of CNA from 1990 until 1992 and chairman from 1992 to 1993 and again 2009 until 2011. Hung also joined the Ministry of Foreign Affairs' diplomatic corp during the 1990s. He served as the Representative of Taiwan to Italy from 1993 until 2000. ==Early life and education== Hung was born on February 15, 1932 in Tamsui, Taiwan, to a professionally successful family. His father worked for the Bank of Taiwan branch in Banqiao District. Hung was raised in Taiwan under Japanese rule before and during World War II. As a result, Hung was fluent in Japanese, as well as Mandarin Chinese and English. Hung considered his mother language Japanese, followed by English and Mandarin in order of proficiency. He was educated by the Japanese prior to their defeat in 1945 during his sophomore year in high school. He spoke Japanese so fluently that he later served as the Japanese interpreter for President Lee Teng-hui. Hung and his wife only conversed in Japanese at home until the birth of their first child, when they added Taiwanese Hokkien to their household. Hung studied foreign languages and literature at National Taiwan University until his graduation in 1950. He served as an English-language interpreter in the Republic of China Armed Forces for five years, where he coordinated the communications with American troops stationed on Taiwan. Hung moved to the United States, where he received his master's degree in journalism from Southern Illinois University in 1965. Two decades later, Hung obtained a doctorate in history from Georgetown University in Washington D.C. in 1981. ==Career== He reported for United Press International (UPI) from the late 1960s until the early 1970s. Hung also worked for The China Post, an English-language newspaper based in Taiwan, where he served as chief editor. During his tenure as The China Post's chief editor, a major typhoon struck Taiwan. Hung was one of just two newspaper employees who made it to work at the Post during the typhoon. According to Jack Huang, the then-director of the newspaper, Hung edited the entire newspaper himself during the storm so that the daily paper could be published the next day. In 1974, Hung began work for the Central News Agency (CNA), the state news agency for the Republic of China (Taiwan). He served as a CNA correspondent in Jordan from 1974 to 1977, Washington D.C. from 1977 to 1980, Houston, Texas, from 1980 to 1983, Tokyo from 1983 until 1987, and London from 1987 until 1989. In 1990, Hung was named President of CNA, a position he held until 1992. He was also appointed chairman of CNA for two separate tenures: 1992‚Äì1993 and again from 2009 until 2011. Hung joined the Ministry of Foreign Affairs as a diplomat in the 1990s. He served as the Representative of Taiwan to Italy from 1993 until 2000. According to colleagues and aides, Hung, a talented linguist, took only a week to master the Italian language. Hung maintained good personal and professional relations with Italian officials, which led to an agreement to allow Taiwanese airlines to fly to Italy. Hung also oversaw the opening of the Taipei Economic and Cultural Representative Office, known Ufficio di Rappresentanza di Taipei in Italia, during his tenure as Representative. Hung later worked with Stephen S. F. Chen, another diplomat and politician, at the National Policy Foundation, a think tank affiliated with the Kuomintang. In 2010, Hung released the first ever English-language translation of the works of Lai He, a native Taiwanese poet and writer. Hung was chosen for the translation due to his experience as a linguist, translator and historian. The first English-language volume of Lai He's work, Lai He Fiction, a collection of twenty-one short stories translated by Hung, was published as a series of columns in The China Post before release as a book on October 22, 2010. The project was funded by the Central News Agency and the Hakka Affairs Council. In 2011, Hung published his book, A New History of Taiwan, inspired by Lian Heng's General History of Taiwan. He decried Taiwan's political divisions in the book, which he argued hindered the country's development. Additionally, he trained translators and taught journalism at several Taiwanese universities. == Death == Hung was diagnosed in January 2018 with rectal cancer that had spread to the kidneys. He was admitted to the hospital in January and underwent surgery, which initially proved successful. However, Hung suffered a heart attack and pulmonary infection during his recovery. Joe Hung died from complications of heart and lung disease at Linkou Chang Gung Memorial Hospital on February 20, 2018, at the age of 86.

Also, included in the gallery is the Agua Caliente Pioneer Cemetery. ==Brief history== King S. Woolsey Before the arrival of the European settlers in the region the area was home to the Tonto Apache tribe. They were the first to enjoy the natural hot spring waters which flowed in the area. Around 1748 and 1750, the Spanish missionaries arrived in the area and called it Agua Caliente which is Spanish for \\"hot water\\".

Woolsey, an American pioneer rancher, Indian-fighter, prospector and politician in 19th century Arizona owned a ranch where the hot spring waters were located. On one occasion John Ross Browne and Charles Debrille Poston a.k.a. \\"Father of Arizona\\", due to his efforts lobbying for creation of the territory, visited and stayed in Woolsey's ranch. According to John Ross Browne: \\"We had a glorious bath in the springs next morning.\\" By 1873, word had spread about the hot springs and many visitors, which included miners and cowboys went there.Thomas Edwin Farish, HISTORY OF ARIZONA. Volume VIII, Phoenix, Arizona, 1918, p.204 In 1897, a 22-room resort was built where Woolsey once had his ranch. It was named the \\"Agua Caliente Hotel\\". Arizona's first elected governor George W. P. Hunt was among those who visited and stayed in the hotel in the late 1800s. Various stone houses were built in the area, which included a store, saloon and residences. Plus, the small town also had a cemetery. ==Decline of Auga Caliente== The over-irrigation of the farms and ranches nearby may have been one of the causes for which the water of the springs dried up. During World War II, a swimming pool was built for the use of the officers of nearby Camp Horn. However, once the war was over and the Arizona State Highways 85 and I-8 were built and bypassed Agua Caliente, the town was deserted and eventually became a ghost town. ==Historic structures and artifacts== The following are the images of the Agua Caliente Resort and some of the ruins in Agua Caliente. ==Further reading== *\\"Ghost Towns and Historical Haunts in Arizona\\"; Publisher: Golden West Publishers; ASIN: B003HF06YA. ==See also== *Agua Caliente, Arizona * National Register of Historic Places listings in Arizona *National Register of Historic Places listings in Maricopa County, Arizona ==References== Historic properties Category:Ghost towns ","title":"List of historic properties in Agua Caliente, Arizona"},{"id":"56834406","text":"The Melody Lingers On is an album by vocalist Etta Jones featuring tributes to jazz vocalists, which was recorded in late 1996 and released on the HighNote label the following year.Jazz Depot: HighNote discography.

The November 2016 elections maintained Republican control of both the House and Senate. ==Dates of sessions== *Organizational day: January 3, 2017 *First session: February 2-May 22, 2017 *First extraordinary session: September 25, 2017 *Second extraordinary session: December 18, 2017 *Second session: February 5-May 25, 2018 Previous: 55th Legislature ‚Ä¢ Next: 57th Legislature ==Major legislation2017 Legislative Session=== *Criminal Justice - SB603 mandates the Oklahoma Department of Corrections to create individualized case plans for each offender *Education - HB1693 revised Oklahoma's A-F school grading system to comply with federal law *Education - SB301 expands the Lindsey Nicole Henry Scholarship program *Public Health - HB1703 expands pregnancy resource centers *Public Health - HB2039 authorizes prescriptions of Naloxone to combat state's opioid crisis *Taxation - SB845 raises the state tax on cigarettes by $1.50 per pack to $2.53 per pack *Taxation - HB2433 raises the state tax on motor vehicle by extending a portion of state sales tax to include motor vehicle purchases *Drivers License - HB1845 brings Oklahoma into compliance with the federal REAL ID Act *Drivers License - SB643 eliminates Oklahoma's administrative hearing procedure for revocation of drivers licenses *Crime and Punishment - HB1468 expands time limits for prosecution of sex crimes against children *Taxation - HB2298 eliminates tax credits for wind industry *Energy - SB867 expand ability for oil companies to conduct horizontal drilling *Tourism - SB872 transfer ownership of the American Indian Cultural Center and Museum from the state to the city of Oklahoma City *Taxation - SB120 extends tax credits for aerospace industry ===2017 First Special Session=== Following the Oklahoma Supreme Court ruling the tax increases found in SB845 unconstitutional, Governor Mary Fallin issued , later amended by , to convene a special meeting of the Oklahoma Legislature. Pursuant to Section 7 of Article VI of the Oklahoma Constitution, the Governor recommended the Legislature adopt the following matters: * Address the budget shortfall associated with the loss of revenue from the unconstitutionality of SB845 * Increase pay for public teachers * Increase pay for public employees * Provide supplemental funding for the Oklahoma State Department of Health ===2017 Second Special Session=== Following her veto of the amended fiscal year 2018 Oklahoma state budget, Governor Mary Fallin issued Executive Order 2017-43, later amended by subsequent order and again by an additional subsequent order, to convene a special meeting of the Oklahoma Legislature. Pursuant to Section 7 of Article VI of the Oklahoma Constitution, the Governor recommended the Legislature: * Provided supplemental funding for the Oklahoma Health Care Authority * Adopt wide-ranging tax increases and elimination of tax deductions and credits * Authorize expanded gambling by Native American tribes * Grant the Governor greater appointment powers over Executive agencies * Increase pay for public teachers ===2018 Legislative Session=Subsequent Events=== * On August 10, 2017, the Oklahoma Supreme Court, in the case of Naifeh v. Oklahoma ex rel Oklahoma Tax Commission, ruled 7-2 that SB845 violated the Oklahoma Constitution's tax raising clause by failing to obtain the super- majority of votes in the Legislature needed to raise taxes. SB845 had sought to raise the tax on cigarettes in an attempt to balance the fiscal year 2018 Oklahoma state budget. The Legislature had classified the measure as a \\"fee\\" as opposed to a \\"tax\\" but the Court disagreed with such classified. Without the revenues from the bill, the state budget lost over $200 million in anticipated revenue, forcing Governor Mary Fallin to convene an extraordinary session of the Legislature to revise the budget. * On August 31, 2017, the Oklahoma Supreme Court, in the case of Oklahoma Automobile Dealers Association v. Oklahoma ex rel Oklahoma Tax Commission, ruled 5-4 that HB2433 did not violate the Oklahoma Constitution's tax raising clause. HB2433 eliminated an exemption under the current state sales tax code which excluded motor vehicle purchases from the tax. By removing the exemption, the Legislature did not raise a tax for the purposes of the Constitution's tax raising clause and therefore was not required to obtain the super-majority of votes in the Legislature needed to raise taxes. * On December 19, 2017, the Oklahoma Supreme Court, in the case of Hunsucher v. Fallin, ruled 5-4 that SB643 unconstitutional under the Oklahoma Constitution's single-subject clause and Due Process Clause. SB643 eliminated Oklahoma's administrative hearings procedures for revocation of drivers licenses and allowed the Oklahoma Department of Public Safety to revoke the license without granting the affected driver a hearing before the Department or an administrative opportunity to object. ==Leadership== Oklahoma State Capitol Since the Republican Party holds the majority of seats in both the Oklahoma Senate and Oklahoma House of Representatives, they hold the top leadership positions in both chambers. In Oklahoma, the lieutenant governor serves as President of the Oklahoma Senate, meaning that he serves as the presiding officer in ceremonial instances and can provide a tie-breaking vote. Todd Lamb serves as the current Lieutenant Governor of Oklahoma. The current President pro tempore of the Oklahoma Senate, who presides over the state senate on the majority of session days is Mike Schulz of Altus. He is aided by Majority Floor Leader Greg Treat of Oklahoma City. The Democratic minority leader of the state senate is John Sparks of Norman. Paul Ziriax serves as the Secretary of the Oklahoma Senate. The Oklahoma House of Representatives is led by Speaker Charles McCall of Atoka. He is aided by Majority Floor Leader Jon Echols of Oklahoma City. The Democratic minority leader is Steve Kouplen of Beggs.

The distinctive second story > which stands today was added in 1887. Expanding the house here simply meant > adding a second story gabled room to each of the existing three bays. The > house mixes Greek Revival and Victorian stylistic impulses. It was built by John Thuesen, who was born near Copenhagen, Denmark, in 1843. He and his family joined the LDS church in 1856, and he immigrated to Utah in 1866. The house is also associated with Jens Petersen, who was born in Ramsin, Hvidbjerg, Denmark in 1860, and who immigrated to Utah in 1875 with his father Niels and brother Andreas. They were unusual because they were not LDS church members, but apparently were attracted to Utah based on reports from Danish Mormons who had come to Utah earlier. Jens bought this house in 1879, the three lived there, then in 1887 Jens added the second story and also built a store on the property.

The class was initially designated \\"25DD\\", referring to a date on the Japanese calendar, specifically the 25th fiscal year of the Heisei period (2013). The lead ship, Asahi, is the third ship to hold the name after the Asahi-class destroyer escort lent from the United States Navy in 1955, and the Imperial Japanese battleship. The second ship of the class, Shiranui, is the third ship to hold the name after the Murakumo and Kager≈ç-class destroyers. == Development == The procurement of the destroyer began in 2013 in response to the reduction in the number of destroyers (namely the ) within the JMSDF. The two major characteristics of this destroyer is its bigger emphasis on anti-submarine warfare and the adoption of the COGLAG (combined gas turbine electric and gas turbine) propulsion system. A second destroyer was procured a year later. ==Design== The Asahi class is based on the existing to reduce acquisition cost and allow future development and growth. Unlike the Akizuki class (which focuses on anti-aircraft warfare) the Asahi class focuses on anti-submarine warfare. ===Features=== The Asahi class is the first Japanese warship to be equipped with a COGLAG propulsion system. This allows the destroyer to be more fuel efficient than previous warships. Another unique feature about this destroyer is the usage of a GaN-AESA (gallium nitride - active electronically scanned array) Multifunction Radar. The Asahi class is the second Japanese class of warship to be outfitted with this technology (the Akizuki class was the first). The destroyer's radar is based on the FCS-3A radar used for the Akizuki class and uses gallium nitride to improve performance. In radar technology, gallium nitride offers a number of advantages over the traditionally used gallium arsenide (GaA). These advantages include higher power density, efficiency, thermal spreading and frequency coverage. This in turn allows the GaN chip to be smaller than their GaA counterpart, thus reducing cost and increasing overall cost effectiveness. ==Ships in the class== {class= ! Building no.  Pennant no.

Its editorial board included the Storting representative and attorney Wilhelm Frimann Koren Christie, Bishop Jacob Neumann, and the educator Lyder Sagen. The first volume of the journal was produced in four issues from 1834 to 1837, containing 39 articles altogether. Volume two appeared in 1842 with four issues containing 31 articles. The journal was printed by the company Chr. Dahl R.S., headed by Christopher Dahl, who in 1820 had taken over the press previously owned by his father, Rasmus Dahl. The expensive paper for the journal, which was imported from Copenhagen, and problems with the primitive printing technology resulted in the failure of the third issue. An important reason for the journal's failure also lay in the fact that the members of the journal's editorial team, who were also the most important contributors to Urda, had retired.

Defending WBC heavyweight champion Deontay Wilder defeated challenger Luis Ortiz by technical knockout in the tenth round. == Background == Wilder had first become WBC heavyweight champion in January 2015, after he defeated Bermane Stiverne via 12 round unanimous decision at the MGM Grand in Las Vegas. Stiverne had been making the first defence of the crown he had claimed after he beat Chris Arreola for the title that had been vacated by the retiring Vitali Klitschko. Wilder then saw off a host of challengers that included Eric Molina, Johann Duhaupas and Artur Szpilka before he was due to make a mandatory defence of his title against Alexander Povetkin in May 2016. However less than two weeks before the fight was due to take place Povetkin failed a drug test which meant the contest was called off altogether. Two months later Wilder fought replacement opponent Arreola and retired him in his corner after 8 rounds. A hand injury then kept Wilder out until February 2017 when he fought fellow undefeated American Gerald Washington, knocking him out in the 5th round. Meanwhile, the relatively unknown but well schooled and dangerous Ortiz had so far been unable to secure a title shot despite his high rankings. His 'high risk, low reward' factor meant that he was largely avoided by the divisions top fighters, but he had previously knocked out contenders Bryant Jennings and Tony Thompson before a short term deal in November 2016 saw him fight twice in two months and in Europe for the first time, first facing Malik Scott in Monaco. Scott was extremely negative and reluctant to engage throughout the contest and Ortiz was forced to go the full distance for the first time in his career, winning every round of a 12 round unanimous decision. He then faced the highly durable Dave Allen in Manchester and stopped him on his feet after 7 one sided rounds. In July 2017, it was reported that a deal was being worked out which would see Wilder defend his title against Ortiz on 4 November. Wilder's mandatory challenger Stiverne had accepted step aside money and agreed to face Dominic Breazeale on the undercard. On 29 September, Ortiz failed a drug test after he tested positive for the banned diuretics chlorothiazide and hydrochlorothiazide, which Ortiz claimed was because he was on medication to treat high blood pressure. The arranged fight was cancelled and Wilder faced Stiverne in a rematch instead, knocking him down three times on the way to delivering a sensational 1st round knockout. This meant Wilder had now stopped every opponent he had faced, the first fight with Stiverne being the only time he had been taken the distance in his career to date. On December 8, 2017, Wilder was ringside when Ortiz made his return to action and knocked out Daniel Martz in the 2nd round. After the fight, Ortiz called out Wilder in his post fight interview before Wilder joined him in the ring to reply, \\"I'm going to give you another chance, I want to fight the best and I think you're one of the best, so I guarantee you you'll have the fight.\\" Fresh negotiations for the fight to be rescheduled then began and by January 12, 2018 terms had been agreed for the fight to take place on March 3 at the Barclays Center in New York. The contest would be 32 year old Wilder's seventh defence of his crown and the 38 year old Ortiz's first shot at a world title. Both fighters went into the fight unbeaten as professionals and both were also widely regarded to be the toughest opponent of each fighter's career thus far. Wilder was to earn a career-high $2.1 million for the fight and Ortiz would receive a $500,000 purse. == The fight == The fight had a fairly cagey start as both men tried to work behind their jab with the more active and aggressive Ortiz getting the better of the first 4 rounds. The fight took a twist at the end of the 5th round as Wilder landed a powerful right hand on Ortiz' forehead that made the challenger stumble before Wilder caught him with a second right hand to the temple that sent Ortiz backwards into the ropes and on to the floor. Ortiz got to his feet and beat the count only for the bell to ring before any more punches could be thrown. Wilder began to find the target more in the 6th and he caught Ortiz with a right hand in the 7th but was clipped himself by counter right hook from Ortiz that stunned Wilder as Ortiz followed it up with a hard left hook, then began to unload and land hard shots to both head and body including a couple of big straight left hands that left the champion shaken and hanging on before the bell sounded to signal the end of the round. At the start of the 8th round Wilder's corner signalled to the referee to call time out to inspect Wilder's face giving him around an extra 20 seconds of recovery time despite there being no obvious cut or injury. Ortiz then tried to press home his advantage stalking Wilder as the champion looked for counters whilst regaining his composure. In the 9th Wilder made better use of his range and jab and towards the end of the round pushed Ortiz back with right hand before rushing in and nearly getting caught by a counter left hand by Ortiz which in turn blocked another right hand from Wilder. The entertaining contest took another turn mid way through the 10th round as both men exchanged blows with left hand by Ortiz and a right hook from Wilder that forced both men to grab each other with Ortiz being thrown to the ground by Wilder. The referee signalled no knockdown before Wilder unleashed a barrage of punches in a slightly wild and unorthodox yet ruthless and clinical fashion, Ortiz stood his ground until a heavy right hand pierced his guard and wobbled him before a second sent him down to the canvas on his knees. Ortiz managed to regain his feet for a second time but in the following exchange was immediately caught by another hard right hand from Wilder that staggered him, before the champion again unloaded another flurry of punches with a right uppercut finally putting Ortiz down for the third and final time in the fight as the referee stepped in to wave the contest off. == Aftermath == It was revealed that all three official ringside judges had Wilder ahead 85‚Äì84 at the time of the stoppage, whilst both Showtime and CBS Sports had it 86‚Äì83 in favour of Ortiz. Wilder gave his thoughts on the contest saying, \\"A true champion always finds a way to come back, and that's what I did tonight. Luis Ortiz is definitely a crafty guy. He put up a great fight. We knew we had to wear him down. I showed everyone I can take a punch. When Ortiz leaves tonight, he can hold his head high. He gave the fans a hell of a fight.\\" Wilder also added, \\"He was hitting me with those furious punches, throwing combos that knocked me off balance. I just had to get my range back and my fundamentals back and I was able to do that. I showed I was a true champion tonight. Ortiz was one of those fighters that everyone ducked, even champions ducked him,\\" Wilder said. \\"I wondered why it took so long for him to get a title shot and now we know.\\" Speaking through a translator Ortiz also gave a post fight interview saying, \\"I almost had him, and I think I would've if there were a few more seconds in the round, Wilder was definitely saved by the bell. I thought I had him out on his feet. But you have to give him credit, he weathered the storm.\\" He also added, \\"I feel fine, I did receive a right hand, but I'm OK. I was listening to the directions that my corner was giving me. In this sport, any punch can end a fight, in the ring anything can happen. I thought I was going to get a rhythm earlier but I thought I was winning the fight. This is heavyweight boxing and he caught me with a great shot. It was a great fight and he's a great champion.\\" When questioned about facing the winner of the upcoming unification clash between Anthony Joshua and Joseph Parker, Wilder reiterated his desire for a unification fight of his own when he added, \\"I'm ready right now. I always said that I want to unify, I'm ready whenever those guys are. I solidified my position at the top of the food chain tonight.\\" == Broadcasting == The fight was aired live on Showtime in the United States, live on Sky Sports in the United Kingdom; live on tvOne and iflix in Indonesia; live on beIN Sports in France and Asia-Pacific; and live on Fox Sports in Australia. The fight averaged 1.1 million viewers and peaked at 1.2 million on Showtime. The last time Showtime had done over 1 million viewers was in 2015 when Wilder had first defeated Stiverne for the WBC title. == See also == *Deontay Wilder vs. Luis Ortiz II == References == Category:Boxing in New York City Category:World Boxing Council heavyweight championship matches Category:2018 in boxing Category:2018 in sports in New York City Category:March 2018 sports events in the United States Category:Sports competitions in New York City ","title":"Deontay Wilder vs. Luis Ortiz"},{"id":"56834874","text":"Danger in the Dark is an American mystery novel by Mignon G.

Farr worked in the cotton industry in Mossley, and he became the secretary of the Mossley Card and Blowing Room Operatives' Association at an early age. He was a supporter of the Colne Valley Labour Union, and then became one of the first members of the Independent Labour Party (ILP). He and stood for the district council in the Yorkshire ward in 1893, and again in 1895, when he became the first independent labour councillor in the town. He became an alderman in 1899, and then in 1914 was elected as Mayor of Mossley. By this time, he was a member of the executive of the Amalgamated Association of Card and Blowing Room Operatives (Cardroom Amalgamation), to which his Mossley union was affiliated. He also became increasingly prominent in the Labour Party, to which the ILP was affiliated, and in 1921 was elected to its National Executive Committee, serving for two years. The Cardroom Amalgamation was a member of the United Textile Factory Workers' Association, and this organisation was keen to sponsor Labour Parliamentary candidates. In 1919, he was firstly adopted as its Prospective Parliamentary Candidate for Stalybridge and Hyde. Later in the year, he was instead adopted in Oldham, but Farr instead decided to contest Middleton and Prestwich. The party planned to stand him in the 1920 Middleton and Prestwich by-election, but due to a serious outbreak of smallpox in the town, the local party decided it best to leave the seat uncontested. Farr first stood in Middleton and Prestwich at the 1922 United Kingdom general election, taking 41.5% of the vote. When he was again a candidate in the 1923 United Kingdom general election, the Manchester Guardian described him as \\"... a well-known and popular leader of the cotton operatives, [who] will undoubtedly secure a heavy following\\" in the Chadderton and Middleton areas of the seat. Despite this, he took third place, and despite moving back into second, he again failed to win in 1924 and 1929. In 1919, Farr was elected to Lancashire County Council, and in 1929 became an alderman on that body. He finally stood in Oldham at the 1935 United Kingdom general election, taking fourth place in the two-seat constituency.

Trantalis (born October 14, 1953) is an American politician and mayor of Fort Lauderdale, Florida. Before his election as mayor, Trantalis served as a city commissioner for Fort Lauderdale from 2009 to 2017. == Political career  Fort Lauderdale City Commissioner (2003-2006) === Trantalis was elected to the Fort Lauderdale City Commission in 2003, and served until 2006. He was the city's first openly gay commissioner. === Fort Lauderdale City Commission (2013-2018) === Trantalis was elected to the Fort Lauderdale City Commission in a 2013 special election, defeating then-incumbent Charlotte Rodstrom, who instead ran for County Commission. He won the 2015 general election without much opposition.  \\"Homeless Hate Laws\\"  The City of Fort Lauderdale made international news when the commission voted to outlaw feeding the homeless. Trantalis voted against the ordinance, causing a major rift between himself and the commission. There was international outrage when a 93-year-old man, Arnold Abbot, was arrested for feeding the homeless. The City passed another feeding ban in 2017, despite public outcry. In 2016, the U.S. Department of Justice announced that it would probe Broward County and the City of Fort Lauderdale, in response to the homeless sharing ordinances. Trantalis has vowed that as Mayor, he would not enforce the ordinance.  Development  Trantalis has been an early opponent of overdevelopment in the coastal city. On the commission, he voted against many of the development proposals. In 2017, he voted against the controversial Bahia Mar development proposal. === Fort Lauderdale Mayor (2018-Present) ===  Fort Lauderdale Mayoral Election, 2018  The 2018 race for mayor of Fort Lauderdale was said to be the city's most heated election. Trantalis announced his intent to run for mayor late in October 2017. The election became about pressing issues such as development, infrastructure, traffic, and special interests. \\"Our infrastructure needs have reached a crisis level, and now we are discovering that mismanagement of city funds only made the situation worse\\", said Trantalis in a Sun Sentinel questionnaire. On January 12, 2018, Trantalis campaign staffer Elijah Manley was arrested by the Fort Lauderdale Police Department. Manley was accused of tampering with campaign signs. On This Week in South Florida, Trantalis defended Manley, saying that it could have been because of a mistaken identity. Manley accused the Fort Lauderdale Police Department of a \\"politically motivated\\" arrest and bias for their former boss, Bruce Roberts, who was running against Trantalis. Trantalis and Roberts exceed to a March 2018 runoff. Trantalis handily defeated Bruce Roberts, with a 64% landslide in the March 13th, 2018 General Election runoff. Trantalis is the first openly gay person to be elected Mayor of Fort Lauderdale.  Water & Sewer Infrastructure Crises  Trantalis' first term as Mayor has been marred by a growing infrastructure crises in the City of Fort Lauderdale. The crises has been partially blamed on the City's practice of diverting money from the water and sewer infrastructure fund to other projects. Since 2012, the City siphoned off at least $106 million from the fund. In 2019, Trantalis falsely claimed to have ended the process later clarifying that \\"We are weaning ourselves out of it.\\" The process was later rejected by state officials with Florida Department of Environmental Protection Secretary Valenstein stating, \\"Our message is simple: Engaging in the practice of diverting utility funds and sending that money elsewhere is no way to mitigate, monitor or address the issue of aging infrastructure.‚Äù Trantalis later responded saying ‚ÄúWe will get cited. There‚Äôs nothing we can do about that.‚Äù Trantalis has also been criticized for his lone vote against a $200 million sewer repair bond claiming he did not understand the \\"full scope\\" of the project and doubted the need to borrow such a large sum despite the City's Comprehensive Utilities Strategic Master Plan outlining the need for over $1.4 billion in repairs.Fort Lauderdale Comprehensive Utility Strategic Master Plan In 2020, the sewage crisis ballooned into an environmental disaster after over 211,000,000 gallons of sewage spilled into the City's waterways. The State of Florida Department of Environmental Protection has fined the City over $2.1 million‚Äîthe largest in State history‚Äîas a result of the City's poor handling of the crises. == Personal life == Dean Trantalis resides in Fort Lauderdale, Florida.

He played college football at Fort Hays State and Simon Fraser. ==Early life== Shepherd grew up in Ajax, Ontario, where he played youth football with the Ajax/Pickering Dolphins Football Club. ==College career== At Simon Fraser University, Shepherd redshirted his first year and was able to start every game his second year as a defensive end. He left the university after a total of two years, as he wasn't able to pay tuition. After leaving Simon Fraser, Shepherd spent time at working various jobs including at a plant nursery, electrical construction, and a boxing factory. Fort Hays State University later reached out to Shepherd, and Shepherd was able to pay his first semester of tuition before being put on athletic scholarship. After his 2017 season, Shepherd was named the MIAA Defensive Player of the Year. He was also invited to play in the 2018 Senior Bowl. ==Professional career== On November 20, 2017, it was announced that Shepherd had accepted his invitation to play in the 2018 Senior Bowl. He became the first player from Fort Hays State to receive an invitation to the Senior Bowl. Shepherd was productive during Senior Bowl practices and had his draft stock rise significantly after displaying speed, power, and technique while going up against the top offensive linemen in the nation. Shepherd unfortunately suffered a broken hand during Senior Bowl practice and was unable to participate in the official game. Shepherd attended the NFL Scouting Combine in Indianapolis and completed the majority of combine drills, but opted to skip the bench press due to his fractured hand. His performance continued to raise his draft stock and garnered him attention throughout the draft process. On March 12, 2018, Shepherd held a pro day at Fort Hays State, but opted to stand on his combine numbers and only performed positional drills for the scouts and team representatives from 16 NFL teams that attended. Shepherd attended ten private meetings with team and also performed at private workouts for multiple teams, that included the Dallas Cowboys, Arizona Cardinals, Atlanta Falcons, and Houston Texans. At the conclusion of the pre-draft process, Shepherd was projected to be a second or third round pick by NFL draft experts and scouts. He was ranked as the sixth best defensive tackle prospect in the draft by DraftScout.com and Scouts Inc. The New York Jets selected Shepherd in the third round (72nd overall) in the 2018 NFL Draft. Shepherd was the sixth defensive tackle drafted in 2018 and became only the third player to be drafted in the history of Fort Hays State. He became the first player to be drafted from Fort Hays State since Frankie Neal was drafted by the Green Bay Packers in the third round (71st overall) of the 1987 NFL Draft. On May 14, 2018, the New York Jets signed Shepherd to a four-year, $3.87 million contract that includes a signing bonus of $987,724. Shepherd was suspended for six games for violating the NFL's performance-enhancing drugs policy on September 10, 2019. It was revealed that Shepherd underwent a sports hernia surgery in the off-season plus battling a shoulder issue and a herniated disc in his back. Shepherd confessed about using the PEDs in an effort to speed up his recovery, which eventually led to his suspension. He was reinstated from suspension on October 29, 2019, and was activated on November 1, 2019. ==References *Fort Hays State bio *New York Jets bio Category:1993 births Category:Living people Category:People from Ajax, Ontario Category:Gridiron football people from Ontario Category:Canadian players of American football Category:American football defensive tackles Category:Simon Fraser Clan football players Category:Fort Hays State Tigers football players Category:New York Jets players ","title":"Nathan Shepherd (American football)"},{"id":"56834957","text":"David Bowie Is was a touring museum exhibit displaying history, artifacts and information about the life, music, films, tours, and art of English singer- songwriter and actor David Bowie. The show opened in March 2013 at the Victoria and Albert Museum in London and ended in July 2018 at the Brooklyn Museum in New York City. Over its 5-year run, it stopped at 12 museums around the world and attracted over 2 million visitors. At each museum, the exhibit displayed about 500 objects; often a few hundred were unique to that particular museum. An accompanying documentary film, also titled David Bowie Is, was directed by Hamish Hamilton, Katy Mullan, and Hanif Kureishi. After the exhibit closed in July 2018, it was announced that in early 2019 a new, virtual version of the exhibit would be released on virtual and augmented reality platforms. == History== Near the end of 2010, an archivist for Bowie's collection contacted the Victoria and Albert Museum (V&A;) and asked if they'd be interested in a display. Bowie had saved most of the artifacts, costumes, and props from his career and had almost 75,000 pieces in a private collection. Bowie allowed Victoria Broackes and Geoffrey Marsh, the V&A; museum curators, free access to his archives for the show, although he did not get involved with how the pieces were displayed, nor the narrative of the show itself. According to museum directors at the Brooklyn Museum, \\"David Bowie asked that the exhibit open in London and close here [in New York]\\". The V&A; Museum worked with 59 Productions and Real Studios to design the exhibit. When the show was first booked at the V&A; Museum, it was not generally felt that the exhibit would be very successful. However, it became the museum's fastest selling show with over 300,000 visitors. The success of the show at the V&A; museum resulted in the decision to take the exhibit on tour, and it has sold roughly two million tickets across 11 cities around the world as of March 2018. As of 2018, the \\"David Bowie Is\\" exhibition holds the record for being the most visited exhibit in the V&A; Museum's history. When Bowie died in early 2016, the museum tour was almost canceled, with concerns for if and how the show would go on. There were also discussions as to whether to keep the name in the present tense (David Bowie Is). The exhibit, which was at the Groninger Museum in the Netherlands at the time, instead extended the show for 4 weeks to allow grieving fans to attend. ==Exhibit contents== A typical stop of the exhibit included around 500 objects, including over 60 performance costumes, handwritten lyrics, and Bowie's own oil paintings. The exhibition was organized thematically rather than chronologically. It included outfits designed by Alexander McQueen, Hedi Slimane, Issey Miyake, Vivienne Westwood and Kansai Yamamoto. There were over 50 video pieces, including television performances, music videos and concert footage. Music journalist Dan Hyman wrote in Rolling Stone of the Chicago exhibition that the retrospective taught him five things about Bowie; Namely that Bowie was \\"... a Fantastic Painter and Illustrator‚Ä¶\\", \\"‚Ä¶an Avid Collector of Minutiae‚Ä¶\\", \\"‚Ä¶a Style Icon‚Ä¶\\", \\"‚Ä¶a Tech Geek at Heart‚Ä¶\\", and \\"‚Ä¶an Unflinching Self-Editor‚Ä¶\\". David Bowie on stage in 2002; a portion of the lights' \\"W\\",\\"I\\" and \\"E\\" are visible at the top of the picture Some museums included items unique to their country or city, reflecting Bowie's connection to the area. For example, in New York, where Bowie lived, Brooklyn Museum's Matthew Yokobosky said \\"We have the original backdrop from when he performed in \\"The Elephant Man\\" on Broadway, and moments from when he worked on Julian Schnabel‚Äôs film Basquiat, on the life of New York artist Jean-Michel Basquiat. ‚Ä¶ While most of the Young Americans album was recorded in Philadelphia, \\"Fame\\" was actually recorded in New York City. That's how John Lennon just happened to stop by the studio that day. He [Lennon] actually did a drawing for David in the studio and I have that drawing in the show.\\" Yokobosky also spoke about how and why they got the letters \\"BOWIE\\" for the exhibit: ‚ÄúThe first time I met with Bowie‚Äôs archivist at the archive, I looked down one of the aisles and saw a photograph of the letter W resting on a case. I asked what it was, and the archivist told me that it corresponded to one of the letters from Bowie‚Äôs New York marathon tour in 2002, when he played five theaters in five boroughs of the city in five days‚Äîand every night they moved these brilliant letters which spelled out his name in light bulbs. Well, I saw that tour in the Beacon Theater, and I just blurted out, ‚ÄòI want the letters.‚Äô They hadn't been seen since that tour, and we spent two months trying to figure out how to get them to work again.\\" While in Berlin at the Martin-Gropius-Bau museum, the exhibition added pieces from Bowie's time in West Berlin, his collaborations with Iggy Pop, and his Berlin Trilogy: Low (1977), \\"Heroes\\" (1977), and Lodger (1979). When David Bowie Is opened in Tokyo, pieces from Japanese collaborator Kansai Yamamoto were highlighted, having designed costumes during Bowie's Ziggy Stardust (1972) and Aladdin Sane (1973) periods. Scottish artist Paul Robertson contributed \\"The Periodic Table of Bowie\\" to the exhibition, a faux-periodic table of artists that have influenced, or were influenced by, Bowie over his career. The final stop of David Bowie Is at the Brooklyn Museum (2 March to 15 July 2018) saw the release of the album Live In Berlin (1978), as well as a 7‚Ä≥ single containing the US single edit of 'Time'/'The Prettiest Star'. There was also the red vinyl version of iSelect, a 12 song compilation, which had first been made available in this format at the Paris exhibition. Live In Berlin was recorded on 16 May 1978 at the Deutschlandhalle in West Berlin during Bowie‚Äôs Isolar II Tour. ==Technology== The V&A; Museum worked with audio company Sennheiser to create a custom audio experience for the exhibit. Originally the curators were nervous to ask visitors to wear headphones, fearing it would isolate them. As visitors walked around the exhibit, the audio changed as they entered \\"spheres\\" of Bowie's work, relating to particular events, people or cities that the artist has worked in. The headphones required no interaction; the music and information you hear simply changed as you approached different parts of the exhibit. Producer Tony Visconti, who worked with Bowie for many years, created a unique megamix from the master tapes of more than 60 Bowie songs for the exhibition. Part of the exhibition included a cavernous room with large video screens displaying various Bowie live performances throughout the years and featuring surround sound, in which visitors were asked to remove their headphones. ==Augmented reality app== Announced in 2018, the augmented reality application was released on iOS and android devices on 8 January 2019, coinciding with Bowie's birthday. Bowie's friend, actor Gary Oldman, provides the voice-over for the application, which allows users virtual access to the costumes, videos, handwritten lyrics, and original works of art as seen in the museum show. The application also includes access to \\"dozens\\" of items that were not part of the original exhibition. == Dates of museum shows == {  - ! Museum !! Location !! Opened !!

Retrieved March 14th, 2018. === The political and public economics of local government=== After an early interest in environmental economics, research on the Tiebout hypothesis, led Dennis Epple to adopt a perspective framed by competition between different localities;With regard to the Tiebout hypothesis, Epple and Allan Zelenitz argue that competition among numerous local jurisdictions alone doesn't prevent local governments from exercising monopoly power; as - unlike residents - land is immobile, local governments are able to capture at least some land rents. this perspective is present in much of his research on public and political economics, including school competition. In further research on interjurisdictional competition with Thomas Romer and Radu Filimon, Epple has explored the conditions under which there is an equilibrium between mobile consumers' choices in terms of housing location and public goods provision and how much scope for local redistribution there is if taxpayers are mobile or differ in preferences and incomes. In research with Holger Sieg (and Thomas Romer) in the late 1990s and early 2000s, Epple has further investigated the estimation of structural general equilibrium models of interjurisdictional competition. Corresponding applications, e.g. in the Boston Metropolitan Area, have found evidence of sophisticated voting behaviour in line with households' sorting into communities with similar public spending preferences and rejected myopic voting. Finally, in work with Richard Romano during the mid-1990s, Epple has studied how the presence of private alternatives affects public service provision in theory, finding (among else) that the public provision of services without restrictions on privately purchased supplements will be preferred by a majority of households relative to purely market or government- based provision systems, would maximize public and private expenditure on the public good, and be opposed by both poor and rich households. === Learning in industrial organisations === In the 1990s, Dennis Epple and Linda Argote contributed substantially to the theory of organizational learning. While Epple and Argote observe learning curves in many manufacturing organisations, they also observe considerable variation in the extent to which organisations' productivity increases in production, which they attribute to differences between organizations \\"memories\\", employee turnover, economies of scale and knowledge transfers from other products and organisations. Such transfers of knowledge are also observed across production shifts within the same plant and across stores owned by the same franchisee. === Economics of education === In 1998, Epple and Richard Romano developed a seminal model of competition between tuition-financed private schools, tax-financed, tuition-free public schools and students that differ in terms of ability and income. The model predicts that private schools will attempt to vary tuition to attract relatively able students through tuition discounts as less able yet wealthy students benefit from the educational peer effects due to their more talented but poorer peers. With regard to public and private schools, these predictions are borne out by later work with David Figlio, which moreover asserts that students' income plays a stronger role in determining placement in the hierarchy of private schools the more public school expenditure falls. In an extension, Epple, Romano and Elizabeth Newlon study the effect of student tracking on school competition and predict that tracking would increase the share of high ability students in public schools but also push wealthy, low- ability students into private education, which attracts the wealthiest and most talented students. These findings have led Epple and Romano to caution that the introduction of municipal school choice programmes may drive wealthy households out of the city centers into the suburbs.Epple, D., Romano, R. (2003). Neighborhood Schools, Choice, and the Distribution of Educational Benefits. In: Hoxby, C.M. (ed.). The Economics of School Choice. Chicago: University of Chicago Press, pp. 227-286. To prevent private schools from \\"skimming off\\" the wealthiest and most talented students, they argue in favour of sophisticated combinations of tuition floors and ceilings, which allow school vouchers to provide the benefits of school competition without making participation in the voucher system compulsory or abiding very high levels of educational stratification. Finally, Epple's and Romano's work on the impact of educational peer effects on student sorting into private and public education has also been applied (together with Holger Sieg) to higher education, which also witnesses the emergence of a hierarchy of schools in terms of quality that is associated with corresponding stratification among students by income and ability. == References  External links == *Dennis Epple's webpage on the website of the Tepper School of Business * Category:Living people Category:21st-century American economists Category:Carnegie Mellon University faculty Category:Education economists Category:Fellows of the Econometric Society Category:Political economists Category:Princeton University alumni Category:Public economists Category:Purdue University alumni Category:Year of birth missing (living people) ","title":"Dennis Epple"},{"id":"56834977","text":"People Say may refer to: *People Say (album), by Christian Falk *\\"People Say\\" (song), by the Dixie Cups *\\"People Say\\", a song by Don Diablo from Future *\\"People Say\\", a song by The Meters from Rejuvenation *\\"People Say\\", a song by Portugal.

In order to build up the necessary forces near the Cambodian border and sustain their operations Highway 13 needed to be opened and secured. Meanwhile, Central Office for South Vietnam (COSVN) commander General Tr·∫ßn VƒÉn Tr√† pursued a strategy of attrition using his People's Army of Vietnam (PAVN) and Viet Cong (VC) forces to attack U.S. military units to cause as many casualties as possible hoping that the Americans would conclude that the war was too costly and withdraw from South Vietnam. Tr√†'s deputy, General Ho√†ng VƒÉn Th√°i planned to use the experienced VC 9th Division commanded by Senior Col. Ho√†ng C·∫ßm, to spearhead COSVN's dry season offensive in B√¨nh Long Province. The initial target was the district capital of L·ªôc Ninh in order to neutralize the U.S. Special Forces and CIDG camp there and to embarrass the South Vietnamese Government. ==Operation== Operation Shenandoah II, 30 October - 19 November 1967 During the first weeks of the operation, the 1st and 3rd Brigades, 1st Division secured Highway 13 between Lai Kh√™ and Ch∆°n Th√†nh District. These forces also swept the Long Nguyen Secret Zone, situated between Highway 13 and the Michelin Rubber Plantation about northwest of Saigon, in Binh Duong Province. On 29 September, MG John H. Hay ordered the 1st Brigade with the 1st Battalion, 2nd Infantry Regiment and the 1st Battalion, 28th Infantry Regiment into the north of the Zone. On 30 September, the 3rd Brigade with the 2/2nd Infantry and the 2/28th Infantry were ordered into the southern half of the Zone. During the first days sweeping the Zone the U.S. forces made little contact with the VC. On 2 October, an Army of the Republic of Vietnam (ARVN) unit operating east of Highway 13 near Ch∆°n Th√†nh engaged a large VC formation and took heavy casualties. Documents found on the dead indicated they had clashed with a battalion-sized unit from the VC 272nd Regiment, sent to attack Ch∆°n Th√†nh in order to cover the movement of the 271st Regiment into the Long Nguyen area. On 4 October the 1/2d Infantry engaged a VC company 9 km southwest of Ch∆°n Th√†nh, killing 12 before the VC withdrew to the west. To pursue the retreating VC, the 1st Battalion, 18th Infantry Regiment was instructed to conduct an air-assault into a clearing located about west of the 1/2nd Infantry, in order to block enemy troops. The 1/18th Infantry landed unopposed, and they immediately set up their standard field position with wire entanglements to protect the base. On 6 October, the 1/18th Infantry's position was hit by VC mortar fire causing little damage. At 18:00 it began to rain and an hour later the VC started attacking the perimeter from different directions, but the attack was repulsed with the support of artillery and mortar fire. By midnight the fight was over, U.S. casualties were 5 killed and 4 wounded. Three weeks later a captured VC soldier from the 2nd Battalion, 271st Regiment, revealed that his unit lost 59 killed and 56 wounded in the attack. On 8 October, 1/2nd Infantry was moved to Ph∆∞·ªõc Vƒ©nh Base Camp to act as the division's reaction force. The 2/28th Infantry was then lifted from Lai Kh√™ and landed about northwest of Ch∆°n Th√†nh, and north-west of 1/18th Infantry's position. On 10 October 1/2nd Infantry was deployed into new blocking positions, as VC units were believed to be moving toward the Michelin Rubber Plantation. On 11 October 11, two companies from 1/18th Infantry probed northwards and were immediately attacked by the VC. While under heavy fire, the lead company was ordered to pull back behind a perimeter formed by the second company. As the lead company fell back, artillery and air support were called in to pummel the VC's attacking formation. When the battle was over, 21 VC were found dead, whereas U.S. casualties for the day were 1 killed and 4 wounded. On 13 October, 1/18th Infantry was moved to Ph∆∞·ªõc Vƒ©nh for rest and refitting. By mid-October, MG Hay believed the VC 271st Regiment had suffered a major defeat and was ready to withdraw from the Long Nguyen Secret Zone, so he was ready to terminate the operation. However, increased VC activity near the Ong Thanh Stream, which flowed near the Binh Duong-Binh Long provincial boundary, where the 1st Brigade made most of its contacts, had indicated otherwise. ===Battle of Ong Thanh=== Map of the Battle of Ong Thanh On the morning of 16 October, two companies of the 2/28th Infantry commanded by Lt Col. Terry de la Mesa Allen Jr. left their night defensive position along the Ong Thanh Stream to patrol an area to the southeast, which was covered by thick jungle canopy. After marching for about , the battalion found a fortified VC bunker and pulled back to allow airstrikes against the VC positions. When the airstrikes were over, they reentered the camp and a firefight broke out with VC snipers firing down from trees in the surrounding areas. U.S. forces pulled back and artillery strikes were called in against VC bunker positions. They again re-entered the camp, and they discovered the bodies of 17 VC. Moving through the western end of the camp, and another fire-fight broke out with an estimated 60 VC. Later that afternoon Lt. Col. Allen decided to break contact and return to base, to avoid fighting a battle that could last until the evening. In the meantime, however, he called in air-strikes to inflict further damage on the VC. On the morning of 17 October the 2/28th Infantry renewed their attack against the VC position and at approximately 10:00 they triggered a 3-sided ambush by the 271st Regiment reinforced by 200 soldiers from the VC C1 Company of Rear Service Group 83. At 12:00 the 2/28th Infantry attempted to withdraw which quickly descended into chaos as the U.S. forces were pursued by intense fire killing Allen among others. U.S. losses were 64 killed, 75 wounded and 2 missing. VC losses were unknown, the 1st Brigade reported an estimated body count of 101, but the U.S. relief force found only 2 VC dead. ===First Battle of Loc Ninh=== L·ªôc Ninh Special Forces Camp and airfield After clearing the Long Nguyen Secret Zone, the next stage of the operation called for the 1st and 3rd Brigades to secure Highway 13 through An L·ªôc up to L·ªôc Ninh 25 km farther north, however II Field Force commander LTG Frederick C. Weyand suspended this phase as it became apparent that COSVN was preparing to launch a major offensive in northern III Corps. In late September and early October patrols from the L·ªôc Ninh Special Forces Camp had discovered an engineer company from the VC 9th Division building a large hospital on the S√¥ng B√© River several kilometers west of L·ªôc Ninh and elements of the 84A Artillery Regiment (which operated in support of VC infantry) camped within a few kilometers of L·ªôc Ninh. Allied intelligence also obtained documents indicating that the 9th Division would begin a major operation in B√¨nh Long Province on or about 25 October. LTG Weyand ordered MG Hay to prepare contingency plans for the defense of the district capitals of L·ªôc Ninh and S√¥ng B√©. After midnight on 27 October, under cover of mortar fire the VC 88th Regiment attacked S√¥ng B√©, while 2 PAVN battalions attacked an ARVN 5th Division base camp several kilometers southeast of S√¥ng B√©. The 200 ARVN defenders held on with air support and eventually forced the PAVN to withdraw, on searching the battlefield in the morning they found 134 PAVN dead and captured 2 wounded soldiers, 73 abandoned weapons, including 3 flamethrowers and 10 machine guns were also found. ARVN losses were 5 killed and 7 civilian laborers were also killed. An ARVN Ranger Battalion and the 1/18th Infantry flew into S√¥ng B√©, but the VC had already withdrawn and the 1/18th Infantry, returned to Lai Kh√™ on the afternoon of 28 October. At 01:00 on 29 October the 9th Division attacked L·ªôc Ninh starting with a barrage of 122-mm. rockets and 82-mm. and 120-mm. mortar rounds against the Special Forces camp and the South Vietnamese district headquarters. The defenders responded with their own mortar fire and called for support. At 02:00 VC sappers attacked the district headquarters detonating satchel charges on the northern perimeter wire clearing the way for 2 battalions of the 273d Regiment. The defenders withdrew into the south of the compound. A pair of U.S. UH‚Äì1B helicopter gunships arrived on the scene and began attacking the VC and were soon joined by an AC‚Äì47 Spooky gunship which poured fire on VC reserve forces in the nearby treeline. Despite this air support, the situation in the compound remained desperate and the district chief called for a Proximity fuse artillery barrage on his own position which caused devastating losses to the exposed VC. At 04:00 the VC withdrew pursued by air and artillery strikes. At dawn, the ARVN found that some VC had stayed behind in bunkers in the compound and after reinforcements arrived they proceeded to methodically clear out the VC using M72 LAW rockets. 135 VC had been killed in the attacks on L·ªôc Ninh while the ARVN lost 8 killed and 33 wounded. On the morning of 29 October, two companies from the 2/28th Infantry and a battery of 105-mm. howitzers were flown into L·ªôc Ninh to set up a firebase at the southwest corner of the airstrip. By 09:50 the battery was operational and conducting preparatory fire for the landing of the 1/18th Infantry 3.5 km to the northwest. The battalion landed unopposed and established a defensive perimeter to establish a firebase. At 12:00, a CIDG company radioed that it had engaged a PAVN platoon 1 km north of the landing zone and Company C 2/28th Infantry was sent to support the CIDG company, hitting the PAVN from behind, killing 9 and scattering the rest. Two more PAVN platoons then counterattacked Company C and Company D was sent in a flanking attack forcing the PAVN to withdraw. 5 PAVN had been killed and documents on them indicated that they were from the PAVN 165th Regiment. On the morning of 30 October the 165th Regiment attacked Company A, 1/18th Infantry, as it was reconnoitering the area around its landing zone. Company D and a CIDG company were immediately sent to assist forcing the PAVN back to a low hill where they took refuge in some shallow irrigation trenches. The U.S. forces called in air and artillery strikes and then the CIDG forces attacked forcing the PAVN into a gully where they were hit by further air and artillery strikes. 83 PAVN had been killed and 32 weapons were captured. MG Hay ordered the 1st Brigade to move its headquarters to Qu·∫ßn L·ª£i Base Camp to prepare for a renewed attack on L·ªôc Ninh. Just after midnight on 31 October, rockets and mortar shells began pounding the district compound, the Special Forces camp, and the airstrip artillery firebase. As the barrage ended, helicopter gunships and an AC-47 arrived over L·ªôc Ninh and began firing on suspected assembly areas. They were met by heavy machine gun fire from the PAVN 208th Anti-Aircraft Battalion. At approximately 02:00 hundreds of 272nd Regiment troops emerged from the treeline on the eastern side of the airstrip. Their attack was met by interlocking fire from the 3 U.S./ARVN positions around the airstrip. A small group of VC made it across the airstrip and fought their way into the district headquarters compound, however as no follow-up troops were able to advance they soon abandoned their attack and withdrew. At dawn the 272nd Regiment withdrew east, leaving 110 dead. ARVN/U.S. losses were 9 killed and 59 wounded. The 1/28th Infantry was sent southeast of L·ªôc Ninh in pursuit of the 272nd Regiment and killed 11 VC over the next two days, but failed to locate main body of the 272nd Regiment. On the evening of 1 November, the 84A Artillery Regiment hit L·ªôc Ninh with mortar and rocket fire and a battalion from the 272nd Regiment then hit the district compound with machine gun fire, however this attack was just a diversion and at 00:30 on 2 November 82-mm. mortar shells began to hit the 1/18th Infantry firebase. U.S. night observation posts around the base reported that VC forces were converging, detonated their Claymore mines and retreated into the base perimeter. The VC sprayed the base with fire to try to locate the U.S. heavy weapons positions but the U.S. troops had been ordered to hold their fire. When VC mortars began firing on the base they were engaged by helicopter gunships which were then met by antiaircraft fire from at least 12 heavy machine guns and fighter- bombers were called in to silence these. At 04:15, the 273rd Regiment began its attack which was met with intense defensive fire and faced with this by 04:45 the VC began to withdraw. At dawn the 1/18th policed the perimeter finding 263 VC dead while drag marks and blood trails suggested their losses were even higher. U.S. losses were 1 killed and 8 wounded. On 2 November 1 Brigade was given operational control over the 3rd Brigade's 1st Battalion, 26th Infantry Regiment which made an unopposed landing 4 km northwest of L·ªôc Ninh and the 2nd Battalion, 12th Infantry Regiment, from the 25th Infantry Division which made an unopposed landing 6 km northeast of L·ªôc Ninh. There were now 4 U.S. infantry battalions deployed around Loc Ninh. That evening Col. C·∫ßm sent the 1st Battalion, 272d Regiment to assault the 2/12th Infantry position hoping to catch them before they had time to fortify their base. The attack began at 02:30 on 3 November but was quickly forced back by the already entrenched infantry and artillery and air support. The VC withdrew at 04:00 leaving 57 dead and 7 wounded, while U.S. losses were 4 killed. On 6 November the 1/26th Infantry moved to a new firebase northeast of L·ªôc Ninh and began probing east towards where the 272nd Regiment was believed to be regrouping. The 1/18th Infantry returned to Qu·∫ßn L·ª£i and the 2/12th Infantry was redeployed to S√¥ng B√©. Part of the 2/28th Infantry remained at its firebase at L·ªôc Ninh airstrip. On the morning of 7 November with Company A remaining to guard their firebase, the rest of 1/26 Infantry left to patrol a dirt road bordered by a rubber plantation. At 13:05 the column moved into the rubber trees and the lead company was quickly ambushed by VC from the 3rd Battalion, 272nd Regiment in the plantation while small arms and machine gun fire raked the column on the road. VC fire killed the battalion commander and his command group, wounded 2 company commanders and disabled most of their radios. Company D was at the rear of the column and its commander Captain Raymond H. Dobbins was able to manoeuvre troops to prevent the VC from outflanking to column. Captain Dobbins assumed temporary command of the battalion, calling in air and artillery strikes to cover the unit as it withdrew to a more defensible position. After an hour the VC broke contact leaving 66 dead according to US claims while U.S. losses were 18 killed and 22 wounded. With no further VC activity MG Hay concluded that the VC had disengaged and retreat to its sanctuaries across the border in Cambodia. The Battle of L·ªôc Ninh was over with the US claiming that the PAVN/VC losses were more than 850 killed while U.S./ARVN losses were 50 killed. ===Further attacks at S√¥ng B√© and Bo Duc=== While the VC 9th Division withdrew from L·ªôc Ninh, elements of the 5th Division were gathering near S√¥ng B√©, 40 km east with the 275th Regiment arriving to join the 88th Regiment. On the morning of 6 November, elements from the 275th Regiment ambushed a company from the ARVN 5th Infantry Division south of S√¥ng B√©. The forces became intermingled preventing the use of air and artillery strikes. The ARVN claim to have killed 265 VC, while ARVN losses were 54 killed and 15 missing in action. As the 275th regiment did not usually operate in this area, with the 1st and 3rd Brigades occupied at L·ªôc Ninh, LTG Weyand ordered two battalions from the 25th Infantry Division to sweep the area around S√¥ng B√©. After two weeks of uneventful patrolling the battalions returned to their parent units. Soon afterwards CIDG forces observed the 271st Regiment moving into the area and PAVN/VC forces building fortifications near the abandoned hamlet of Bu Gia Map, 28 km northeast of S√¥ng B√©. On 25 November elements of the 275th Regiment attacked the ARVN camp south of S√¥ng B√© in a 4 hour long firefight, resulting in more than 100 VC dead. On 26 and 28 November CIDG troops from Bo Duc 20 km northwest of S√¥ng B√© observed unidentified PAVN/VC forces moving through the area. Just after midnight on 29 November the 2nd and 3rd Battalions, 272nd Regiment attacked the Bo Duc District headquarters which was defended by a reconnaissance company from the ARVN 5th Division, a company of Regional Forces and two Popular Forces platoons, meanwhile VC mortar fire prevented the CIDG forces at the Bu Dop Special Forces camp 2 km north of Bo Duc from reinforcing the district headquarters. A group of VC penetrated the southern perimeter of the district headquarters forcing the defenders into the northern half of the compound. The U.S. adviser called in air strikes against VC weapons positions and then, as the VC came closer, napalm and bombs within the compound to halt the VC advance. The ARVN then counterattacked and drove the VC back out of the compound. The battle ended at 06:30, VC losses were 96 dead while ARVN losses were 15 dead. On the afternoon of 29 November Bo Duc was reinforced by the arrival of 2 ARVN infantry battalions, while 1/28th Infantry and Battery A 2nd Battalion, 33rd Artillery Regiment, deployed to Bu Dop establishing a firebase at the northwestern end of the runway. At 22:00 that night, VC mortar rounds and 122-mm. rockets hit the firebase. When the barrage lifted, hundreds of VC from the 3rd Battalion, 271st Regiment and elements of the 80A Replacement and Training Regiment advanced from the treeline on the eastern side of the runway. As the VC crossed this 200m distance to the firebase, the 2/33rd Artillery crews depressed their howitzer barrels and fired directly into the advancing VC while the 1/28th Infantry engaged them with all available weapons. 2 helicopter gunships soon arrived overhead and they were met by intense antiaircraft fire from more than 10 heavy machine guns. The helicopters spotted the VC mortar positions in a nearby hamlet and engaged these as fighter-bombers came on station. By 00:30 the VC began to disengage leaving 31 dead while U.S. losses were 7 dead. Over the following week, Allied patrols skirmished with VC forces around Bo Duc and each night mortar shells landed in the town. Anticipating another VC attack on Bo Duc, on 6 December MG Hay deployed the 1/2nd Infantry and Battery B, 1st Battalion, 5th Artillery Regiment, to establish a firebase southeast of Bo Duc. At 01:00 on 8 December, the 3rd Battalion, 273rd Regiment, attacked the firebase under a barrage of Rocket-propelled grenades. The 1/5th Artillery levelled their guns and fired on the advancing VC infantry. As the full weight of U.S. air and artillery support was brought to bear on the VC they began to withdraw at 03:00 leaving 49 dead while U.S. losses were 4 killed. Between 25 November and 8 December, the PAVN/VC had lost at least 400 men and possibly up to twice that number at S√¥ng B√©, Bo Duc and Bu Dop. On 5 December a battalion from the 88th Regiment carried out the ƒê·∫Øk S∆°n massacre killing more than 200 Montagnards. ===Highway 13 and Caisson VI=== Battle of Caisson VI 10 December 1967 As part of their security operation along Highway 13, the 3rd Brigade, 1st Infantry Division had established a line of firebases named Caisson I through VII at 10 km intervals along the road between Lai Kh√™ and An L·ªôc from which road security and minesweeping operations would be conducted. The PAVN 7th Division commanded by Senior Col. Nguyen Hoa sought to close Highway 13 and shortly after midnight on 24 November sent his 2nd Battalion, 165th Regiment to attack a U.S. night defense position on the shoulder of Highway 13 12 km south of An L·ªôc. The U.S. force consisted of Company B, 1/18th Infantry, a platoon from the 1st Squadron, 4th Cavalry Regiment equipped with 3 M48A3 tanks and 4 M113 armored personnel carriers and two platoons from the 2nd Battalion, 2d Infantry (Mechanized), equipped with 11 M113s. As the attack began, PAVN RPGs failed to disable any of the armored vehicles and sappers were unable to reach the perimeter wire due to the volume of fire coming from the U.S. armored vehicles. When helicopter gunships and an AC-47 arrived overhead the PAVN began to withdraw leaving 57 dead, U.S. losses were 4 dead. Just after midnight on 3 December, Hoa sent his 1st Battalion, 141st Regiment into action against another night defensive position 3 km south of the 24 November attack. The defending force consisted of Company D, 1/18th Infantry, and a mechanized platoon from Company C, 2/2nd Infantry. This time the PAVN succeeding in penetrating the perimeter before again being forced back by defensive fire, air and artillery strikes. PAVN losses were 27 killed, while U.S. losses were 7 killed. On 10 December Colonel Hoa targeted Caisson VI () 6 km south of An L·ªôc. Defending the base was Company A, 1/18th Infantry and Troop A, 1st Squadron, 4th Cavalry with 3 M48A3 tanks and 4 M113s dug into fighting positions around the perimeter. The base also housed Battery A, 6th Battalion, 15th Artillery, equipped with 105-mm. howitzers and Battery C, 8th Battalion, 6th Artillery Regiment, equipped with 155-mm. howitzers. At 02:00 a barrage of 75-mm. recoilless rifles and 82-mm. and 120-mm. mortars hit the firebase. When this barrage ended VC from the 165th Regiment attacked the north, west and east of the perimeter. Sapper teams penetrated the northern perimeter and VC troops raced for the gap which was soon covered by Canister shot from the M48s. Intensive artillery fire soon forced the PAVN to withdraw and by 03:30 the battle was over. At dawn U.S. soldiers policed the perimeter finding 143 dead, U.S. losses were 1 killed. ==Aftermath== The operation concluded on 10 December 1967. The U.S. forces had successfully reopened Highway 13 and claimed to have inflicted serious losses on several PAVN/VC Battalions blunting their offensive plans. ==References== Category:1967 in Vietnam Category:Battles and operations of the Vietnam War Category:Battles and operations of the Vietnam War in 1967 Category:History of B√¨nh D∆∞∆°ng Province Category:History of B√¨nh Ph∆∞·ªõc Province ","title":"Operation Shenandoah II"},{"id":"56835057","text":"Professor Wong Yuk-shan, BBS, JP (; born 1950) is a Hong Kong politician and academic.

In 2016, he was linked to the leakage of the Panama Papers. He runs the Maranatha Christian Church, a religious congregation with more than 16,000 followers in Latin America that expands social work and evangelist through the Civil Association El Evangelio Cambia, of which he is a leader and founder. He was a candidate in the 2018 Venezuelan presidential election. == Biography == Javier Bertucci was born on November 16, 1969, in Guanare, Portuguesa, to a peasant family that subsisted on a banana and tobacco producing plantation. His great-grandmother, Maria de las Nieves, helped the Bertucci family experience economic mobility. Using family land to cultivate topochos in the town of San Nicol√°s, Portuguesa State, Bertucci cut the topochos and sold them on a nearby road. Subsequently, the hacienda grew by diversifying its agricultural production on a small scale which grew his family's wealth. Bertucci completed both his primary and secondary education in the town of Yagua (north of Valencia). In school he met Francisco Barrios at age 12, who introduced him to his future wife Rebeca Barrios, Francisco's sister. In 1994, at the age of 24, Bertucci married Rebeca Barrios. They have three children: Raquel Rebeca, Valeria Alejandra and Javier Abraham. Bertucci began to follow the Evangelical Christian Church in 1990, when he had \\"an experience with God at 21 years old.\\" He decided to start a pastorate career a month after his marriage when he received the \\"call of God\\" (an expression that indicates when a believer recognizes the task to follow within a church or in your life as a Christian). From 1993, with his wife Rebeca, Bertucci began to preach in squares, parks, and houses. In the 1990s, the Bertucci Barrios family moved to Valencia, where they lived, and simultaneously formed a small evangelical church in the town of Tinaquillo (Cojedes, 48 km southwest of Valencia), which remained for the next five years. == House arrest == On July 2, 2010, Bertucci was charged with aggravated smuggling and conspiracy to commit a crime. He was detained for three days when he tried to move a 5,000-metric-ton tanker ship from the Ocamar dock in Puerto Cabello to the port of Barahona in the Dominican Republic. The ship was thought to contain 5,000 tons of diesel disguised as paint thinner. The diesel, through its Tecnopetrol company, was referenced in file GP01-R-2010-000234 of the Court of Appeals. url with English translation During the presentation hearing, prosecutors Armando Galindo, Yolanda Carrero and Francisco Leal requested that Bertucci receive a custodial (incarceration) sentence. On July 4, the first judge in control of the Criminal Judicial Circuit, extension Puerto Cabello, Henry Chirino, ordered his house arrest. On September 30 of the same year he was granted a permit to leave his residence only to officiate at the Maranatha Church. On December 20, Bertucci received a substitute measure of freedom with a filing system and was banned from leaving the country. His defense appealed and the court annulled the sentence, initiating a new trial that is still in progress under judge No. 2 of the Judicial Criminal Circuit of Carabobo state, Rosa Matute. The Venezuelan Supreme Court of Justice does not have a record of a signature sentence on the case. == Panama Papers == Bertucci was linked to the leakage of the Panama Papers in 2016. According to a series of emails delivered to the German newspaper S√ºddeutsche Zeitung consulted for an investigation by journalist Katherine Pennacchio, Bertucci contacted the law firm Mossack Fonseca to be the president of Stockwin Enterprises Inc, a company created in Panama on January 3, 2012, with a capital investment of five million dollars dedicated to the purchase and sale of inputs, mainly the importation of raw materials from the food sector. Desir√© Obadia, an intermediary client of the company and the person in charge of negotiating with Mossak Fonsecca, denied that the transaction had been completed, stating that in order to import an import license and Cadivi dollars (National Center for Foreign Commerce) were needed, and that neither of the two were obtained. During the investigation, attempts were made to contact Bertucci on several occasions, but no response was received until five days after the report was published, when Bertucci explained that the initiative did not materialize and that he did not have the resources to possess accounts in tax havens. Both the intermediary of Mossack Fonseca and Bertucci denied the accusations and rejected the investigative work done by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists. The journalist was subjected to cyberbullying and attacks on social networks headed by Bertucci himself. == Political career== Altamira, Caracas. In January 2018 he announced his presidential candidacy, in which he referred to his desire to be \\"the light among the darkness,\\" to seek to electoral victory over Venezuelan leader Nicol√°s Maduro, and to affect change in the country. As the Venezuelan constitution establishes a secular requirement for those running for office, Bertucci had to leave his occupation as a pastor. Among his proposals as a candidate is the lifting of exchange control. He has also declared that he would not govern with Chavismo or with the opposition. He has additionally expressed his desire to implement Sunday radio and television channels using the Bible, and converting Venezuelans into \\"devotional\\" Christians, and to implement \\"Christian values\\". He has positioned himself against same-sex marriage and is in favor of abortion only in medical cases or that compromise the life of the mother. ==References * Decisi√≥n de Corte de Apelaciones Sala Dos de Carabobo, de 31 de Agosto de 2010 vLex Venezuela.

During the German occupation of Poland, some citizens of all its major ethnic groups collaborated with the Germans. Estimates of the number of collaborators vary. Collaboration in Poland was less institutionalized than in some other countries, and has been described as marginal. During and after the war, the Polish State and the Resistance movement punished collaborators, with thousands sentenced to death. ==Background== Following the German occupation of Czechoslovakia in March 1939, Hitler sought to establish Poland as a client state, proposing a multilateral territorial exchange and an extension of the German‚ÄìPolish Non- Aggression Pact. The Polish government, fearing subjugation to Nazi Germany, instead chose to form an alliance with Britain (and later with France). In response, Germany withdrew from the non-aggression pact and, shortly before invading Poland, signed the Molotov‚ÄìRibbentrop Pact with Soviet Union, safeguarding Germany against Soviet retaliation if it invaded Poland, and prospectively dividing Poland between the two totalitarian powers. On 1 September 1939 Germany invaded Poland. The German army overran Polish defenses while inflicting heavy civilian losses, and by 13 September had conquered most of western Poland. On 17 September the Soviet Union invaded the country from the east, conquering most of eastern Poland, along with the Baltic states and parts of Finland in 1940. Some 140,000 Polish soldiers and airmen escaped to Romania and Hungary, and later many soon joining the Polish Armed Forces in France. Poland's government crossed over into Romania, later forming a government-in-exile in France and then in London, following the French capitulation. Poland as a polity never surrendered to the Germans. Nazi authorities annexed the westernmost parts of Poland and the former Free City of Danzig, incorporating it directly to Nazi Germany, and placed the remaining German-occupied territory under the administration of the newly formed General Government. The Soviet Union annexed the rest of Poland, incorporating its territories into the Belarusian and Ukrainian Soviet republics. Germany's primary aim in Eastern Europe was the expansion of the German Lebensraum which necessitated according to Nazi views the elimination or deportation of all non-Germanic ethnicities, including Poles; the areas controlled by the General Government were to become \\"free\\" of Poles within 15‚Äì20 years. This resulted in harsh policies which targeted the Polish population, in addition to the explicit goal of exterminating Polish Jews, which was carried out by Nazi Germany in the occupied Polish territories. ==Individual collaboration== Polish-language recruitment poster: \\"'Let's go do farm work in Germany!' See your w√≥jt right away.\\" Estimates of the number of individual Polish collaborators vary according to the definition of \\"collaboration\\". According to Klaus-Peter Friedrich estimates range from as few as 7,000 to as many as several hundred thousand (including Polish officials employed by the German authorities; Blue Police officers, who were required to serve; compulsory \\"labor service\\" workers; members of Poland's German minority; and even Poland's peasantry, which on the one hand was subject to food requisitions by the Germans, and on the other collaborated and benefited financially from the wartime economy and the removal of Jews from the Polish economy for much of the war. Post-war communist Polish propaganda painted the entire non-communist Polish resistance, in particular the Home Army, as \\"Nazi collaborators\\". Czes≈Çaw Madajczyk estimates that 5% of the population in the General Government actively collaborated, which he contrasts with the 25% who actively resisted the occupation.Czes≈Çaw Madajczyk, Kann man in Polen 1939-1945 von Kollaborationsprechen, okupation und Kollaboration 1938-1945. Beitrage zu Konzepten und Praxis der Kollaboration in der deutschen Okkupationspolitik, Berlin, Heidelberg, W. Rohr, 1994,p. 140. Historian John Connelly writes that \\"only a relatively small percentage of the Polish population engaged in activities that may be described as collaboration, when seen against the backdrop of European and world history.\\" However, he criticizes the same population for its indifference to the Jewish plight, a phenomenon he terms \\"structural collaboration\\" (see more below). ==Political collaboration== Unlike the situation in most German-occupied European countries where the Germans successfully installed collaborationist governments, in occupied Poland there was no puppet government. The Germans had initially considered the creation of a collaborationist Polish cabinet to administer, as a protectorate, the occupied Polish territories that had not been annexed outright into the Third Reich. At the beginning of the war German officials contacted several Polish leaders with proposals for collaboration, but they all refused. Among those who rejected the German offers were Wincenty Witos, peasant party leader and former Prime Minister; Prince Janusz Radziwi≈Ç≈Ç; and Stanis≈Çaw Estreicher, prominent scholar from the Jagiellonian University. In 1940, during the German invasion of France, the French government suggested that Polish politicians in France negotiate an accommodation with Germany; and in Paris the prominent journalist Stanislaw Mackiewicz tried to get Polish President Wladyslaw Raczkiewicz to negotiate with the Germans, as the French defenses were collapsing and German victory seemed inevitable. Three days later the Polish Government and Polish National Council rejected discussing capitulation and declared they would fight on until full victory over Nazi Germany. A group of eight low-ranking Polish politicians and officers broke with the Polish Government and in Lisbon, Portugal, addressed a memorandum to Germany, asking for discussions about restoring a Polish state under German occupation, which was rejected by the Germans. According to Czeslaw Madajczyk, in view of the low profile of the Poles involved and of Berlin's rejection of the memorandum, no political collaboration can be said to have taken place.Czeslaw Madajczyk \\"Nie chciana kolaboracja. Polscy politycy i nazistowskie Niemcy w Lipcu 1940\\", Bernard Wiaderny, Paryz 2002, Dzieje Najnowsze 35/2 226-229 2003 The Nazi racial policies and Germany's plans for the conquered Polish territories, on one hand, and Polish anti-German attitudes on the other, combined to prevent any Polish-German political collaboration. The Nazis envisioned the eventual disappearance of the Polish nation, which was to be replaced by German settlers.\\"Just before the outbreak of the Second World War, Hitler spoke of the planned mass murder of Poles and asked, 'Who, after all, is today speaking about the destruction of the Armenians?'... Poland, Belarus, and Ukraine would be populated by [German] pioneer farmer-soldier families.\\" Alex Ross, \\"The Hitler Vortex: How American racism influenced Nazi thought\\", The New Yorker, 30 April 2018, pp. 71‚Äì72. In April 1940 Hitler banned any negotiations concerning any degree of autonomy for the Poles, and no further consideration was given to the idea. Shortly after the German occupation began, pro-German right-wing politician Andrzej ≈öwietlicki formed an organization - the National Revolutionary Camp - and approached the Germans with various offers of collaboration, which they ignored. ≈öwietlicki was arrested and executed in 1940. W≈Çadys≈Çaw Studnicki, another nationalist maverick politician and anti-communist publicist, and Leon Koz≈Çowski, a former Prime Minister, each favored Polish-German cooperation against the Soviet Union, but they too were rejected by the Germans. ==Security forces== German General Government poster requiring former Polish Police officers (Blue Police) to report for duty under the German Ordnungspolizei or face \\"severe\\" punishment The main security forces in German-occupied Poland were some 550,000 soldiers and 80,000 SS and police officials sent from Germany.Czes≈Çaw Madajczyk, Polityka III Rzeszy w okupowanej Polsce, Warsaw, Pa≈Ñstwowe Wydawnictwo Naukowe, 1970, vol. 1, p. 242. ===Blue Police=== In October 1939 the German authorities ordered mobilization of the prewar Polish police to serve under the German Ordnungspolizei, thus creating the auxiliary \\"Blue Police\\" that supplemented the principal German forces. The Polish policemen were to report for duty by 10 November 1939 or face death. At its peak in May 1944, the Blue Police numbered some 17,000 men. Their primary task was to act as a regular police force dealing with criminal activities, but the Germans also used them in combating smuggling and resistance, rounding up random civilians (≈Çapanka) for forced labor or for execution in reprisal for Polish resistance activities (e.g., the Polish underground's execution of Polish traitors or egregiously brutal Germans), patrolling for Jewish ghetto escapees, and in support of military operations against the Polish resistance. ===Polish Criminal Police (Polnische Kriminalpolizei)=== The Germans also created a Polnische Kriminalpolizei.. The Polish criminal police team was trained at the Security Police School and the Security Service of the Reichsf√ºhrer SS (SD) in Rabka- Zdr√≥j. It's estimated that there were between 1,790 and 2,800 ethnic Poles in the Polish Kripo units. The organization of the Polish Criminal Police was analogous to the organization of the German ‚ÄúKriminalpolizei\\" and consisted of various police stations. Station 1 dealt with robberies, assaults, murders and sabotage; station 2 - with small thefts; station 3 - with burglary and house thieves; station 4 - moral crimes; station 5 - with internal service, search of Jews in hiding and other wanted persons; station 6 - with registration of wanted persons, station 7 - with forensic technique, and photographic laboratory. ===Auxiliary police=== The German General Government tried to form additional Polish auxiliary police units‚ÄîSchutzmannschaft Battalion 202 in 1942, and Schutzmannschaft Battalion 107 in 1943. Very few men volunteered, and the Germans decided on forced conscription to fill their ranks. Most of the conscripts subsequently deserted, and the two units were disbanded. Schutzmannschaft Battalion 107 mutinied against its German officers, disarmed them, and joined the Home Army resistance.J√≥zef Turowski, Po≈ºoga: Walki 27 Wo≈Çy≈Ñskiej Dywizji AK, PWN, , pp. 154-155. Some Poles also passed on the side of the Soviet partisans - like Miko≈Çaj Kunicki, Kompanief√ºhrer in Schutzmannschaft 104. Poles also served in Byelorussian Auxiliary Police Cezary Chlebowski, Reporta≈º z tamtych dni Krajowa Agencja Wydawnicza, Warszawa 1988, ss. 248-249 or in Ypatingasis b≈´rys \\\\- due to the fact that part of Lithuania and Belarus was part of the Second Polish Republic. In 1944, in the General Government, Germany attempted to recruit 12,000 Polish volunteers to \\"join the fight against Bolshevism\\". The campaign failed; only 699 men were recruited, 209 of whom either deserted or were disqualified for health reasons. ==Poles in the Wehrmacht== POW) who had been forcibly conscripted into the German Army, speaks with Polish 1st Armoured Division soldiers in Normandy. Following the German invasion of Poland in 1939, many former citizens of the Second Polish Republic from across the Polish territories annexed by Nazi Germany were forcibly conscripted into the Wehrmacht in Upper Silesia and in Pomerania. They were declared citizens of the Third Reich by law and therefore subject to drumhead court-martial in case of draft evasion. Professor Ryszard Kaczmarek of the University of Silesia in Katowice, author of a monograph, Polacy w Wehrmachcie (Poles in the Wehrmacht), noted that the scale of this phenomenon was much larger than previously assumed, because 90% of the inhabitants of these two westernmost regions of prewar Poland were ordered to register on the German People's List (Volksliste), regardless of their wishes. The exact number of these conscripts is not known; no data exist beyond 1943. In June 1946, the British Secretary of State for War reported to Parliament that, of the pre-war Polish citizens who had involuntarily signed the Volksliste and subsequently served in the German Wehrmacht, 68,693 men were captured or surrendered to the Allies in northwest Europe. The overwhelming majority, 53,630 subsequently enlisted in the Polish Army in the West and fought against Germany to the end of World War II. ==Compulsory civilian service (Baudienst)== In May 1940, the Germans instituted a Baudienst (\\"construction service\\") in several districts of the General Government, as a form of compulsory national service that combined hard labor with Nazi indoctrination. Service was rewarded with pocket money, and in some places it was a prerequisite for occupational training. Starting in April 1942, evasion of Baudienst service was punishable by death. By 1944, Baudienst strength had grown to some 45,000 servicemen.Antoni MƒÖczak, Encyklopedia historii gospodarczej Polski do 1945 roku: O-≈ª (Encyclopedia of Poland's Economic History: O‚Äì≈ª), Warsaw, Wiedza Powszechna, 1981. Baudienst servicemen were sometimes deployed in support of aktions (roundup of Jews for deportation or extermination), for example to blockade Jewish quarters or to search Jewish homes for hideaways and valuables. After such operations the servicemen were rewarded with vodka and cigarettes. Disobedience while in \\"service\\" was punished with commitment to punitive camps. There were three Baudienst branches: * Polnischer Baudienst (Polish Labor Service) * Ukrainischer Heimatdienst (Ukrainian National Service) * Goralischer Heimatdienst (Goral National Service) ==Cultural collaborationFilm and theater=== In occupied Poland there was no Polish film industry. However, a few former Polish citizens collaborated with the Germans in making films such as the 1941 anti-Polish propaganda film Heimkehr (Homecoming). In that film, casting for minor parts played by Polish actors was done by Volksdeutscher actor and Gestapo agent Igo Sym, who during the filming, on 7 March 1941, was shot in his Warsaw apartment by the Polish Union of Armed Struggle resistance movement; after the war, the Polish performers were sentenced for collaboration in an anti-Polish propaganda undertaking, with punishments ranging from official reprimand to imprisonment. Some Polish actors were coerced by the Germans into performing, as in the case of Bogus≈Çaw Samborski, who played in Heimkehr probably in order to save his Jewish wife. During the occupation, feature-film showings were preceded by propaganda newsreels of Die Deutsche Wochenschau (The German Weekly Review). Some feature films likewise contained Nazi propaganda. The Polish underground discouraged Poles from attending movies, advising them, in the words of the rhymed couplet, \\"Tylko ≈õwinie siedzƒÖ w kinie\\" (\\"Only swine go to the movies\\"). Following the Polish underground's execution of Igo Sym, in reprisal the Germans took hostages and, on 11 March 1941, executed 21 at their Palmiry killing grounds. They also arrested several actors and theater directors and sent them to Auschwitz, including such notable figures as Stefan Jaracz and Leon Schiller. The largest theater for Polish audiences was Warsaw's Komedia (Comedy). There were also a dozen small theaters. Polish actors were forbidden by the underground to perform in these theaters, but some did and were punished after the war. Many other actors supported themselves by working as waiters. Adolf Dymsza performed in legal cabarets and wasn't allowed to perform at Warsaw during a short period after the war. A theater producer Zygmunt Ipohorski-Lenkiewicz was shot as a Gestapo agent. ===Press=== The legal press in German-occupied Poland was a German propaganda tool, which Poles called ' (\\"reptile press\\"). Many respected journalists refused to work for the Germans; and those writing for the German-controlled press were considered collaborators. Jan Emil Skiwski, a writer and journalist of extreme National Democrat and fascist orientation, collaborated with Germany, publishing pro-Nazi Polish newspapers in German-occupied Poland. Toward war's end, he escaped advancing Soviet armies, fled Europe, and spent the rest of his life under an assumed name in Venezuela. ==Collaboration and the resistance== Polish resistance poster announcing the execution of several Polish collaborators and blackmailers (szmalcowniks), September 1943 The main armed resistance organization in Poland was the Home Army (Armia Krajowa, or AK), numbering some 400,000 members, including Jewish fighters.Edward Kossoy Zydzi w Powstaniu WarszawskimPowstanie warszawskie w walce i dyplomacji - page 23 Janusz Kazimierz Zawodny, Andrzej Krzysztof Kunert - 2005 By≈Ç r√≥wnie≈º czterdziestoosobowy pluton ≈ºydowski, dowodzony przez Samuela Kenigsweina, kt√≥ry walczy≈Ç w batalionie AK ‚ÄûWigry\\" The Home Army command rejected any talks with the German authorities, but some Home Army units in eastern Poland did maintain contacts with the Germans in order to gain intelligence on German morale and preparedness and perhaps acquire needed weapons.Review by John Radzilowski of Yaffa Eliach's There Once Was a World: A 900-Year Chronicle of the Shtetl of Eishyshok, in Journal of Genocide Research, vol. 1, no. 2 (June 1999), City University of New York. The Germans made several attempts at arming regional Home Army units in order to encourage them to act against Soviet partisans operating in the Nowogr√≥dek and Vilnius areas. Local Home Army units accepted arms but used them for their own purposes, disregarding the Germans' intents and even turning the weapons against the Germans. Rimantas Zizas.

Tadeusz Piotrowski concludes that \\"[these deals] were purely tactical, short-term arrangements\\" and quotes Joseph Rothschild that \\"the Polish Home Army was by and large untainted by collaboration.\\" The Polish right-wing National Armed Forces (Narodowe Si≈Çy Zbrojne, or NSZ) ‚Äì a nationalist, anti-communist organization, widely perceived as anti-Semitic ‚Äì did not have a uniform policy regarding Jews. Its attitude to them drew on anti-semitism and anti-communism, perceiving Jewish partisans and refugees as \\"pro-Soviet elements\\" and members of an ethnicity foreign to the Polish nation. Except in rare cases, the NSZ did not admit Jews, and on several occasions killed or delivered Jewish partisans to the German authorities and murdered Jewish refugees. NSZ units also frequently skirmished with partisans of the Polish communist People's Army (Armia Ludowa). At least two NSZ units operated with the acquiescence or cooperation of the Germans at different times. In late 1944, in the face of advancing Soviet forces, the Holy Cross Mountains Brigade, numbering 800-1,500 fighters, decided to cooperate with the Germans. It ceased hostilities against them, accepted their logistical help, and coordinated its retreat to the Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia. Once there, the unit resumed hostilities against the Germans and on 5 May 1945 liberated the Hol√Ω≈°ov concentration camp. Another NSZ unit known to collaborate with the Germans was Hubert Jura's unit, also known as Tom's Organization, which operated in the Radom district. The Communist underground (PPR, GL) denounced Home Army operatives to the Nazis, resulting in 200 arrests. The Germans found a Communist printing shop as a result of one such denunciation by Marian Spychalski.Komunistyczny donos do gestapo ==The Holocaust== Part of the core exhibition dedicated to Jedwabne pogrom at the Museum of the History of Polish Jews in Warsaw. Historian Martin Winstone writes that only a minority of Poles took part either in persecuting or in helping Jews. He compares Poland with other occupied countries and asserts the largest part of society was indifferent. Regarding the purported low Polish resolve to save Jews, Winstone writes that this tendency may be partly explained by fear of execution by the Germans. He nevertheless notes that the Germans imposed death sentences for many other acts and quotes Micha≈Ç Berg: \\"[Poles] were threatened with death not only for sheltering Jews, but for many other things... [but] they kept right on doing them. Why was it that only helping Jews scared them?\\" Winstone comments, \\"it may well be that the risk of hiding a Jew was greater, but that is in itself suggestive since the Germans were not the only danger\\"; he goes on to explain that Poles who had helped Jews were afraid of repercussions even after liberation. Sociologist Jan Gross writes that a leading role in the 1941 Jedwabne pogrom was carried out by four Polish men, including Jerzy Lauda≈Ñski and Karol Bardo≈Ñ, who had earlier collaborated with the Soviet NKVD and were now trying to recast themselves as zealous collaborators with the Germans.Gross (2001), Neighbors, p. 75. Historian John Connelly wrote that the vast majority of ethnic Poles showed indifference to the fate of the Jews; and that \\"Polish historiography has hesitated to view [complicity in the Holocaust of Jews] as collaboration... [instead viewing it] as a form of society's 'demoralization'\\". Klaus-Peter Friedrich wrote that \\"most [Poles] adopted a policy of wait-and-see... In the eyes of the Jewish population, [this] almost inevitably had to appear as silent approval of the [German] occupier's actions.\\" According to historian Gunnar S. Paulsson, in occupied Warsaw (a city of 1.3 million, including 350,000 Jews before the war), some 3,000 to 4,000 Poles acted as blackmailers and informants (szmalcowniks) who turned in Jews and fellow-Poles who provided assistance to Jews. Grzegorz Berendt estimates the number of Polish citizens who participated in anti-Jewish actions as being a \\"group of dozens of thousands of individuals\\". In 2013, historian Jan Grabowski wrote in his book Hunt for the Jews that \\"one can assume that the number of victims of the Judenjagd could reach 200,000‚Äîand this in Poland alone.\\" The book was praised by some scholars for its approach and analysis,\\"Hunt for the Jews snags Yad Vashem book prize\\", Times of Israel (JTA), 8 December 2014.\\"Professor Jan Grabowski wins the 2014 Yad Vashem International Book Prize\\", Yad Vashem, 4 December 2014. while a number of other historians criticized his methodology for lacking in actual field research,Samsonowska, Krystyna (July 2011). \\"DƒÖbrowa Tarnowska - nieco inaczej. (DƒÖbrowa Tarnowska - not quite like that)\\". Wiƒô≈∫. 7: 75‚Äì85. and argued that his \\"200,000\\" estimate was too high.Musial, Bogdan (2011). \\"Judenjagd ‚Äì 'umiejƒôtne dzia≈Çanie' czy zbrodnicza perfidia?\\"\\".

The Lviv pogrom was carried out by the Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists (OUN), Ukrainian People's Militia and local Ukrainian mobs in the city of Lw√≥w (now Lviv, Ukraine), between June and July 1941, shorty after the German takeover of the city.Himka, John-Paul (2011). \\"The Lviv Pogrom of 1941: The Germans, Ukrainian Nationalists, and the Carnival Crowd\\". Canadian Slavonic Papers. 53 (2‚Äì4): 209‚Äì243. ISSN 0008-5006. Taylor & Francis. The pogrom was organized by the German SS Einsatzgruppe C and OUN leaders under a pretext that the local Jews were co-responsible for the earlier Soviet atrocities in the city.Ronald Headland (1992). Messages of Murder: A Study of the Reports of the Einsatzgruppen of the Security Police and the Security Service, 1941-1943. Fairleigh Dickinson Univ Press. pp. 111‚Äì112. . In total, around 6,000 Jews were killed by the Ukrainians, followed by an additional 3,000 executed in subsequent Einsatzgruppe killings. The pogrom culminated in the so-called \\"Petlura Days\\" massacre, when more than 2,000 Jews were killed.Longerich, Peter (2010). Holocaust: The Nazi Persecution and Murder of the Jews. Oxford; New York: Oxford University Press. p. 194. . ==Collaboration by ethnic minorities== Germans used the divide and rule method to create tensions within the Polish society, by targeting several non-Polish ethnic groups for preferential treatment or the opposite, in the case of the Jewish minority. ===German minority=== Meeting of German minority (Volksdeutsche) in occupied Warsaw, 1940 Volksdeutscher Selbstschutz leaders in Bydgoszcz, 1939 During the invasion of Poland in September 1939, members of the German ethnic minority in Poland, which had numbered some 750,000 persons before the war,Maria Wardzy≈Ñska, By≈Ç rok 1939: Operacja niemieckiej policji bezpiecze≈Ñstwa w Polsce Intelligenzaktion (It Was 1939: Intelligenzaktion [Operation Intelligentsia] of the German Security Police in Poland), Warsaw, Instytut Pamiƒôci Narodowej (Institute of National Remembrance), 2009, , p. 20. assisted Nazi Germany in its war effort. The number of Germans in prewar Poland who belonged to pro-Nazi German organizations is estimated at some 200,000, primarily members of Jungdeutsche Partei, Deutsche Vereinigung, Naziverein, and Deutsche Jugendschaft in Polen.Maria Wardzy≈Ñska, By≈Ç rok 1939 Operacja niemieckiej policji bezpiecze≈Ñstwa w Polsce.

Additionally, German-minority activists helped draw up a list of 80,000 Poles who were to be arrested after the invasion of Poland by German forces; most of those on the list lost their lives in the first few months of the war.Maria Wardzy≈Ñska, By≈Ç rok 1939 Operacja niemieckiej policji bezpiecze≈Ñstwa w Polsce.

Intelligenzaktion, IPN Instytut Pamiƒôci Narodowej, 2009 p. 49. Shortly after the German invasion of Poland, an armed ethnic- German militia, the Volksdeutscher Selbstschutz, was formed, numbering some 100,000 members.Michael Geyer, Sheila Fitzpatrick, Beyond Totalitarianism: Stalinism and Nazism Compared, Cambridge University Press, 2009, p. 155. It organized the Operation Tannenberg mass murder of Polish elites. At the beginning of 1940, the Selbstschutz was disbanded, and its members were transferred to various SS, Gestapo, and German-police units. The Volksdeutsche Mittelstelle organized large-scale looting of property, and redistributed goods to Volksdeutsche. They were given apartments, workshops, farms, furniture, and clothing confiscated from Jewish Poles and ethnic Poles.August Frank, \\"Memorandum, September 26, 1942: Utilization of property on the occasion of settlement and evacuation of Jews\\", in NO-724, Pros.

In Gda≈Ñsk Pomerania, by 22 November 1939, 30% of the German population (38,279 persons) had joined the Selbstschutz (almost all the German men in the region) and had executed some 30,000 Poles.\\"22 listopada 1939 r. do Selbstschutzu w Okrƒôgu Rzeszy Gda≈Ñsk-Prusy Zachodnie nale≈ºa≈Ço 38 279 os√≥b.

During the German occupation of Poland, Nazi authorities established a German People's List (Deutsche Volksliste\\", or \\"DVL), whereby former Polish citizens of German ethnicity were registered as Volksdeutsche. The German authorities encouraged registration of ethnic Germans, and in many cases made it mandatory. Those who joined were given benefits, including better food and better social status. However, Volksdeutsche were required to perform military service for the Third Reich, and hundreds of thousands joined the German military, either willingly or under compulsion.Historia: Encyklopedia Szkolna, Warsaw, Wydawnictwa Szkolne i Pedagogiczne, 1993, pp. 357‚Äì58. According to , in 1939 Poland's German minority numbered some 750,000 and constituted the principal citizen collaborators. ===Ukrainians and Belarusians=== Reichsfuhrer Heinrich Himmler inspecting Ukrainian volunteers of the SS-Galizien division, May 1943 Before the war, Poland had a substantial population of Ukrainian and Belarusian minorities living in her eastern, Kresy regions. After the Soviet invasion of eastern Poland on 17 September 1939, those territories were annexed by the USSR. Following the German invasion of the Soviet Union in June 1941, German authorities recruited Ukrainians and Belarusians who had been citizens of Poland before September 1939 for service in the Waffen-SS and auxiliary-police units, serving as guards in the German- run extermination camps set up by the Nazis in occupied-Poland, and to assist with anti-partisan operations. In District Galicia, the SS Galicia division and Ukrainian Auxiliary Police, made up of ethnic-Ukrainian volunteers, took part in widespread massacres and persecution of Poles and Jews.Czes≈Çaw Partacz, Krzysztof ≈Åada, Polska wobec ukrai≈Ñskich dƒÖ≈ºe≈Ñ niepodleg≈Ço≈õciowych w czasie II wojny ≈õwiatowej, (Toru≈Ñ: Centrum Edukacji Europejskiej, 2003)Timothy Snyder.

ISSN 1427-7476. ===Jewish collaborators=== Jewish Ghetto policemen guarding the gates of the Warsaw Ghetto, June 1942 A minority of Jews chose to collaborate with the Germans. Jews helped the Germans in return for limited freedom, safety and other compensation (food, money) for the collaborators and their relatives. Some were motivated purely by self-interest, such as individual survival, revenge, or greed; others were coerced into collaborating with the Germans. The Judenr√§te (s. Judenrat, literally \\"Jewish council\\") were Jewish-run governing bodies set up by the Nazi authorities in Jewish ghettos across German-occupied Poland. The Judenr√§te functioned as a self-enforcing intermediary and were used by the Germans to control the Jewish population and to manage the ghetto's day-to-day administration. The Germans also required Judenr√§te to confiscate property, organize forced labor, collect information on the Jewish population and facilitate deportations to extermination camps. In some cases, Judenrat members exploited their positions to engage in bribery and other abuses. In the ≈Å√≥d≈∫ Ghetto, the reign of Judenrat head Chaim Rumkowski was particularly inhumane, as he was known to get rid of his political opponents by submitting their names for deportation to concentration camps, hoard food rations, and sexually abuse Jewish girls.Rees, Laurence,Auschwitz: The Nazis and the \\"Final Solution\\", especially the testimony of Lucille Eichengreen, pp. 105-131. BBC Books. .Rees, Laurence.\\"Auschwitz: Inside the Nazi state\\". BBC/KCET, 2005. Retrieved: 01.10.2011. Tadeusz Piotrowski cited Jewish survivor Baruch Milch who wrote that \\"Judenrat became an instrument in the hand of the Gestapo for extermination of the Jews... I do not know of a single instance when the Judenrat would help some Jew in a disinterested manner.\\" through Piotrowski cautions that \\"Milch's is a particular account of a particular place and time... the behavior of Junderat members was not uniform.\\" Political theorist Hannah Arendt stated that without the assistance of the Judenr√§te, the German authorities would have encountered considerable difficulties in drawing up detailed lists of the Jewish population, thus allowing for at least some Jews to avoid deportation. The Jewish Ghetto Police (J√ºdischer Ordnungsdienst) were volunteers recruited from among Jews living in the ghettos who could be relied on to follow German orders. They were issued batons, official armbands, caps, and badges, and were responsible for public order in the ghetto. Also, the policemen were used by the Germans for securing the deportation of other Jews to concentration camps.\\"Judischer Ordnungsdienst\\". Museum of Tolerance. Simon Wiesenthal Center. Retrieved 14 January 2008.Collins, Jeanna R. \\"Am I a Murderer?: Testament of a Jewish Ghetto Policeman (review)\\". Mandel Fellowship Book Reviews. Kellogg Community College. Retrieved 13 January 2008. The numbers of Jewish police varied greatly depending on the location, with the Warsaw Ghetto numbering about 2,500, ≈Å√≥d≈∫ Ghetto 1,200 and smaller ghettos such as that at Lw√≥w about 500. Historian and Warsaw Ghetto archivist Emanuel Ringelblum described the cruelty of the Jewish Ghetto Police as \\"at times greater than that of the Germans\\", concluding that this formation's members distinguished themselves by their shocking corruption and immorality. Group 13, a Jewish collaborationist organization in the Warsaw Ghetto, which reported directly to the German Gestapo, 1941 In Warsaw, the collaborationist groups ≈ªagiew and Group 13, led by Abraham Gancwajch and colloquially known as the \\"Jewish Gestapo\\", inflicted considerable damage on both Jewish and Polish underground resistance movements. Over a thousand such Jewish Nazi collaborators, some armed with firearms, served under the German Gestapo as informers on Polish resistance efforts to hide Jews, and engaged in racketeering, blackmail, and extortion in the Warsaw Ghetto.Israel Gutman, The Jews of Warsaw, 1939‚Äì1943: Ghetto, Underground, Revolt, Indiana University Press, 1982, , pp. 90‚Äì94.Itamar Levin, Walls Around: The Plunder of Warsaw Jewry during World War II and Its Aftermath, Greenwood Publishing Group, 2004, , pp. 94‚Äì98. A 70-strong group led by a Jewish collaborator called Hening was tasked with operating against the Polish resistance, and was quartered at the Gestapo's Warsaw headquarters on ulica Szucha (Szuch Street). Similar groups and individuals operated in towns and cities across German-occupied Poland ‚Äî including J√≥zef Diamand in Krak√≥w and Szama Grajer in Lublin. It is estimated that at the end of 1941 and the start of 1942 there were some 15,000 \\"Jewish Gestapo\\" agents in the General Government. Jewish agent-provocateurs were used by the Germans to bait Jews hiding outside of the ghettos, turn them over to the Germans, and occasionally entrap Poles who were helping the Jews. Perhaps the largest of such actions involved agents from the ≈ªagiew network, who falsely promised Jews hiding in Warsaw following its ghetto's liquidation and who held or were hoping to obtain foreign passports a safe place at Hotel Polski; Around 2,500 Jews came out of their hiding places and moved to the hotel, where they have been captured by the Germans. In another, smaller incident in the village of Paulin√≥w, the Germans used a Jewish agent to pose as an escapee looking for a hiding place with a Polish family, after receiving help the agent denounced the Polish family to the Germans, resulting in the deaths of 12 Poles and several Jews who were hiding with the family.Teresa Prekerowa, Institute of History of the Polish Academy of Sciences, \\"Who Helped Jews during the Holocaust in Poland\\", Acta Poloniae Historica, Wydawnictwo Naukowe Semper, vol. 76, p. 166. \\"The gravest provocation involving Jews took place in 1943, some 100 km east of Warsaw; a Jewish Gestapo agent posing as a fugitive was given, or promised, help by 14 inhabitants of the village of Paulin√≥w.\\" Zak≈Çad Narodowy im.

The agent-provocateur from Warsaw joined some Jews who were in hiding, giving himself out to be a French Jew who had escaped from a transport of deportees who were being sent to Treblinka.\\") Smaller scale provocations were more common, with Jewish agents approaching Polish resistance members asking for fake documents, followed by Gestapo arresting said resistance members. Some members of Jewish Social Self-Help (J√ºdische Soziale Selbsthilfe), also known as the Jewish Social Assistance Society, collaborated with Nazi authorities in the deportation of Warsaw Jews to death camps. The group was formed as a humanitarian organization funded by the American Jewish Joint Distribution Committee, which also supplied it with legal cover,Alexandra Garbarini, Jewish Responses to Persecution: 1938‚Äì1940, p. 198. and was allowed to operate within the General Government. Concerned with its lack of effectiveness, and seeing it as a cover for Nazi atrocities, both Jewish and Polish underground movements actively resisted the organization. ===Gorals and Kashubians=== Wac≈Çaw Krzeptowski, prominent Goralenvolk collaborator, visiting German governor Hans Frank during a celebration held in honor of Hitler's birthday The Germans singled out as potential collaborators two ethnographic groups that had some separatist interests: the Kashubians in the north, and the Gorals in the south. They reached out to the Kashubians, but that plan proved a \\"complete failure\\". The Germans had some limited success with the Gorals ‚Äì establishing the Goralenvolk movement, which Katarzyna Szurmiak calls \\"the most extensive case of collaboration in Poland during the Second World War.\\" Overall, however, \\"when talking about numbers, the attempt to create [a] Goralenvolk was a failure... a mere 18 percent of the population took up Goralian IDs... Goralian schools [were] consistently boycotted, and... attempts to create a Goralian police or a Goralian Waffen-SS Legion... failed miserably.\\" == Notable collaborators  The Tom Organization === Tom's Organization was a group of spies formed in 1943 by collaborator Hubert Jura, known by the nickname of \\"Tom\\" as well as the alias Herbert Jung, who was of mixed German and Polish ancestry. The group is theorized to have been formed by Jura and his friends after they were expelled from the Home Army due to criminal activity, using German support as a way to take revenge. They managed to insert themselves into the National Armed Forces, with Jura commanding a group of soldiers. In 1944, after the fall of the Warsaw Uprising, members of the Tom Organization came to Czƒôstochowa. \\"Tom\\" received a villa from the Germans at Jasnog√≥rska Street, which became the headquarter of the group for a few months. Later in 1944, a group of soldiers of the National Armed Forces commanded by Jura attacked the village of Petrykozy. According to the report from March 9, two Jews hiding there were murdered. After the war, most of the organization's members fled and Jura as well as his former associate, Gestapo member Paul Fuchs operated for the US intelligence network created to work in the newly established countries controlled by the Soviet Union. Later, Jura moved to Venezuela, and in 1993 to Argentina. ===Kalkstein and Kaczorowska=== In 1942, Ludwik Kalkstein started to collaborate together with Blanka Kaczorowska for the Gestapo. Kalkstein and Kaczorowska were responsible for the subsequent capture and execution of several high ranking Polish underground Home Army officers, including General Stefan Rowecki. In 1944, Ludwik Kalkstein served in SS (during the Warsaw Uprising). His wife was protected by the Gestapo until the end of the war. ==See also== * Polish resistance movement in World War II * Collaboration with the Axis Powers during World War II * Szmalcownik * Trawniki * Sonderkommando * Sonderdienst * Judenjagd ==References== Category:Collaboration during World War II Category:German occupation of Poland during World War II Category:Poland in World War II Category:Collaboration with the Axis Powers ","title":"Collaboration in German-occupied Poland"},{"id":"56835443","text":"The English Turn Golf and Country Club is a private golf course and country club in the southern United States, located in New Orleans, Louisiana.

He took leading roles in operas by Mozart and Weber, and in revivals of Beethoven's opera Fidelio. He appeared for many years at the Theater am K√§rntnertor, the royal court theatre of Vienna. ==Early life and career== Forti was born in Vienna in 1790, and had lessons in singing and the violin. His musical career began as a viola player in the orchestra of the Theater an der Wien. After his debut as a singer in Eisenstadt, he was appointed in December 1807 by Prince Esterh√°zy as a member of his court musicians.Forti, Franz Anton Carl-Maria-von-Weber-Gesamtausgabe. Retrieved 27 February 2018. From 1811 he appeared at the Theater an der Wien. In that year he was in Mozart's Don Giovanni in the title role; it was, wrote Carl Ferdinand Pohl, \\"a part for which his very sonorous voice, commanding presence, and elevated refined style of acting eminently fitted him.\\" In 1813 he appeared as Sarastro in Mozart's The Magic Flute. His success in this role led to his engagement at the royal court theatre of Vienna, the Theater am K√§rntnertor; he was there from May 1814 to April 1828.Paul Nettl. \\"Forti, Anton\\". Beethoven Encyclopedia. Philosophical Library, New York. 1956. On 17 February 1814 he married Henriette Theimer, who had played Zerlina in Don Giovanni. ==Theater am K√§rntnertor, and later years== He appeared as Pizarro in the revivals of Beethoven's opera Fidelio in 1818, 1822 and 1824. In 1821 he was in the first production in Vienna of Weber's Der Freisch√ºtz, as Caspar, and he created the role of Lysiart in Weber's Euryanthe (1823). Anton Forti in 1844 In 1829 Wenzel Robert von Gallenberg became lessee of the Theater am K√§rntnertor, and Forti was pensioned. He made successful appearances in Prague, Hamburg and Berlin; after his guest appearance in Berlin in June 1829 he was engaged there at the K√∂nigsst√§dtisches Theater until the end of 1830. From 1831 to 1842 he occasionally appeared again at the royal court theatre in Vienna. \\"His voice had lost its charm, and his increasing corpulence spoiled his acting,\\" wrote Carl Ferdinand Pohl. He retired after winning first prize in a public lottery. In later years he withdrew from public life, suffering from an eye ailment.

It also came almost a year after at least 25 CRPF personnel were killed in one of the deadliest attacks by Maoist rebels. ==Incident== On 13 March 2018, an IED blast occurred when a contingent of CRPF's 212th battalion was patrolling in a mine-protected vehicle in the forest of Kistaram area in Sukma district, Chhattisgarh. At least nine Central Reserve Police Force personnel were killed and six others were injured in the attack. The blast ripped the vehicle apart and some dead bodies were found 20 to 30 feet away from the blast site. The injured were airlifted for treatment in Raipur. According to Special Director General CRPF D. M. Awasthi, \\"There were about 11 men in the vehicle. A patrolling party was going from Kistaram to Palodi in an anti- landmine vehicle which was targeted by Naxals with an IED\\". He said that, \\"they were only 1km from the nearest camp in Palodi\\". According to him, \\"there is an exchange of fire almost on a daily basis. The security forces have been running an aggressive campaign against Naxalites\\". The security forces are trying to figure out if the attack was carried out by a single group of Naxals or multiple. ==Arrests== Seven individuals, identified by authorities as Komram Sade, Madkam Joga, Madkam Hindwa, Mandvi Sukka, Madkam Ganga, Vanjam Aayta and Vanjam Singha, have been arrested and are being investigated on suspicion of involvement with the attack. Athhorities assert that all seven members of the \\"Jan Militia\\". All are residents of Kistram in Sukma. ==Reaction== Indian President Ram Nath Kovind in a tweet expressed anguish at the attack and saluted the CRPF personnel who lost their lives. He also offered condolences to the bereaved families and stated that, \\"we remain firm in our resolve to take on and defeat all forms of terrorism\\". Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi in a tweet saluted the CRPF personnel who were killed in the attack and said that, \\"the nation stands shoulder to shoulder\\" with the families and friends of those killed \\"in this hour of grief\\". Indian Home Minister Rajnath Singh expressed distress in a tweet. He also expressed condolences to the families of those who lost their lives in Sukma blast and prayed for the speedy recovery of the injured. He further stated that, \\"I spoke to DG CRPF regarding the Sukma incident and asked him to leave for Chhattisgarh\\". Chief Minister of Chhattisgarh Raman Singh condemned the \\"cowardly attack\\". Congress President Rahul Gandhi tweeted that the attack mirrors a \\"deteriorating internal security situation due to flawed policies\\". He called the attack \\"tragic\\" and expressed condolences to the families of those killed and wished speedy recovery to those injured. == References == Category:Conflicts in 2018 Category:Communist Party of India (Maoist) Category:History of Chhattisgarh (1947‚Äìpresent) Category:Naxalite‚ÄìMaoist insurgency Category:Sukma district Category:Terrorist incidents in India in 2018 Category:March 2018 events in India Category:Political violence in India ","title":"2018 Sukma attack"},{"id":"56835649","text":"Audace was the name of at least three ships of the Italian Navy and may refer to: * , an launched in 1913 and sunk in 1916 following a collision. * , a destroyer ordered for Japan from Yarrow as Kawakaze transferred to Italy while building renamed Intrepido then Audace.

It has two folded leaves and up to nine light yellow flowers with reddish- brown markings. It is a poorly known species that has only been recorded in the Blue Mountains. ==Description== Diuris brevissima is a tuberous, perennial herb with two linear leaves about long, wide and folded lengthwise. Between two and nine light yellow flowers with reddish-brown markings, about wide are borne on a flowering stem up to tall. The dorsal sepal is erect, broadly egg- shaped, long and wide. The lateral sepals are linear, about long, wide, turned downwards and parallel to each other. The petals have a broad egg-shaped to almost circular blade on a dark coloured stalk. The labellum is long and has three lobes. The centre lobe is egg-shaped with the narrower end towards the base, long and the side lobes are oblong to wedge-shaped, long and wide. There are two ridge-like calli about in the mid-line of the labellum. Flowering occurs in October. ==Taxonomy and naming== In 1939, William Henry Nicholls published a description of Diuris brevissima in The Victorian Naturalist, relying on printed but unpublished colour drawings of Robert D. FitzGerald of a specimen collected at Lawson. However Nicholls did not include a Latin description and therefore did not comply with the rules of nomenclature. In 1942 Nicholls formally described the species in a later edition of The Victorian Naturalist. The specific epithet (brevissima) is a Latin word meaning \\"shortest\\". ==Distribution and habitat== Diuris brevissima is a poorly known species from the Blue Mountains where it grows in forest. Although in his 1939 publication, Nicholls refers to collections of this orchid from Ararat in Victoria, D. brevissima does not occur in that state. ==References== brevissima Category:Orchids of New South Wales Category:Flora of New South Wales Category:Plants described in 1942 ","title":"Diuris brevissima"},{"id":"56835653","text":"R116 may refer to: * R116 road (Ireland) * 2017 Irish Coast Guard Rescue 116 crash, a helicopter that crashed ","title":"R116"},{"id":"56835701","text":"Hatakeswara is a form of the Lord Shiva worshipped by the cult of Lingayat or Veera Pashupatha. There is a temple dedicated to Hatakeswara in Srisailam and many more across the Deccan region of India == Other Legends == According to the Skanda Purana the Suryavanshi King Dashratha, who was the ruler of Ayodhya had performed a long penance to Lord Vishnu for obtaining heirs. He began his penance by visiting many pilgrim spots in the region of Kartikeyapura starting with Hatakeswara. The site was selected by him because his father Aja had also performed penance at the same spot earlier to appease the goddess and obtained certain Siddhis. After finishing his pilgrimage Dashratha created a massive temple for Lord Vishnu at Hatakeswara and installed an idol of the Lord in it. In the hundred and second chapter of the text, there is also a mention of Lord Rama visiting Vibhishana to bid him goodbye before leaving the earth after Lakshmana had already attained Samadhi. On his way back, the Pushpaka Vimana refused to move ahead till Lord Rama got out of it and visited the shrine consecrated by his father. After taking bath in the pond in front of the temple, Rama installed a Shiva Linga in memory of his brother Lakshmana and also another one in memory of his wife Sita. Thereafter, he spent a few days at the pilgrim spot of his ancestors and then headed back to Ayodhya. ==References== Category:Hindu denominations Category:Hindu gods Category:Hindu philosophy Category:Names of God in Hinduism Category:Shaivism Category:Veerashaiva ","title":"Hatakeswara"},{"id":"56835749","text":"The International Centre for Sports Studies, known mostly by the initials CIES from the French Centre International d'Etude du Sport, is an independent, research and education organization, located in Neuch√¢tel, Switzerland, It had a research group CIES Football Observatory, focusing on statistical studies of football-related issues. ==Origin== CIES was created in 1995 as a joint venture between FIFA, the University of Neuch√¢tel, and the City and State of Neuch√¢tel. ==Research== CIES Football Observatory conducts research mostly on players' transfer values\\"Mohamed Salah: Liverpool forward's transfer value rises most in Europe\\", BBC Sport, 12 March 2018\\"Why is Cristiano Ronaldo only 49th most valuable?\\", ESPN, 10 January 2018 and team profiles. ==FIFA Master== CIES organizes and offers a one-year postgraduate sports executive program, endorsed by FIFA,SportBusiness International 2015 Postgraduate Sports Course Rankings which consists of three modules that are taught across three universities in Europe, and concludes with a final project. The successful conclusion of the program merits the award of FIFA Master International in Management, Law and Humanities of Sport.\\"CIES\\", Master Studies website, 2018 It was created in 2000 to promote a managerial culture within the sports industry, with the aim to develop the skills of aspiring managers so that they can take on the complex challenges of this industry. With around 20 nationalities represented in class each year, the FIFA Master provides an international and dynamic learning environment, and focuses on three major and interconnected subject fields: management (SDA Bocconi), law (Neuch√¢tel) and human sciences (De Montfort). The strengths of the FIFA Master in the key areas of graduate employability, alumni networks, quality of teaching and international appeal has seen the programme named as the top postgraduate sports management course in the world by SportBusiness International in their 2014 rankings. Established in 2000, the FIFA Master scooped the top global award at this year's ceremony, having previously been named as the leading course in Europe by the same rankings from 2012 to 2015. More than 500 international sport management courses and alumni submitted data to the 2014 rankings process. The Master offers students the chance to meet with top international managers from the world of sport (e.g. clubs, federations, associations, etc.) and to be part of a network of highly relevant contacts. Graduates from the course become members of the FMA (the FIFA Master Alumni Association), which guarantees they will remain in touch with important stakeholders in sport. ===De Montfort University=== Humanities of Sport ‚Äì The first term is taught at the International Centre for Sport History and Culture (ICSHC) at the De Montfort University, Leicester. The ICSHC was established in 1996 and is today widely acknowledged as the leading centre for the study of sports history in the world. The Humanities of Sport modules addresses the birth of modern sport, professionalisation and internationalisation of sport and sport ethics. ===SDA Bocconi=== Sport Management ‚Äì The second term is taught at the SDA Bocconi School of Management, Milan, one of Europe's most prestigious business schools. This term addresses the area of Sports Management and covers topics such as finance, marketing, organization and governance, strategy, business planning, and event management, applied to the context of sport. ===Universit√© de Neuch√¢tel=== Sport Law ‚Äì The third and final term is taught at the Universit√© de Neuch√¢tel, Neuch√¢tel, whose Law Faculty is one of the top law faculties in Switzerland. This term addresses the area of Sports Law and covers topics such as the legal aspects of the private sector of sport, the legal status of the sports person, legal aspects of sport and health, sport business and law, and methods of dispute resolution. ===Final project=== The Final Project of the FIFA Master in Management, Law, & Humanities of Sport is seen as an opportunity for postgraduates to conduct original research, demonstrate creativity and independent thinking, as well as to develop and defend their ideas. Working in small research teams, postgraduates develop an inter-disciplinary research project with reference to the course themes of Management, Law and the Humanities of Sport. The final work, which is expected to have an applicable nature to issues faced in world sport, is presented to a specially invited audience of industry and academic experts during a special conference event in Neuch√¢tel. Previous Final Projects have been implemented directly by sports organizations or by course Alumni in the sports industry. CIES' postgraduates are examined throughout the FIFA Master in Management, Law, & Humanities of Sport by a variety of assessment methods. These include group assessments, written examinations, oral examinations and research papers. The assessment timetable is devised by each of the three partner universities. ===Course patrons=== Every year, the FIFA Master class is supported by a globally recognised patron who has made a profound contribution to sport. ::2000/2001 (1st Edition) ‚Äì Abedi Pele ::2001/2002 (2nd Edition) ‚Äì Anita DeFrantz ::2002/2003 (3rd Edition) ‚Äì Michel Platini ::2003/2004 (4th Edition) ‚Äì Sergey Bubka ::2004/2005 (5th Edition) ‚Äì Alexander Popov ::2005/2006 (6th Edition) ‚Äì Sir Bobby Charlton ::2006/2007 (7th Edition) ‚Äì Lord Sebastian Coe ::2007/2008 (8th Edition) ‚Äì Sepp Blatter ::2008/2009 (9th Edition) ‚Äì Nawal El Moutawakel ::2009/2010 (10th Edition) ‚Äì George Weah ::2010/2011 (11th Edition) ‚Äì J√©r√¥me Valcke ::2011/2012 (12th Edition) ‚Äì Jonathan Edwards ::2012/2013 (13th Edition) ‚Äì Steffi Jones ::2013/2014 (14th Edition) ‚Äì Christian Karembeu ::2014/2015 (15th Edition) ‚Äì Jean-Christophe Rolland ::2015/2016 (16th Edition) ‚Äì Fatma Samoura ::2016/2017 (17th Edition) ‚Äì Zvonimir Boban ::2017/2018 (18th Edition) ‚Äì Francois Pienaar ===FIFA Master alumni=== *Taufique Ahmed ‚Äì (Saudi Professional League, Project Manager ‚Äì International Relations) *Musa Amadu ‚Äì (Nigeria Football Federation, General Secretary) *Caroline Anderson ‚Äì (TSE Consulting, Director & Partner) *Anja Berninger ‚Äì (NADA, acting CEO) *Jair Bertoni ‚Äì (EPFL, Head of Cabinet) *Dariel Collazo ‚Äì (Puerto Rican Football Federation, acting General Secretary) *Alberto Colombo ‚Äì (EPFL, Head of Marketing & Communications) *Marcelo Cordeiro ‚Äì (IMG, Director Licensing) *Robert Cormack ‚Äì (Under Armour, Football Merchandising Manager) *Miguel Angel Couchonnal ‚Äì (Atlante F√∫tbol Club, Executive Director) *Lauren Decker ‚Äì (Octagon WorldWide, Senior Marketing Director) *Ratu Tisha Destria ‚Äì (Football Association of Indonesia, General Secretary) *Pierre Ducrey ‚Äì (IOC, Deputy Director of Olympic Games Coordination) *Diederik Dewaele ‚Äì (ECA, Head of Administration) *Hicham El Amrani ‚Äì (CAF, General Secretary) *Rob Esteva ‚Äì (The Stats Zone, Founder & Director) *Michael Gandler ‚Äì (Inter Milan, Chief Revenue Officer) *Ameline Gerbel ‚Äì (AIBA, Sport Director) *Michael Gerlinger ‚Äì (FC Bayern M√ºnchen, Legal Director) *Tim Goethals ‚Äì (ASOIF, Head of Projects) *Andres Ivan Gonzalez ‚Äì (MasterCard, Head of Sponsorships, Asia/Pacific, MEA) *Javier Gonz√°lez Tupper ‚Äì (former Venezuelan international) *Sebastian Hassett ‚Äì (Football Victoria, Head of Government Relations, Communications & Facilities) *Nir Inbar ‚Äì (Hapoel Tel Aviv FC, Director) *Court Jeske ‚Äì (MLS, Senior Director, International Business) *Jules C√©sar Kalisa ‚Äì (Rwandese Association Football Federation, General Secretary) *Angenie Kanhai ‚Äì (Caribbean Football Union, General Secretary) *James Kitching ‚Äì (FIFA, Director of Football Regulatory) *Arnaud Le Mintier ‚Äì (FIFA, Head of Broadcaster Servicing) *Tsuneyasu Miyamoto ‚Äì (former Japanese international) *Ibrahim Y.

It has several applications on cryptography, as key exchange protocols, identity- based encryption, and broadcast encryption. There exist constructions of cryptographic 2-multilinear maps, known as bilinear maps, however, the problem of constructing such multilinear maps for n > 2 seems much more difficult and the security of the proposed candidates is still unclear. == Definition  For n = 2 === In this case, multilinear maps are mostly known as bilinear maps or parings, and they are usually defined as follows: Let G_1, G_2 be two additive cyclic groups of prime order q, and G_T another cyclic group of order q written multiplicatively. A pairing is a map: e: G_1 \\\\times G_2 \\\\rightarrow G_T , which satisfies the following properties: ; Bilinearity: \\\\forall a,b \\\\in F_q^*,\\\\ \\\\forall P\\\\in G_1, Q\\\\in G_2:\\\\ e(a P, b Q) = e(P,Q)^{ab} ; Non- degeneracy: If g_1 and g_2 are generators of G_1 and G_2, respectively, then e(g_1, g_2) is a generator of G_T. ; Computability: There exists an efficient algorithm to compute e. In addition, for security purposes, the discrete logarithm problem is required to be hard in both G_1 and G_2. === General case (for any n) === We say that a map e:G_1\\\\times \\\\cdots \\\\times G_n \\\\rightarrow G_T is a n-multilinear map if it satisfies the following properties: # All G_i (for 1 \\\\le i \\\\le n) and G_T are groups of same order; # if a_1, \\\\ldots, a_n \\\\in \\\\mathbb{Z} and (g_1, \\\\ldots, g_n) \\\\in G_1 \\\\times \\\\cdots \\\\times G_n, then e(g_1^{a_1},\\\\ldots,g_n^{a_n})=e(g_1,\\\\ldots,g_n)^{\\\\prod_{i=1}^n a_i}; # the map is non-degenerate in the sense that if g_1, \\\\ldots, g_n are generators of G_1, \\\\ldots, G_n, respectively, then e(g_1, \\\\ldots, g_n) is a generator of G_T # There exists an efficient algorithm to compute e. In addition, for security purposes, the discrete logarithm problem is required to be hard in G_1, \\\\ldots, G_n. === Candidates === All the candidates multilinear maps are actually slightly generalizations of multilinear maps known as graded-encoding systems, since they allow the map e to be applied partially: instead of being applied in all the n values at once, which would produce a value in the target set G_T, it is possible to apply e to some values, which generates values in intermediate target sets. For example, for n = 3, it is possible to do y = e(g_2, g_3) \\\\in G_{T_2} then e(g_1, y) \\\\in G_T. The three main candidates are GGH13, which is based on ideals of polynomial rings; CLT13, which is based approximate GCD problem and works over integers, hence, it is supposed to be easier to understand than GGH13 multilinear map; and GGH15, which is based on graphs. ==References== Category:Cryptography Category:Multilinear algebra ","title":"Cryptographic multilinear map"},{"id":"56835849","text":"The 2018 NAIA Division I Men's Basketball Tournament was held in March at Municipal Auditorium in Kansas City, Missouri.

He is the Susan Linn Sage Professor in the Department of Psychology at Cornell University. He is known most recently for his research studying how the movies in American cinema have evolved over the years in their structure, their physical attributes, and their narratives. Cutting is also known for his research on the mere exposure effect, on navigation and wayfinding, and biological motion. Over the last four decades Cutting's research has revolved around various aspects of perception. He has conducted research on the perception of cinema, perception of depth and layout, and art and perception. His research interests also include high and popular culture. He has published over 100 scientific papers and three books. From 2003 to 2007, he served as the editor of the journal Psychological Science. == Education and early career == Cutting graduated with a BA in Psychology from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill in 1969 and a PhD in Psychology from Yale University in 1973. After completing his PhD, he taught at Yale and a year later, he went to Wesleyan University. In 1980, Cutting joined the Cornell faculty as an associate professor in the Psychology department. In 1977-78, he was a visiting scholar at Stanford University and in 1983-84 a visiting scientist at the Atari Sunnyvale Research Laboratory. == Later career == While still teaching at Cornell, Cutting was a visiting scholar at University of Arizona, the University of Padova, the CNRS in Paris and the University of Trieste. He was the editor of Journal of Experimental Psychology: Human Perception and Performance from 1987 to 1993 and served in the position until 1993. In 1993, he was awarded a John Simon Guggenheim fellowship. He used the grant to study the perception of depth and subsequently wrote, Perceiving Layout and Knowing Distances: The Interaction, Relative Potency, and Contextual Use of Different Information About Depth, a chapter in the 1995 book Perception of Space and Motion. Cutting was named the Susan Linn Sage Professor of Psychology in 2013, and he served as the chair of the Department of Psychology at Cornell from 2011 to 2016. Cutting is a charter fellow of the Association for Psychological Science, a fellow of the American Psychological Association, a fellow of the Society for Cognitive Studies of the Moving Image, and a fellow of Society of Experimental Psychologists, where he was also the chair from 2003 to 2004. == Research and writing  Auditory and visual perception === At the beginning of his career, Cutting's research interests revolved around speech perception. In 1975, he co-edited the book The Role of Speech in Language. In late 1970s, he developed a research interest in biological motion, on which he wrote multiple articles through the early 1980s. At this time, his research interest began to other aspects of visual perception including perception of shapes, objects, depth, and motion. He published several papers on these subjects and in 1986 wrote the book, Perception with an Eye for Motion. Throughout the 1990s and early 2000s, visual perception remained the subject of most of his research. === Impressionism and Mere Exposure effect === In the 1990s, Cutting began spending time at the Fine Arts Library at Cornell, where he studied books about French Impressionist paintings. He collected images, counted them, catalogued them, and later used them for an experiment on mere exposure effect, the theory that the more times one is exposed to something, the more one prefers it over something similar but less familiar. To study this effect, Cutting inserted the pictures of French impressionist paintings into his power point slides over the course of many class lectures. At the end of the semester, he tested the students and found that they preferred the more frequently published pictures over the more obscure ones. The next year in the same class, he showed the better-known paintings only once, and more obscure ones four times each. At the end of the year, the students were again tested and preferred the more obscure and more common ones equally.For James Cutting, It's Science Meets Cinema in the Psychology of Perception. The Cornell Daily Sun. October 14, 2009. pg. 13. This pair of studies led Cutting to study the effect in more detail. He concluded in a 2003 paper \\"that artistic canons are promoted and maintained, in part, by a diffuse but continual broadcast of their images to the public by museums, authors, and publishers. The repeated presentation of images to an audience without its necessarily focused awareness or remembrance makes mere exposure a prime vehicle for canon formation.\\" He published several other papers on the subject of why people prefer a certain piece of art over the other. In 2006, Cutting his book Impressionism and Its Canon was published, exploring the connections between high and popular culture. === Evolution of Hollywood films === After finishing his editorship of Psychological Science in 2006, Cutting continued his interest in popular culture and focused on how Hollywood movies have evolved over the years, studying their structure, physical attributes, and narratives. Cutting and his graduate students used scientific tools and techniques to study 100 years of film, 1915 to 2015, shot by shot. As part of the research, they studied over 300 popular, English-language movies across many different genres. Through their research, Cutting and his colleagues showed that, compared to older movies, contemporary movies have more motion, shorter shot durations, shorter scenes, fewer dissolves, more closeups, fewer characters per frame, less clutter, more parallel action, and higher contrast, all of which help to hold the viewers‚Äô attention, which generally follows a pattern of pink noise. Throughout last decade the perception of movies has remained Cutting's main research interest. A study published in 2018 by Cutting and his students, showed that filmmakers have adapted the patterns of shot durations, motion, sound amplitude, and scene durations to match better the fluctuation in people's natural patterns of attention. In another study in the domain, Cutting studied how clutter in a shot affected the ability of the viewer to recognise the emotion of the actor. == Selected bibliography  Papers === *Categories and Boundaries in Speech and Music.

Cutting"},{"id":"56835970","text":"Tarakany! (previously Chetyre Tarakana \\"The 4 Cockroaches\\") is a Russian (Soviet) punk rock band based in Moscow. Formed in 1991, the band has released 14 studio albums, 5 live albums, as well as a lot of splits and compilations. Tarakany! has repeatedly toured Russia and other CIS countries, Europe, Japan, Israel, Georgia, and Kazakhstan. Tarakany! is one of the few Russian rock bands to create original music in both Russian and English. == History Early Years (as Chetyre Tarakana, 1991‚Äì1997) === The band was formed in Moscow in 1991, six months before the fall of communism and dissolution of the Soviet Union. The band's original line-up was: * Yuri Lenin ‚Äî vocals, guitars * Dmitry Vorobyov ‚Äî guitars * Dmitry Spirin ‚Äî bass * Denis Rubanov ‚Äî drums, percussion All founders were 15‚Äì16 years old, and three of them were classmates. In 1991, the band released their first demo, Crazy Boys (which was only distributed through underground channels and has still never been officially released), hence becoming a part of the Moscow Rock Laboratory. Together with such punk acts as PoGo, Va-Bank, Na√Øve, Distemper and others, the band helped formed the Moscow underground scene during those years. Despite the absence of any method of underground music marketing or distribution like those found in Western Europe and the United States (independent labels, distro, zines, clubs), these bands laid the foundation for a future developed punk scene with all its typical attributes. In 1992, they released their debut album, Duty Free Songs, featuring tracks in both English and Russian performed by their new vocalist, Denis Petukhov. At that time, the band's style and sound was influenced by the Sex Pistols, Ramones, and The Clash. Their lyrics were mainly about street punk romance, alcohol, drugs, sex, and hanging out. The album was released by the band members independently, and distributed exclusively on cassettes. > ...the sound is thich‚Äîat times even somewhat metallic (\\"Time Has Passed\\"), > and sometimes mainstream (\\"Home Sweet Home\\"); the piano sounds are very > pleasing. 5 of 11 tracks are in English... Some stuff sounds monotone > (\\"Chetyre Tarakana\\"), while others are melodic (\\"Krysa\\"). FUZZ No. 6 (45), > June 1997 In 1993, the band suspended their activities for 1.5 years due to Dmitry ‚ÄòSid' Spirin's imprisonment for drug possession. Two years later, they recorded the new album, Best Before, entirely in English. Dmitry Spirin replaced Denis Petukhov as Tarakany!'s singer. The album's sound and songwriting were influenced by bands like Ramones, Buzzcocks, and Generation X. The lyrics were devoted to personal values, opposition to the majority, and being lonely and far away from home. The album's track, \\"Farewell Majority\\", was aired several times on special programmes at Radio Maximum, a popular Moscow rock radio station. The music video \\"Don't Come\\" found its way on some music TV programmes. Also, this was the first time when the band's records were reviewed by major American punk-zines. Moreover, the band gave a big interview to Maximum Rocknroll. === FeeLee Records=== Between 1995 and 1997, Chetyre Tarakana were frequenters in Moscow and St. Petersburg clubs and attracted the attention of FeeLee record company. In 1997, the band released their first album on FeeLee records titled Ukral? Vypil?! V Tyurmu!!! where they somewhat changed their stylistics, mixing a classic Ramones-inspired sound with early Green Day/Lookout! Records. > ... the album is specially for those die-hard skeptics who still think > rock'n'roll and punk died long ago. Traditional drive, power, fun, tastes, > and smells. All the tracks are brilliant. –û–ú, February 1998 Immediately after releasing the album, the band changed their name to Tarakany! and it has remained unchanged to this day. Two songs from the album (\\"Durnaya Bashka\\" and \\"Nepogoda\\" received serious airplay on Radio Maximum, thereby increasing their army of fans, expanding their geography of performances, and pushing the band into several major rock and punk festivals where they shared the stage with bands such as Toy Dolls, Stranglers, the Exploited, and Rage Against the Machine. In late 1998, Tarakany! released the album, Posadki Net, featuring 16 songs in Russian, and a Depeche Mode cover of \\"Personal Jesus\\" which ultimately ended up finding its way to the first Russian tribute to Depeche Mode. Three of the songs the band decided to produce music videos for, \\"Personal Jesus,\\" \\"Punk-Rock Pesnya\\" and \\"Poezd V Storonu Arbatskoy\\" ended up being selected for broadcast by then fledgling, MTV Russia. The network had only been in existence for a month when the album was released. \\"Punk-Rock Pesnya\\" and \\"Poezd V Storonu Arbatskoy\\" reached the top chart positions at Russian rock station Nashe Radio. > Their positive punk rock is truly no worse than Green Day, NOFX, and other > California bands. Using old tube amps and a one-channel approach > (essentially), Ramones-fed Tarakany! have gained a real punk sound adding > measured doses of reggae and ska like Rancid does overseas. The front man > Sid shows a huge voice gorgeously shaded with old school American pop- > singers. –û–ú, Andrey Bukharin In 1999, Tarakany! released their first live album, Eto Zhizn: Ofitsialny Bootleg. In Winter 2000, the band embarked on their first European tour where they supported the Monsters for several shows. Followed by the next album few months later, Popcorm (My Nauchili Mir Sosat') became one of the first pop- punk albums in Russia. Their songs \\"365 Dney\\" and \\"Mnogo Telok I Piva\\" climbed to the TOP-10 of the Russian rock radio charts, and the video for \\"365 Dney\\" was in full rotation on MTV Russia. > ‚Ä¶Album by album, the band is increasingly switching from the Moscow to the > Californian punk school like Green Day or Rancid ... It is rather more > exciting to listen to their style juggling and embellishing their happy-punk > background with ska, reggae and country... I would not be surprised if Sid > will practice Tuvan throat singing in five years or so. Anyway, his > tremendous Sinatrian vocals are damn well-adjusted. > > Afisha, March 2000 On March 18, 2000, the band took part in the punk/alternative/rap festival Beat Bitva in Moscow's Dynamo Stadium. During the festival, hundreds of Nazi skinheads attacked the festival and anyone in the way. Two of the band's members were injured as a result of the fight with the Nazis. In early 2001, Tarakany! celebrated their 10th anniversary, and FeeLee Records reissued the band's entire back catalogue as well as released Tarakany!'s first ever \\"Best Of\\" compilation. Towards the end of that same year, Tarakany! cooperated with the Japanese band SOBUT on the split-album, Realny Punk?/Punk This Town, and it was released in Russia. In Spring 2002, they released their sixth studio album, Strakh I Nenavist' featuring the song \\"Ya Smotryu Na Nikh\\" which became one of the band's top hits and one of the top three offerings on the rock radio charts during the 16 week chart period. In 2013, the song reached the 55th position in the top 500 Russian rock hits, according to Nashe Radio. To present the album, the band arranged their first nationwide tour from the eastern to the western edge of Russia followed by Tokyo, Osaka and Nagoya, Japan with SOBUT, Assfort and Samurai Attack. Furthermore, the new album was released in Japan by Old Blood Records. The new record showed the band's transformation towards rapid melodic Californian punk rock which lyrics and music discussing themes such as domination, brainwashing, social issues, personal identity, all the while maintain the band's awareness of its own traditional humor. > ...

It was composed of newly arranged old songs, as well as one previously unreleased track. In the beginning of 2003, Tarakany! celebrated their 12th anniversary with a show in DKG (Gorbunov Palace of Culture), a famous Moscow rock landmark, where they performed 45 songs for over 2500 people. In early 2003, Tarakany! collaborated with the legendary Marky Ramone, the drummer for the Ramones. Their joint band was titled Marky Ramone & The Pinhead Army. === AiB Records === In late 2003, their first studio album release on their new label, AiB Records. Ulitsa Svobody at its album release concert at Moscow's Gorbunova Palace (DKG) drew more than 2500 fans. The concert itself was recorded for CD and can also be found on their 2004 DVD A My Uzhe Rubim!. This album is filled with up-tempo and meaningful tracks about freedom, choice, and equality. The songs were each directed against intolerance, nationalism, and indifference. > ‚Ä¶ Ulitsa Svobody is just what this album could and simply had to be > like‚Äîsharp, powerful, snotty, furious, uncompromising, and straight-ahead. > This is for those who are able not only to ascertain the shortcomings of the > surrounding reality and of theirs, but also to endeavour to change > something, to change themselves, which is worth a lot. For those who do not > want to remain indifferent, to tolerate their own drawbacks, who are not > afraid to be misunderstood‚Ä¶ The new release is not only invigorating and > providing \\"mind and heart\\" music with healthy anger inoculation. This is an > ultimate monolith full of ear-pleasing rock tunes. Intense, fuzzy, and huge > record. Rockmusic.ru The band made two videos off of this album, \\"Granitsy Ghetto\\" (\\"The Ghetto Limits\\") and \\"Hymn Democraticheskoy Molodyohi Mira\\" (\\"The Hymn of Democratic Youth of the World\\"). The previous, both featured and was directed by well- known theater and film actor Vladimir Epifantsev. While the latter consisted of footage from the band's Japanese tour. Both videos appeared on A-1 Channel, the first federal alternative music TV channel in Russia. The band's 2004 LP, Rakety Iz Rossii became the ideological successor of Ulitsa Svobody. The band again entered Russia's charts in the top 3 with its single, \\"Tishina Eto Smert\\" (\\"Silence is Death\\"). Its video was broadcast on both MTV Russia and A-1. Later that year, ZCM Records released both albums in Europe under the names \\"Freedom Street\\" and \\"Rockets from Russia\\". Those European versions also contained several English and German language versions, as well as the original Russian songs. In 2004, Tarakany! began working towards acquainting the public at large with the mostly unknown sound of true punk music, a style of music not widely found. The project, and its recorded audio equivalent, \\"High School of Punk\\", was at that time, the largest punk rock music festival in Russian history with a capacity crowd of 6,000 in attendance at Luzhniki Stadium. Tarakany!'s role in this festival was simultaneously as co- organizers, and co-headliners. The festival's Western headliner was Misfits. In Winter 2005, Tarakany! participated in the European Ramones night tour with Marky Ramone (ex-Ramones). Concerts were held in Germany, Switzerland, Italy, Norway, Sweden, Denmark, Czech Republic, Austria, and Netherlands, and included performances from such bands as Manges, Peawees, and Moped Lads. 2005 was also the band's Finnish debut, playing the Ilosaarirock Festival with MC5, Skatalites, Agnostic Front, Backyard Babies, and others. Near the end of 2005, Tarakany! released a split album with the members of Japan's SOBUT who had already left the band and re-united as Screams of Presidents. In early 2006, another split-album came out. This time, their collaborators were the Russian ska veterans, Distemper. Immediately following the Russian release, An'na Nadel Records put it out in Europe. The split-album contains six original songs, replayed by the other, and one jointly composed song, a cover of Sham 69's \\"If The Kids are United\\". Tarakany!'s 2006 studio album release, Vlasteliny Vselennoy, saw the band deviate from its traditional sound in favor a something more punk'n'roll. Four of these new songs entered the Russian radio rock charts: \\"Kto-To Iz Nas Dvoikh\\", \\"10 Millionov\\", \\"Pozvol Mne Pobyt' Odnomu\\", and \\"Vlasteliny Vselennoy\\". > The guys are gonna end up with \\"adult oriented rock\\" outweighing their > normal audacious punk. Their new album contains less flippancy and more > lyricism. Rolling Stone Magazine In 2007, Tarakany! celebrated their 15th anniversary by putting on two gigs at Moscow's Club Tochka (about 1,500 people each show) whose audio and video materials were recorded in the double CD+DVD combo, Krepkie Zuby I Ostrye Kogti. In that year, the band experimented with their own creative approach and started a new project, Unplugged Unlimited. In particular, they expanded their live line-up with back-vocalists, a wind section, and dramatically re- arranged their old songs by performing them in surprising styles such as bossa nova, latina, surf, and rhumba. The project was embodied in the eponymous album. It was at approximately this time that the band had cameos in two different episodes of Russia's version of the television show, Married... with Children. In mid-2008 Tarakany! was the opening act for the first, and only, Moscow performance of the Sex Pistols. Half a year later, the band released their EP, Skolko Deneg U Boga? (How Much Money's God Got?\\") whose title track caused public controversies and threats from religious radicals. === 2009‚ÄìPresent === In November 2009, the band issued a new long-play, Boy Do Dyr. Some songs from the album were used by Cannes-award winning director Valeriya Gai Germanika towards the soundtrack for her notorious series, Shkola (School). Consequently, she directed the music video for the band's song \\"To, Chto Ne Ubivaet Tebya\\" (\\"Reign of Failure\\"). That track was an unparalleled success for the band. > ... The band has created a surprisingly adult, honest and self-ironic > record, charming in its pathos lacking simplicity. The lyrics are about > social issues, a bit romance, and a lot of rock-and-roll, whose joys and > sorrows are known to Sid firsthand. In a word, Tarakany! have recorded their > most integral, and, at the same time, most versatile album, delivering teeth > grinding hardcore-punk (\\"Vykhod V Gorod\\"), surf-rock (\\"Almazy I > Istrebiteli\\"), as well as late Social Distortion-style punk ballads (\\"To, > Chto Ne Ubivaet Tebya\\"). > > Rolling Stone From 2010 to 2012, the band released several EPs. One of those tracks, \\"V Den', Kogda Ya Sdalsya\\", was a collaboration with Sergei Mikhalok, the leader of the legendary Belarusian band Lyapis Trubetskoy (and, later, the band Brutto, which was prohibited to perform in Russia). \\"Sobachye Serdtse\\" (\\"Heart of a Dog\\") another of the EP tracks, dedicated itself to the idea of treating homeless people humanely, and this subject was dealt with poignantly in its music video. In Summer 2010, while playing at the Tornado festival in Miass, Russia, a small group of armed individuals broke into the festival grounds and began beating spectators and shooting in the direction of the stage with firearms and other lethal weapons during Tarakany!'s performance. The incident was widely covered by Russian media, and the ensuing trial lasted several years. Spring 2011 was Tarakany!'s 20th Anniversary, and was celebrated by holding a concert at Arena Moscow (3,500 people). Then afterwards, again Tarakany! toured Europe with Tagada Jones, performed with Oi Polloi, Street Dogs, and The Mahones at the Zikenstock Festival. In 2011, by signing an open letter in support of Belarusian political prisoners, the band was placed on the so-called \\"black list\\" of artists who are ineligible to perform within the borders of Belarus. This unfortunate situation resulted in the cancellation of the planned Belarusian tour immediately after the European gigs. The band finally returned to Belarus three years later. First, with a trial, unannounced, secret gig, and then later on with a full-scale publicized live show. In 2012, at the Kubana Open-Air Festival (which was outrageously and officially banned the next year due to an incident involving the Bloodhound Gang and the Russian flag.) On stage, Tarakany! expressed their support and solidarity with Pussy Riot, and almost immediately afterwards, the festival organizers stopped Tarakany!'s performance and would not permit them to continue. Additionally, Tarakany! showed their support for Pussy Riot later in 2012 by posting an Internet compilation titled \\"Release!\\" covered with symbolic artwork. In 2013, FeeLee Records released both parts of Tarakany!'s new double-album, MaximumHappy. For this album, they invited special guests such as Chris Barker (Anti-Flag), Yotam Ben-Horin (Useless ID), Rodrigo Gonz√°lez (Die √Ñrzte), and singer-songwriter Frank Turner. It was the first time Tarakany! found themselves in the No. 1 position on the Nashe Radio Russian rock chart, Chartova Dyuzhina, with their song \\"Pyat' Slov\\" featuring guest vocals by Lousine Gevorkian of Louna. The track remained on the charts for 20 weeks, which resulted in it being named the No. 1 song in Russia for 2013. One other song also earned No. 1 honors in 2013 on the Nashe charts: Tarakany!'s, \\"Samiy Schastlivy Chelovek Na Zemle\\" featuring the group Anacondaz. Officially, the two Tarakany! tracks received co-honors from Nashe. The videos for both songs accumulated over 1 million views each on YouTube. There were other videos from the album as well, including for the track, \\"Bog I Politisiya\\" (\\"God and Police\\") jointly made with Chris Barker of Anti-Flag. The music video for the song \\"Plokhie Tantsory\\" (\\"Schlechte T√§nzer\\") featuring Rodrigo Gonz√°lez from Die √Ñrzte, was deleted by YouTube's administrators 10 hours after being uploaded due to numerous complaints because of profanity. It did mangage to rack up more than 100,000 hits during that ten hours. The MaximumHappy double LP was followed by MaximumHappy Live, and contained live stage performances of all the songs from both parts of the studio release. Right after New Years in 2014, Los Angeles punk label, Punk Outlaw Records, published Tarakany!'s first American release, Russian Democrazy. This album contained six new English songs and a compilation of the band's earlier tracks in English. > Their sound at times reminds you of classic essential punk-rock music like > Pennywise but the message is as politically charged as Anti-Flag‚Ä¶ Other > stand out tracks from the album would be #10 - Smile (Because It Irritates > Them) and #11 ‚Äî Anesthesia; and my favorite lyrics are from the first song > on the album is Heart of a Dog \\"fear, afraid of the things that I see.\\" > Although Russia's political outrage has been more transparent than that of > the United States over the last half of a century I can certainly relate to > this line because I am afraid of what I see in my own country these days. > Overall I really dig this album and I have added it to my keeper collection > far away from the garage sale bargain pile that I've compiled and that crap > that ends up in my desktop recycle bin. Dyingscene.com , 4/5 Stars In 2015, Tarakany! got mixed up in a scandal regarding a military equipment exhibition relating to the overall militarization of the Nashestvie Festival, the biggest Russian rock festival in the country. The band performed a set of anti-war songs and appealed to the audience between songs with messages of peace. As a result, the band was badly ostracised for their position by the organisers and also by the most reactionary spectators. In early 2016, Tarakany! celebrated their 25th anniversary with four concerts in one of the biggest club venues in Moscow, Glavclub/Yotaspace, for a total of 8,000 people give or take. Also, the band had two shows in club Avrora (St. Petersburg) (4,000 people). The resulting tour included more than 40 dates in Russia and Belarus. In early 2017, Soyuz Music released Larger than‚Ä¶ Live!, a triple combo outfit featuring two audio CDs and one DVD from their Moscow performances and include tracks from other artists such as Siberian Meat Grinder, Distemper, Louna, Lumen, and many others. In November 2016, Tarakany! released their new album, Sila Odnogo (The Power of One) on the Soyuz Music label. The band is currently awaiting their first truly global release in 2018 on the American label A-F Records. Their first global release is an English language version of Silo Odnogo, appropriately titled, The Power of One. In early September 2017, the group decided to try something a bit different. For a project called, Much Ado About Nothing, they decided to lock themselves in a small house in a village for 11 days, and write, record, and release one song every day from the process. The resulting material was collected and turned into an album called, A Lot of Noise from Nothing: The Album, and is available December 2017. Among the guests on the album are musicians from the Russian groups: Pornofilmi, Teni Svobodi, Plan Lomonosov, SMEX, Animal Jazz, Useless ID (Israel), and others. In addition to the global release in 2018, they will also release a split album made in collaboration with Israel's Useless ID. == Other projects of musicians == Projects of the former members of Tarakany! include: * Yuri Lenin (vocals, guitars).

In their songs and interviews, the musicians actively advocate for a meatless way of life. In 1996, the band became a participant of Uchites Plavat, a movement of alternative rock musicians against heavy drugs, fascism, and racism, as well as the radio programme, audio compilations, and festivals of the same name. In 1998, Tarakany! volunteered to participate in an \\"anti-drug\\" tour of several of Moscow's schools. For two weeks, they performed for different students at different schools and warned them about the dangers of heavy drugs. In 1999, Tarakany! initiated a set of audio compilations and festivals called, Tipa Punki I Vsyo Takoe, to help out and support punk/hardcore beginners. In total, they released six parts of the compilation and helped many people to discover a lot of new names. Since 2000, Tarakany! has been actively participating in events organized by the Russian non-profit foundation Net Alkogolizmu I Narkomanii (NAN), an organization similar in most respects to AA and NA. In particular, Tarkany! has been performing in several anti-AIDS campaigns. In 2005, Tarakany! performed at a charity concert to support the musicians of other punk bands who suffered from the Nazi skirmishes. The band is constantly cooperating with the charitable foundation AdVita in aiding children and adults suffering from cancer. Also, they regularly perform at concerts in support of the B.E.L.A. Deti-Babochiki (Children to Butterflies) fund, which comprehensively aids children who suffer from a rare genetic disewase known as epidermolysis bullosa. In addition to direct aid to children, the charity also donates to the Scientific Research Center of Pediatric Oncology, Nastien'ka, established to help children treated by the Scientific Research Centre of Paediatric Oncology. In 2012, Tarakany! organized the charity rock fair, Sobachye Serdtse, and donated all proceeds to Moscow's homeless. Also, the band performed a concert at the Moscow Institute of Emergency Care for the campaign, My Odnoy Krovi, which is interested in having rock musicians encourage the public to more regularly donate blood. In 2017, Tarakany! supported social campaign Producty V Glubinku to help to provide food for the elderly and poor.

The bridge was erected by J. A. Mackay, then City Engineer of Leeds, and opened to traffic in June 1912. The event is commemorated by a cast iron plaque at the eastern end. Cast iron segmental arches on stone piers carry the road, slightly rising from east to west, across the river. The abutments are decorated with the coat of arms of Leeds looking towards the river. Their top parts are pierced, as are the parapet rails and the spandrels of the bridge arches. The lamp posts on the abutments were installed in the middle of the 20th century. ==References== Category:Buildings and structures in Leeds Category:Transport in Leeds Category:Grade II listed buildings in West Yorkshire Category:Bridges in West Yorkshire ","title":"Kirkstall Bridge"},{"id":"56836045","text":"Confession of the Unity of the Bohemian Brethren of 1535 or Brethren's confession is doctrinal statement of the Unity of the Brethren. The confession was introduced to the king Ferdinand I in 1535 and published in Czech in 1536 and in Latin with Martin Luther's preface in 1538. The confession consists of a long apologetic preface and of twenty articles. It represents traditional theological concerns of the Unity, but is inspired by the Augsburg Confession too. In later editions the brethren made some changes, reflecting the theological drift of the Unity (significant changes had been done especially in Latin Wittenberg edition from 1573). The Brethren's confession is sometimes referred as Bohemian Confession. It should not be merged with the Bohemian Confession from 1575, which is different text. == Bibliography == * Craig D.

Within Nigeria, country music is generally classified as \\"sentimental music\\" - a Nigeria-specific genre that includes non-country musical acts. ==History== Country music originated in the southern United States in the 1920s where it evolved as a fusion of Appalachian music and Blues largely through the efforts of commercial record producers who sought to popularize traditional folk melodies from the rural United States. Country is musically similar to Western, although the latter tends to be more evocative of themes and imagery associated with the western United States, particularly that of the Old West era. Country was introduced to Nigeria in the middle 20th century by a combination of visiting American Christian missionaries from the southern United States, by returning Nigerian expatriates, and by a Don Williams-owned radio station that operated in the nation. By the 1960s, the genre had become \\"a part of everyday Nigerian life\\". As of the mid 1990s, country music remained highly popular among Nigerian radio listeners. By the early 2010s, interest in country music had lessened in major metropolitan areas, but continued to enjoy popularity in Middle Belt states, notably including Plateau, whose state capital Jos has been described as Nigeria's \\"home of country music\\". American country singer Jim Reeves, who died in 1964, has had a special staying power as a cultural icon in Nigeria and, as of the early 2010s, his recordings continued to be popular as a form of comfort music listened to in familial settings. Nigerian music audiences have tended not to recognize country music as a unique genre but have grouped it into a constructed genre of \\"sentimental music\\" which has been described by Public Radio International as a \\"catch-all category that essentially referred to everything Western that wasn‚Äôt dance music\\". ==Local acts== As in other parts of Africa where country music is popular, country music in Nigeria is dominated by recordings from American artists. However, a small number of Nigerian country and country-western musical acts have gained varying levels of popularity including Emma Ogosi, Ogak Jay Oke, Bongos Ikwue, and Poor Charley Akaa. ==See also== * Country music in Canada * Music of Nigeria ==References== Category:Country music ","title":"Country music in Nigeria"},{"id":"56836082","text":"√ñmer Sercan ƒ∞pek√ßioƒülu (born 1 July 1991), better known by his stage name Ezhel, is a Turkish rapper, singer and songwriter from Ankara whose music blends trap, hip-hop and reggae. His song \\"Geceler\\" has been streamed more than 60 million times on Spotify. He has been given the title 'Freestyle King' by Hip Hop Life in Turkey. == Life and career == Ezhel came from a musical family. His mother was an Anatolian folk dancer, and his uncle was a musician and sound and light engineer. He received a scholarship to TED school, and began listening to US rappers like Eminem, 50 Cent and Tupac Shakur. At 18, he began performing with a reggae band called Afra Tafra. After this group split, he formed his own reggae band, K√∂kler Filizleniyor, along with some of his friends from Ankara. He performed under the name Ais Ezhel until 2017. Ezhel can also play the baƒülama and guitar, and sings reggae with the band K√∂kler Filizleniyor. His debut album M√ºptezhel came out in 2017. Ezhel was arrested on 24 May 2018 and sent to pretrial detention accused of \\"inciting drug use\\" in his songs.

In 1925 she travelled to Washington, D.C. as a Delegate to the International Women's Congress. In 1926 Beckmann was appointed headmistress of the high school Helene-Lange- Oberrealschule. The following year, she became the first woman in Hamburg to be appointed a school inspector (Oberschulr√§tin). Like many other democratic figures of the Weimar Republic, Beckmann was removed from office by the Nazis in 1933. Officially, she retired early because of \\"national unreliability\\". During the time of National socialism, she withdrew with her twin sister Hanna into Inner Emigration. In 1945, she was reinstated by Heinrich Landahl as a school inspector and played a vital part in the rehabilitation of the Hamburg school system. Emmy Beckmann campaigned her whole life for the interests of women. Among other things, she was a founding member of the Stadtbund Hamburgischer Frauenvereine in 1915, published the source booklets on women's life in history and was one of the founding members of the Hamburg Frauenring in 1946. At the beginning of 1948, she initiated the re-establishment of the Akademikerinnenbund Hamburg, to which she had already belonged in the Weimar period and which today belongs to the German Women's Academic Society (Deutscher Akademikerinnenbund). Beckmann has headed the latter since its re- establishment in 1949. After her death in 1967 she was buried at the Ohlsdorf Cemetery (Hamburg). The joint tomb slab for her and her sister is now in the so-called Women's garden. == Political career == In the Weimar period, Emmy Beckmann was a member of the German Democratic Party (DDP, from 1930 onwards: German State Party, germ. Deutsche Staatspartei). She took part in the founding of the Free Democratic Party in 1945, which later became the Hamburg FDP regional association. Internally, she was part of the left wing of the party. In addition to Hans-Harder Biermann-Ratjen, Harald Abatz, Max Dibbern, Anton Leser und Lieselotte Anders , she was one of the signatories of Edgar Engelhard's appeal for a liberal collection (Aufruf f√ºr eine liberale Sammlung) on 20 January 1951, which declared itself against the plans of the state associations of North Rhine-Westphalia, Hesse and Lower Saxony to turn the FDP into a party of the national collection. From 1921 to 1933 and from 1949 to 1957 Beckmann was a member of the Hamburg Parliament. As early as 1946, the British occupying forces wanted to appoint her to the Appointed Parliament (germ. Ernannte B√ºrgerschaft), but she refused to do so with regard to her occupation as a school inspector. During the deliberations on the new Hamburg Constitution, she requested that the sentence \\"Women must belong to the Senate\\" be included in Article 33, but was unsuccessful. Even within her own party, only Emilie Kiep-Altenloh, Lieselotte Anders, Walter Brosius und Hans-Harder Biermann-Ratjen voted in favour of the motion. After the Parliament elections in 1953, she was, alongside Emilie Kiep-Altenloh, nominated by the Hamburg women's associations for one of the Senators positions, but was not voted in. In 1957 she was re-elected as a member of the Hamburg Parliament, but renounced the position on grounds of age. Her parliamentary work focused on education policy. In contrast to Senator Heinrich Landahl and the SPD, she spoke out against the six-year elementary school system and in favour of the 13th grade at secondary school. She argued that six years of secondary school were not enough to prepare for the scientific work at university. In the first federal election 1949, she ran on third place of the FDP's state list after Hermann Sch√§fer and Willy Max Rademacher, which did not suffice for an entry into the Bundestag. Beckmann attended the first federal convention as one of Hamburg's representatives. == Honours == In 1953 Beckmann was awarded the Grand Cross of Merit of the Federal Republic of Germany. In 1957, the Senate of Hamburg bestowed the title of professor on her. In addition, she was the first woman ever to be awarded the Mayor Stolten Medal (germ. B√ºrgermeister-Stolten-Medaille) in 1961. Her and her work are commemorated today in the Ohlsdorf Cemetery in the women's garden. In 1980, the Emmy-Beckmann-Weg in Niendorf was named after her in honour of her work as a politician and women's rights activist. == Sources == * Christine von Oertzen.

Swedish forces under Gustav II Adolf laid siege to Pskov, but were unable to take the city. == Prelude == After the Battle of Klushino, the Swedish troops, located in Russia, called in 1609 by Vasily Shuisky, declared war on Russia and in 1611 occupied Novgorod land. The siege of Tikhvin in 1613 was unsuccessful for the Swedes, but in 1614 they managed to take Gdov. In 1615 the Swedish King Gustavus Adolphus intended to subdue the Pskov land. == Siege == Approaching Pskov, the Swedes tried to take it immediately, but were repelled by the Pskov garrison with heavy losses. In front of the king, famed field marshal Evert Horn was shot dead from the wall. During the siege, the Swedes shelled the city with artillery, but at night Pskovites successfully closed any breach in the walls, and repeatedly made bold sallies causing the Swedes considerable losses. In September, Pskov even received reinforcements from Moscow. In early October, the Swedes undertook a second decisive assault. The attackers managed to occupy part of the city wall and one of the towers. However, the Pskovites managed to blow up the tower, together with the Swedes that were in it, and went into a fierce counterattack. After two and a half months, the Swedes withdrew from Pskov to Narva in view of the coming cold weather, as well as the high mortality from diseases and famine. == Aftermath == After a cruel defeat, King Gustavus Adolphus decided not to continue the war with Russia. Sweden already then planned to resume the struggle with Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth for the Baltic states and was not ready for a war on two fronts. On December 15, 1615 , a truce was concluded, and both parties initiated peace negotiations that ended with Treaty of Stolbovo in 1617. == References == Pskov Pskov(1615) Pskov(1615) Category:1615 in Sweden Category:1610s in Sweden Category:1615 in Russia Category:Russia‚ÄìSweden military relations Category:History of Pskov ","title":"Siege of Pskov (1615)"},{"id":"56836237","text":"Matt Wordsworth is an Australian television presenter.Matt Wordsworth sells in Camperdown, news.com.au, 10 December 2017.

It was originally for voice and piano accompaniment, and was later arranged by the composer for voice and full orchestra. ==Composition== In this song Faur√© set words by the poet Paul Armand Silvestre.Nectoux, p. 551 It was composed in 1904 for the amateur singer Emilie Girette after her marriage to the pianist √âdouard Risler.Nectoux, p. 302 Originally for voice and piano, it was later orchestrated by Faur√© as part of his incidental music for Masques et bergamasques (1919). Faur√© composed the song in the key of F minor, but it was first published (Hamelle, Paris, 1907) in E minor.Johnson, p. 28 When Faur√© orchestrated the song for Masques et bergamasques he wrote to his wife that it was not at all well known: \\"for just as pianists play the same eight or ten of my pieces, so singers all sing the same songs\\".Jones, p. 179 The pianist Graham Johnson calls it an \\"enchantingly mournful serenade of a persistent, if unsuccessful lover ‚Ä¶ Faur√© distilled to the essentials\\". Both Johnson and Vladimir Jank√©l√©vitch find an autumnal quality in the song, despite the reference to \\"la saison nouvelle\\".

It was published in the United Kingdom in 2005 by Hamish Hamilton. In the United States, a paperback version was published by Bloomsbury USA in 2007 as Bamboo: Essays and Criticism. Adam Mars-Jones, who reviewed the book for The Observer, was unimpressed. He said: \\"Does William Boyd write effective prose? Not often. He is neither an intellectual nor a stylist, and in the absence of rigour or sparkle Bamboo is not an enjoyable read\\". \\"Journalism\\", says Mars-Jones, \\"is normally assumed to promote economy of expression, but there's no sign of that here... The only times William Boyd's non-fiction comes alive is when he writes about art, not in general terms but when he describes a particular artist's procedures in detail... the dust falls off his prose and he seems a different writer\\". James Urquhart, for The Independent, said: \\"Much of it is good... Boyd's art criticism is lucid, well-constructed and refreshing, possessing the unusual quality of making painters legible and interesting on the page... Perhaps his professionalism as a writer combines with his abiding interest in art to give Boyd the rare skill of translating visual idiom into intelligent prose. Unfortunately, many pieces in the later sections of Bamboo fail to rise to this standard\\". Urquhart's conclusion is that Bamboo \\"is solid stuff, and occasionally inspiring, but too big\\". \\"Boyd\\" he says \\"is undoubtedly a substantial writer but this block of journalism confirms the mighty labour of his workaday career, rather than the more memorable flights of fictional transcendence\\". ==References *Official website Category:2005 non-fiction books Category:Bloomsbury Publishing books Category:Hamish Hamilton books Category:Non-fiction books by William Boyd (writer) ","title":"Bamboo (book)"},{"id":"56836418","text":"Leroy Leon Pendarvis (born 1945) is an American session musician.

He was a member of various right-wing political parties. ==Studies== Ern≈ë Rozgonyi was born on 16 August 1933 in Budapest into a senior military family as the son of economist Dr. Ern≈ë Rozgonyi, Sr. (1908‚Äì1993) and German-Italian teacher language teacher Margit Tschan (1899‚Äì1980). After the World War II, the family landholdings were confiscated by the new Communist regime. Rozgonyi graduated from the Arts section of the Pet≈ëfi S√°ndor State Secondary School of 1st District of Budapest in 1951. Rozgonyi was not able to pursue university studies due to his bourgeois origin. After studying in the E√∂tv√∂s L√≥r√°nd Geophysical Institute, he worked as a geodesist and tried unsuccessfully entrance exams to various universities in the next twelve years. Finally, in 1962, he was admitted to the night school section of the Financial and Accounting College (today a faculty of the Budapest Business School). He obtained an economist degree there in 1966. He earned the degree of auditor's qualification in June 1973. ==CareerDuring the Communist regime=== He spent his military service between October 1953 and December 1956. His unit was locked in the barrack by officers of the National Air Defense and Air Force Command (OLLEP) during the Hungarian Revolution of 1956. Rozgonyi and his fellow soldiers were disarmed by the arriving Soviet Army on 4 November. He was discharged from the military on 5 December. He continued his work at the Maszolaj Geophysical Research Company and its successor organization National Petroleum and Gas Trust (OKGT) until March 1958. Following that he worked for √âM No. 44 State Construction Company as a technician since April 1958. After finishing his exam in 1966, he became an employee at the Ministry of Finance, where he participated in the draft of the New Economic Mechanism launched in 1968. He was a senior lecturer at the III. Industry and Construction Department. After the decline of the reformist movement and the New Economic Mechanism, Rozgonyi was charged of incitement against a community and was detained in September 1970. He was sentenced to a fine of 3,000 HUF by the Supreme Court. After 1974, he worked for the VI. Department of Transportation, Construction and Housing Policy. By 1984, his relationship with secretary of state Attila Madarasi has deteriorated for political reasons. As a result, he was relocated to the National Association of Co-operatives (SZ√ñVOSZ) and was appointed head of its Housing Co-operative Department in June 1984. He served as the last managing director of the disintegrating SZ√ñVOSZ from 1990 to 1992. ===Political career=== During the regime change, Rozgonyi joined the Christian Democratic People's Party (KDNP) in 1989, which became a coalition member in the government of J√≥zsef Antall. Minister of Finance Mih√°ly Kupa appointed Rozgonyi as financial director of the Treasury Property Directorate in the spring of 1992. According to his own biography, Rozgonyi struggled unsuccessfully against the \\"excessive privatization of state goods\\", as a result he applied for retirement. In 1993, he also left his party and joined the newly formed right-wing nationalist Hungarian Justice and Life Party (MI√âP). In the 1998 parliamentary election, Rozgonyi was elected a Member of Parliament from his party's national list. He served as a deputy leader of the MI√âP caucus throughout the parliamentary term and was vice-chairman of the Audit Committee until 2002. He was also involved in the Regional Development Committee (1999‚Äì2002) and the Committee on Employment and Labor (2001‚Äì2002). He was a member of that sub-committee which investigated the allegations of corruption within the Postabank. The MI√âP failed to win any seats in the 2002 parliamentary election. Rozgonyi left the party in 2003 and was a founding member of the Hungarian National Front (MNF) which soon integrated into the Hungarian National Alliance (MNSZ) electoral cooperation. After its failure in the 2004 European Parliament election and subsequent decay, Rozgonyi joined Jobbik in that year. Rozgonyi was elected MP via the Jobbik's Fej√©r County Regional List in the 2010 parliamentary election. He worked in the Audit and Budget Committee (2010, 2011‚Äì2012) and the Economic and Information Technology Committee (2010‚Äì2011). On 5 December 2012, Rozgonyi announced he left the Jobbik party and quit its parliamentary group, continuing his career as an independent MP. He objected to the party's claimed \\"scandal policy\\" and lack of professionalism. In January 2013, Rozgonyi and fellow ex-Jobbik MP Zsolt Endr√©sik announced that they would henceforth represent the extra-parliamentary Hungarian Justice and Life Party (MI√âP) in the National Assembly. Technically, they remained independent MPs. Following his exit from Jobbik, Rozgonyi worked in the Committee on Sustainable Development until the end of the parliamentary term in 2014. Rozgonyi was nominated the MI√âP's candidate for the position of finance minister for the 2018 parliamentary election. He would have run for an individual seat in √ìbuda, but suddenly fell ill and died in the Sz√©kesfeh√©rv√°r hospital on 4 March 2018, a month before the election. ==References== Category:1933 births Category:2018 deaths Category:Hungarian economists Category:Christian Democratic People's Party (Hungary) politicians Category:Hungarian Justice and Life Party politicians Category:Jobbik politicians Category:Members of the National Assembly of Hungary (1998‚Äì2002) Category:Members of the National Assembly of Hungary (2010‚Äì2014) Category:Politicians from Budapest ","title":"Ern≈ë Rozgonyi"},{"id":"56836429","text":"The Franklin Boulevard Historic District is a primarily residential historic district located in Pontiac, Michigan along Franklin Boulevard between West Huron Street and Orchard Lake Avenue. It also contains structures along Mary Day and Henry Clay Avenues between Franklin and Miller, and some structure along West Huron between Franklin and Williams, and along West Lawrence between Williams and the railroad. The district was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1983. ==History== Pontiac was founded in 1818, with the earliest development occurring downtown. However, residential development soon spread west, first to Lawrence and Williams Streets in 1835, when George M Williams platted lots in the area. In 1886, Henry Clay Ward platted Franklin Boulevard (named after his son) and Mary Day and Henry Clay Avenues (named after his wife and himself). Lots in this area were sold and developed at different times, leading to a mix of architectural styles through the district. ==Description== The heart of the district, along Franklin Boulevard, contains relatively large lots with large, detached, single-family houses of two-and-a-half to three stories. There is a mix of architectural styles and materials, but the streetscape is unified by a consistent 60 foot setback from the street. The houses on the adjacent Mary Day and Henry Clay Avenues are smaller in scale and on smaller lots, but are also unified by their consistent setback and similar massing. The eastern portion of district was developed earlier, and the houses are generally older. The houses along West Huron Street and Williams Street are placed on very large lots, with substantial open space between them. The structures on West Lawrence Street are generally smaller, from one and one-half to two and one-half stories high, and on smaller lots. Significant structures in the district include: * Myrick- Palmer House (223 W. Huron): An Italian Villa-style house constructed by Frederick C. Myrick in 1848 and purchased by Charles H. Palmer in 1862. This house is individually listed on the national Register. * Sibley-Hoyt House (146 W. Lawrence): A long, low clapboard-covered house is cabin dating to 1820 with another house moved to the site in 1867 by George Hoyt.a blind music teacher at the Romeo Academy when Palmer was there. * First Church of Christ, Scientist (Williams and West Lawrence): A Greek Revival structure with a double portico facing both Williams and West Lawrence Streets. The building was originally a house belonging to Edwin C. Smith. The church [purchased it in about 1920. * Pontiac Cultural Arts Center (47 Williams Street): This building was originally the Pontiac City Library, built in 1898 by the Ladies' Library Association. In 1924 the Association turned the library over to the City of Pontiac, and when the library moved in the 1950s, this building became the city's Art Center. * Jacobs House (99 Franklin Boulevard): Probably the oldest building on Franklin, this house was built In 1886 by banker Frank G. Jacobs It is generally Queen Anne In style, with a large L-shaped front veranda and two small balconies on the second floor. * McCall House (72 Franklin Boulevard): Built In 1889 by businessman F. E. McCall, this house is Queen Anne In style with a projecting angled, boxed bay at the southeast corner. * Heltsch House (75 Mary Day Avenue): A two-and-one-half-story clapboard covered house with a steep gable roof and an enclosed porch with three pilasters across the front. * O. J. Beaudette House (87 Franklin Boulevard): Built in 1914 by carriage-maker Oliver Joseph Beaudette. Beaudette's company was one of Pontiac's largest employers at the turn of the century, and continued to be so as the firm gradually switched to making automobile bodies. * Leo Beaudette House (269 West Huron Street): Built in 1917 for Oliver Leo Beaudette, Oliver Joseph's son. It was designed by architect Oscar C. Gottesleben of Detroit. The Y.W.C.A. purchased the property in 1965. * William L. Day House (22 Franklin Boulevard): Built for William La Motte Day (1863-1938), manager and president of General Motors Truck Company of Pontiac from 1912 to 1924. * Andrew Lewis Moore House (58 Franklin Boulevard): Queen Anne house built for attorney Andrew Lewis Moore between 1899 and 1902. ==Gallery== File:Franklin Boulevard Historic District Pontiac MI A.JPGLeo Beaudette House (now YWCA), 269 W.

It is a relatively rare cancer and is diagnosed in approximately 1/100000 people every year. In recent decades the incidence has increased. The prognosis is comparatively good with a median survival of more than 8 years. The disease was named by Siegfried Oberndorfer, a German pathologist, in 1907. == Signs and symptoms == A large fraction of cases are diagnosed after routine surgery for bowel obstruction. Others may be diagnosed incidentally, or after investigation for carcinoid syndrome. The tumor typically produces serotonin, Tachykinin peptides and other substances, which cause flushing, tachycardia, diarrhea and in some cases fibrosis of the heart valves. There are often several small and highly fibrotic tumors present in the intestine. The tumors often spread to the mesenteries and the liver. ==Cause== Familial clustering of the disease, with several relatives being diagnosed may occur. Relatives of patients have an increased risk of developing the disease. === Genetics === The tumors often harbour loss of chromosome 18q. Mutations in CDKN1B are present in approximately 8% of cases. == Treatment == The treatment traditionally consists of a combination of medical and surgical treatment. Somatostatin analogues and Interferon decrease the secretion of hormones and the resulting symptoms. Radionuclide therapy with 177-Lutetium-DOTA-Octreotate increases progression-free survival. Traditionally, the primary tumor has been surgically removed even in the case of metastatic disease, although this was in 2017 shown not to improve survival in asymptomatic patients. == References == Category:Gastrointestinal cancer Category:Neuroendocrinology ","title":"Small intestine neuroendocrine tumor"},{"id":"56836444","text":"The Special Library of Oncology is a central oncological library in Slovenia.

Most mining in the area, mostly of silver chloride ores, had finished by 1874. Groom Mine continued to operate, finally ceasing operations in 1954. By 1956, official recordings of products of the Groom Mining District, which includes Groom Mine, shows that lead was the bulk of minerals harvested, which also included of silver and about of gold. During World War II, Groom Mine became surrounded by military activity, which continued into the 21st century. In the 1950s, the mine was exposed to fallout from nuclear testing that was being carried out at the Nevada Test Site. During the late 20th century, military activities, including the destruction of a mill and the restriction of access to the mine, continued to affect work there. The United States Government seized the mine under eminent domain from its previous owners in 2015. Just compensation was set at $1.204 million by the United States District Court, District of Nevada (Las Vegas), Judge Miranda Du presiding. ==Background== The rocks in the range date back to the Paleozoic era; the site is also covered by Tertiary rocks on its east and north sides. Prior to European exploration, the region was inhabited by Southern Paiute Native Americans. Following the discovery of minerals in the Comstock Lode in 1859, prospecting of other areas in Nevada began. Mining in the area began in the late 1860s, after minerals were discovered in the Groom Range in 1864. A mining district to organize claims, called Groom District, was formed in 1869. In 1871, the area was documented in the Wheeler Survey. ==HistoryMining=== Human habitation at the Groom Mine site may have begun as early as 1866. A patent for the Groom Mine was issued in 1872 and in 1885, the Sheahan family acquired the property. The mine was three days' travel from Indian Springs and above sea level, making it very isolated. According to Nevada Bureau of Mines and Geology in 1998, the property claim, which is commonly referred to as Groom, is officially named \\"Conception\\". In addition to the Conception claim, other claims in Groom Distract were made and held by the Sheahan family. From 1915 until 1917, the mine was leased to Tom McCormick, who worked the mine. In September 1917, a miner from Austria- Hungary who was employed by Groom Mining Company died at the mine. In the mid- to-late 1910s the mine produced silver worth about $250,000. The shipping of mined products became difficult with the closing of the Las Vegas and Tonopah Railroad at the end of that decade, which caused the mine to become temporarily idle. By 1922, the mine had two shafts, the longest being deep. alt=a dirt road leading off towards the horizon In 1942, construction of a mill that used a gravity and flotation method began; a source later referred to this mill as a concentration mill. By 1951, four people were living at the mine and the concentration mill had been completed. Ore from Groom Mine, from which lead and silver were extracted, was found to contain cerussite and galena. Beginning in 1950, roads approaching the mine from the west were closed due to military activities, leading to the Sheahan family and Lincoln County to build a road from the east; this is referred to as Groom Road in a 1986 report. During the 1950s, mining operations paused due to nearby nuclear tests. In 1954, production from the mine ended due to the destruction of a mill at the mine. Until 1956, the mine product totaled almost a million dollars in several minerals, including copper, silver, and gold; In 1977, the United States Bureau of Mines valued the output of Groom mine products at $3.75 million. It was the most productive mine in the Groom Mining District and had been worked on by three generations of the Sheahan family. Based on panning samples near Groom Mine, the area may also contain deposits of antimony, barium, lead, mercury, and zinc. By 1959, the Sheahan family moved away from the mine but visited their property regularly. In 1984, the Sheahan family, who still owned the Groom Mine, also had the legal rights to most of the other 22 patented mining claims nearby. According to the Nevada Bureau of Mines and Geology, it was estimated in 1963 that there is of material that can be mined at Groom Mine. A 1990 Bureau of Land Management report stated that due to restricted access to the mine, it would lead to \\"potential loss of income through inability to expand or further develop the claims\\". Until late 2015, the Sheahan family periodically blasted for minerals at the mine; by this time the family had owned the mine for 130 years. ===Military interaction=== In 1941, Groom Mine was visited by individuals who stayed at the mine with the Sheahan family while surveying the area for a gunnery and bombing range to be used during World War II. The outhouse and bunkhouse at the mine were accidentally strafed during the war by aircraft using the Las Vegas Bombing and Gunnery Range. Beginning in the 1950s, Groom Mine began to be impacted by nuclear tests at the Nevada Test Site; Groom Mine was away. In 1951, the Atomic Energy Commission informed the Sheahan family of the planned detonations and set up instrumentation at the mine. The instrumentation was monitored by an employee of the United States Public Health Service, who lived at the mine along with the Sheahan family. The first mention of a nuclear tests impacting operations at Groom Mine was the Operation Tumbler‚ÄìSnapper Easy Test, which led to the mine being evacuated due to its proximity to the detonation. Following the detonation, measurements of radiation at the mine reached 0.19 roentgen per hour. It caused some structural damage, breaking the front door of the Sheahan's home. Further away, fallout impacted nearby Tempiute. Returning to the mine had to be done using a different route; the normal route was too radioactive to travel on. The following Fox test in late May 1952 led to fallout falling on the mine; the highest-recorded radiation was 0.32 roentgen per hour. It was, however, the view of the Atomic Energy Commission that the nuclear detonations \\"had not subjected Groom Mine personnel to any real danger from fallout\\". By May 1952, most of the Sheahan family had evacuated the mine and moved to Las Vegas. In July 1952, Martha, a member of the family who had been exposed to fallout, was diagnosed with cancer. Following Operation Upshot‚ÄìKnothole, the Sheahan family attempted to sell their claim to the Atomic Energy Commission but it refused, fearing it would set a precedent; instead the family received $1,100 for losses and damages resulting from the Operation Tumbler-Snapper tests. Following the adverse environmental impact observed by the two remaining family members at the mine caused by Upshot-Knothole Harry, the Atomic Energy Commission said the blasts were designed to produce winds from the testing area towards Groom rather than towards Las Vegas. During 1953, the property was strafed and during the summer a bomb destroyed the mine's mill; no specific claim was made by the Sheahan family against the United States Air Force (USAF) for the event. In 1954, the mining buildings were strafed by aircraft using Nellis Air Force Gunnery and Bombing Range. In 1956, the Sheahan family and others filed lawsuits against the Atomic Energy Commission because of damage caused by nuclear testing. In 1959, the lawsuit was withdrawn when the Sheahan family ran out of funds to continue legal action. The property on which the mine is located has a view of an airfield known as Area 51. In the 1970s and 1980s, armed personnel arrived when the Sheahan family came onto their property, sometimes locking them into their own buildings. alt=A map with an overlay of restricted areas. In 1984, the USAF seized lands around Groom Mine, restricting access to the mine for the Sheahan family. Some of the Sheahan family were issued with security clearances after 1984. In 1986, the 1953 mill-destruction event was entered into the record of a subcommittee of the United States House Committee on Natural Resources. In 1987, the position of the United States Air Force was, \\"we don't want to go in and tell them to get the hell out\\". In 1989, although it was within the Nevada Test and Training Range, the United States Air Force allowed claimants access to their claims within the Groom Mining District, including Groom Mine. ===Government ownership=== Beginning in late 2014, the United States Department of Defense attempted to purchase the property from the Sheahan family, originally offering $1.5 million. By August 2015, the USAF had raised the offer to $5.2 million; the family continued rejecting the offers. In August 2015, a government press release described the mine as a \\"safety and security risk\\", even though the Sheahan family had not disclosed any activities of the Groom Lake facility. In September 2015, the commander of the Nevada Test and Training Range stated that the existence of the mine within the range led to \\"tremendous expense\\" due to \\"canceling missions when they came out\\"; secret operations at the base could not proceed when civilians were present on the Sheahan's property within easy view of the installation. On 16 September 2015, the property was condemned under eminent domain and given to the United States Government by a court order signed by federal Judge Miranda Du. It was not determined at the time of transfer of ownership how much the Sheahan family would receive in just compensation for the government acquisition of Groom Mine; the USAF in 2015 estimated the land to be worth $1.2 million. In November 2015, the Sheahan family suggested the mine be protected as a national historic site; this coincides with a suggestion in a 1980s USAF report that recommended nominating Groom Mining District to be listed on the National Register of Historic Places. By 2016, the USAF only valued Groom Mine at under a third of a million dollars; the Sheahan family's legal counsel valued the property as being worth over $100 million. In 2017, the family claimed they were forced to leave millions of dollars worth of property at Groom Mine following the seizure; part of the property which was abandoned includes an antique anvil that was missing when personal property was reviewed in November 2015. In August 2019, it was reported that the family was hoping to have a jury trial to determine the value of the property. The trial was ultimately conducted in front of a three-member Land Commission. Prior to trial, the landowners accepted the Government's valuation of the mineral interests at $104,000 and went to trial only to contest the value of the surface rights. The landowner's experts valued those rights at $50 million based on the property being developed into a commercial tourism enterprise offering views of Area 51. The Government's experts valued it at $254,000 based on continued use as a rural recreation retreat. On May 29, 2020 the Land Commission ruled that just compensation for the taking of the surface rights is $1,100,000 based on the property's continued use for rural recreation, with a premium over the Government's valuation to account for its view of Area 51 and its historic use as a family owned mining operation. ==See also== * Tikaboo Peak ==ReferencesFurther reading== * * * ==External links== * * Category:Buildings and structures in Lincoln County, Nevada Category:Mines in Nevada Category:1875 establishments in Nevada Category:2015 disestablishments in Nevada ","title":"Groom Mine"},{"id":"56836525","text":"Euglossa villosa is a species of orchid bee in the genus Euglossa.

Despite initial enthusiasm, as a result of budgetary and management problems, it was announced in February 1894 that the exhibition would not be held until 1895.

It is also the seventh book in the Gray Man series. The novel puts its main character Court Gentry at the forefront of the civil war in Syria, as he helps a group of expatriates take down the Syrian president's brutal regime. The book debuted at number 7 at The New York Times bestseller list. == Plot summary == Two months after his CIA operation in Hong Kong, freelance mercenary Court Gentry is hired for a contract job in Paris by a group of Syrian exiles through former French intelligence officer Vincent Voland. His job is to kidnap Bianca Medina, a Spanish fashion model and Syrian President Ahmed al-Azzam's mistress, and then deliver her to the exiles so that they can gather information from her about a secret meeting between President Azzam and the Supreme Leader of Iran, in which she was present. They believe that the revelation of Azzam's secret talks with the Iranians, in which he permitted them to build military bases in Syria, would anger the Russians, who were his allies in the civil war, for betrayal; this would then cause discord among the three parties and lead to the destabilization of Azzam's regime. Later that night, Court captures Medina from her private apartment, while also rescuing her from assassins sent by ISIS in the process. After delivering her to the FSEU, led by husband and wife doctors Tarek and Rima Halaby, he berates them for giving him faulty information about the attackers and then leaves them, finished with his job. The attackers were found out to be provided information on Medina's whereabouts (albeit presented as her being a concubine of the emir of Kuwait, who was an enemy of ISIS) by Azzam's powerful wife Shakira, who wanted the Spanish model dead after finding out about their affair and fearing that she might replace her one day as first lady of Syria. The Halabys try to secure Medina's cooperation, but their plan becomes complicated as Bianca reveals that she gave birth to a child with Azzam, who was named Jamal after his father. She further insists that she would rather go back to war-torn Syria and care for her child rather than betray Azzam. Medina was later kept in a secluded safehouse owned by French domestic intelligence (DGSI) as suggested by Voland. Desperate to earn her cooperation, the Halabys try to retask Gentry with another job: spirit away Medina's infant son from Syria in what is considered a suicide mission, which Court initially refuses. He later rescues the Halabys from being tortured for Medina's whereabouts by two French police officers sent by Swiss bank consultant & Shakira's right-hand man Sebastian Drexler. Court then agrees to rescue Medina's son as well as his babysitter, named Yasmin, from Damascus after she allows him to do so. Meanwhile, Shakira sends Drexler to Paris in order to find and eliminate Medina; however, this coincides with a rescue mission for Medina that President Azzam assigned for him. Upon arriving in Paris under a stolen identity (since he was wanted by the Interpol, and Voland in particular, for his crimes as a former field operative), he plans to leave the Azzams after fulfilling the operations by faking his death. Drexler then forces French police captain Henri Sauvage to continue working for him in hunting down Medina after his colleagues had been killed by Gentry and Drexler's henchmen working for Syrian intelligence (Mukhabarat), led by Malik. Court secures a job inside Syria as a mercenary for a German-based private military company working with pro-regime army Desert Hawks Brigade, which will provide his cover as he works on rescuing Medina's son. He then arrives at the city of Latakia, and takes part in a convoy of Mukhabarat officials which, after surviving an ambush by local al Qaeda outfit Al Nusra Front, proceeds to the capital of Damascus. Since communication devices were not allowed in the military camp where he was staying, Court later steals a phone from an Arab soldier on a night out with his fellow contractors in order to contact Medina, instigating a barfight in the process. After she gives him the location of her house, he infiltrates her home and then extracts Jamal and Yasmin amidst gunfire from pursuing Syrian forces. Meanwhile, Sauvage identifies the location of the FSEU safehouse where Medina is being kept, which he relays to Drexler as well as Malik and his men. They infiltrate the estate, making Voland surrender himself to them and killing Tarek in the process. Rima manages to let Medina escape and then sets fire to the house; she was also killed. As Drexler and his henchmen leave the burning building, Sauvage and Malik find Medina running away and then capture her. Court calls Voland and informs him of the successful extraction, but the French intelligence officer tells him about what had happened in the safehouse. Gentry becomes livid, but later offers to assassinate President Azzam in an effort to salvage the failed operation. Voland agrees to let Gentry be his agent in place in Syria, as long as he arranges for the extraction of Jamal and Yasmin out of the country. Court then lets Jamal and Yasmin stay in the home of Syrian doctor Shawkat Saddiqi, who is a friend of the Halabys. Court maintains his cover as a mercenary. Amidst clearing a ruined refinery with his fellow contractors, Court gathers information about President Azzam's upcoming trip to a Russian military base in Palmyra from a Desert Hawks battalion command post stationed there. Afterwards, Court tries to alert the nearby enemy to his team's presence in order to use the impending gunfight as a diversion to contact Voland about the intel. However, he was captured by a Special Forces unit in the ensuing firefight. Meanwhile, Drexler, Sauvage, Medina, and Malik and his men arrive in Athens, Greece to smuggle themselves back to Syria. As they prepare to board the ship for Damascus, Drexler tries to carry out his plan, which is to kill his companions and then escape the Mukhabarat operatives who were waiting for them. However, his plan goes awry when Sauvage shoots him, knocking him unconscious; still, the French police officer was also killed by the Swiss. Meanwhile, Voland, who had tracked the group to the Greek port, rescues Medina from the firefight. Drexler is then left to be rescued by the Syrian operatives waiting in the ship bound for Syria. After identifying himself to his captors as an American with military experience, Court manages to call his boss in the CIA, Matthew Hanley, to authorize his assassination of President Azzam. By the time that the Syrian president visited the Russian military base, he manages to shoot Azzam in the face with a sniper rifle from a mile away. However, the Syrian president was whisked out of the line of fire; Court and his Syrian interpreter Abdul escape from pursuing Russian forces, but they were captured by ISIS fighters. The next day, Court and Abdul, as well as other prisoners, were brought to a lake to be executed one by one by their captors. When it became his turn to be executed, Court manages to break free and then kills his executioners, while Abdul and the other prisoners disable their guards. Court and Abdul were then rescued by the Special Forces unit, who tell them that Azzam had died from his gunshot wound. Meanwhile, Jamal and Yasmin had been extracted into Jordan, where they were reunited with Medina. After Azzam's death, Shakira was forced into exile in Switzerland, helped by Drexler, who had escaped death when her husband was killed, and his employer bank. Months later, Voland tracks the two down and sends Court to assassinate them. He kills Shakira; however, Drexler manages to escape even though he was wounded. After the operation, Gentry returns to the CIA for a new one. == Characters == * Courtland ‚ÄúCourt‚Äù Gentry: The Gray Man, code name Violator ‚Äî freelance assassin * Ahmed al-Azzam: President of Syria * Jamal al-Azzam: Late father of Ahmed al-Azzam, former president of Syria * Shakira al-Azzam: First lady of Syria * Bianca Medina: Spanish fashion model, mistress of Ahmed al-Azzam * Dr. Tarek Halaby: Cardiac surgeon, co-director of the Free Syria Exile Union, husband of Rima Halaby * Dr. Rima Halaby: Cardiac surgeon, co-director of the Free Syria Exile Union, wife of Tarek Halaby * Vincent Voland: Former intelligence officer, DGSE, Directorate-General for External Security (French Foreign Intelligence Service), and DGSI, Directorate-General for Internal Security (French Domestic Intelligence Service) * Sebastian Drexler: (Code name: Eric) Swiss intelligence officer, employee of Meier Privatbank * Henri Sauvage: Captain, Police Judiciare, French National Police * Allard: Lieutenant, Police Judiciare, French National Police * Foss: Lieutenant, Police Judiciare, French National Police * Clement: Lieutenant, Police Judiciare, French National Police * Malik: Foreign Intelligence operative of GIS, General Intelligence Service, Syrian External Security Division * Lars Klossner: Owner of Klossner Welt Ausbildungs GMBH, security and private military contractor * Van Wyk: KWA, private military contractor/team leader * Saunders: KWA, private military contractor * Broz: KWA, private military contractor * Walid: Major in Desert Hawks Brigade (pro- regime Syrian militia) * Paul Boyer: Former French Foreign Legionnaire, private security officer * Robert ‚ÄúRobby‚Äù Anderson: Captain, U.S. Army 10th Special Forces Group * Stefan Meier: Vice president, Meier Privatbank * Jamal Medina: Infant son of Bianca Medina * Yasmin Samara: Nanny to Jamal Medina * Dr. Shawkat Saddiqi: Trauma surgeon, Syrian resistance sympathizer * Abdul Basset Rahal: Syrian resistance fighter with the Free Syrian Army * Matthew Hanley: Director, National Clandestine Service, Central Intelligence Agency == Development == The book had a working title of Weaponized, and was originally centered on Court Gentry trying to stop the transport of sarin gas into Syria. But Greaney said: ‚ÄúThat was already going on, and I just felt like by the time this book comes out, the Syrian government gassing their people was going to have been going on for years. Once I changed that, ‚ÄòWeaponized‚Äô no longer meant anything to the story.‚Äù The title Agent in Place was suggested by his editor Tom Colgan, who thought fit the story, since the term refers to an operative who has penetrated into an intelligence target, which is Gentry‚Äôs role in the novel. The author researched for the novel on location in Paris, France and did some research on the Syrian Civil War. Greaney points out that Agent in Place is different from previous Gray Man novels: ‚ÄúCourt‚Äôs motivations are different this time out. He has new allies and new enemies, and you‚Äôll meet some new characters you can expect to see in later installments.‚Äù He furthermore stated, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a spy novel and an action novel, but at its core, it‚Äôs a story about valor and vengeance, and the perseverance of the human spirit despite the horrors of war.‚Äù == Reception  Commercial === Agent in Place debuted at number 7 at the Combined Print & E-Book Fiction category of the New York Times bestseller list during the week of March 11, 2018, making it Greaney's second top 10 novel in the Gray Man series after Gunmetal Gray. It was also at number 10 at the Hardcover Fiction category of the same list, and also debuted at number 7 at the USA Today bestseller list during the week of March 1, 2018. === Critical === The book received positive reviews. In a starred review, Publishers Weekly praised it as a \\"can't miss\\", citing \\"Greaney‚Äôs steady escalation of the risks that Court faces, and the exceedingly clever ways he tackles them.\\" Kirkus Reviews stated that \\"Readers of the great Tom Clancy will salivate over this fast-moving and well-plotted yarn, which is part of a consistently appealing series in which each assignment is billed as the most dangerous ever.\\" In a featured review, prominent literary reviewer The Real Book Spy hailed its main character, Court Gentry, as \\"represent[ing] the future of the thriller genre\\", and remarked: \\"Greaney once again develops his character brilliantly as he continues to slowly break away from the pack as the apparent heir to the throne currently held by Brad Thor and Daniel Silva.\\" == References == Category:2018 American novels Category:American thriller novels ","title":"Agent in Place"},{"id":"56836889","text":"Jillian Armsbury was a singer, performer, songwriter and occasional activist, originally from Washington state.

The building material for the false spider is debris, carcasses of food and even their own shed old skin. The first such spider, originally found in the area of Tambopata river in Peru, is thought to belong to the genus Cyclosa. Later another species was found in a different region of the World, on Negros Island in Philippines. This spider makes a decoy object with \\"legs\\" spread from the body in all directions, while the Peruvian decoy has \\"legs\\" pointing towards the ground. Apparently, these two species, separated by more than 11,000 miles, evolved independently, indicating that making large sculptures of arachnids serves some role in luring prey for spiders or as a defence against predators. It was earlier shown that spider Cyclosa mulmeinensis, living in Orchid Island off the southeast coast of Taiwan makes life-size decoy copies of himself that are taken by predators instead. ==See also== Orb-weaving spider ==References== Category:Arachnids Category:Spiders ","title":"Decoy-building spider"},{"id":"56837069","text":"The Battle of Bronnitsy was part of the Ingrian War. == Prelude == After the Battle of Klushino, the Swedish troops located in Russia, called in 1609 by Vasily Shuisky, declared war on Russia and in 1611 occupied Novgorod land. The Siege of Tikhvin in 1613 was unsuccessful for the Swedes, and in spring of 1614, Tsar Michael Romanov sent an army to liberate occupied Novgorod. == Battle == In April 1614, the Russian army made camp near Bronnitsy in Novgorod Oblast, preparing for an offensive against Novgorod. The army consisted primarily of militiamen, marred by weak discipline and conflicts between noblemen and Cossacks. Swedish Governor of Novgorod Jacob De la Gardie decided to act quickly and on July 16, 1614, defeated the Russians in open battle. After that, the Swedes blockaded the Russian camp, where famine soon began. Dmitry Troubetskoy broke through the blockade and retreated to Torzhok, sustaining heavy losses. == Aftermath == As a result of the victory at Bronnitsy, the Swedes regained the military initiative in the Ingrian War and began the siege of Gdov, which guarded the road to Pskov from the north. == References == Bronnitsy Bronnitsy Bronnitsy Category:History of Novgorod Oblast Category:1610s in Sweden Category:1610s in Russia Category:Russia‚ÄìSweden military relations ","title":"Battle of Bronnitsy"},{"id":"56837071","text":"The Dakota Club Library in Eagle Butte, South Dakota, also known as the Eagle Butte Library, was built in 1910.

He retired in 1871 and died in 1873. Led by Anne Jellicoe and Corlett a committee of well to do Irish women established a Society for Promoting the Employment of Women on 19 August 1861. They then set up an employment registry for women. The main aim was to highlight the urgent need to provide training for women. The committee established classes in business related skills such as book-keeping, writing, dictating and arithmetic. Jellicoe gained funds through loans and an appeal which enabled them to create the Queen's Institute for the Training and Employment of Educated Women in 1863. Queen Victoria was its patron. In 1865 the name changed to ‚Äòthe Queen's Institute of Technical Schools‚Äô, due to continued expansion of its facilities and courses. This was the first technical college for women in either Ireland or Great Britain. It is believed to be the model for similar institutions in Austria. One difficulty the group faced was the negative connotations of being a working woman and losing the status of gentility. So the college provided classes in painting and decorative arts which was generally an appropriate study for a women. The Institute had annual exhibitions of the work and the ceramic painting gained the approval of distinguished visitors. Nobility and even royalty supported the Institute by buying the china which included designs for Belleek and Royal Worcester porcelain from 1870 on where some of the mentors were Herbert Cooper and W. H. Kerr. Corlett was the main person in charge of the Institute especially after Jellicoe left in 1866. The Institute is credited with unprecedented improvements in women's opportunities. The Royal Dublin Society allowed women to use their facilities including the use of the library and the ability to sit examinations for certificates like similar male students. When the civil service accepted women as telegraph operators in 1870 the Institute was officially given the responsibility for training the women for the new roles. Corlett published a paper on the successes of the Queen's Institute in June 1881 however by 1883 the building it was in was vacant and the Institute had ceased to operate. Corlett died after a protracted illness in 1891. Throughout her life Corbett had been a staunch supporter of women's suffrage and women's rights despite her conservative approach to gentility. ==References== Category:1820s births Category:1891 deaths Category:People from Dublin (city) Category:Suffrage ","title":"Barbara Corlett"},{"id":"56837106","text":"Canyon Creek is an unincorporated community and census-designated place (CDP) in Hood County, Texas, United States.

The film was released on July 19, 1940. ==Plot== Walter Norton a reporter for big city newspaper. When he is given the assignment to be the paper's war correspondent, he decides to stop off in his home town before leaving for Europe. While there, Archie Connor, who also works with his father in the local mine, tells Norton that the mine is unsafe. Norton is not sure there is anything he can do, but on the morning he is to leave for Europe, his father is injured in a blast in the mine. Norton postpones his departure, and disguised as a miner, enters the mine to see the conditions for himself. Understanding the dangerous conditions, he attempts to explain the dangers to the other miners and get them to rally to demand that the mine owner improve conditions. However, the workers are fearful that if they complain they will lose their jobs. Having failed to convince the miners, Norton is resolute on finding another way to improve the mine's safety. However, Connor decides to take matters into his own hands, and plans to rig an explosion in the mine to close the mine down and highlight the unsafe conditions. When Norton hears of the plan, he realizes this will play into the mine owner's hands, and runs to the mine to prevent Connor from carrying out the blast. As the two men struggle, the police arrive and arrest both of them. While in jail, Norton's sister Nina overhears her boss, Redman, bribing the mining inspector, Mathews, to overlook the mine's safety deficiencies. With the help of Linda Connor, Archie's daughter and Norton's high school girlfriend, they get Norton transferred from the jail to the hospital, where he escapes. Norton and his friend, Barney Tolliver, lure Mathews into the mine, where they threaten to bury him in an explosion unless he comes clean and admits to the bribery and the unsafe conditions. However, Redman learns of the plan, and he sends Johnson, along with several company thugs to stop Mathews from exposing them. Johnson decides that dead men tell no tells, and leaves Norton, Tolliver, and Mathews in the mine, intending to use Norton's explosives to bury the three men in the mine. What Johnson doesn't know is that Norton's explosives are simply a dummy charge, they were never meant to actually work, simply scare Mathews into confessing. Mathews, upset at the betrayal of Johnson, publicly confesses of the bribery of Redman and of the mine's unsafe working conditions. Redman is arrested and control of mine is taken over by local authorities, who immediately implement better safety measures, while Norton and Linda resume their childhood romance. ==Cast list== * Richard Arlen as Walter Norton * Andy Devine as Barney Tolliver * Kathryn Adams as Linda Connor * Paul Fix as Matthews * Mary Treen as Nina Norton * Cliff Clark as Mr. [Archie] Connor * Pat Flaherty as Johnson * Maude Allen as Mrs. Norton * James Norton as [Joseph] Stacey * Tom Chatterton as Dr. Lukas ==Production== The original screenplay for Black Diamonds, written by Sam Robin, was purchased by Universal in May 1940, and was originally meant to begin production in early April, and was originally scheduled for release on May 10, 1940.

Initially inspired by the stylized animals and plants used in medieval needlework, she became an outstanding designer who could transform depictions of wild flowers into simple but effective embroidery patterns. In 1980, she published the popular Danish Floral Charted Designs. ==Early life== Born on 6 February 1900 in the Copenhagen district of Frederiksberg, Gerda Johanna Bengtson was the daughter of two schoolteachers: Svend Otto Bengtsson (1871‚Äì1956) and Elise Marie Lassen (1873‚Äì1956). Showing an early interest in drawing, she was supported in her artistic ambitions by both her parents. After attending Frederiksberg Technical School, she studied painting at the Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts (1919‚Äì24) under Gotfred Rode, Sigurd Wandel and, during her final year, the sculptor Einar Utzon- Frank. Of particular importance was the instruction she received in textile art from Astrid Holm who introduced her to tapestry work. ==Career== Bengtsson later travelled to Paris on an extended study trip where she carefully studied the floral decorations on tapestries from the Middle Ages in the Mus√©e de Cluny. These served as an inspiration for her many colourful cross-stitch patterns representing wild flowers, herbs and other plants. Her early work also reflects the stitch-work techniques practised by Kristiane Konstantin- Hansen and Johanne Bindesb√∏ll. She soon moved from tapestry and weaving to the more straightforward cross-stitch approach, often basing her work on classical designs or the large tablecloths embroidered by the artist Else Johnsen (1898‚Äì1957). She was particularly adept at creating cross-stitch patterns for a wide range of applications, including tablecloths, bed covers, serviettes, tea cosies and bell pulls. Making use of her own colour-identification system, these easy-to-use patterns could be followed by women without special training. From 1939, Bengtsson taught at the Selskabet til Haandarbejdets Fremme establishment which also published her patterns. Lifelong collaboration followed. While she is remembered above all for her floral designs, she also produced other designs with figures and birds. Examples of her work can be seen in several Danish museums, especially the Danish Museum of Art & Design. Bengtsson was awarded a gold medal in 1951 at the Milan Triennial IX. Her patterns and publications have become popular not only in Denmark but in many other countries, especially the United States. They have been translated into several languages. Gerda Bengtsson died in Frederiksberg on 13 December 1995. She is buried in Helleb√¶k Cemetery. ==Publications== Bengtsson's publications in English include: *1972: Book of Danish stitchery *1973: Flower designs in cross-stitch *1977: U.S. State flowers in counted cross-stitch *1979: Herbs and medicinal plants in cross-stitch from the Danish Handcraft Guild *1980: Danish floral charted designs *1983: Dye plants and fruits in cross-stitch : from the Danish Handcraft Guild *1986: Roses and flowering branches in counted cross-stitch : from the Danish Handcraft Guild ==References== Category:1900 births Category:1995 deaths Category:Danish textile artists Category:Danish embroiderers Category:20th-century Danish artists Category:Artists from Copenhagen Category:20th-century Danish writers Category:Danish women writers Category:20th-century Danish women artists Category:Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts alumni Category:20th-century women writers Category:Women textile artists ","title":"Gerda Bengtsson"},{"id":"56837332","text":"The observatory was established in Juvisy-sur-Orge in 1883 by the French astronomer and author Camille Flammarion.

It had an estimated magnitude of 6.0 and a maximum felt intensity of VII-VIII on the Mercalli intensity scale. Based on contemporary reports of damage, the epicentre is thought to have been in the Straits of Dover. The earthquake caused widespread damage in south-eastern England and in the Low Countries. The earthquake interrupted a synod convened in part to examine the religious writings of John Wycliffe, which became known as the Earthquake Synod. ==Geology== The geological structure of the eastern part of the English Channel is dominated by the WNW-ESE trending boundary between rocks deformed by the Variscan orogeny and the more stable London-Brabant Massif, known as the Northern Variscan Thrust Front. The London-Brabant Massif has been the proposed location for several historical earthquakes, including the event in 1382. ==Earthquake== The magnitude for this event has been estimated using the distribution of felt intensities. Musson in 2008 gave a magnitude of 5.8 , while Camelbeek et al. 2007 gave 6.0 . The epicentral location has also been estimated from the distribution of felt intensities. A location in the middle of the Dover Straits, somewhat to the north-east of the similar 1580 Dover Straits earthquake is preferred. There were significant aftershocks on 23 May and on 24 May, the latter being the strongest recorded. The 24 May aftershock was also described as a \\"waterquake\\" affecting anchored ships. ==Damage== In England, the most severe damage was recorded in Canterbury, particularly to St Augustine's Abbey and Christ Church, Canterbury, where the bell-tower was destroyed. The manor house and church at Hollingbourne, Kent were also badly damaged. This has been used to estimate intensity in the range VII-VIII. In London there was damage to St Paul's Cathedral and Westminster Abbey with an estimated intensity of VI‚ÄìVII. In the Low Countries damage was reported from Ypres, Bruges, Liege and Ghent. There is no record of casualties associated with this event. ==Earthquake synod== William Courtenay, the Archbishop of Canterbury convened a synod that met in Blackfriars, in London on the day of the earthquake. The synod was intended to consider the challenges to the church by the group of thinkers that became known as the Lollards, particularly the writings of John Wycliffe. During the deliberations the monastery was shaken by the earthquake, but Courtenay turned it to his advantage saying: The court found ten of Wycliffe's propositions to be heretical and another six erroneous, allowing Lollards to be prosecuted and executed. ==References== Category:1382 in England Category:Earthquakes in the United Kingdom Category:14th-century earthquakes ","title":"1382 Dover Straits earthquake"},{"id":"56837410","text":"Forgotton Anne is an indie adventure-platformer video game developed by ThroughLine Games and published by Square Enix Collective.

Prior to working at the Willard, where he started in 1986 upon the hotel's reopening, he worked at the Buxton Inn in Ohio. Hewes has served drinks to numerous United States presidents, including Ronald Reagan, George Bush and George W. Bush, and Gerald Ford. He never served a sitting president, but only presidents before they entered or after they left office. Hewes' favorite president to serve was Ford, who he called \\"very down to earth and funny.\\" He served Ford prior to entering the presidential office and prior to Ford becoming sober in support of his wife, Betty Ford. Gerald Ford used to drink Scotch or Budweiser. Other famous people Hewes has poured drinks for include Pel√©, George Clooney, Harry Connick, Jr. and Johnny Depp. In 1987, Hewes witnessed Bob Fosse have a heart attack outside of the Round Robin, which killed the dancer and choreographer. Hewes offers history programs at the Willard about craft cocktails, prohibition and other related subjects, specifically historical subjects pertaining to Washington. A collector of Washington and cocktail history ephemera, Hewes owns a Mint Julep recipe handwritten by Henry Clay. ===Cocktails=== The \\"Jingle Bell Julep\\" is a holiday twist on the mint julep. An original recipe by Jim Hewes, it uses a berry-based maceration rather than traditional mint. Hewes oversees the bar's cocktail program, which includes creating new thematic cocktails and reintroducing classic cocktails. He aims to create cocktails that guests can make easily at home. Hewes makes classic cocktails that reflect history and the cocktail's original recipe. He opposes the use of what he calls \\"secret ingredients\\" to craft cocktails. In a 2016 interview with Vice Hewes shared that \\"the key to a correct cocktail is the final taste.\\" His favorite drinks to make include the Old Fashioned, Sidecar, and Mint Julep, the latter which Henry Clay introduced to the bar. It remains the Round Robin's signature drink. During the holidays, Hewes offers thematic cocktails, which have included hot spiced cider, hot buttered rum, and a Jingle Bell Julep, a variation on a mint julep with red and green spirits used to symbolize the holiday season. Other cocktails he has created for the holidays include the Poinsettia, which comprises Champagne, framboise and cranberry. In 2013, Hewes created a cocktail program by creating a cocktail for all 44 presidents, based on cocktails that presidents have historically consumed or that are thematic to a president's life. Presidential beverages include Madeira wine, which George Washington used to drink, hot buttered rum in honor of John Quincy Adams, and a twist on the Blue Hawaii, which uses tequila rather than rum, as a tribute to Barack Obama, which honors Obama's life in Hawaii. He introduces the menu, for a limited time only, during every presidential inauguration season. ==Personal life== Hewes has lived in Washington DC since 1977.

Its clock mechanism still rings every hour with a respective number of bell rings based on the current hour. It was constructed in 1866. ==History== A view of the clock tower The clock tower was built while Bulgaria was still under Ottoman rule by the master Vuno Markov from Vrachesh as a part of large-scale construction in 1866 on the occasion of the announcement of the village Samundjievo as town and district center by proposal of Midhat Pasha. The clock mechanism was made by the local ironmonger Gencho Nakov, and the bell ‚Äì by master Lazar Dimitrov from Bansko. Initially, there was a little wooden house on the top of the tower. A Turkish figurine with a fez on its head would get out and bow every time the bells announced the hour. After the Liberation of Bulgaria in 1878 the local people took down and burned the Turkish symbol. In 1924 a chitalishte (community center) was built next to the tower. Half a century later, according to restoration plans of the tower, the chitalishte was removed, and a Douglas Fir (g. Pseudotsuga) was planted next to the tower. The height of the tree eventually almost reached the height of the tower. It became a valuable tree for the city and it is decorated for Christmas every year. However, the tall tree is located very close to the tower, and some specialists suggest its roots may threaten the symbol of the town. In its century-long history, the architecture monument has undergone many conservation and restoration efforts, as well as artistic activities to keep its original style and appearance. The clock tower is one of the 100 Tourist Sites of Bulgaria. The stamp for this object is in the Botevgrad History Museum. ==Description== A night view of the clock tower The clock tower is one of the few architectural monuments in the municipality of Botevgrad that date from the Bulgarian National Revival. It is located in the very center of the town. ===Architecture=== The tower consists of three proportional sections with the total height of 30 m, which makes it the tallest clock tower in Bulgaria. Distinctive features are its baroque elements and frescoes decorating the corrugated cornices. It contains similar architectural elements to those of the Plovdiv and Koprivshtitsa houses of the National Revival period, and a pointed cube reminiscent of the forms of Islamic architecture. It is decorated with blue frescoes. The building materials included stones from a quarry near the village of Bozhenitsa and timber from the Vrachesh area. The lower section of the tower is square, reaching a height of 11 m. It has stone masonry with a door, which leads inside for servicing and winding the clock mechanism. The middle section is narrowed and its edges are outlined by half-columns, ending with cornices, and the walls are slightly wave-shaped, which adds elegance to the building. The upper section rises over the cornice and the cornice narrows even further. It has a hexagonal shape and houses the clock and the bell. In 1870 a weather- cock was placed on its very top. From the entrance of the tower to its last section, there are spiral-shaped wooden stairs, which lead to the clock mechanism. ===Clock mechanism=== The original clock mechanism is made by Gencho Nakov ‚ÄúKantardjiata‚Äù and is exhibited in the Botevgrad History Museum. The new one is made by masters of the Etar Architectural-Ethnographic Complex and still counts the hours by bell rings with bell ringing audible within a radius of 3 km. ==Gallery== File:Botevgrad Clock tower interior 04.JPGThe working clockwork.

L. Lucas. It tells the story of Theseus and Ariadne, with details drawn from various sources and original touches based on modern psychology. It was Lucas's longest poem. His other epic reworking of myth was Gilgamesh, King of Erech (1948).Lucas, F. L., Gilgamesh, King of Erech, Golden Cockerel Press (1948). == Summary  Book I === Athens assembles to hear news that the serial killers on the south road have been killed by an unknown traveller, acting alone. In old Aegeus's kingdom, dominated by the King's ambitious nephew Agrion, a reward is offered for the wanderer's head. Eyewitnesses give accounts. One unmasks a hooded youth in the crowd as the perpetrator. The youth identifies himself as the King's lost son, Theseus. Agrion, who has suborned the guard, attempts a coup. Theseus appeals to the people, who drive Agrion out. The same day, the Cretan ambassador, who has come for the Athenian tribute, demands satisfaction. Lots are drawn for seven youths and seven maidens to be sent to Crete (Lucas makes this a once-every- nine-years event). Queen Medea and her young son arrive to welcome Theseus. Her plot to poison him fails and her husband banishes her. Aegeus tells Theseus the story of his love for and betrayal of Aethra, Theseus's mother, and urges his son to value true love when he finds it. Theseus, resenting the Cretan yoke, takes the place of one of the doomed youths. Next morning the two ships sail for Crete. One of the maidens sings a farewell lament to Athens, voicing sorrow that she will die without ever having been loved. === Book II === The ships stop for the night at an uninhabited islet. Around the campfire, Euaemon, the Greek ship's master, pitying the young, tries to distract them with travellers' tales; but Aegle, the girl who sang the lament, demands to be told the truth about what lies in store. Euaemon tells the little he knows, including the usual story, that the monster in the Labyrinth is the offspring of Pasipha√´, Queen to Minos, by a bull-god. The young people pair off for the night, Theseus choosing Aegle, who has impressed him by her courage and grace. They become lovers (Theseus had already seduced the pine-bender's young daughter on the way to Athens.) At dawn the south wind prevents departure; the party spend three days on the isle, during which time Theseus and Aegle are happy together. Reaching Crete, the Athenians, wondering at the primitive bull-totems, are led before King Minos and Queen Pasipha√´ in Knossos. When Theseus's plea for clemency is brushed aside, Aegle reveals Theseus's identity, in the hope of saving his life ‚Äì to no avail. Theseus wrenches a spear from a guard and has Minos at his mercy, but one of the King's daughters, the beautiful Ariadne, intervenes daringly to save her father, and Theseus is disarmed. As he is led out Theseus praises Ariadne for her courage, loyalty and beauty, adding: \\"May God give you, / One day, a lover as brave and fair and true!\\" Pasipha√´ smiles darkly, having already divined the attraction between Theseus and Ariadne. === Book III === In her chamber that night Ariadne thinks about Theseus ‚Äì and about the sort of husband her father is likely to choose for her. Her brilliant little sister Phaedra, who witnessed events in court and who is also smitten by Theseus, urges her to seek help from Daedalus, who built the Labyrinth. Daedalus, a Greek exile, has long loved Ariadne in silence, this fair-haired daughter of Minos by a Thracian captive-woman of royal blood. In the small hours Ariadne calls on Daedalus, who hints sadly that he has guessed the secret of the Minotaur. Ariadne doesn't want to know. She accepts his plan and bluffs her way into Theseus' cell, where she files his chain and hands over file, spool and dagger. \\"I half hate this land of weasel priests,\\" she tells Theseus in the course of a passionate exchange.Lucas, F. L., Ariadne (Cambridge University Press, 1932), p. 98. An escape plan is agreed, should Theseus survive. Next day, while the captives toil their way up Mount Juktas (Lucas places the Labyrinth in a cave- complex on Juktas), Ariadne uses Phaedra to pass a message to Euaemon, to delay his departure and watch for a signal. That night the signal is seen by Ariadne; she parts tearfully from Phaedra, and arrives on the beach in time to see the survivors of the Labyrinth staggering down from the hills. The ship slips away. === Book IV === On board, while the exhausted survivors sleep, Theseus tells Ariadne of the night's events: how the Athenian maidens were bathed and perfumed by African eunuchs and dressed as brides; how the captives were led into the cave, down mazy passages and dim chambers, each with statues of the Cretan snake-goddess; how the last chamber contained the horror: the Minotaur on a throne, before a flower-strewn bed, surrounded by the dead; how the priests and guards bound the Athenians with thongs and left. Theseus cut his thongs and freed his companion, Euthycles. The Minotaur, seeing the danger, seized a long sword to hold off the unarmed Greeks while it made to escape. Euthycles sprang at it and was killed, allowing Theseus time to crush the creature with its throne. They discover that the Minotaur was King Minos himself in a bull-mask. Hearing this, the horrified Ariadne thinks of the golden tress she left on her father's pillow, as a loving token of farewell. She absolves Theseus of blood-guilt. The ship beaches for the night on Naxos. Aegle watches Theseus sadly, then goes off alone. Theseus finds her, blames Aphrodite for sending him a new love, and offers her a dowry. Aegle is devastated. That night Theseus and Ariadne become lovers. He promises to make her Queen of Athens. At dawn Aegle's body is discovered. She has stabbed herself. Ariadne learns of Theseus's earlier love for Aegle, and decides to leave him. The single love based on ecstasy is what she wants (and which she later seeks in Dionysus). Too late, Theseus recognises that Aegle was his one true love. Approaching Phalerum he forgets to raise the signal white sail, Aegeus commits suicide, and the hero's homecoming is joyless. == Verse form == The poem is in 'open' heroic couplets, with many run-on lines, the underlying iambic pentameter being varied by counterpoint and occasional trochaic lines. Other devices include a varying caesura and occasional hexameters and terminal triplets. Aegeus in Book I:‚Äì :\\"How strange, how strange the thing that is done and gone, :Past God's own power to undo; past man's wit, :When he looks back, himself to fathom it ! :For I loved Aethra. ‚Äì O learn this, my son, :This lesson I can teach, the only one ‚Äì :I have paid to learn it. Think not true love grows :Through all the world, as the wild poppy blows :Red on a thousand fields, a thousand hills. :Youth thinks it so ‚Äì to find just as it wills :The red bloom of desire in every lane, :Easy to pluck, to drop, to find again. :Youth does not know.\\" The old man smiled to see :His son's eyes dreamy now with memory; :With memory of the Isthmus ‚Äì that grim glen :Where he had slain the Pine-bender ‚Äì and then :A rustle in the thicket, two brown eyes :Like a scared fawn's, and sweet low piteous cries, :As he dragged forth his quarry, a slim maid :Shy as a Dryad in a woodland glade, :Trembling and sobbing for her father's fate. :Sweet that had been, so sweet, as night grew late...Lucas, F. L., Ariadne (Cambridge University Press, 1932), p. 28-29. == Background and publication== The Deeds of Theseus, Attic red-figured kylix, c.440‚Äì430 BC (from Vulci); British Museum Ariadne was published by the Cambridge University Press and by the Macmillan Company, New York, in November 1932, in a limited edition of 500 copies. The Theseus and Minotaur device on the upper board (Theseus dragging the dead Minotaur into the light), and the Deeds of Theseus illustration on the title-page and dust-cover, were taken from the well-known Attic red-figured kylix, c.440‚Äì430 BC (from Vulci), in the British Museum. The University Press continued to use the Theseus and Minotaur device on the front of Lucas's books in the 1930s (and their postwar reprints). The poem was dedicated to Lucas's fianc√©e, the 21-year-old Girton Classics graduate Prudence Wilkinson (1911‚Äì1944), whom Lucas married in December 1932. It includes a serious-playful dedicatory love-poem to her, divided into Prologue and Epilogue. \\"The wild Greek hills,\\" Lucas notes in the former, :And war, and death, and that worse pain that kills :Love in two hearts gown bitter ‚Äì these I know: :They were little changed three thousand years ago.Lucas, F. L., Ariadne (Cambridge University Press, 1932), p. ix. The poem's emphasis on 'true love', on shared values of courage and loyalty, may be seen as its primary theme. The realistic, psychological interpretation of the Minotaur story reflects Lucas's interest in the discoveries of modern psychology.Lucas, F. L., The Decline and Fall of the Romantic Ideal (Cambridge, 1936). The contrast between light-loving Athens and benighted Minoan Crete, hag-ridden with religion, reflects another authorial preference.

Lucas, read by Nesta Sawyer, 6 Sept. 1934: genome.ch.bbc.co.uk Ariadne was reprinted by the Cambridge University Press in May 2014.Ariadne, by Frank Laurence Lucas, Cambridge University Press, 2014 . == Reception == Ariadne was, in the main, well received. \\"An exception to the generalisation that all modern epics are tedious,\\" declared The Cambridge Review. \\"Its plot is a model of epic construction in its compactness, directness and speed.\\" Julian Bell, review of Ariadne in The Cambridge Review, 10 February 1933. \\"The poetry is skilful,\\" wrote the journal Books. \\"The parts concerning the lovers sometimes rise to a fine lyric passion.\\" Review of Ariadne in Books, p. 13, 26 March 1933. R. P. Blackmur singled out as forceful \\"the six-page passage [near the end] where Theseus, as a philanderer with good intentions, argues with Ariadne, who defends with resigned eloquence the ecstatic and single love\\".R. P. Blackmur, review of Ariadne in Poetry journal, vol. 42, May 1933, p. 115-116. The Times Literary Supplement praised \\"the frequent grace of description. Lucas has studied the natural touch in every scene and every colloquy, giving to images of primitive force a modern psychological dress\\".The Times Literary Supplement, 2 February 1933, p. 72. William Plomer in The Spectator found the poem \\"better than many a modern novel. It is even in texture, agreeably and skilfully phrased, calls for no great intellectual effort, and would surely have pleased William Morris\\" (a reference to Morris's Jason). \\"But it makes no new music; never surprises by a fine excess.\\" William Plomer in The Spectator, 6 January 1933. The poem was reviewed by Lucas's former tutee, Julian Bell, in the New Statesman and Nation. \\"The story is constructed with classic dexterity and neatness,\\" Bell wrote, \\"and both story and verse have a breath-taking rapidity that is wholly admirable.\\" He regretted, however, that Lucas had not used language in the modernist way, with obliqueness and ambiguity.Julian Bell, review of Ariadne in the New Statesman and Nation, 11 February 1933. The Listener did not share this regret: \\"While preserving the great metrical tradition,\\" its reviewer wrote, \\"Ariadne is a continuous refreshment of it, and is free at once of archaic pedantries and modernist affectations.\\" Review of Ariadne in The Listerner, quoted in Life and Letters, March‚ÄìMay 1933, p. 121. More recently, Simon Tidworth in The Quest for Theseus (1970) believed that making the Minotaur Minos in a bull-mask was \\"a real stroke of originality\\", but, comparing the two works, preferred Nikos Kazantzakis' drama ŒöŒøœçœÅŒøœÇ, ŒÆ ŒòŒ∑œÉŒ≠Œ±œÇ (Kouros, or Theseus ) (1949), as (in his view) richer in symbolism.Tidworth, Simon, The Quest for Theseus, ed.

The company was initially focused on providing college athletes with help to improve their social media visibility prior to turning pro. As Hurrdat Social Media grew, Kunalic and Lawrence recognized a growing need for businesses in Lincoln to improve their own online presence, which led to expanding the client roster to managing and expanding the social media profiles for local businesses and non-profits, in addition to athletes. ===Opendorse & B2 Interactive=== In March 2013 Hurrdat Social Media decided to split operations into two. Hurrdat Social Media continued in its original format and remained focused on helping businesses grow online through social media marketing, but it would leave the athlete endorsement portion of its business to a newly formed spinoff, opendorse. Kunalic stayed on at Hurrdat Social Media, managing day-to-day operations of the company's social media marketing campaigns with local, regional, and national clients, while Lawrence left to focus full-time on building opendorse. In August 2014, just over a year after the launch of Opendorse, Hurrdat Social Media was acquired by Omaha, Nebraska based digital marketing company, B2 Interactive, which was co- founded by Bill Hipsher and Brandon Taylor. ===2015 - Today=== In 2015, Kunalic's role in the day-to-day operations of Hurrdat Social Media ended as he joined Opendorse full-time. Kunalic and Lawrence continued as Hurrdat Social Media Board Members. In 2017, Hurrdat Social Media announced a new strategic partnership with Hail Varsity, a leading media company based in Lincoln that's devoted to creating and sharing Husker focused content. ==Hurrdat Films== In 2016, Hurrdat Social Media launched a Digital Film and Video brand, Hurrdat Films, after parent-company B2 Interactive's acquisition of Dan Napoli's film and video production company Disconnected Media, which was founded in 2010. == Resources == Category:Companies based in Lincoln, Nebraska Category:2010 establishments in Nebraska Category:Companies based in Omaha, Nebraska ","title":"Hurrdat Social Media"},{"id":"56837671","text":"Stella is a surname meaning star.

By incorporating data protection regulations and the explicit consent of the users, the public administration is allowed to re-use and exchange the data with each other. The once-only principle is part of the European Union's (EU) plans to further develop the Digital Single Market by reducing the administrative burden on citizens and businesses. == Description == The application of the once-only principle to public administrations in all EU Member States aims to reduce administrative burdens. This objective was endorsed by EU ministers in the Ministerial Declaration on eGovernment in 2009. The EU-wide application of once-only is also one of the pillars of the strategy for the Digital Single Market and one of the basic principles of the EU eGovernment Action Plan 2016-2020. The once-only principle is defined differently in the individual EU Member States. In some countries it refers to data storage, which means storing the collected data in a single database. In other countries, once-only refers to data collection and specifies that data may be transmitted only once to public administrations, but that multiple data repositories are possible. Other countries combine both approaches and require that the data must be collected only once and stored in a single database. == Government-Centric vs Citizen-Centric Once-Only == Critical to the discussion of Once-Only is WHO is doing the sharing and using which Identity? There are two opposing approaches; the Government-centric and the Citizen-centric - both of which technically implement Once-Only. In the Government-centric model, the citizen use the same or easily linkable identifiers across applications, borders and databases. In this case, data control is centralized leading to systemic profiling and accumulation of risks. Proponents - mainly government bureaucracy - of this model claim it to be more efficient. In the Citizen-centric model, the citizen do NOT use the same or linkable identifiers, but instead a variant of Privacy/Security by Design such as according to e.g. EU Digital Signature Regulation article 5.2 on pseudonymous signatures and Identity. Applying this principle the citizen can have non-linkable but fully functional and legal identities that are not linkable even within the same application in the same database in the same memberstate. In this model control is decentralized and the citizen act as data broker. Proponents ‚Äì mainly citizen-rights experts and activists (e.g. EDRI), legal experts, security experts and economists ‚Äì of this model claim it to be more effective and secure as it prevents classical Command & Control failures ensuring systems adapt to citizens choice and drastically reduce security risks. In addition to the technical and economic issues, there is a real concern that Government-Centric model similar to Data Retention will prove incompatible with GDPR and Human Rights article 8 as it requires government profiling citizen in order to detect attempted requests for data already collected for another purpose. This problem would not arise in Privacy by Design based Citizen-Centric Once-Only models. Citizen-centric models are under implementation in Denmark in a model named CitizenKey. == Benefits == The once-only principle can help to reduce administrative burdens in the EU Member States, as exchanging information that has already been collected is cheaper and less burdensome than collecting and storing it repeatedly. Furthermore, some experts believe that data protection concerns can be better taken into account. Process optimization and potentially higher administrative efficiency are described as main advantages of once-only for public administrations. These include fewer calls to customer service centers, fewer paper-based applications, faster processing of administrative processes, time savings due to reduced data capture requirements and fewer data errors due to data reuse. This could save costs for public administrations and improve the quality of various public services. Cross-border implementation of the principle could also help to ensure equal treatment for domestic and foreign persons and companies in the use of public services, for which they are obliged to provide information to public authorities. Better public value creation could, on the overall level, improve the legitimacy, transparency and accountability of public administrations. == Barriers == According to a study carried out on behalf of the European Commission, once-only encounters technical, organisational, semantic, and legal obstacles to implementation throughout the EU. On the technical side, there is a lack of a comprehensive and secure data exchange solution, interoperable catalogs and IT systems as well as a lack of infrastructure for a secure and data protection-compliant exchange. In addition, other barriers are organisational in nature. The study includes the lack of clear political guidance, the high implementation costs and the lack of administrative willingness to cooperate and exchange data. As far as semantic aspects are concerned, the challenge lies in the lack of or over-distributed registers and the insufficient interoperability of existing registers and data. In addition, barriers exist due to different standards, taxonomies, data models and data quality. Legal obstacles include the heterogeneity of national legal frameworks, data protection and respect for privacy. These aspects prevent a fast and far-reaching implementation of the once-only principle at European level. == Criticism and public reception == The European Data Protection Supervisor (EDPS), Giovanni Buttarelli, welcomed the EU-initiative, but claimed additional clarity on important data protection principles. In particular, the proposal should not provide a legal basis for the exchange of information for purposes other than those mentioned therein. Furthermore, it should not restrict the principle of purpose limitation laid down in the General Data Protection Regulation. The EDPS also asks for clarification of a number of questions relating to the practical implementation of user control. The advocacy group European Digital Rights (EDRi) pointed out, that a once-only implementation needs to follow privacy by design and privacy by default, to be citizen-friendly and user-oriented. A representative survey on e-government in Germany, Austria and Switzerland in 2017 showed that the majority of the population in each country is rather skeptical. A national once-only implementation received less than 50% support in all countries, a Europe-wide once-only implementation received less than 20%. == Implementation of the once-only principle (national) == By 2014, 25 European countries had begun to implement once-only to a certain extent and 13 countries had legislation supporting the implementation of the principle for businesses and individuals. However, implementation is still fragmented across the EU and once-only cross-border applications are still limited to a few services and cases. The most advanced once-only infrastructures exist in Belgium, Estonia and the Netherlands, which have national legislation and enforce its implementation. === Estonia === In Estonia, once-only is used in most administrative procedures. Several essential prerequisites, including legal, administrative and technical requirements, have been fulfilled. Since 2007, the Public Information Act prohibits the creation of separate databases for the collection of the same data. Also, the General Part of the Economic Activities Code Act states that economic administrative authorities are prohibited to require companies to provide information that is already entered in a public database. The prohibition also applies to information which can be obtained from the relevant register of another Contracting State. In the health sector in Estonia, the once-only principle is already being used in the electronic health record. Since 2008, health data has been managed via a central database. Specialists can document analyses, diagnoses, test results and treatment procedures. After a transfer to a hospital, for example, the patient data can be retrieved from the database without the patient having to enter the data again. In emergency situations, an electronic first aid card can be generated in the ambulance after identification of the patient, which provides vital data to the first responders. Patients can access the database via a (mobile) ID card and manage their data independently and give their consent/rejection to the data exchange. === Netherlands === In the Netherlands, the once-only principle is applied in several areas. The Stelsel van Basisregistraties (Basic Registries System) was founded in 2003 and comprises 12 basic registries containing general information on companies and individuals, such as company names, personal addresses, cadastral information, income and registration information for motor vehicles. This enables businesses and citizens to provide this data only once. The system includes both open and closed registers where information is only accessible to those who need it for their work. Regarding the once-only principle for private individuals, the Dutch tax office (Belastingdienst) introduced the prefilled tax returns in 2014 and made them standard in 2016. Because tax data from different databases is automatically merged and added to tax forms, users don't have to manually fill in tax forms. Once-only is also used in the Elektronisch Pati√´nten Dossier (EPD, Electronic Patient Dossier. It enables caregivers to ask other service providers for patient information via a national exchange office. Access to information is only possible if patients have given their prior consent. Patients can view their medical records online (authentication takes place via eID) and allow access to the care providers. Critics in the Netherlands see the risk of abuse and invasion of privacy in the event of burglary of the system by crackers. In that case, very sensitive medical information can be exposed. Such information is highly sensitive to privacy and can cause major harm to victims. === Belgium === Belgium adopted its own law on once-only in 2014. The law requires the federal government's public administrations to retrieve all available data from official registers with a unique identification feature instead of asking citizens and companies to make this data available more than once. The implementation of the law is facilitated by the system of basic registers and the eID system, which provides each data holder with a unique identification feature. This will allow public administrations to exchange data and give individuals and businesses access to public electronic services. The system also enables citizens to know at any time which organisation has accessed their data. In the area of business services, a number of common transactions (e. g. registration of company name and address, withholding tax and social security contributions from wages) can be carried out online using pre-entered forms. The administrative burden of setting up a business is also considered low due to the extensive re-use of data from public sector databases. In the Belgium region Flanders, the once-only principle (known as the \\"vraag niet wat je al weet\\" principle) was adopted as part of the Flemish e-government decree of July 18th 2008. The decree requires that the Flemish public administrations retrieve the data required for their government processes from authentic data sources, when available, and gives citizens the possibility to complain if he or she is asked for data which is already available in such an authentic data source. The MAGDA platform (Maximum Data Sharing between Agencies) is a once- only principle implementation supporting electronic delivery of public services, at the federal, regional, and local levels of the government. The platform enables the reuse and sharing of citizens‚Äô and companies‚Äô data between the Flemish government authorities (190 agencies and 13 departments). The platform allows citizens and businesses to enter or update their data only once, from a single point of access, to be used by all public authorities. The exchange and reuse of existing data between government agencies through the MAGDA platform is performed using the national eID; accordingly, the once-only data collection relies on the eID card as well. Different public services, especially the application for benefits, can be performed online, without providing personal information or performing any further paperwork. All required data is transferred automatically, since MAGDA retrieves the required data from the national registry of natural persons after the citizen has been identified through his or her eID card. === Austria === Austria has set itself the goal of advancing once-only integration in the field of eGovernment services in the coming years. In some cases, the principle has already been applied, e. g. in the case of the Austrian electronic health record (ELGA) or the Austrian FinanzOnline service. A prominent example is the case of family allowances in Austria. After the birth of the child, the authorities will be asked whether a legal claim exists without a request. The competent registry office collects all relevant data on the child and the personal status data of the parents in the Central Register of Civil Statuses (CPR), operated by the Federal Ministry of the Interior. These data are transmitted by the Federal Ministry of the Interior to the tax authorities. The tax authorities are now examining whether all the conditions for granting family allowances are met. If this is the case, the parents are informed and the money is automatically transferred to the account. Up to six authorities had to be consulted by May 2015. As a rule, citizens no longer have to produce any evidence at all and receive support without submitting an application. In addition, the birth certificate and other documents can be requested in some hospitals (e. g. in Vienna) through a branch office of the registry office (so-called' baby points'). This avoids further visits to the authorities. === Portugal === Slowly, the national administration is adopting the once-only principle. For the moment (2018), the most visible effort is on the annual tax form for individuals, which is now mostly pre-filled for everybody, using data existent on several different national offices. In thousands of cases, the form is even defined as complete, without the need for those citizens to do anything else other than confirming it in the system. This allows a speedy processing of taxes, to the point of reimbursements being made in a matter of weeks. === Denmark === Denmark has for many years been pursuing the Government-centric Once-Only model with significant focus on central sharing and citizen profiling. Benefits of this model was mainly achieved in the 1980s and early 1990s. Since then accumulating problems with trust, security and effectiveness of public sector models has led to search for New Digital Security Models addressing and solving these issues through extending or replacing models with Citizen-Centric Once-Only These models would involve introducing a two-layer National Identity and Digital Signature Scheme implementing support for eIDAS article 5.2 as purpose-specific identity and data sharing which will be tested in Denmark preparing for an EU-wide roll-out. === Spain === In Spain, once- only is first mentioned in 1992. The Law 30/1992 of 26 November, on Public Administrations and the Common Administrative Procedure recognized the citizens‚Äô right to non-provide documents already in hands of the acting Administration. Fifteen years later, the Law 11/2007 of 22 June, on Citizens‚Äô Electronic Access to Public Services, extended this right to documents and data in hands of any Public Administration body. Then, the Law 39/2015 of October 1, of the Common Administrative Procedure of the Public Administrations complemented this right with a public administrations' obligation to verify and obtain data in hands of any public body with the citizen consent. Along these years, the implementation of the once-only principle in Spain has been undertaken with sectorial and general domain initiatives. For instance, the Spanish Tax Agency started providing prefilled tax declarations to citizens in 2003, and the interoperable electronic prescription was launched in 2015 to allow buying medication in the whole country regardless of the administration that issued the prescription. A general purpose implementation of the once-only is the national Data Intermediation Platform (DIP), as a result of a collaboration effort involving the whole Spanish public sector. The DIP was launched in 2007 by the Spanish Government to publish and consume services for electronic data interchange with the aim to grow and to be re-used by all Administrations. Using the DIP with the SCSP protocol, public bodies in charge of administrative procedures can automatically check the required information without document submission by the citizens. The SCSP protocol is aimed to substitute paper certificates by electronic data exchanges and it defines a common structure for the messages and a governance model that considers four roles as result of two dimensions: data consumer/provider and business/technical actor. The Citizen's Folder is an online site where a citizen can access and see her/his data exchanges though the DIP. Since 2007, the number of data enquiry and verification services provided by the DIP has been growing dramatically, reaching almost 81 million of data transmissions in 2018 with 1191 public bodies involved (65 national bodies, 47 regional bodies, 11 institutional agencies, 1045 municipalities and 22 universities). == Implementation of the once-only principle (cross-border)  e-SENS === The aim of e-SENS is to enable digital, cross-border management through generic and reusable technical components in the European Union. This project focused on technical solutions such as eID, e-documents and electronic signatures. As part of the Citizen Lifecycle area of e-SENS, Sweden has been testing a new online service since 2016, providing third country students access to academic programmes at Stockholm University. The pilot project uses eID to identify and register, using a federal cross-border authentication tool supported by e-SENS, a large- scale EU initiative. The pilot project, which is run by the University of Stockholm, enables foreign students to study Swedish courses at the same level as students on campus, including secure submission of signed assignments, individual teacher feedback online and participation in examinations. The system uses an extended version of the online learning platform Moodle. === Nordic Institute for Interoperability Solutions === Nordic Institute for Interoperability Solutions (NIIS) is a non-profit association founded by Estonia and Finland in June 2017. Iceland joined NIIS as a partner in September 2018. The mission of the institute is to develop e-governance solutions and its first product is X-Road data exchange layer. X-Road is used nationwide in the Suomi.fi Data Exchange Layer service () in Finland and in the Estonian data exchange layer X-tee. Public sector organisations in both countries are legally obliged to use the national data exchange layer services. In addition, private companies are allowed to use the services in both countries. X-tee and Suomi.fi Data Exchange Layer are technically connected to one another which enables easy and secure cross-border data exchange between Estonia and Finland. === eManifest === The eManifest pilot project was launched in 2016 to test the implementation of the once-only principle for maritime data in cooperation between DG MOVE, DG TAXUD, the European Maritime Safety Agency (EMSA) and representatives of maritime and customs authorities from 13 EU Member States and industry associations. The aim of the project is to test procedures that would simplify reporting formalities for maritime transport and facilitate the implementation of Directive 2010/65/EC on reporting formalities. The pilot project aims to ensure that data elements transmitted by maritime operators can be reported once only through a single transmission to the national or EU-wide maritime Single Window. Subsequently, they will be distributed to the competent national authorities. === Business Registers Interconnection System === The BRIS (Business Registers Interconnection System) is an initiative at EU level that provides a cross-border cooperation platform for European business registers and acts as a single point of access for the European e-Justice portal. It provides a service through which citizens, businesses and public administrations can access information on companies and their branches established in other Member States in accordance with Directive 2017/17/EC. BRIS provides an interface/search function for accessing enterprise data at EU level. It is designed to reduce the administrative burden on businesses in meeting cross-border obligations and to increase the legal certainty and efficiency of procedures carried out by public administrations. === X-trans.eu === X-trans.eu was a cross-border pilot project between the Free State of Bavaria and Upper Austria with the aim of developing a faster procedure for the application and approval of cross-border large-capacity transports. Due to the different application forms and procedures for obtaining heavy goods transport permits in different countries, the aim of the pilot project was to create a central system that would save companies from submitting multiple applications for the same transport to different local authorities. The central approval portal x-trans.eu enabled the applicants to make their data available only once for the respective transport. The information collected was then forwarded to the appropriate authorities in each country, based on the application requirements in each country. The portal was based on a common data model that contained all the information required for approval. Rules could then be formulated to describe the information and application formats required in the individual countries. This made the system completely scalable for every European country. During the pilot phase, the data exchange between Austria and Germany was successfully tested. == Once-only research projects  The Once-Only Principle Project (TOOP) === The Once-Only Principle Project (TOOP) is a large-scale cross-border pilot initiative supported by the Horizon 2020 framework programme, which examines the feasibility of the once-only principle at cross-border level. TOOP takes a specific approach to the once- only principle by focusing on information about companies (i. e. without data on individual citizens) and the cross-border exchange of this information. The project aims to contribute to a future in which companies have to pass on certain standard information to a national or supranational public administration only once, and this information can be shared and reused by public authorities in compliance with legal requirements and constraints. === Stakeholder Community of the Once-Only Principle For Citizens (SCOOP4C) === Stakeholder Community of the Once-Only Principle For Citizens (SCOOP4C) is an EU coordination and support action supported by the Horizon 2020 Framework Programme. The aim of the initiative is to examine how better provision of public services to citizens can be achieved by applying the once-only principle. SCOOP4C was established to analyze implementation barriers, generate once-only research and identify and link relevant EU stakeholders. To this end, the initiative regularly organises EU-wide workshops and events on the subject and provides an online knowledge base, a community platform and a best practice database.

She is credited by the Colombian scholar Mar√≠a Lovino with staging the first work of feminist performance art in Colombia, in 1981. She is best known for discussing controversial themes such as political oppression, feminism, environment, and socioeconomic issues within her performances. == Early life == Marmolejo was born in Pradera, Colombia, in 1958. Raised in a Catholic family with four brothers, from an early age she became displeased with the idea of machismo and her inferior role in a male-dominated society, which led her to express this frustration in future artworks such as \\"Tendidos\\". As a child she took part in neighborhood theater classes and also participated in a theater workshop in art school, both largely influencing her passion for performing. She found performance art suitable for her as it gave her an outlet to express her anger and distress towards her country's political turmoil at the time, as well as her own struggles with being a woman. == Education  Art Student: Universidad de Santiago de Cali (1978-80) === Mar√≠a Evelia Marmolejo studied art and obtained her B.F.A at La Universidad de Santiago de Cali, in Cali, Colombia, from 1978 to 1980, after realizing in previous years that studying law was not something that interested her. Here, she created her first installation for her final exam in 1979 titled \\"Tendidos\\", where she hung both used and unused pads from a clothing rack, which was hanging from a butchers hook. This was her first use of blood, which she would go on to use in other works to speak on the violence going on in her country. The piece as a whole was meant to protest the rape and torture of Colombian women by the Colombian army. During her final drawing test at the school, she cut her index finger and used her blood to draw a line on posters, illustrating how Colombia's political violence was continuous, but not a straight line, and also expressing her belief that a drawing did not have to be made out of the traditional paper and pencil. Consequently, she was failed out of art school when her professors did not accept either of the works. Once Marmolejo left art school, she decided to concentrate on performance art, having been inspired by artists including Lygia Clark, Yeni and Nan, and Carlos Zerpa. === Masters and Other Education === Marmolejo also studied video and television at the Centro de Estudios de la Imagen in Madrid, Spain in 1986. Furthermore, she went on to obtain her Master of the Arts and Humanities from The City University of New York in New York, New York in 2008. == Artwork == Marmolejo's works deal with themes of gender, colonialism, and political oppression in Colombia. Her first performances span the years 1981-1985, after which there was an almost 30 year period during which she rarely performed; she became publicly active again in 2013. She has staged her performances at major institutions such as the Museum of Modern Art of Bogota, Museum of Modern Art Cartagena, and the Contemporary Art Museum Guayaquil, as well as in more secluded sites. Her performances in the 1980s often included bodily fluids and infliction of injury to herself, in works responsive to political oppression in Colombia, the social conditions of women, the political context of women's bodies, and environmental issues. Marmolejo self-exiled to Madrid in 1985. She is currently based in New York City. == Main Production Period: 1981-85  Anonimo-1981 === Marmolejo produced the majority of her performance art pieces between 1981 and 1985. Her first performance titled \\"Anonimo 1\\" (Anonymous 1) took place in 1981 at the Plazoleta del Centro Administrativo Municipal in Cali, Colombia. \\"Anonimo 1\\" was a performance in recognition of the various innocent Colombian people that had suffered under the regime of the Colombian president at the time, Julio Cesar Turbay Ayala (1978‚Äì82). The first part of the performance consisted of Marmolejo creating a walkway from a white paper and then proceeding to cutting her own feet and walking over the paper, while leaving blood stains. In order to remain anonymous, she wore a white tunic, cap, and bandages over her face. In the second part, Marmolejo cured her self-inflicted lesions and then continued to walk over the paper with bandaged feet until the twenty minutes that she had planned for the performance were up. Maria Evelia Marmolejo intended to shock spectators into paying attention to the violence around them, to confront the various disappearances and murders, and to convince them of the great need to heal the pain that this violence had caused.\\"Anonimo 1\\" also marked the beginning of her often utilizing self-harm as a technique to express herself in her performances and easily capture the attention of her audiences. === 11 de Marzo-1982 === In 1982 Marmolejo produced her most famous and also most controversial performance titled \\"11 de Marzo.\\" She performed it at the Galeria San Diego, in Bogota, Colombia. The performance consisted of her inducing her period, and was meant to celebrate it as a natural part of life rather than something to be ashamed of. Marmolejo arranged paper on the floor in an L shape and walked naked over it so that her blood would drip on it, all while playing flushing sounds in the background. The majority of her body was covered in pads, and she also danced while rubbing her pubic area against the paper and the walls. This performance was a way for her to express a part of her that had always been looked down upon by society, as well as a way to free herself and finally accept the natural functions of her body. It was seen as very rebellious as she turned a part of womanhood that was traditionally seen as a weakness, and an attribute contributing to a woman's presumed inferiority, and turned it into a strength. === Anonimo 3 and 4-1982 === Marmolejo also produced \\"Anonimo 3\\", which spoke on the need to focus on the environment. This was a private 15-minute performance that occurred near the Cauca River in Colombia, meant as a sort of apology for all of the pollution that humanity had created on earth, as was represented by the river. In this performance, Marmolejo covered herself in gauze and performed a healing ritual where she gave herself a vaginal washing meant to fertilize the ground and get rid of the pollution. \\"Anonimo 4\\" was produced the same year. In a similar way to \\"Anonimo 3\\", it was a private performance that also took place by the Cauca River. In this presentation, she collected multiple placentas from nearby hospitals and placed them in a triangle that she dug in the ground. She then hung some placentas from her body using plastic strips and stood inside the triangle. This performance was effective in provoking people in the audience to both cry and vomit, as the smell of the placentas was so strong. The piece meant to emphasize the idea that being born into a world where one had to fight to survive was terrifying for many, including herself. === Am√©rica-1985 === Marmolejo became pregnant in 1985 and decided to exile herself to Madrid, Spain. The artist became aware that the Spanish would be celebrating 500 years of the discovery of the Americas, which led her to provide her point of view and protest the celebration through another performance titled \\"Am√©rica.\\" \\"Am√©rica\\" took place on October 12, 1985, at the Plaza Colon in Madrid. Through the performance, Marmolejo expressed her belief that they should not be celebrating, but instead lamenting that day because the discovery of the Americas also marked the beginning of colonialism. At 12:00 noon the artist began distributing copies she had taken of Fray Bartolom√© de la Casas‚Äô book, \\"Breve Destrucci√≥n de las Indias\\". She used some of the most tragic and graphic descriptions of conquest that de la Casas had described in his book as an attempt to convince people of the horrors of colonialism. She then proceeded to cutting her own fingers and using her blood to write the word \\"Am√©rica\\" on the Christopher Columbus statue located in the plaza. The performance resulted in strong reactions from the public, with some people yelling at her to go back to her own country, and others yelling that she had the right to speak up because Spain was a free country. She then broke a large mirror and passed the shattered pieces out to the public, and shortly after got arrested. She was in jail for a few hours for possession of a weapon (the knife she used to cut herself), but was shortly released. === Sesquil√©-1985 === Marmolejo decided to turn the birth of her son into another one of her artworks. The artist gave birth to her son on December 5, 1985, at the Hospital Anglo-Americano in Madrid. She chose to invite a photographer as well as various spectators to observe her giving birth to her son, whom she would give the same name as the performance, Sesquil√©. Through \\"Sesquil√©\\", Marmolejo wanted to juxtapose what it meant to be an artist and what it meant to be a creator of life. She believed that the process of creating as an artist was very similar to giving birth in that giving birth was in a sense a creation of a new life. Because at the time the artist believed that the concept of a God fed into the patriarchy and therefore considered herself an atheist, she considered herself her own God. === Major works === * An√≥nimos 1, 2, 3, y 4, 1981-82. * 11 de Marzo, 1981. * Residuos I, 1983. * Residuous II, 1984. * Am√©rica, 1985. *Sesquil√©, 1985. * Extractivismo, 2015. == Exhibitions == The following is a list of Maria Evelia Marmolejo's art exhibitions including her performances. * Plaza del Centro Administraci√≥n Municipal de Cali.

O. G. Shann) was an Australian economist and historian. At a time when Australia's dominant economic philosophy favoured protectionist tariffs, Shann championed a more liberal approach. He is perhaps best remembered for his prediction of the Great Depression based on an analysis of similarities between the economic climate of the late 1880s and that of the late 1920s, for his involvement in the development of the University of Western Australia, and for his numerous works on economics and the defence of free trade. ==Early life and education== Shann was born in 1884 in Hobart, Tasmania to Frank and Frances Shann, and was the youngest of four children. The family relocated to Victoria in the late 1880s following the departure of his mother. The 1890s in Australia were characterized by a serious economic depression, and the Shann family suffered great financial difficulty during this time. Nonetheless Edward was able to attend Wesley College and later Queen's College, University of Melbourne thanks to scholarships and the support of his brother Frank. Shann was a polymath and explored many different fields of study, but specialized in history and political economy. He graduated with a Bachelor of Arts with first class honours in these fields at the top of his class in 1904. ==Later life and career== Following his graduation in 1904 he taught briefly at his alma mater, as a temporary lecturer in constitutional history. Apart from a brief stint as acting professor of philosophy at the University of Adelaide in 1906, a posting he apparently regretted, he would lecture in Melbourne until his departure for the London School of Economics. In September 1908 he left Australia to attend the LSE where he intended to pursue a D.Sc., although his studies would ultimately be cut short due to illness. While there he studied French syndicalism and was influenced by the Fabian Society and prominent British socialists such as George Bernard Shaw and Sidney Webb and Beatrice Webb, whom he came to know personally. He would return to Melbourne a believer in rational socialism but this flirtation was ultimately short-lived. In 1910 he returned from London and resumed work as a lecturer. He was offered the chair of political science at the University of Peking that same year, which he declined; in 1911 he accepted a position as lecturer in charge of history and economics at the University of Queensland. He would remain there through 1912. Throughout this period he supported Liberal politician Donald Mackinnon and served as his political secretary. The memorial sundial at the University of Western Australia In 1913 he became foundation professor of history at the newly founded University of Western Australia in Perth. He would become closely affiliated with the University and its development, serving as its vice-chancellor from 1921‚Äì23. His legacy at UWA is commemorated by the Shann memorial lecture (held there annually since 1961) as well as a memorial sundial and seat erected in 1937 in his honour in the sunken gardens on the campus. In 1930 he was hired as the Bank of New South Wales' economic consultant, a full-time position in Sydney. This was the first time that such a position had been filled by an actual economist in Australia; Shann established an economics department at the bank and advised it on economic issues relevant to it. He held this position for three years, during which time he became active in an economic advisory capacity to the Australian government. To this end in 1931 he joined the Copland Committee which helped to formulate the Premiers' Plan to combat the great depression; in 1932 he assisted Sir Wallace Bruce's committee on unemployment; in 1932 he advised the government at the Ottawa Conference and again in 1933 at the London Economic Conference. In all of these roles he emerged as a strong proponent of free trade and flexible markets and against expansionary fiscal policy. In 1933 he accepted the chair of economics at the University of Adelaide, although he remained at UWA through 1934. This would be his final appointment before his death in 1935. ==Economic positions== Edward Shann was a classical liberal, and defended free trade and open markets at a time when Australia favoured protectionist trade policy and tariffs. Shann famously predicted the Great Depression in his 1927 essay, The Boom of 1890 ‚Äì and now, in which he likened the economic conditions of the late 1880s to those of the late 1920s, warning that a similarly dire economic decline might follow for similar reasons. His seminal work, 1930's An Economic History of Australia, is still a very well regarded reference to Australia's economic policies and institutions from the late 19th century into the early 20th. He wrote prolifically on the subject of economics, always advancing a liberal position. His collection of essays, Bond or Free?, juxtapose economic liberalism against paternal protectionism and, as in the title, ask whether Australians should prefer bondage or freedom. In this work he came out in opposition to more public works, and in this as well as in his vocal opposition to countercyclical fiscal policy he fell decidedly outside of the Keynesian mould that gained popularity during the depression years. ==Personal life== Edward Shann married Alice Eddie in 1911 in Melbourne, and together they had three daughters. One, Marjorie, later married one of Shann's more prominent students, Arthur Tange. ==Death== Shann's death was and remains the subject of some controversy. He was found dead on the footpath outside of his first-floor office window at the University of Adelaide, from which he had apparently fallen. This was ruled a suicide by the coroner. This explanation has always been controversial: even at the time, some of his contemporaries suggested foul play. Later analyses suggest that while suicide was perhaps not the correct explanation, foul play probably wasn't either. Rather, it suggests that his death was probably accidental: Shann, who had suffered from nervousness throughout his life, often felt faint, and when such an episode was upon him he would tend to rush to fresh air. He had indeed complained of faintness the day of his death and had delivered a lecture sitting down, unusually for him. In a previous episode, described by his brother in a letter, Shann had hurt his finger and then rushed to the window for some fresh air; upon opening the window he collapsed and nearly fell out. Similarly, Keith Hancock wrote in a letter that Shann had told him he had been feeling faint, and related that he would often open a window to get some fresh air and then lose his balance. Unfortunately, these letters only surfaced after the coroner had pronounced the death a suicide. In light of them it now seems more likely that Shann had a similar episode, opened his window, and, feeling faint, simply fell out. ==Bibliography== * Cattle Chosen (1926) * The Boom of 1890 ‚Äì and now (1927) * An Economic History of Australia (1930) * Bond or Free?

There are a few vidame titles in France, of which that of Chartres is probably the best known, because a number of holders have been notable in widely different ways over the centuries. Vidame was originally the name for the commander of a bishop's military force in the Early Middle Ages, when bishops, like other great lords, needed troops for security. The title eventually developed into a heritable noble title, like others linked to a specific estate. The title therefore passed to the new owner when the estate was sold, as happened a number of times in this case. By the later Middle Ages, the title was held by the owner of the chateau and estate of La Fert√©-Vidame (documented by 985), Eure-et-Loir, some 40 kilometres from Chartres. In the 17th century the holder was still supposed to pay an annual fee to the Bishop of Chartres (for holding the land associated with the role, while not performing the duties), ceremonially presented during the mass in Chartres Cathedral on the feast day of the Purification of the Virgin.Formel (1982) ==Middle Ages== The vidame of the day took part in the First Crusade (1095‚Äì1099). The title was held by the de Ferri√®res family by the 12th century. They had acquired it through marriage with the sister and heiress of the 10th vidame of the family of the lords of √âtienne. Confusingly, this was an entirely different de Ferri√®res family to that holding the title in the 16th century.Formel (1995) Holders included Guillaume de Ferri√®res (grandson of the first de Ferri√®res vidame, c.1150 ‚Äì ?April 1204), who took part in the Third (1188‚Äì92) and Fourth Crusades (1201‚Äì4), and died in Romania as part of the latter. He is assumed to be the trouv√®re (north French troubador poet-composer) recorded only as the \\"Vidame de Chartres\\", to whom eight songs have been attributed. Through his sister the title passed to the lords of Meslay-le-Vidame, Eure-et-Loir.Formel (1995) About 1380 the Vidame's sister and eventual heir Jeanne de Chartres married Robert de Vend√¥me, who became Vidame after the death of his brother-in-law around 1401.Formel- Levavasseur, 44 says the marriage was in 1374, other sources say 1385 Robert de Vend√¥me came from a branch of the Vend√¥me family, a well-connected junior branch of the House of Bourbon. The Vend√¥mes held the title until 1560. They largely rebuilt the chateau to give it the impressive feudal appearance, with eight towers, that it kept until the 1770s. ==Renaissance to French Revolution== The title passed to Fran√ßois de Vend√¥me (c. 1522 ‚Äì 22 December 1560). There are contradictory accounts of the precise date and place of his death in Paris in December 1560, see de P√©tigny, 336‚Äì339, who was a successful soldier who figures largely in accounts of the brilliant but decadent French court of the period. The account in the colourful memoirs of Brant√¥me (1540‚Äì1614) place him in the centre of intrigues with Queen Catherine de' Medici (1519‚Äì1589), Diane de Poitiers (1499‚Äì1566), and the Guise brothers, Francis, Duke of Guise (1519‚Äì1563), Charles, Cardinal of Lorraine (1524‚Äì1574) and Claude, Duke of Aumale (1526‚Äì1573), with all of whom he was at odds by the end of his life. Although not apparently a Huguenot himself, he became attached to the Huguenot convert Louis, Prince of Cond√© (1530‚Äì1569) as the strongest anti-Guise figure. The Vidame was put in the Bastille after the Amboise conspiracy of 1560, in which he seems to have not been involved, and died days after the death of Francis II of France, which would probably have led to his release.de P√©tigny, 327‚Äì349 Fran√ßois de Vend√¥me, always referred to as the Vidame de Chartres, is a major character in La Princesse de Cl√®ves, an anonymous French novel published in March 1678, which mixes historical and fictional characters.\\"Personnages ‚Äì La princesse de Cl√®ves\\" It is regarded by many as the beginning of the modern tradition of the psychological novel, and as a great classic work. Its author is generally held to be Madame de La Fayette. The action takes place between October 1558 and November 1559 at the court of Henry II of France, and the account of the Vidame's character broadly agrees with that of Brant√¥me. The Vidame was further depicted, in similar terms, in Catherine De Medici by Honor√© de Balzac, as \\"the first and only amour\\" of the widowed queen.Catherine De Medici, end of the Introduction When Vend√¥me died the title passed to Jean de Ferri√®res (1520‚Äì1586),de P√©tigny, 340 a leading Huguenot politician and military commander in the French Wars of Religion, who was forced to spend periods in exile in England. He was eventually captured when fighting for the future Henri IV of France by the crown's Catholic forces, and died in captivity when he could not raise the ransom demanded. After de Ferri√®res died, the title passed by descent to Pr√©jean de la Fin (d. 1624), another plotter, this time against the Bourbon dynasty. ===Dukes of Saint-Simon, and after=== Claude de Rouvroy, duc de Saint-Simon, father of the memoirist By the time La Princesse de Cl√®ves was published the chateau and title belonged to Claude de Rouvroy, duc de Saint- Simon (1607‚Äì1693), who had bought La Fert√©-Vidame in 1635, the same year his dukedom was created. His son Louis, the second and last duke and famous memoirist (1675‚Äì1755), used it as a courtesy title at court until his father's death; the contrast between the debonair fictional character and the very short teenager may have given rise to some amusement. In turn it was used by his sons. According to the second duke, his father (a younger son) had bought the estate at the request of King Louis XIII ‚Äì and perhaps with his funds, to give him a seat befitting his new rank as a ducal peer of France.Formel (1982) La Fert√©-Vidame passed to the Grimaldi family when Saint-Simon's grand- daughter married a younger son of Jacques I, Prince of Monaco. In 1764 La Fert√©-Vidame was bought by Jean-Joseph de Laborde (1724‚Äì1794), a very wealthy businessman, who became a fermier g√©n√©ral, politician and banker to the king. Laborde built the neo-classical mansion (architect Antoine Matthieu Le Carpentier, from 1771) whose ruined shell remains today. In politics, he was ahead of his time and of the French Revolution, and (with Mirabeau) was one of the only noble d√©put√©s (from the bailliage d'√âtampes) to accept demotion to the Third Estate upon the Revolution. However, this was not enough to save him from being guillotined under the \\"loi des suspects\\" on the orders of Louis de Saint-Just, in one of the last fits of the Reign of Terror in May 1794.Formel (1990); Bardet, Jean-Pierre (ed), Etat et soci√©t√© en France aux XVIIe et XVIIIe si√®cles: M√©langes offerts √† Yves Durand, 181‚Äì184, 2000, Presses Paris Sorbonne, , 9782840501510, google books After only 20 years the estate was sold to Louis Jean Marie de Bourbon, Duke of Penthi√®vre (1725‚Äì1793), grandson of Louis XIV of France by Louis Alexandre, Count of Toulouse, his legitimized son with Madame de Montespan (and incidentally, along with his brother, especially detested by Saint-Simon). The sale was in 1784 for 5.5 million francs, a very large sum.Formel-Levavasseur, 41 The duke died of natural causes in 1793, the last vidame of the Ancien regime. At the Bourbon Restoration, the chateau was restored to his daughter, Louise Marie Ad√©la√Øde de Bourbon, Duchess of Orl√©ans. On her death in 1821, the domaine passed to her eldest son Louis-Philippe I, future king of the French.Formel (1990) ==Holders of the title== Notable holders before the revolution include: *Guillaume de Ferri√®res (c.1150 ‚Äì ?April 1204), crusader and trouv√®re *Fran√ßois de Vend√¥me (c. 1522 ‚Äì 22 December 1560), soldier and courtier *Jean de Ferri√®res (1520‚Äì1586), Huguenot politician and military commander *Claude de Rouvroy, duc de Saint-Simon (1607‚Äì1693), royal favourite *Louis de Rouvroy, duc de Saint-Simon, (1675‚Äì1755) the second and last duke and famous memoirist *Jean-Joseph de Laborde (1724‚Äì1794), businessman turned politician *Louis Jean Marie de Bourbon, Duke of Penthi√®vre (1725‚Äì1793), grandson of Louis XIV of France ==NotesReferences== *Formel-Levavasseur, Fran√ßois, Le Duc de Saint-Simon, Comte de la Fert√©-Vidame, M√©morialiste Et √âpistolier, 2012, BoD ‚Äì Books on Demand France, , 9782810626311, google books, in French *Formel, Fran√ßois (1982), \\"Presence des Saint-Simons a La Fert√©-Vidame (1635‚Äì1764)\\", extracted from the Bulletin Municipal de La Fert√©-Vidame (1982 p. 9-10), in French *Formel, Fran√ßois (1990), \\"Diner de Tetes a La Ferte-Vidame: Le mari d‚Äôune imp√©ratrice chez le banquier du Roi\\", extracted from the Bulletin Municipal de La Fert√©-Vidame (1989‚Äì1990, p. 38-50), in French *Formel, Fran√ßois (1995), \\"\\"Des predecesseurs des Saint-Simons..., extracted from the Bulletin Municipal de La Fert√©-Vidame (1994‚Äì1995, p. 63‚Äì66), in French *de P√©tigny, Jean, \\"Testament de Fran√ßois de Vend√¥me, Vidame de Chartres\\", Bibliotheque de l'ecole des Chartes, 1849, Paris, pp. 327‚Äì349, in French Category:French titles of nobility Category:Chartres ","title":"Vidame de Chartres"},{"id":"56838914","text":"Nails is a 2017 horror film directed by Dennis Bartok, who co-wrote it with Tom Abrams.

When she wakes in the hospital, her body is battered, her legs are paralyzed, and she is connected to a medical ventilator through a tracheal tube. Unable to speak, she is forced to use a speech synthesis program. Her husband Steve helps her adjust to the program and assures her that he will attempt to get her back home soon. That night, Dana believes someone has entered her room. The nurse assistant, Trevor, checks the room for her in the morning but says no patients from this wing could have wandered in. When Dana insists a man is harassing her, she is assigned psychiatrist Dr. Stengel. As Steve insists the hospital staff take better care of her, Dana's daughter, Gemma, explores the hospital, unaware that a ghostly figure has observed her. After an incident in which her ventilator fails, the hospital is forced to take Dana's claims more seriously. Though doubting foul play, hospital director Elizabeth Leaming authorises CCTV cameras to be installed in Dana's room. The cameras do not capture the next attack, where the same ghostly figure attempts to kill Dana. Dana's frantic emergency calls summon Trevor. The ghost leaves when Trevor enters; though he says he saw nothing, he tells Leaming that he felt a presence. Dana researches the hospital's past, learning that an orderly, Eric Nilsson, murdered several children before committing suicide. Trevor claims ignorance of Nilsson and tells her to ask Dr. Stengel about the hospital's history. Stengel reveals that Nilsson, a troubled former patient, was hired as an orderly once he was discharged. Because he collected fingernails from the children's ward patients, he was given the nickname \\"Nails\\". Dana becomes convinced that Nails's ghost is haunting her and that Steve is having an affair with a new athlete, Ashley. Steve believes Trevor to be responsible for Dana's attacks. Trevor himself is overworked. Though he helps her as he can, he exasperatedly tells her to seek help from her husband when Dana insists on being discharged from the hospital. Nails makes contact with Dana through her speech synthesis program, threatening to kill her. When she asks why he has targeted her, Nails carves an answer onto her body: \\"because I miss you\\". Separately, Trevor finds an old record for Dana under her maiden name. Dana is revealed to have been one of the child patients Nails tended. Trevor sees live video footage where Nails attacks him; Nails kills Trevor off-screen, then mocks and kills Leaming, who has attempted to call the police. Ashley, who comes to the hospital to visit Dana with Steve and Gemma, is possessed by Nails and kills Steve. Knowing that Nails will attempt to kill everyone, Dana tells Gemma to leave without her. Gemma refuses and forces Dana to come with her. Dana, who has grown stronger and has been practicing breathing on her own, has Gemma pull out the tracheal tube and put her in a wheelchair. The two race to escape the hospital as Nails kills the few remaining staff members, including Dr. Stengel. To save Gemma, Dana sacrifices herself; Gemma suffers shock after seeing Nails murder Dana. Emergency workers attend to Gemma after she escapes the hospital. When they ask who is responsible, all she can tell them is that Nails killed everyone. The final shot of the film shows Dana's hospital room with her laptop on the bed facing towards the camera. It slowly zooms into the laptop screen that is displaying Dana in her bed from the angle of one of her CCTV cameras. Then Nails, in living form, walks over to her bedside and clips her fingernails. == Cast == * Shauna Macdonald as Dana Milgrom * Steve Wall as Steve Milgrom * Leah McNamara as Gemma Milgrom * Ross Noble as Trevor * Richard Foster-King as Eric Nilsson / Nails * Robert O'Mahoney as Dr. Ron Stengel * Charlotte Bradley as Elizabeth Leaming * Muireann D'Arcy as Ashley == Production == Director and co-writer Dennis Bartok was inspired by a news story he read. A male patient, after becoming paralyzed in a hit-and-run accident, had cameras installed in his hospital room, which captured evidence of someone tampering with his ventilator. Bartok did a gender swap and made the protagonist a track coach as a tribute to a friend who was murdered shortly after the first draft was written. The production company, Fantastic Films, had worked previously with Noble on Stitches. Noble, a comedian, was looking to take a dramatic role and wanted to avoid comedy. Shooting took place in Dublin. == Release == Nails premiered at the Audi Dublin International Film Festival on 20 February 2017. It was released in the UK and Ireland on 16 June 2017. == Reception == Rotten Tomatoes, a review aggregator, reports that 44% of 16 surveyed critics gave the film a positive review; the average rating is 4.7/10. Aine O'Connor of the Sunday Independent rated it 2/5 stars and wrote that the good acting is not enough to offset the thin story. In his review for RT√â, Paddy Kehoe rated it 1.5/5 stars and wrote that it \\"essentially follows the current Hollywood schlock-horror template\\", focusing on tech gadgets and jump scares instead of story. Kim Newman, writing in Empire, rated it 3/5 stars and called it predictable but effective, praising Macdonald's acting. == References  External links == * Category:2017 films Category:2017 horror films Category:Irish films Category:Irish horror films Category:English-language films Category:British ghost films Category:British films Category:Films set in hospitals Category:Films set in Ireland Category:Films shot in the Republic of Ireland ","title":"Nails (2017 film)"},{"id":"56838956","text":"The 2018‚Äì19 season of Grupo Desportivo Interclube is the club's 31st season in Angolan football, and the 20th consecutive season in the Girabola, the top flight of Angolan football.

She has been a member of the German Bundestag since 2005 and was chairwoman of the Committee on Culture and Media Affairs from 2009 to 2013. Since December 2016, Gr√ºtters has also been the chairwoman of the CDU Berlin and an elected member of the CDU Federal Executive Board. == Education and professional life == After graduating from high school in 1981, Monika Gr√ºtters studied German language and literature, art history and political science at the University of M√ºnster and at the Rheinische Friedrich-Wilhelms- Universit√§t Bonn from 1982 onward, where she graduated in 1989 as Magister Artium. After having worked in the press and public relations department of the Bonn Opera during her studies from 1987 to 1988, she worked in the same area from 1990 to 1991 at the then Museum for Transportation and Technology in Berlin and from 1991 to 1992 for the publishing house Bouvier. Between 1992 and 1995 Gr√ºtters was spokesperson of the Senate Administration for Science and Research (State of Berlin). From 1991 to 1999, Gr√ºtters was a lecturer in cultural management at the Hanns Eisler College of Music in Berlin. Since 1999, Gr√ºtters has been holding an honorary professorship at Freie Universit√§t Berlin for the Master's program Arts and Media Administration. Gr√ºtters also worked as a PR officer for the Bankgesellschaft Berlin from 1996. From 1998 to 2013, she was Spokeswoman of the Board of the Brandenburger Tor Foundation. She is a member of the Central Committee of German Catholics and spokeswoman of the committee's \\"Culture, Education and Media\\" section since 2013. == Political career == Gr√ºtters joined the Young Union in 1978 and the Christian Democratic Union of Germany (CDU) in 1983. Since 1998 she has been a member of the state executive of the CDU Berlin. Gr√ºtters was a member of the Berlin House of Representatives from 1995 to 2005. In this role, she was the spokesperson for science and cultural policy and from 2001 to 2005 also deputy chairwoman of the CDU Parliamentary Group. ===Member of Parliament, 2005‚Äìpresent=== Gr√ºtters has been member of the German Bundestag since the 2005 elections, representing the electoral district of Marzahn-Hellersdorf. She always entered the Bundestag via the regional list of candidates for Berlin and chaired the Committee on Culture and Media Affairs from 2009 to 2013. In addition to her committee assignments, Gr√ºtters has been a member of the German-Israeli Parliamentary Friendship Group since 2005. In the 2013 federal election, she was again as the CDU's top candidate for Berlin. Following Frank Henkel's resignation from the position of chairperson to the CDU Berlin on 13 October 2016, Gr√ºtters was unanimously nominated by the executive committee and state executive of the CDU Berlin as a candidate for his successor on the following day. At a small party convention of the CDU Berlin on 2 December 2016, Gr√ºtters was elected as the new chairwoman with 78.4 percent of the votes. Additionally, Gr√ºtters was elected at the CDU's federal congress in Essen with 70.37 percent as successor to Emine Demirb√ºken- Wegner in the Executive Board of the CDU and thus in the party's leadership circle around chairwoman Angela Merkel. ===Federal Government Commissioner for Culture and the Media, 2013‚Äìpresent=== On 17 December 2013, Gr√ºtters succeeded Bernd Neumann (CDU) as the Federal Government Commissioner for Culture and the Media. She thus holds the title of a Minister of State to the Federal Chancellor and is head of a so-called Supreme Federal Authority (oberste Bundesbeh√∂rde) with headquarters in both Berlin and Bonn. Albeit often stated in the press, Monika Gr√ºtters does not cover the function of a German \\"culture minister\\": according to the German Basic Law, cultural and educational matters are still subject to the sovereignty of the L√§nder. In the context of cooperative cultural federalism, however, the Federal Government Commissioner is responsible for cultural and media matters of national importance. During her term of office in the third Merkel cabinet, the overall budget for federal cultural affairs increased by more than 30% up to 1.67 billion within the federal budget between 2013 and 2018. However, issues surrounding the 2012 Munich artworks discovery overshadowed Gr√ºtters‚Äôs first two years in office.Alison Smale (3 March 2016), Germany to Continue Funding to Establish Provenance of Looted Art New York Times. As an institutional response to the discovery of major artworks of unclear provenance and ownership in the private Gurlitt collection, Gr√ºtters launched the German Lost Art Foundation (Deutsches Zentrum Kulturgutverluste) in 2015. Also in 2015, Gr√ºtters presented an amendment to the German law on the protection of cultural property (Kulturgutschutzgesetz) which has been subject to controversial debates. In addition, Gr√ºtters has significant responsibility for the successful state funding of the Barenboim‚ÄìSaid Akademie in Berlin and a national photographic archive in D√ºsseldorf to preserve, archive and publicise the country's photographic cultural heritage.Catherine Hickley (November 19, 2019), German parliament approves institute for photographic legacy based in Dusseldorf The Art Newspaper. In the negotiations to form another coalition government under the leadership of Chancellor Angela Merkel following the 2017 federal elections, Gr√ºtters led the working group on cultural affairs and media, alongside Dorothee B√§r and Michael Roth. In February 2018, Merkel announced that she would take over Gr√ºtters for a second term in her fourth cabinet.

By the beginning of the Great Patriotic War the House of Soviets had not yet been fully completed. Repair and restoration work were carried out only in the 1950s, and the facades of the building were completed only in 1968. The total volume of the Rostov House of Soviets is 370,000 cubic meters, which makes it one of the largest buildings in the North Caucasus and the largest administrative structure in Southern Russia. == History and description == The House of Soviets is situated at the historic center of Rostov-on-Don, at Soviets Square. It was initially planned that the building would have 1000 rooms, a conference hall, canteens, a post office, a hairdresser, buffets, a printing house and other services. The highest floor were to be in a form of the cylindrical body with a conference hall. However, this high-altitude project did not have enough time to be finished, and what had been already built, was badly damaged during German occupation of the city in 1942. Eight- story building during the post-war reconstruction partially lost its originally planned appearance. The facades were deprived of tape glazing - it was simply laid with brick, it was made in relief, a heavy portal was installed above the main entrance to the building with huge pilasters of rectangular cross section. The authors of the new project of the facade were architects Vladimir Grigor and Vladimir Simonovich. The project of Rostov House of Soviets was completed in 1929-1934 by architect Ilya Golosov. On the site chosen for the administrative building, until 1930 stod the Church of Alexander Nevsky. In 1935, the foundation of the House of Soviets was laid. The construction works were carried out at an insufficient rate. Construction, basically, was completed by 1941. Before the beginning of the Great Patriotic War, the finishing works were not fully completed, although the building partly was already in use. In the post-war period, taking advantage of the lack of funds from the city, the Ministry of Defense proposed that the House of Soviets to be rebuilt by German prisoners of war under the condition of alienating 80% of the usable area. The city was forced to agree, and so now this building in the most prestigious district of Rostov-on-Don is now partly occupied by the so-called Watch factory. Only the last two wings of the House of Soviets, facing the Bolshaya Sadovaya Street, and the central rizalit are occupied by the Administration of Rostov Oblast. == References == Category:Stalinist architecture Category:Buildings and structures in Rostov- on-Don Category:Government buildings completed in 1956 ","title":"House of Soviets (Rostov-on-Don)"},{"id":"56839122","text":"Angela Asher is a Canadian film and television actress and active anti- vaxxer.\\"Perpetually on the job; Angela Asher knows what it means to be a celeb in Canada\\".

The film was unsuccessful at the box office. ==Plot== By 1758, the Maratha Empire had reached its peak under the leadership of Peshwa Balaji Baji Rao aka Nana Saheb. Maratha commanders Raghunath Rao, the Peshwa's brother, Shamsher Bahadur, the Peshwa's half-brother, and Sadashiv Rao Bhau, the Peshwa's cousin, defeat the Nizam of Hyderabad and capture their commander of artillery Ibrahim Khan Gardi, with Sadashiv inducting him into the Maratha Army as their commander of artillery. They return home to the Empire's capital at Pune and are welcomed. Due to pressure by his wife Gopika Bai, the Peshwa appoints Sadashiv as the Empire's finance minister in favour of the Peshwa's son Vishwas Rao, which he reluctantly accepts. Sadashiv lists the defaulters who failed to pay taxes to the Maratha Empire on time, and notes that the Rohilla's Head Najib ad-Dawlah has the largest amount of tax due. Najib, determined to teach the Marathas a lesson, allies himself with Ahmad Shah Abdali, inviting him to Delhi. News of this formidable alliance reaches Pune, along with the news of Dattaji Shinde's death in battle against Najib. The Peshwa appoints Raghunath Rao as the commander of the Maratha forces which will be dispatched to fight Abdali and defend Delhi. However, Raghunath asks for a large amount of money, which Sadashiv denies, citing the treasury's condition after consecutive battles. Raghunath, therefore, refuses to march north, which leads the Peshwa to appoint Sadashiv as the commander-in-chief of the Maratha army, under the overlordship of Vishwas Rao, the Peshwa's son and heir. The army, along with a large number of non-combatants (women, children and pilgrims), begin their long and arduous journey north. They arrive at Dholpur, where they're welcomed by their fellow Maratha generals‚Äî Govind Pant Bundela, Balwant Rao Mehendale, Jankoji Shinde, and the veteran Malhar Rao Holkar. They start making alliances with other kingdoms, including Maharaja Suraj Mal and Nawab Shuja-ud-Daulah, and are successful, with their army size growing to 50000 men. Abdali is also making alliances, taking advantage of the Rajput kings' hatred for the Marathas. Sadashiv and the commanders receive intelligence that Abdali has camped on the other side of the Yamuna and spot Shuja's flags along with Abdali's, revealing that the Nawab had switched allegiance. Due to the heavy rains, the Marathas are unable to build a bridge to cross the Yamuna. Sadashiv decides to march north and capture Delhi and then cross the Yamuna to defeat Abdali. Najib receives intelligence that the Marathas have retreated, from which Abdali deduces that they are marching north to Delhi. He suggests that they also march north and cross the Yamuna. Meanwhile, the Marathas defeat Najib's general and capture Delhi. After finding out the Afghans are chasing the Marathas, Sadashiv decides to strategically capture Kunjpura Fort and eventually carry out a massacre there of helpless Afghans departed from their main column, which angers Abdali to such an extent that he immediately reacts by crossing the swollen Yamuna in heavy rainfall. This leaves the Maharaja of Patiala, Ala Singh, unable to send his soldiers. Food begins to dwindle, and the Maratha soldiers and civilians are forced to go without food. Although the arrival of King Araadhak Singh provides some relief to the Maratha camp, but soon after camping at Panipat, Abdali catches up with the Marathas and comes face to face. However, after hearing of a possible coup d'√©tat at his capital in Kandahar, Abdali arranges for a truce with Sadashiv but scraps it after the latter doesn't agree with to terms Abdali presents him. After both sides decide strategies and formations, they prepare for the final confrontation. Parvati Bai and the civilians and pilgrims stay at a small camp towards the back, and Vishwas promises Sadashiv that he'll never get off his elephant during the battle for his own protection. Artillery firing begins by both sides, with substantial damage done to Abdali's army due to Ibrahim Khan's leadership. The riflemen also start attacking. The infantry then begin the main attack, with the Marathas doing well. Overcome with fear, many soldiers of Abdali's army retreat, but Abdali threatens them with severe punishment and forces them to return to the battle. Meanwhile, on seeing Shamsher wounded, Vishwas descends from his elephant to protect him. Sadashiv fends off the Afghans who attacked the young prince, but a bullet hits Vishwas on his head, killing him. This is a huge blow to the morale of the Marathas, who begin to lose ground from then. One by one, the Maratha chieftains are either wounded or killed. Araadhak Singh unexpectedly retreats from the battle. It is then revealed that he was angry with the Marathas for the high taxes imposed upon them, so he secretly allied himself with Abdali and passed information onto him. Seeing the tide of the battle turn, Malhar Rao retreats from the battlefield and escorts the non- combatants to safety, as promised to Sadashiv on the eve of the battle. Abdali's soldiers close in on Sadashiv but he bravely fights back, sustaining serious injuries. He eventually succumbs to his wounds and dies, but not before making Abdali aware of his pyrrhic victory. Back in Pune, Parvati Bai dies from grief. Abdali sends the Peshwa a letter, praising Sadashiv's bravery and courage. The epilogue reveals that even though victorious, Abdali never returned to India. Under the leadership of Peshwa Madhav Rao, the generals Mahadaji Shinde and Tukoji Rao Holkar saved the Maratha empire from extinction, and re-captured Delhi ten years later, making the Marathas a dominant force once again. ==Cast== *Arjun Kapoor as Sadashiv Rao Bhau *Sanjay Dutt as Ahmad Shah Abdali *Kriti Sanon as Parvati Bai *Mantra as Najib-Ud- Daula *Mohnish Bahl as Nana Saheb Peshwa *Padmini Kolhapure as Gopika Bai (Peshwinbai) *Sahil Salathia as Shamsher Bahadur *Kunal Kapoor as Shuja-ud- Daula *Mir Sarwar as Imad-ul-Mulk *Milind Gunaji as Dattaji Rao Scindia *Abhishek Nigam as Vishwas Rao Peshwa *Ravindra Mahajani as Subhedar Malhar Rao Holkar *Gashmeer Mahajani as Sardar Jankoji Shinde *Nawab Shah as Ibrahim Khan Gardi * Kashyap Parulekar as Raghunath Rao *Suhasini Mulay as Radhabai *S.

It‚Äôs a tribute to the Maratha community in its truest form and even it was shorter by an hour, it could have had the same impact\\". The Times of India gave 3.5 out of 5 stars stating \\"Panipat delves into a significant chapter in history and is a war drama that lauds the unshakable bravery, courage and the strong principles of the Maratha's\\". India Today gave 2.5 out of 5 stars stating \\"Ashutosh Gowariker may not be able to do grandeur like Sanjay Leela Bhansali, but he can do war. Yet, a lacklustre cinematography and terrible CGI mars this solid attempt. It would have worked 10 years ago\\". Namrata Joshi of The Hindu wrote \\"Gowariker may have taken liberties with history, but doesn‚Äôt play around with the form. He sticks to the tried and tested, the long and langourous and old-fashioned\\". Bollywood Hungama gave 3 out of 5 stars stating \\"Panipat throws light on an important chapter of Indian history with the battle scenes as its USP\\". Zee News gave 3 out of 5 stars stating \\"The film is a great effort by Gowariker and deserves to be watched for some impeccable performances and adrenaline-pumping action\\". CNN-News18 gave 2.5 out of 5 stars stating \\"Panipat, a film about Maratha warrior Sadashiv Rao Bhau who staves off Afghan ruler Ahmad Shah Abdali, disappoints only because of a linear screenplay that fails to rouse dramatic emotions so important to historicals\\". NDTV gave 2 out of 5 stars stating \\"The burden on Arjun Kapoor is too heavy for him though he rises manfully to the challenge. Panipat definitely isn't Mohenjo Daro. But is that saying much? It will take three hours of your life and a whole lot of patience to sit through this laboured film\\". Deccan Chronicle gave 2.5 out of 5 stars stating \\"Directors like Gowariker do no service to the nation or their audience by twisting the truth, ignoring military, diplomatic, common sense follies and rewriting history with jingoistic fervour\\". Portrait of Ahmad Shah Durrani in Afghan Costume BBC News and Al Jazeera reported that the film received criticism from different parts of the world, especially from Afghanistan since Ahmad Shah Abdali is the national hero and the founder of modern day Afghanistan. Afghan viewers pointed that the film's portrayal of Abdali was that of an Arab, rather than an Afghan. Critics linked the rising number of Bollywood films with negative Muslim characters, such as the portrayal of Alauddin Khilji as a cruel and vicious ruler in the film Padmaavat (2018), as an attempt by the industry executives to align with India's ruling Bharatiya Janata Party, a Hindu nationalist party led by Prime Minister Narendra Modi. The Panipat trailer depicted Ahmed Shah Durrani as ruthless and brutal ruler and Afghans as 'battle-hardened, blood-thirsty savages'. While the film presented Marathas as \\"sophisticated and righteous\\". Consul General of Afghanistan in Mumbai, Naseem Sharifi, said that 'Afghans would not tolerate any insult to Ahmad Shah Durrani'. Afghan journalists stated that the film will create more Islamophobia and racism towards Afghans. The Telegraph India reported that films like Padmaavat (2018), Kesari (2019) and Panipat have stereotyped and vilified Afghans as brutal, cold-blooded and treacherous. Afghanistan's Ambassador to India, Tahir Qadiri, claimed that he was in contact with Indian officials and have shared the Afghan concerns with them. Ajmal Alamzai, cultural attache at the Afghan embassy in New Delhi, claimed that he had made several unsuccessful attempts to contact the director of the film. Pajhwok Afghan News reported that the Panipat film trailer depicted the Maratha Empire as victorious in the Third Battle of Panipat despite the fact that it was Ahmad Shah Durrani, who had won the battle. Khaama Press, another Afghan newspaper, reported that some Afghan social media users have welcomed the film as reality while others criticised it and claimed that parts of history has been forged in favour of specific groups. The portrayal of Ahmed Sha Durrani founder of Afghanistan in the film has been criticised by analyst and critics. Ahmed Sha Durrani who holds great respect in Afghanistan and also known as Baba (Father) for his contribution, the Embassy of Afghanistan has expressed its concerns and has requested a meeting with New Delhi. === Box office === Panipats opening day domestic collection was 4.12 crore.

With its theme of young men and women accusing each other of selfishness and cruelty in affairs of the heart, Faur√© set it as a mischievous wedding present for his friend and ex-pupil Andr√© Messager, who was the dedicatee.

They are a cadet branch of the Hughes of Gwerclas family, descending from the younger brother of the 7th Baron of Kymmer-yn-Edeirnion, Gruffydd ap Rhys ab Ieuan (d. 1489), 'Baron of Crogen and Branas', who was famed for his pilgrimage to Santiago di Compostella. He was a Lancastrian and later supported his kinsman Henry Tudor. He was a patron of the bards, most notably Lewys Glyn Cothi. The eponymous ancestor of the family was John ap Rhydderch ap John ap Hywel ap Gruffydd ap Rhys, of Faerdref Uchaf, who appears in the visitations of Wales in 1594. His son, Maurice Jones of Faerdref Uchaf, Esq. (1597- ca. 1655), was the first to adopt the surname 'Jones'. Faerdref Uchaf house no longer exists but would have been a very similar house to the surviving Branas Uchaf and Plas Uchaf. Ty Uchaf was built on its site in the 1680s. The family, like their kinsmen, were Royalists during the English Civil War, and two of Maurice's sons, Capt. John Jones and Lt. Nathanael Jones, fought at the Battle of Marston Moor, leading a company of men from Llandrillo. Later, Nathanael achieved minor fame as a native Welsh poet and translator of theological textbooks, such as works by Jeremy Taylor from English into Welsh, so that they could be more widely read. He also served as a Justice of the Peace and coroner for Merionethshire, and became High Sheriff of Merionethshire in 1673. His son, Maurice, also served as High Sheriff in 1684. By the mid-19th century, following the Industrial revolution, the family had largely lost their ancestral lands and had dispersed into the neighbouring counties of Shropshire and Cheshire. An elaborate 18th century memorial tablet to the family remains in the parish church of Llandrillo. As descendants of Owain Brogyntyn, they bear the 'Black Lion' of Powys on their escutcheon and keep the motto 'Kymmer-yn-Edeirnion', in memory of their ancestral seat. The family frequently intermarried with their kinsmen the Nanney of Nannau family, whom they now represent in the female line. Their arms hang in the hall of Jesus College, Oxford where several members of the family were educated. == References == Category:Welsh noble families Category:Gentry families ","title":"Jones of Faerdref Uchaf"},{"id":"56839277","text":"The 1892 United States presidential election in Delaware took place on November 8, 1892.

It is currently outbound approximately 89 AU from the Sun, a distance of more than . As of its announcement in March 2018, it is the fourth most distant observed natural object in the Solar System. At a visual apparent magnitude of 26.2, it is one of the faintest trans-Neptunian objects observed. == Discovery == The object's discovery telescope, Subaru (Japanese name for the Pleiades) on the far left, alongside the twin Keck telescopes and NASA's Infrared Telescope Facility was first observed by Scott Sheppard, Chad Trujillo, and David Tholen on 13 October 2015 using the Subaru Telescope, a large reflecting telescope at the Mauna Kea Observatories on the summit of Mauna Kea with a primary mirror in diameter. In 2015 it was only observed for 26 days, which is a very short observation arc for a trans-Neptunian object as objects far from the Sun move very slowly across the sky. It is calculated that it will remain in the constellation of Aries from 1994 until 2077. It was announced on 13 March 2018 alongside several other trans-Neptunian objects with a current heliocentric distance greater than 50 AU. The trans-Neptunian objects , , and V774104 were also discovered by this team on 13 October 2015. == Orbit == The orbit of is poorly constrained, as it has only been observed 8 times over less than 1 year due to how dim it is. At a visual apparent magnitude of 26.2, it is about 75 million times fainter than what can be seen with the naked eye, and it is one of the dimmest trans-Neptunian objects ever observed, only being able to be seen by the largest modern telescopes. It is estimated to have come to perihelion (closest approach to the Sun) around the year . == Distance from the Sun == The precise distance of still remains unknown due to its poorly understood orbit. It is currently outbound roughly from the Sun, and will require further observations to better refine the orbit. The object has not been observed since October 2016. At magnitude 26, it is only observable with a small number of telescopes that are capable of following it up and refining its orbit. It is expected to come to opposition in the constellation of Aries around 3 November 2018 when it should have a solar elongation of roughly 175¬∞. There are only 4 known minor planets further from the Sun than under its nominal orbit as of March 2018, (90.9 AU), Eris (96.1 AU), (123.8 AU), and \\"FarFarOut\\" (~140 AU). Observed Solar System objects that periodically become more distant than 89 AU from the Sun include (which is much larger in size), , , , and . There are 804 known objects that have aphelia more than 89 AU from the Sun as of March 2018. This distance is about double the outer limit of the torus-shaped Kuiper belt that lies outside Neptune's orbit. Far beyond this region is the vast spherical Oort cloud enshrouding the Solar System, whose presence was deduced from the orbits of long-period comets. Another distant object publicly known as V774104 was purportedly discovered at around 103 AU on 13 October 2015 by the same team, but public press releases may have confused its distance with (V302126). Study of the population of Solar System objects that are significantly more distant than will likely require new instruments. The proposed Whipple spacecraft mission is designed to determine the outer limit of the Kuiper belt and directly detect Oort cloud objects out to 10,000 AU. Such objects are too small to detect with current telescopes except during stellar occultations. The proposal involves use of a wide field of view and rapid recording cadence to allow detection of many such events. == Notes  References  External links == * List Of Centaurs and Scattered-Disk Objects by the Minor Planet Center * * # Category:Minor planet object articles (unnumbered) # 20151013 ","title":"2015 TH367"},{"id":"56839330","text":"The 1892 United States presidential election in West Virginia took place on November 8, 1892.

This case pertains to Hooda's alleged role for misusing his position as then Chief Minister of Haryana to cause wrongful gains to the Associated Journals Limited (AJL) and corresponding loss to the Government of Haryana, by illegally allotting a government plot of land worth several crores rupees (billions) to AJL for INR 59 lakh (5.9 million). Then Chief Minister, Hooda, was also the chairman of HUDA, a government entity which re-allotted the plot to AJL in 2005 in violations of rules and against the advise of the HUDA officials.

Plot was originally allotted to AJL in 1982. As per the rules, ownership was repossessed by the government in 1992 due to non- construction by AJL within the mandatory period. AJL's applications to have the plot re-allotted were dismissed in 1995 and again in 1996. AJL waited for a favorable entity to come to power for getting the re-allotment.

Hence, as per the rules the land should have been returned to the government, but the ownership was illegally transferred to AJL/National Herald by Hooda government in 2013.

As per the chargesheet, the plot was originally allotted in 1982, but allotment automatically lapsed as no construction was carried out within the prescribed ten years, resulting in HUDA (now called HSVP) retaking the ownership of the plot in 1992. Chargesheet states that Bhupinder Singh Hooda, who was then chairman of HUDA and chief minister of Haryana, re-allotted the plot in 2005 at 1982 price with interest by violating the rules, resulting in loss of INR 620,000 to the govt of Haryana.CBI files chargesheet against ex-Haryana CM Bhupinder Singh Hooda, Congress leader Motilal Vora in AJL land allotment case, Economic Times, 1 December 2018.

It is found throughout the Amur basin in eastern Asia to China, the Korean peninsula, and Japan. Currently, little research has been done regarding this species, therefore, information regarding it is limited. The common name of this freshwater fish is the spotted steed. Its scientific name is Hemibarbus maculatus. Hemibarbus is from ancient Greek and means \\"half\\". Maculatus, is Latin and means \\"spotted\\". == Taxonomy and classification == The spotted steed belongs to the kingdom Animalia, the phylum Chordata, and the class Actinopterygii. Further, it belongs to the order Cypriniformes, and the subfamily Gobioninae. == Identification and characteristics == The spotted steed can be distinguished from other similar species through various physical and behavioral characteristics. The spotted steed exhibits 7-11 large blackish spots on each flank, under developed lips, and fins placed in a specific order. Specifically, their dorsal fin is closer to the tip of their snout than their caudal-fin base. Also, they have six and a half branched anal-fin rays. == Diet == The spotted steed is known to feed on benthic crustaceans, insects and mollusks. They have been recorded to feed mainly on mollusks during the summer and crustaceans during the winter. == Reproduction and lifecycle == The spotted steed becomes mature at 3 years of age. They naturally breed during May and June. Their eggs are deposited among aquatic vegetation and develop in approximately four days. Then, the larvae live in the pelagic stage for their first six days of life. == Native range == The spotted steed is native to China, Korea, Japan and the Amur basin. == Non- native range == The spotted steed was first introduced to the former USSR accidentally. It is believed to have invaded the freshwater habitats of some lakes and rivers in the Russian Federation and Russian Far East. The invasion was likely the result of the species accidentally being introduced with Chinese carp fry from the Yangtze River, China in 1988. == Current distribution == Some countries the species is found in includes Cambodia, China, Chongqing, Guanxi, Guizhou, Hebei, Heilongjang, Henan, Hubei, Hunan, Jiangsu, Jiangxi, Nei Menggu, Shanghai, Sichuan, Yunnan, Zhejiang, Japan, Korea, Laos, Mongolia, Taiwan, Uzbekistan, and Vietnam. Specifically, in Mongolia, the species is widely distributed in Lake Buir and Rivers Onon, Kherlen, and Khalkhiin. Outside of Mongolia, the species is distributed throughout the Amur and Yangtze drainage (Russia, China) and Taiwan. Some of the European areas it has been accidentally introduced into include the Russian Federation and Russian Far East. == Modes of distribution and introduction == The main mode of distribution of this species has been through accidental introduction. Specifically, the introduction occurred indirectly when Chinese carp fry was purposely introduced from Yangtze River to the former USSR. Another mode of distribution the species has used to invade other habitats is that it was intentionally introduced in rivers of various Asian countries. Lastly, throughout most of Asia, natural dispersal has occurred; this is especially true in China, Korea, Japan, and countries connected by the Amur River basin. == Ecological role == The spotted steed has been recorded to be a serious competitor and threat to the native benthic fish where it is introduced. This was especially true when it was introduced into the former USSR. Some impacts this species has had on habitats include causing habitat alteration, modification of natural benthic communities, negatively impacting aquaculture and fisheries, causing a reduction in native biodiversity, and engaging in competition with native species. The spotted steed is an excellent invader due to its rapid growth rate and higher fecundity than native fish species. Within its native ecosystem it engages in competition, however, it does not have as strong of an effect on other species as it does in the habitats it invades. == Factors in establishment == Some factors that are known to influence the successful establishment of the spotted steed are its high fecundity and rapid growth rate. The species also has a very non-specific diet that consists of snails, aquatic insects, clams, and small fish. As such, it is able to obtain its resources easier than other species with more specific diets. These factors aid in the species ability to invade other habitats. == Benefits and threats == The spotted steed threatens its newly established habitat by harming aquaculture and fisheries, reducing native biodiversity, and causing loss of native species. It benefits the newly established habitat by becoming a part of the food chain and acting as a food source/prey to larger predators. == Control methods and status of mitigation == There is currently not an active control program for this species. Therefore, the status of mitigation is ‚Äúno action\\". ==References== * Category:Hemibarbus Category:Fish described in 1871 ","title":"Spotted steed"},{"id":"56839757","text":"Hemibarbus medius is a species of small freshwater fish in the family Cyprinidae.

It is Thessaly's most important regional line after the Palaiofarsalos‚ÄìKalambaka railway. As a branch line of the Piraeus‚ÄìPlaty railway, its western terminus at Larissa provides connections to Athens and Thessaloniki. ==Course== The line branches off at Larissa and continues to the southeast through Kypseli, Armenio and Stefanovikeio before heading south to Velestino, where it meets the former metre-gauge line to Kalambaka. It then advances eastwards from Melissiatika to its eastern terminus at Volos. ==Stations== The stations on the Larissa‚ÄìVolos railway serve are: * Larissa railway station (connecting to Athens, Thessaloniki and suburban Thessaloniki) * Kypseli railway station * Armenio railway station * Stefanovikeio railway station * Velestino railway station * Melissiatika railway station (services suspended) * Volos railway station ==History== Construction of the metre-gauge railway began in 1882 and the line was inaugurated on 22 April 1884, as part of the Thessaly Railways. The project was designed and led by Italian-born Evaristo de Chirico, father of the famous painter Giorgio de Chirico, and Greek banker Theodoros Mavrogordatos. The original route was somewhat different from the current one, passing through the Volos quarry and proceeding to the centre of the city, where it met the narrow-gauge Pelion railway. In 1960, the decision was made to convert the line to standard gauge, thus speeding up travel times by allowing through traffic to bypass Larissa via the Piraeus‚ÄìPlaty railway. ==Services== The Larissa‚ÄìVolos railway is used by the following passenger services: * TrainOSE regional service between Larissa and Volos. The journey time is 48 minutes. ==Future== The line is currently being upgraded with the installation of railway signalling, electrification and ETCS systems.

Predated by insurrectionists such as Fran√ßois Mackandal, Vincent Og√© and Dutty Boukman, the rebellion would become organized and consolidated under the leadership of Toussaint Louverture; succeeded by Dessalines. The now full- fledged fighting force would utilize their sheer manpower and strategic capacity to overwhelm French troops, ensuring the Haitian Revolution as the most successful of its kind. ==Etymology== Despite its name, the moniker had no relation to the indigenous populations of Hispaniola, as the native Ta√≠no no longer existed in any discernible number at the advent of the Haitian Revolution. Rather, the word indig√®ne was used in French as a euphemism for non-white (cf. indig√©nat). == Pre-Haitian Revolution == In the late 18th century and early 19th century, the French colony of Saint-Domingue; later established as Haiti post-revolution, was founded on the western half of the island of Hispaniola in the Caribbean. An agriculturally potent landmass, the colony was regarded as a highly valuable asset to France and the shining star of its imperial crown, notably producing most of the world's sugar and coffee by the 1780s.#Lawless, Robert, and James A.

Despite their free status, the gens de couleur were not safe from the discrimination that resulted from their skin color; petits blancs (poor whites) were unable to overcome the held resentment towards them because of their wealth and power gained by the ability to buy other slaves. In 1789, The Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen gave hope to the gens de couleur that they would have better living conditions and rights that they did not have, especially now that France would look at every citizen equally, regardless of position or race[7]. However, the vague interpretation of the Declaration would leave the gens de couleur unchanged in terms of social position; in fact, the grand blancs would take advantage of the Declaration and use it to gain independence from trade regulations. In addition, slavery was not officially abolished. Since the 1780s, free men of color such as Julien Raimond and Vincent Oge had tried to get free people of color the rights that belonged to them by representing the colonies in the National Assembly. One of these rights was the right to vote; however, the free people of color were still denied of this right. With 300 armed gens de couleur and affranchis, Vincent Oge led an insurrection, which attempted to disarm the white men of Grande-Rivi√®re[1][8]. Taking place in 29 October 1790, this event became known as the Oge Rebellion, which ended up in a failure. Oge and his rebels were executed on the wheel, and his barbaric death would cause even more tension amongst the free people of color and eventually the enslaved, who already had the mindset of revolution[1][8]. == Haitian Revolution == Battle of Verti√®res in 1803 The wealthy gen de couleur were given citizenship in May 1791, which caused tension between them and the grands blancs, and as a result, fighting broke out between the two groups. Because of this, the poorer African Americans like the slaves were also resentful of grands blancs, who were in the way of what was the beginning of equality for everyone in Saint- Domingue. The first rebellion broke out in August 1791, when religious Voodoo priest Dutty Boukman ordered the slaves to attack Bois Ca√Øman[4]. While they were seeking their rights as Frenchmen, the slaves also engaged in acts of cruelty, such as rape and murder against the white plantation owners. In a couple of weeks, the number of slaves participating in the rebellion was over 100,000. By 1792, a third of Saint-Domingue was under the control of the slaves, and France was ready to quell the rebellion[9]. They gave political rights to the gen de couleur, and sent L√©ger-F√©licit√© Sonthonax to Saint- Domingue as its new governor; he was a man against slavery and the plantation owners[4]. While all of this was happening, Toussaint Louverture was training his own army in the ways of guerilla warfare, and helping the Spanish, who declared war against France in 1793; both the Spaniards and the British were helping the rebels in hopes that they could take over Saint-Domingue and use its resources. Louverture, alongside Dessalines and his army, would go back to the French in 1794, a while after France abolished slavery in the colonies [1][2]. Later, Louverture would establish a Haitian constitution and declare himself governor for life, but Napoleon Bonaparte did not accept this claim, and locked up Louverture, where he would die in prison[1][2]. In 1803. Dessalines took over, and by then, the army that fought in the Haitian Revolution was renamed as the Arm√©e Indig√®ne. Saint-Domingue's flag changed to a red and blue flag with the slogan ‚ÄúLiberte a la Mort‚Äù (Liberty or Death) in white lettering [3]. Bonaparte would try to reestablish the slave regime by sending general Charles Leclerc to Saint-Domingue, but would fail to stop the Arm√©e Indig√®ne, because of an outbreak of yellow fever[4][10]. Because of this, the Arm√©e Indig√®ne was now known as the army that freed Saint-Domingue. == Casualties and Lasting Impact == While the actions of the Arm√©e Indig√®ne were fueled by Enlightenment principles that advocated for the equality of all Frenchmen, the Haitian Revolution had many casualties; both sides suffered losses from their own violence. The Haitians suffered about 200,000 casualties, which made them the group that lost the most. The British and French together suffered about 120,000 casualties. Dessalines would later be known for the 1804 massacre of the French, which lasted for 2 months and even affected innocents like women and children. However, despite the violence that occurred, the actions of the Arm√©e Indig√®ne in the Haitian Revolution would serve as inspiration to the slaves in the United States, as Haiti would finally be recognized by France in 1825, and later by the United States, in 1862[10]. == List of generals  Commanders-in-chief === * Toussaint Louverture, Commander-in-chief (1793-180, governor-general of Saint-Domingue 1801-1803) * Jean-Jacques Dessalines, Commander-in-chief (1803-1804, first president and later emperor of Haiti) === Division generals === * Henri Christophe * Alexandre P√©tion * Augustin Clervaux * Nicolas Geffrard * Andre Vernet * Louis Gabart === Brigadier-generals === * Paul Romain * √âtienne √âlie Gerin * Fran√ßois Capois * Daut * Jean-Louis Fran√ßois, * Laurent F√©rou * Pierre Cang√© * L.

His work is largely abstract, combining influences of his Chinese heritage with Abstract Expressionism. == Early life == Chuang Che was born in Beijing, where his father was working as a scholar and calligrapher at the National Palace Museum. It was his father who introduced him to calligraphy, a medium which later had a profound influence on his art. In his twenties, Chuang studied fine arts at National Taiwan Normal University, where he learned about Eastern painting traditions. Che felt that there was more that could be brought to Eastern painting, and so when he graduated in 1958, he joined several other artists, including Liu Guosong, Fong Chung-Ray, and Sun Duoci, and became one of the first members of the Fifth Moon Group (which had been founded two years earlier). The group sought to modernize Chinese art, making it contemporary and straying from the old traditions. These ideals appealed to Chuang, who wanted to add something modern to the Eastern sensibilities he had been taught first by his father and then in school. == Artistic career == In 1966, Chuang was awarded a John D. Rockefeller III Foundation travel grant, which allowed him to move to the United States and study art. He first moved to Iowa, studying at the University of Iowa. However, he shortly after moved to New York, becoming the assistant of the sculptor Seymour Lipton. In New York, Che was surrounded by contemporary artists, exposing him to Western painting styles - the most popular of the time being Abstract Expressionism. He was inspired by these contemporary styles, and decided to have his art act as a sort of confluence of East and West. He began painting works that were inspired both by his traditional Eastern education, often evoking calligraphy, and by the bold abstractions of Abstract Expressionism that he encountered in New York. His work was successful, catching the eye of many museums and galleries. He showed his work around the U.S. and Europe, and in 1992 a Retrospective Exhibition for him was held at the Taipei Fine Arts Museum. Chuang lives in New York, working in his studio in the East Village. His work has been shown as part of Asia Week New York. == Major public collections == * Taipei Fine Arts Museum, Taipei, Taiwan * Cleveland Museum of Art, Cleveland, Ohio, United States * Cornell University, Ithaca, New York, United States * The Detroit Museum, Detroit, Michigan, United States * Detroit Institute of Arts, Michigan, United States * Hong Kong Museum of Art, Hong Kong, China * National Museum of History, Taipei, Taiwan * Saginaw Art Museum, Michigan, United States * Spencer Museum of Art, The University of Kansas, Lawrence, Kansas, United States * University of Michigan Museum of Art, Ann Arbor, Michigan, United States * Shanghai Art Museum, Shanghai, China * Guangdong Museum of Art, Guangdong, China * Museum of Central Academy of Fine Arts, China * List Visual Arts Center at MIT, Cambridge, Massachusetts, United States == Selected solo exhibitions == * 2019 Vazieux  Art Gallery Paris, Paris, France *2016 Galerie Sabine Vazieux and Galerie Herv√© Courtaigne, Paris, France *2015 Taipei Fine Arts Museum, Taipei, Taiwan *2012 Asia Art Center, Taipei, Taiwan * 2007 National Art Museum of China, Beijing, China * 2006 Asia Art Center, Taipei, Taiwan * 2005 National Museum of History, Taipei, Taiwan * 2005 Kuandu Museum of Fine Art, Taipei National University of the Arts, Taiwan * 2002 Guangdong Art Museum, China * 1980 National Museum of History, Taipei, Ta√Øwan * 1977 Kalamazoo Institute of Art, Kalamazoo, Michigan, United States * 1977 Saginaw Art Museum, Michigan, United States * 1972 Newark Art Museum, Newark, New Jersey, United States * 1972 Montclair Art Museum, Montclair, New Jersey, United States * 1970 Fine Art Museum, Flint, Michigan, United States * 1968 Taiwan Provincial Museum, Taipei, Taiwan * 1965 National Taiwan Arts Hall, Taipei, Taiwan == Major group exhibitions == * Museum of Ixelles, Brussels, Belgium *Forsythe Gallery, Ann Arbor, Michigan, Unites States * Francine Seders Gallery, Seattle, Washington, United States * Magic Touch Gallery, Taipei, Taiwan * Lung Men Gallery, Taipei, Taiwan * De Graaf Gallery, Chicago, Illinois, United States * Alisan Art Gallery, Hong Kong, China * Paidea Gallery, Los Angeles, California, United States * Shaw-Rimington Gallery, Toronto, Canada == Catalogues == * Chuang Che.

The scullers won a regatta in Hanover, a three-nation contest in Klagenfurt, and then the German national championships in Hanover. This qualified them for the 1954 European Rowing Championships, held shortly later in Amsterdam, where they won gold in the double sculls. This was the first medal for Germany after the war and was thus the reason for much celebration for the once dominant rowing nation. In December 1954, H√§ge and Schneider received the Silbernes Lorbeerblatt, Germany's highest sports award, from the nation's president Theodor Heuss.

He showed very promising form as a two-year-old in 1912 when he won four races including the Dewhurst Stakes as well as finishing third in the Middle Park Plate. In the following spring he was placed first in the 2000 Guineas despite serious doubts about whether he had actually crossed the line in front, and was then awarded second place in an extremely controversial race for the Epsom Derby. He went on to win the Prince of Wales's Stakes and finish second in the Eclipse Stakes before running unplaced when favourite for the St Leger. After his retirement from racing he had some success as a breeding stallion. ==Background== Louvois was a bay horse with a narrow white blaze bred and owned by the financier Walter Raphael. The colt was sent into training with Dawson Waugh at his Somerville Lodge stable in Newmarket, Suffolk. Waugh had trained Raphael's filly Tagalie to win the Derby in 1912. Physically, Louvois was described as \\"not very impressive... built on slightly greyhound lines, tucked up and with a very light middle piece\\" but with a \\"very honest head\\". His sire Isinglass was an outstanding racehorse who won the Triple Crown in 1893. The best of his other progeny included Cherry Lass and Glass Doll. Louvois' dam St Louvaine, who had been bought by Raphael in 1901 for 1200 guineas, also produced Louviers, who finished second in the 1909 Epsom Derby. She was a granddaughter of Ulster Queen whose other descendants included Cap and Bells II. ==Racing career1912: two-year-old season=== Louvois began his racing career with an easy win against moderate opposition in the Khedive Plate at Newmarket Racecourse but in the Prince of Wales Stakes at Goodwood Racecourse in late July or early August when he failed to recover from a bad start and finished last of the four runners. His four remaining races were all at Newmarket in autumn. In early October he recorded two comfortable victories, beating Sun Yat in the Buckenham Stakes, before turning out again a day later to take the Boscawen Stakes. In the Middle Park Plate over six furlongs on 17 October Louvois finished third behind Craganour and Shogun, beaten six lengths by the winner. Two weeks later, ridden William Saxby he started at odds of 7/4 for the seven furlong Dewhurst Stakes and won from Sanquhar with Rock Flint in third. After the race he was described as \\"an improving colt that is likely to develop into a stayer\\". In the Free Handicap, a ranking of the year's best two-year-olds, Louvois was given a weight of 120 pounds, making him ten pounds inferior to the top-rated Craganour. ===1913: three-year-old season=== In the spring of 1913 it was reported that Louvois had made exceptionally good progress over the winter. On 30 April, in front of a cowd which included King George V the colt stated a 25/1 outsider in a fifteen-runner field for the 105th running of the 2000 Guineas over the Rowley Mile course. Craganour, ridden by Saxby, started favourite ahead of Fairy King, with the other fancied runners were Sanquhar, Roseworthy, Bachelor's Wedding, Day Comet and Radiant. Ridden by the American jockey Johnny Reiff, Louvois tracked the leaders as Craganour set the pace, before making steady progress approaching the last quarter mile. In the final furlong Craganour appeared to be going very easily along the rail but Louvois maintained his run down the centre of the wide straight. The judge, a Mr Robinson, called Louvois the winner by a short head from Craganour, with the 50/1 outsider Meeting House two lengths back in third. The majority of the observers, however, disagreed with the judge verdict, believing that Craganour had won by about half a length, while others claimed that he was almost two lengths clear. It was suggested that the judge had been the victim of an \\"optical delusion\\". On 21 May Louvois was moved up in distance for the Newmarket Stakes over ten furlongs in which he was ridden by Frank O'Neill, and ran third behind Craganour and Sun Yat in a race which reportedly saw a good deal of bumping and boring between the first three finishers. Despite his defeat Louvois was regarded as one of the leading contenders for the Epsom Derby, run over one and a half miles on 4 June. In another jockey change, Saxby rode Louvois while Reiff took the ride on the favoured Craganour. The race proved to be exceptionally rough and controversial one and ended in a six-horse \\"blanket finish\\" with Craganour, Aboyeur, Day Comet, Louvois, Great Sport and Nimbus all finishing within a length of each other. The racecourse judge called Craganour the winner from Aboyeur and Louvois, ignoring the third-placed Day Comet who had been blocked from his view by other horses. After an objection and an inquiry by the racecourse stewards, Craganour was disqualified and Louvois (who had been one of the chief sufferers from the barging in the straight) promoted to second. Two weeks after his run at Epsom, Louvois contested the Prince of Wales's Stakes (then a race confined to three-year olds and run over thirteen furlongs) at Royal Ascot and won at odds of 4/9. On 18 July the colt was matched against older horses in the Eclipse Stakes over ten furlongs at Sandown Park and finished second behind the four-year-old Tracery with Bachelor's Wedding in third. At Liverpool on 25 July Louvois finished third behind the four-year-olds Junior and Kettle Jack in the ten- furlong Atlantic Stakes. On 3 September he finished second to Roseworthy in the Breeders' St Leger over eleven furlongs at Derby Racecourse. A week later Louvois started 9/4 favourite for the St Leger over fourteen and a half furlongs at Doncaster Racecourse but after leading in the early stages, he dropped from contention in the straight and finished unplaced behind Night Hawk. Louvois ended the season with earnings of ¬£9,075, making him the fifth most financially successful horse of the year behind Jest, The Tetrarch, Tracery and Cantilever. ==Assessment and honours== In their book, A Century of Champions, based on the Timeform rating system, John Randall and Tony Morris rated Louvois an \\"inferior\\" winner of the 2000 Guineas. ==Stud record== At the end of his racing career Louvois was retired to become a breeding stallion. The best of his offspring was probably St Louis, who won the 2000 Guineas in 1922. His last foals were born in 1927. Louvois died in March 1927 at the Lochbroom Stud, The Curragh, Ireland. ==PedigreeReferences== Category:1910 racehorse births Category:1927 racehorse deaths Category:Racehorses bred in the United Kingdom Category:Racehorses trained in the United Kingdom Category:Thoroughbred family 1-s Category:2000 Guineas winners ","title":"Louvois (horse)"},{"id":"56840416","text":"Signature.

This may be a legal obligation required of the company, to ensure that the business understands, and can act on, the health and safety risks that might occur during their particular type of work. == United Kingdom == The forerunner to the Competent Person Scheme in the UK was the 1991 Building Regulations Act, which enabled gas-heating appliance installers to self-certify that their work was safe and legal, rather than needing external checking. Then from 2002-2010, a series of Competent Person Schemes were implemented widely in the buildings sector to enable builders to self-certify that their work meets regulations in eighteen different fields.Changes to the Conditions of Authorisation for Building Regulations Competent Person Self-certification Schemes: Final impact assessment (London: Department for Communities and Local Government, June 2012), pp. 3-5. . By 2019, an estimated 85% of all building work requiring the notification of building control bodies was self-certified, and therefore no longer subject to external inspection. In 2012, a UK government report found that 'although the reports received indicate that most schemes have been operating effectively and have proved to be a success, the latest report in 2009 found that some schemes were not complying fully with their conditions of authorisation or achieving a sufficiently high level of compliance with the Building Regulations'. Recognition of competence is defined as requiring \\"sufficient training and experience or knowledge and other qualities\\" to be able to effectively oversee health and safety in the business, although specialised industries may have additional, more specific requirements.

According to a review in Times Higher Education that described Age of Lone Wolf Terrorism as an \\"genuinely indispensable study of today‚Äôs steadily increasing terrorist threat,\\" the book's \\"pivotal contention\\" that the radicalization of lone wolf terrorists exhibits discernible patterns that include ‚Äúthe integration of personal and political grievances; an affinity with online sympathizers and/or extremist groups,\\" and \\"triggering events that, oftentimes, cause a dramatic change in behavior‚Äù. Hamm and Spaaij constructed a database funded by the United States Department of Justice in which they identified 124 instances of lone wolf terrorist attacks in the United States between 1940 and 2016; the list includes \\"about\\" 30 planned attacks that are known not to have been carrier out, or that have been identified as FBI sting operations, or as hoaxes. Hamm and Spaaij defined lone wolf terrorism narrowly; they required an attacker to be politically motivated, this excluded, for example, mass shooters such as Adam Lanza, whose motive appeared to be entirely personal. And they had to have acted entirely alone, excluding cases like the 2015 San Bernardino attack carried out by a married couple, and the Boston Marathon bombing, carried out by a pair of brothers. Kris Millett (2017): Hamm & Spaaij ‚Äôs The Age of Lone Wolf Terrorism and the prospect of a heterodox terrorism studies (book review), Critical Studies on Terrorism, DOI:10.1080/17539153.2017.1384154 Kris Millett (2017): Hamm & Spaaij‚Äôs The Age of Lone Wolf Terrorism and the prospect of a heterodox terrorism studies (book review), Critical Studies on Terrorism, DOI:10.1080/17539153.2017.1384154. The tightness of this definition was widely criticized. ==Findings== Hamm and Spaaij use data they compiled, and examinations of the lone wolf phenomenon by other researches to reach a series of conclusions. They conclude that lone wolf terrorist attacks are becoming more common in the United States, and that casualty tolls, both of injuries and of deaths, has risen steadily over the decades since 1940, and risen sharply in the 2010s. They note that the lone wolf terrorist who killed the highest number of victims was Joseph Paul Franklin who carried out a series of attacks in which he targeted black and Jewish Americans. They also show that in recent years lone wolves have more frequently targeted uniformed police and military personnel. They conclude that although as of 2018, white supremacist ideologies continue to account for the largest share of attacks, but that jihadist motivation has risen rapidly. They conclude that lone wolf terrorists are usually unemployed, single, white males with a criminal record who tend to be older, to have less education, and more likely to have a record of mental illness than other violent criminals. In particularly, they demonstrate that in recent years such recent attacks have followed incidents in which the lone wolf uses physical violence against women. Their data demonstrates that although explosives and guns were the most common weapons used by lone wolves from the 1940s through the 1980s, the use of guns has skyrocketed and they are now the weapon most commonly employed by lone wolf terrorists. They show that most lone wolves tell someone that they intend to carry out an attack. From the 1940s through the end of the century 84% of lone wolves did so, since 76% have done so. ==Criticism of law enforcement== Hamm and Spaaij single out FBI sting operations for special criticism. Book reviewer Kris Millett praises their \\"devastatingly effective\\" use of data to \\"argue that those captured in the sting operations did not display the personal characteristics common to the radicalisation of lone wolf terrorists.\\" ==Reception== Reviewer James Mills criticizes Hamm and Spaaij for using narrow criteria that eliminate lone wolf pairs such as Rizwan Farook and Tashfeen Malik and the Tsarnaev brothers from inclusion on their list, even those they meet the definition in all other ways. Mills also criticized their argument that lone wolf terrorism is preventable since ‚Äúviolent radicalization is a social process involving behavior that can be observed, comprehended and modeled,‚Äù arguing that the influences on human action are complex and not easily modeled and predicted, while praising the author's date gathering.

This scam resulted in INR1500 crore (15 billion) loss to the farmers of Manesar and neighbouring village in Gurugram district whose 688 acre land was being acquired at a low rate for \\"public purpose\\". This land was later licensed to real estate companies after granting them out of term favours and concessions. Private builders grabbed 400 acres land from farmers at throwaway price based on the threat of acquisition by the government. Once this land was bought by the builders, Hooda government released this land from the acquisition process in the favor of builders instead of the original owners.

CBI is currently investigating the case further. Hooda and 33 others have been charged in the special CBI court. Next CBI court hearing against Hooda and 33 others will be from 19 April 2018. There are a total of 6 CBI cases and several other vigilance department investigations against Hooda underway.Hooda under investigation by CBI in several cases, Navbharat Times, 13 Mar 2018. Central Bureau of Investigation is investigating several scams, mostly related to illegal land grab, that took place during his rule in Haryana. These investigations include the Robert Vadra DLF land grab scam, Gurugram Rajiv Gandhi Trust land grab scam, Sonepat-Kharkhoda IMT land scam case, Garhi Sampla Uddar Gagan land scam, AJL-National Herald Panchkula land grab case, AJL-National Herald Panchkula land grab scam, Haryana Forestry scam case and Haryana Raxil drug purchase scam. He has been already chargesheeted in the Manesar-Gurugram land scam, while other cases are still under investigation (c. March 2018).CBI to probe two more Hooda govt land deals, The Tribune, 14 March 2018. Hooda acquired land from the illiterate poor farmers at throwaway prices in the name of \\"public interest\\" and licensed it to builders by granting them out-of-turn favors, which caused the exponential rise in the land price resulting in big gains for the builders. During his 10-year rule as Chief Minister, Hooda, licensed a massive 24,825 acres of land compared to just 8,550.32 acres by successive Chief Ministers in the 23 years preceding Hooda rule.Hooda‚Äôs land largesse for pvt builder ‚Äòclear fraud‚Äô, SC restores it to HUDA, Firstpost, 15 May 2016. ==DetailsModus of scam=== Builders coerce farmers to sell their land by getting the government to use the Section 4 of the land law to have a government notification issued to the farmer that their land is required for the \\"public purpose\\". Builders try to acquire this land by offering a small premium above the government‚Äôs rate for the acquisition of the land. If landowners farmers still resist the sale, then Section 6 of land law is applied by declaring the government's intention to acquire land, which forces the reluctant farmers to sell the land to builders at small premium. Once the land is acquired by the builders, government cancels the acquisition process and releases the land to new build owners, along with the change in land use (CLU) permission to build residential and industrial building on the farm land. This results in steep rise in the land prices, resulting in massive gains for the builders, opportunity cost loss to the farmers and land tax revenue loss to the government. In 2004, Hooda government issued the notification to acquire the 688 acre land for the IMT Manesar. By the time the government retracted the notification, the builders had managed to buy 400 acres for a total price of Rs 100 crore, as opposed to the market value of Rs 1,600 crore. Private builders grabbed this 400 acres land from farmers at throwaway price based on the threat of acquisition by the government. Once this land was bought by the builders, Hooda government released this land from the acquisition process in the favor of builders instead of the original owners. Market value of this 400 acre land was nearly INR4 crore per acre or total INR1600 crore, which was acquired by the builders at only INR100 crore, causing a loss of INR1500 crore to innocent farmer owners of Manesar, Naurangpur and Lakhnoula villages.Manesar land scam: Ex-Haryana CM Bhupinder Singh Hooda chargesheeted, Times of India, 2 Feb 2018. ===Restoration of land to government by the Supreme Court === On 17 September 2015, CBI had registered an FIR under Indian Penal Code sections 420 (cheating), 465 (forgery), 467 (forgery of valuable security), 468 (forgery for purpose of cheating), 471 (using as genuine a forged document) and 120-B (criminal conspiracy) and under section 13 of the Prevention of Corruption Act.

It was initially created by Randolph as a poem before evolving into an oral folk song and was only published in definitive written form in 1914. == Background == After the Confederacy's loss to the U.S. in the American Civil War, \\"I'm a Good Ol' Rebel\\" was created as a poem by former Confederate major James Innes Randolph in the 1860s. Its music was based upon the Minstrel song \\"Joe Bowers\\". It is not known who initially created the music, with a claim in 1864 attributing it to \\"J.R.T.\\" and an 1866 sheet music copy ironically dedicating it to Thad Stevens. \\"I'm a Good Ol' Rebel\\" was first published as a poem locally in Maryland in 1898 but was published as a song nationwide in the April 4, 1914 edition of Collier's Weekly. The song is anti-American in tone, expressing hatred towards the U.S. and its national symbols such as the U.S. Constitution and U.S. Declaration of Independence. It reflected a view held by some ex- Confederates who were reluctant to accept Reconstruction with the United States and an expression of the bitterness and anger they felt after the Confederacy had lost the American Civil War to the U.S. However, it is speculated that the song did not reflect Randolph's personal views and was intended \\"... to illustrate the irreconcilable spirit of the illiterate in some sections\\", as it had been sung and passed through oral tradition throughout Southern bars. The published version initially contained only four verses, but individual performers have added their own verses to reflect their own opinions on the United States. == Legacy == The song became known outside the United States. The American-born Consuelo Montagu, Duchess of Manchester, once performed the song uncensored for the future King Edward VII when he was Prince of Wales in London. Upon hearing the song, he later requested a repeat performance of \\"...that fine American song with the cuss words in it.\\" In 2011, the band Junto released a parody of the song as an anti-Barack Obama song titled \\"I'm A Good Ole American\\". ==Modern Versions== The soundtrack for the film The Long Riders (1980), (a biopic about the James-Younger Gang), musician/composer Ry Cooder arranged a version consisting of 4 verses. In 1991, a version was released on the Songs of the Civil War album performed by Hoyt Axton. ==Lyrics References == Category:Songs of the American Civil War Category:Culture of the Southern United States Category:Confederate States of America Category:American folk songs Category:Anti-Americanism ","title":"I'm a Good Ol' Rebel"},{"id":"56840835","text":"SS Mira may refer to: * , a ship that convoyed with the icebreaker Sampo during the Finnish Civil War * , a ship owned by Holm & Molzen * , a ship sunk in May 1943 * , a ship sunk in November 1916 * , a ship sunk in 1949 * , a ship that rescued some of the crew from the wreck of Anna in 1914 ==See also== * Mira (disambiguation) Category:Ship names ","title":"SS Mira"},{"id":"56840854","text":"Young S.

Selecting treatments based on factors such as age, body-surface area, weight, gender, or disease stage has been shown to incompletely address this problem, so medical professionals are shifting toward using patient genomic data to select optimal treatments. Now, an increasing amount of evidence shows that epigenetics also plays an important role in determining the safety and efficacy of drug treatment in patients. Epigenetics is a bridge that connects individual genetics and environmental factors to explain some aspects of gene expression. Specifically, environmental factors have the potential to alter one's epigenetic mechanisms in order to influence the expression of genes. For example, smoking cigarettes can alter the DNA methylation state of genes and thereby expression of genes through different mechanisms. Epigenetic changes in genes caused by factors such as environment can result in abnormal gene expression and the initiation of diseases. The progression of diseases further alters the epigenetic patterns of the whole genome. While epigenetic changes are generally long lasting, and in some cases permanent, there is still the potential to change the epigenetic state of a gene. Thus, drugs have been developed to target aberrant epigenetic patterns in cells to either activate or suppress the epigenetically modified gene expression gene expression. This is known as epigenetic therapy. Besides being drug targets, epigenetic changes are also used as diagnostic and prognostic indicators to predict disease risk and progression, and this could be beneficial for the improvement of personalized medicine. The development of the Human Epigenome Project and advances in epigenomics has given rise to a burgeoning field known as pharmacoepigenetics. Pharmacoepigenetics was initially developed to study how epigenetic patterns of drug transporters, drug-metabolizing enzymes, and nuclear receptors affect individuals‚Äô response to the drug. Now, pharmacoepigenetics has an additional focus: the development of therapeutic epidrugs that can make changes to the epigenome in order to lessen the cause or symptoms of a disease in an individual. Even though a large gap still remains between the knowledge of epigenetic modifications on drug metabolism mechanisms and clinical applications, pharmacoepigenetics has become a rapidly growing field that has the potential to play an important role in personalized medicine. In order to develop effective epigenetic therapies, it is important to understand the underlying epigenetic mechanisms and the proteins that are involved. Various mechanisms and modifications play a role in epigenetic remodeling and signaling, including DNA methylation, histone modification, covalent modifications, RNA transcripts, microRNAs, mRNA, siRNA, and nucleosome positioning. In particular, scientists have extensively studied the associations of DNA methylation, histone modifications, regulatory microRNA with the development of diseases. DNA methylation is the most widely studied epigenetic mechanism. Most of them occur at CpG sites. DNA methyltransferase is recruited to the site and adds methyl groups to the cytosine of the CpG dinucleotides. This allows the methyl-CpG binding proteins to bind to the methylated site and cause downregulation of genes. Histone modification is mainly achieved by modifying the N-terminal tails of histones. The mechanisms include acetylation, methylation, phosphorylation, unbiquitination, etc. They affect the compaction of chromatin structure, the accessibility of the DNA, and therefore the transcriptional level of specific genes. Additionally, microRNA is a type of noncoding RNA that is responsible for altering gene expression by targeting and marking mRNA transcripts for degradation. Since this process is a posttranscriptional modification, it does not involve changes in DNA sequence. The expression of microRNA is also regulated by other epigenetic mechanisms. Aberrant expression of microRNA facilitates disease development, making them good targets for epigenetic therapies. Epigenetic proteins involved in the regulation of gene transcription fall into three categories-writers, erasers, and readers. Both writers and erasers have enzymatic activity that allows them to covalently modify DNA or histone proteins. Readers have the ability to recognize and bind to specific sites on chromatin to alter epigenetic signatures. Once the underlying epigenetic mechanisms are understood, it becomes possible to develop new ways to alter epigenetic marks such as \\"epidrugs\\", or epigenome editing, which is the overwriting of epigenetic patterns using man-made signals to direct epigenetic proteins to target loci. Furthermore, based on patients' unique epigenetic patterns, medical professionals can more accurately assign a safe and effective treatment including appropriate epigenetic drugs tailored to the patient. ==Drug response and metabolism== Individual differences in drug metabolism and response can be partially explained by epigenetic changes. Epigenetic changes in genes that encode drug targets, enzymes, or transport proteins that affect the body's ability to absorb, metabolize, distribute and excrete substances that are foreign to the body (Xenobiotics) can result in changes in one's toxicity levels and drug response. One of the main effects of drug exposure early in life is altered ADME (Absorption, Distribution, Metabolism, and Excretion) gene expression. There is evidence that these genes are controlled by DNA methylation, histone acetylation, and miRNAs. More needs to be understood about these mechanisms, but the hope is that it can lead to proper drug selection and dosage. Additionally, drug resistance can be acquired through epigenetic mechanisms. This is particularly common in chemotherapy, where cells that develop resistance to treatment continue to divide and survive. Pharmacoepigenetic treatment plans can consist of a single epidrug class or combine several in a unique therapy. The following are the examples of how drug response or metabolism related proteins are regulated by epigenetic mechanisms: ===Cyp2e1, DNA methylation, and histone acetylation=== Age-related changes to epigenetic modifications on regulatory regions of mouse Cyp2e1 has been associated with the metabolism mediated by its encoded protein. Cyp2e1 mediated hydroxylation of its probe drug chlorzoxazone to its metabolite, 6-hydroxychlorzoxazone, correlated negatively with DNA methylation and positively with histone acetylation in mouse microsome extracts. ===CXCR4 and DNA methylation=== CXCR4 is a protein that acts as a coreceptor for the entry of HIV. It has been developed as a drug target for anti-HIV therapy. A study has shown that its expression is dysregulated by abnormal methylation patterns in some cancers. Thus, this could affect the efficiency and drug response to the anti-HIV therapy. ===CYP1A1 methylation and histone modification=== CYP1A1 is a protein that is well known for its role in chemical compounds and drug metabolism. A study in prostate cancer demonstrated that the protein's regulatory region was under the control of the histone modification H3K4me3, which typically indicates active gene expression in non-cancerous cells. This abnormal methylation typically causes histone modification and changes in chromatin structure at a local level, thus effecting gene expression. ===ABCG2 and miRNA=== ABCG2 is a protein that is responsible for multidrug resistance in cancer chemotherapy. Increased expression of ABCG2 is found in different drug resistant cancer cell lines and tumor tissues. One of the microRNA modifications changes its gene and protein expression by destabilizing its mRNA. ==Epigenetics and human diseasesEpigenetics in cancer=== While there is still a lot of work that needs to be done regarding the epigenetic modifications of specific cancers at various steps in tumor development, there is a general understanding of epigenetic modifications in genes that lead to abnormal expression and various types of cancer. These epigenetic biomarkers are being considered in clinical use as a tool to detect disease, classify tumors, and understand drug response to treatments such as target compounds, traditional chemotherapy agents, and epigenetic drugs. Human cancer is generally characterized by hypermethylation of specific promoters, which typically prevents the expression of DNA repair and tumor-suppressing genes, and the loss of DNA methylation on a global scale, which can allow for expression of oncogenes or result in a loss of imprinting. Histone modifications play an important role in the regulation of cellular processes, thus epigenetic changes resulting in changed structure can lead to abnormal transcription, DNA repair and replication. Below are some examples and then an overview of the ways these epigenetic modifications are being targeted. ===Targeting epigenetic modifications in cancer=== Epigenetic changes are highly present in cancer, therefore it is a good model to assess different ways in which epigenetic drugs can be used to make changes that turn up and turn down gene expression.  Targeting gain-of-function epigenetic mutations  DNA methyltransferase inhibitors are being pursued due to the hypermethylation of tumor suppressor genes and increased DNMTs that have been observed in cancer cells. Introduction of these inhibitors can result in reduced promoter methylation and expression of previously silenced tumor suppressor genes. Azacitidine and decitabine, which incorporate into the DNA and covalently trap the methyltransferases, have been approved by the FDA for myelodysplastic syndrome (a group of cancers where blood cells from the bone marrow do not mature properly into healthy blood cells) treatment and are currently being investigated for other cancers like leukemia. Other types of drugs are being developed like non-nucleoside analogues, which can covalently bind to DNMTs. Some examples include procaine, hydralazine, and procainimide, but they lack specificity and potency making it hard to test them in clinical trials. DNA methyltranferase inhibitors are usually used at a low level due to their lack of specificity and toxic effects on normal cells. HDAC inhibitors are also being used, due to the changes in histone acetylation and the increased HDACs observed. While the mechanism is still under investigation, it is believed that adding the HDAC inhibitors results in increased histone acetylation and therefore the reactivation of transcription of tumor suppressor genes. More so, HDACs can also remove acetyl groups from proteins that are not the histone, so it is thought that adding HDAC inhibitors may result in changes in transcription factor activity. There are around 14 different HDAC inhibitors being investigated in clinical trials for haematological and solid tumors, but more research needs to be done on the specificity and mechanisms by which they are inhibiting. Another way to alter epigenetic modifications is through the use of histone methyltransferase inhibitors.  Targeting loss-of-Function epigenetic mutations  Loss of function in genes encoding DNA demethylases or the overexpression of DNA methyltransferases can result in the hypermethylation of DNA promoters. Loss of function of DNA methyltransferases can lead to hypomethylation. Loss of function in chromosome remodeling, DNA repair, and cell cycle regulation genes can lead to uncontrolled growth of cells giving rise to cancer. Histone modification patterns can also lead to changes in genomes that can negatively affect these and other systems, making cancer more likely. Cells that carry loss-of-function mutations can be targeted by drugs that induce synthetic lethality, a genetic/protein interaction where the loss of one component induces little change, but the loss of both components results in cell death. In cancer cells where one part of the interaction experiences a loss-of- function mutation, the other part can be interrupted by drug treatment to induce cell death in cancerous cells. Synthetic lethality is an attractive treatment option in patients with cancer since it there should be minimal / no effect on healthy cells. For example, with SWI/SNF loss of function mutations, DNA replication and repair is negatively affected and can give rise to tumors if cell growth goes unchecked. Mutations of these genes are common causes of cancers. These mutations are not directly targetable, but several synthetic lethal interactions can be exploited by cancer drugs to kill early cancer growth. Additionally, loss-of-function mutations can be targeted by using the dynamic states of histone modifications. Loss of function mutations in demethylases, such as KDMK6A are common in cancer. By inducing upregulation of methyltransferase inhibitors, the effects of the loss-of-function mutation can be mitigated. Development of drugs that target or modify epigenetic signatures of target genes is growing, especially as bioinformatic analysis increases our knowledge of the human genome and speeds up the search for synthetic lethal interactions. Most widely used to assess potential synthetic lethal interactions is using siRNA and CRISPR-Cas9 to modify target genes. CRISPRi and CRISPRa technology allows researchers to activate or inactivate target genes. ===Lung cancer=== In lung cancer the activation of both dominant and recessive oncogenes and inactivation of tumor suppressor genes has been observed. Frequently observed in lung cancer is the methylation of gene promoters that are involved in critical functions like cell-cycle control, repairing DNA, cell adhesion, proliferation, apoptosis, and motility. A few of the common genes frequently observed are APC, CDH1, CDKN2A, MGMT, and RASSF1A (a tumor suppressor). In the cases of CDKN2A and RASSF1A DNA these genes are methylated, resulting in the loss of tumor suppressor genes. Various strategies such as using drugs like entinostat and azacitidine have been observed in clinical trials of non-small-cell lung carcinoma. The idea being that etinostat, a histone deacetylase inhibitor, can prevent the silencing of genes by allowing them to be accessible to transcription machinery. Azacitidine can be metabolized and incorporated into DNA and then recognized as a substrate for DNA methyltransferases, but since the enzyme is bound the methyltransferase cannot add methylation marks and thus silence crucial genes. ===Heart failure=== Histone modifications, DNA methylation, and microRNAs have been found to play an important role in heart disease. Previously, histone tail acetylation has been linked to cardiac hypertrophy or abnormal heart muscle thickening that is usually due to an increase in cardiomyocyte size or other cardiac muscle changes. The hypertrophic changes that occur in cardiac muscles cells result from the required acetylation of histone tails via acetyltransferases. In addition to acetyltransferases, histone deacetylases (HDACs) also aid in the regulation of muscle cells. Class II HDACs 5 and 9 inhibit the activity of a factor known as myocyte enhancer factor 2 (MEF2), which unable to bind prevents the expression of genes that produce hypertrophic effects. Additionally, loci such as PECAM1, AMOTL2 and ARHGAP24 have been seen with different methylation patterns that are correlated with altered gene expression in cardiac tissue. There are an increasing number of scientific publications that are finding that miRNA plays a key role in various aspects of heart failure. Examples of functions for miRNA include the regulation of the cardiomyocyte cell cycle and regulation of cardiomyocyte cell growth. Knowing the epigenetic modifications allows for the potential use of drugs to modify the epigenetic status of a target sequence. One could possibly target the miRNAs using antagomirs. Antagomirs are single strand RNAs that are complementary, which have been chemically engineered oligonucleotides that silence miRNAs so that they cannot degrade the mRNA that is needed for normal levels of expression. DNA methylation of CpGs can lead to a reduction of gene expression, and in some cases this decrease in gene product can contribute to disease. Therefore, in those instances it is important to have potential drugs that can alter the methylation status of the gene and increase expression levels. To increase gene expression, one may try to decrease CpG methylation by using a drug that works as DNA methytransferase inhibitor such as decitabine or 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine. On the other hand, some diseases result from a decrease in acetylase activity, which results in a decrease in gene expression. Some studies have shown that inhibiting HDAC activity can attenuate cardiac hypertrophy. trichostatin A and sodium butyrate are two HDAC inhinitors. Trichostatin A is known for its ability to inhibit class I and II HDACs from removing acetylases and decreasing gene expression. Sodium butyrate is another chemical that inhibits class I HDACs, thus resulting in the ability for transcription factors to easily access and express the gene. === Challenges in development of epigenetic therapies === There are a number of challenges with the developing epigenetic therapies for widespread medical use. While laboratory results indicate relationships between genes and potential drug interactions that could mitigate the effects of mutations, the complexity of the human genome and epigenome makes it difficult to develop therapies that are safe, efficient, and consistent. Epigenetic alteration may affect more systems than the target genes, which gives potential for deleterious effects to rise out of treatment. Additionally, epigenetic mutations can be a result of lineage. As tissue gene expression is largely regulated by epigenetic interactions, certain tissue-specific cancers are difficult to target with epigenetic therapies. Additionally, genes that encode for elements that prevent one type of cancer in a cell, may have altered function in another and lead to another type of cancer. Trying to modify these proteins, such as EZH2, may give rise to other types of cancer. Selectivity is another hurdle in the development of therapies. Since many proteins are structurally similar, especially within the same protein family, Broad- spectrum inhibitors can't always be used since modifying the regulation of one protein may do the same to others in the family. Based on the differences in these epigenetic patterns, scientists and physicians can further predict the drug response of each patient. One of the most compelling examples is methylation of the tumor suppressor gene at promoter sequence that codes for MGMT. MGMT is a DNA repair protein responsible for transferring methyl groups from O(6)-alkylguanine in DNA to itself to fight against mutagenesis and the buildup of toxic compounds that result from alkylating agents. Therefore, MGMT is responsible for the repair of areas that have been damaged by toxins. This MGMT promoter region has been found to be highly methylated, and thereby repressed, in patients with various types of cancer. Several drugs such as procarbazine, streptozotocin, BCNU (carmustine), and temozolamide are designed to remodel DNA to reverse this abnormal methylation modification so that MGMT may be normally expressed and repair DNA. The methylation status of the promoter become the best predictor of responses to BCNU and temozolamide in patients with brain cancer. ==Epigenetic inhibitors and therapiesBromodomain and inhibitors (BET inhibitor)=== Proteins containing bromodomains recognize and bind acetylated lysine residues in histones, causing chromatin structure modification and a subsequent shift in levels of gene expression. Bromodomain and extra-terminal (BET) proteins bind acetyl groups and work with RNAPII to help with transcription and elongation of chromatin. BET inhibitors have been able to prevent successful interaction between BET proteins and acetylated histones. Using a BET inhibitor can reduce the over expression of bromodomain proteins, which can cause aberrant chromatin remodeling, transcription regulation, and histone acetylation. === Histone acetylase inhibitors === Several studies have shown that histone acetyltransferase (HAT) inhibitors are useful in re-inducing expression of tumor suppression genes by stopping histone acetyltransferase activity to prevent chromatin condensation. Protein methyltransferase (PMT) inhibitors: PMT's play a key role in methylating lysine and arginine residues to affect transcription levels of genes. It has been suggested that their enzymatic activity plays a role in cancer, as well as neurodegenerative and inflammatory diseases. ===Histone deacetylase inhibitors=== Using Histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors allows for genes to remain transcriptionally active. HDACi's have been used in various Autoimmune Disorders, such as systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis, and systemic onset juvenile idiopathic arthritis. They have also proven useful for treating cancer, since they are structurally diverse and only effect 2-10% of expressed genes. Using HDAC Inhibitors for the treatment of psychiatric and neurodegenerative diseases has shown promising results in early studies. Additionally, studies have demonstrated that HDACi are useful in minimizing damage after a stroke, and encouraging angiogenesis and myogenesis in embryonic cells. === DNA methyltransferase inhibitors === One of the common characteristics of various types of cancer is hypermethylation of a tumor suppressing gene. Repression of this methyltransferase action at targeted loci can prevent recurring transfer of methyl groups to these sites and keep them open to transcriptional machinery, allowing more tumor-suppression genes to be made. These drugs are typically cytidine derivatives. These drugs tether DNMT to the DNA and prevent their continued action. Treatments that inhibit DNMT function without attachment to DNA (which can cause toxic effects) show they could be effective treatment options but they are not developed enough to see widespread use. ==See also== * Epigenetic therapy * Epigenetics * Cancer epigenetics ==References== Category:Epigenetics ","title":"Pharmacoepigenetics"},{"id":"56840886","text":"Bhupinder Singh Hooda in 2010 Rohtak-Garhi Sampla Uddar Gagan Model Township land grab case pertains to illegal acquisition and licensing of 850.88 acres land under Bhupinder Singh Hooda's rule as the Chief Minister of Haryana.

Builders try to acquire this land by offering a small premium above the government's rate for the acquisition of the land. If landowners farmers still resist the sale, then Section 6 of land law is applied by declaring the government's intention to acquire land, which forces the reluctant farmers to sell the land to builders at small premium. Once the land is acquired by the builders, government cancels the acquisition process and releases the land to new build owners, along with the change in land use permission to build residential and industrial building on the farm land. This results in steep rise in the land prices, resulting in massive gains for the builders, opportunity cost loss to the farmers and land tax revenue loss to the government. Haryana Urban Development Authority (HUDA), now known as Haryana Shahari Vikas Pradhikaran, notified acquisition of 850 acres in 2002, but it acquired only 441 acres April 2003, and remaining land was released to private builders for developing a colony. 280 acres in Rohtak Garhi Sampla was released from acquisition in the same way as it was done in Gurugram-Manesar IMT land scam Manesar during Hooda's administration.More trouble for Bhupinder Singh Hooda: Rohtak, Sonipat land takeover cases go to CBI, Indian Express, 14 Mar 2018.

Uddar Gagan in the same month applied to the Haryana Town and Country Planning Department for grant of licence to develop a colony, which was granted in July 2016 and the land was released from the government acquisition process, and instead of returning to the farmers it was released to the builder based on execution of sale deeds favouring the builder through power of attorney.<. ===High court and Supreme court cases=== Punjab and Haryana High Court in March 2013 gave relief to farmers landowners by quashing the government's decision to release and license the land to private colonizers. This decision to quash the \\"illegal and deceptive\\" actions of Hooda administration were reconfirmed by the Supreme Court of India in May 2016. Two senior officers in the office of CM Hooda were indicted for allegedly favouring the developers.

Money paid by builders to government, land owners and spent on land development will be repaid by the government. People who had bought the developed properties from the builders will either receive the property or the refund.

Unlike previous SX supercomputers, the SX-Aurora TSUBASA is provided as a PCIe card, termed by NEC as a \\"Vector Engine\\" (VE). Eight VE cards can be inserted into a vector host (VH) which is typically a x86-64 server running the Linux operating system. The product has been announced in a press release on October 25 2017 and NEC has started selling it in February 2018. The product succeeds the SX-ACE. == Hardware == SX-Aurora TSUBASA is a successor to the NEC SX series and SUPER-UX, which are vector computer systems upon which the Earth Simulator supercomputer is based. Its hardware consists of x86 Linux hosts with vector engines (VEs) connected via PCI express (PCIe) interconnect. High memory bandwidth (0.75‚Äì1.2 TB/s), comes from eight cores and six HBM2 memory modules on a silicon interposer implemented in the form- factor of a PCIe card. Operating system functionality for the VE is offloaded to the VH and handled mainly by user space daemons running the VEOS. Depending on the clock frequency (1.4 or 1.6 GHz), each VE CPU has eight cores and a peak performance of 2.15 or 2.45 TFLOPS in double precision. The processor has the world's first implementation of six HBM2 modules on a Silicon interposer with a total of 24 or 48GB of high bandwidth memory. It is integrated in the form-factor of a standard full length, full height, double width PCIe card that is hosted by an x86_64 server, the Vector Host (VH). The server can host up to eight VEs, clusters VHs can scale to arbitrary number of nodes.SX-Aurora TSUBASA Brochure === Product releases === Version 2 Vector Engine {  + !SKU !20A !20B - Clock speed (in Ghz) 1.6 1.6 - Number of cores 10 8 - Core peak performance (double precision GFLOPS) 307 307 - Core peak performance (single precision GFLOPS) 614 614 - CPU peak performance (double precision TFLOPS) 3.07 2.45 - CPU peak performance (single precision TFLOPS) 6.14 4.91 - Memory bandwidth (TB/s) 1.53 1.53 - Memory capacity (GB) 48 48 } Version 1 Vector Engine The version 1.0 of the Vector Engine was produced in 16 nm FinFET process (from TSMC) and released in three SKUs (subsequent versions add an E at the end):https://www.nec.com/en/global/solutions/hpc/sx/docs/SX- Aurora_eng_202002.pdf {  + !SKU !10A !10B !10C !10AE !10BE !10CE - Clock speed (in Ghz) 1.6 1.4 1.4 1.584 1.408 1.400 - Number of cores 8 8 8 8 8 8 - Core peak performance (double precision GFLOPS) 307.2 268.8 268.8 304 270 268 - Core peak performance (single precision GFLOPS)  537  608 540 537 - CPU peak performance (double precision TFLOPS) 2.45 2.15 2.15 2.43 2.16 2.15 - CPU peak performance (single precision TFLOPS) 4.9 4.3 4.3 4.86 4.32 4.30 - Memory bandwidth (TB/s) 1.2 1.2 0.75 1.35 1.35 1.00 - Memory capacity (GB) 48 48 24 48 48 24 } === Functional units === Each of the eight SX- Aurora cores has 64 logical vector registers. These have 256 x 64 Bits length implemented as a mix of pipeline and 32-fold parallel SIMD units. The registers are connected to three FMA floating-point multiply and add units that can run in parallel, as well as two ALU arithmetical logical units handling fixed point operations and a divide and square root pipe. Considering only the FMA units and their 32-fold SIMD parallelism, a vector core is capable of 192 double precision operations per cycle. In \\"packed\\" vector operations, where two single precision values are loaded into the space of one double precision slot in the vector registers, the vector unit delivers twice as many operations per clock cycle compared to double precision. A Scalar Processing Unit (SPU) handles non-vector instructions on each of the cores. === Memory and caches === The memory of the SX-Aurora TSUBASA processor consists of six HBM2 second generation high-bandwidth memory modules implemented in the same package as the CPU with the help of Chip-on-Wafer-on- Substrate technology. Depending on the processor model, the HBM2 modules are either 4 or 8 die 3D modules with either 4 or 8 GB capacity, each. The SX- Aurora CPUs thus have either 24GB or 48GB HBM2 memory. The models implemented with large HBM2 modules have 1.2TB/s memory bandwidth. The cores of a vector engine share 16MB of \\"Last-Level-Cache\\" (LLC), a write-back cache directly connected to the vector registers and the L2 cache of the SPU. The LLC cache line size is 128 Bytes. The priority of data retention in the LLC can to some extent be controlled in software, allowing the programmer to specify which of the variables or arrays should be retained in cache, a feature comparable to that of the Advanced Data Buffer (ADB) of the NEC SX-ACE. === Platforms === NEC is currently selling the SX-Aurora TSUBASA vector engine integrated into four platforms:https://www.nec.com/en/global/solutions/hpc/sx/index.html? * A111-1: a tower PC with one VE card of type 10B * A101-1: a tower PC with one VE card of type 10CE * A311-4: a dual socket 1U 19 inch rack-mountable Xeon scalable server equipped with up to four VE cards of type BE * A311-8: a dual socket 4U 19 inch rack-mountable Xeon scalable server with up to eight VE cards of type BE * A511-64: a 19 inch rack equipped with 64 VEs of type AE. This is the only configuration that is explicitly sold as a supercomputer. Within a VH node VEs can communicate with each other through PCIe. Large parallel systems built with SX-Aurora use Infiniband in a PeerDirect setup as interconnect. NEC also used to sell the SX-Aurora TSUBASA vector engine integrated into five platforms: * A100-1: a tower PC with one VE card of type 10C. * A300-2: a single socket 1U rack-mountable Skylake server equipped with up to two VE cards of type 10B or 10C. * A300-4: a dual socket 1U rack- mountable Skylake server equipped with up to four VE cards of type 10B or 10C. * A300-8: a dual socket 4U rack-mountable Skylake server with up to eight VE cards of type 10B or 10C. * A500-64: a rack equipped with either Intel Xeon Silver 4100 family or Intel Xeon Gold 6100 family CPUs and 32, 48 or 64 VEs of type 10A or 10B. All types are exclusively air cooled with the exception of the A500 series, which also utilizes watercooling. == Software  Operating system === The operating system of the vector engine (VE) is called \\"VEOS\\", and has been offloaded entirely to the host system, the vector host (VH). VEOS consists of kernel modules and user space daemons that: * manage VE processes and their scheduling on the VE * manage the virtual memory address spaces of the VE processes * handle transfers between VH and VE memory with the help of the VE DMA engines * handle interrupts and exceptions of VE processes, as well as their system calls. VEOS supports multitasking on the VE and almost all Linux system calls are supported in the VE libc. Offloading operating system services to the VH shifts OS jitter away from the VE at the expense of increased latencies. All VE operating system related packages are licensed under the GNU General Public License and have been published at . NEC later seems to have abandoned VEOS in favor of Red Hat Enterprise Linux or CentOS. === Software development === A Software Development Kit is available from NEC for developers and customers. It contains proprietary products and must be purchased from NEC. The SDK contains: * C, C++ and Fortran compilers that support automatic vectorization and automatic parallelization as well as OpenMP. * Performance optimization tools: ftraceviewer and veperf. * Optimized numerical libraries for the VE: BLAS, SBLAS, LAPACK, SCALAPACK, ASL, Heterosolver. NEC MPI is also a proprietary implementation and is conforming to the MPI-3.1 standard specification. Hybrid programs can be created that use the VE as an accelerator for certain host kernel functions by using VE offloading C-API.

It stars Kristen Stewart, Jack O'Connell, Margaret Qualley, Zazie Beetz, Anthony Mackie and Vince Vaughn. It had its world premiere at the Venice Film Festival on August 30, 2019. It was released in the United Kingdom on January 10, 2020, by Universal Pictures and in the United States on February 21, 2020, by Amazon Studios, after an awards-qualifying run on December 13, 2019. ==Plot== Jean Seberg is a famous American actress known for playing the female lead in Jean-Luc Godard's film Breathless. She is in an open marriage with her husband, Romain Gary, with whom she is raising a child in Paris. She prepares to leave on a trip to Hollywood to promote her career there and parts lovingly with her husband. On the jet flight in first class, she witnesses a white stewardess discriminating against a black passenger; she appears sympathetic to the passenger, who introduces himself as Hakim Jamal, an activist in the civil rights movement. Upon arrival in the U.S., Seberg notices that the black activists at the airport begin a small protest there to indicate their displeasure with the treatment which Jamal and his travelling companions have received on their flight. Seberg joins the protesters and raises her fist in a black power salute in solidarity. Unbeknownst to her, the FBI are undercover at the airport and photograph her with the activists. The photograph is then processed and the FBI decides that they will shadow her activities while she is in the U.S. and arrange to have her phone conversations taped. Seberg's friendship with Jamal soon grows into a romance, even though Jamal is also married. The FBI's surveillance program COINTELPRO begins to target Seberg, including recording her and Jamal having sex and showing it to Jamal's wife Dorothy, who attacks Seberg physically. Jamal leaves Seberg after Dorothy confronts him, leaving Seberg devastated. The FBI continues its surveillance and harassment of Seberg for years, and the bad press it generates ruins her career. In 1970, her daughter dies in infancy, and COINTELPRO agents create a rumor that the baby was fathered by a member of the Black Panther Party. The combination of her daughter's death and the FBI's smear campaign about the child's paternity send her into a deep depression. Finally, in 1979, her career and personal life in shambles, she commits suicide. ==CastProduction== In March 2018, it was announced Kristen Stewart, Jack O'Connell, Anthony Mackie, Margaret Qualley and Colm Meaney had joined the cast of the film, then titled Against All Enemies.

Hooda was acquiring land from poor, illiterate farmers at a low rate in the name of \\"public interest\\" only to later license this to builders after granting out- of-turn favors that helped the land value increase exponentially. During his 10-year rule as Chief Minister, Hooda, licensed a massive 24,825 acres of land compared to just 8,550.32 acres by successive Chief Ministers in the 23 years preceding Hooda rule.Hooda‚Äôs land largesse for pvt builder ‚Äòclear fraud‚Äô, SC restores it to HUDA, Firstpost, 15 May 2016. ==DetailsModus of scam=== Ashok Khemka, a senior Indian Administrative Service officer in of Haryana known for exposing corruption and for cancelling the mutation of Sonia Gandhi's son-in-law Robert Vadra's illegal land deal in Gurgaon, had written to Chief Minister and Chief Secretary of Haryana to seek the CBI investigation, with the findings that both Rohtak and Sonipat land scams were more blatant than the Manesar scam.Govt was alerted about Rohtak, Sonipat land acquisition scams 15 months ago, Times of India, 14 Mar 2018. In 2005, Haryana State Industrial and Infrastructure Development Corporation (HSIIDC) notified 885 acres for acquisition for housing colony for industrial workers in sectors 59 and 60 of Sonipat, out of which 300-acre land was illegally released to a private builder. 418 acres in Sonipat was released from acquisition in the same way as it was done in Gurugram-Manesar IMT land scam Manesar during Hooda‚Äôs administration.More trouble for Bhupinder Singh Hooda: Rohtak, Sonipat land takeover cases go to CBI, Indian Express, 14 Mar 2018. 642 acres of land in 5 villages was notified for acquisition for developing residential and commercial sectors, by Haryana Urban Development Authority, and a notification was issued on 16 January 2004 to acquire 623.70 acres resulting in sales of land by farmers to builders at throwaway prices under the threat of acquisition.

She is the 9th County Executive in Nassau County history and the first woman to hold the office. Curran worked as a reporter before serving in the Nassau County Legislature. ==Early life and education== Curran was born in St. Catharines, Ontario, Canada. She moved around a lot as a child, and before turning 18, lived in Belgium, Pembroke Pines, Florida, Five Towns, Los Angeles, and Washington, D.C. In 1989, Curran received a B.A. in Liberal Arts from Sarah Lawrence College. ==Career== Curran previously served in the Nassau County Legislature from 2014 to 2017 and as a local school board member in her hometown of Baldwin. Prior to holding elective office, Curran worked as a reporter for the New York Daily News and New York Post. ==Nassau County Executive== In 2017, Curran won a Sep 12 primary against Nassau County Comptroller George Maragos, who switched parties from Republican to Democratic. In the general election, Curran won a contentious campaign against former New York State Senator and Mineola Village Mayor Jack Martins. The then sitting Nassau County Executive, Ed Mangano, had decided not to run for re- election following an indictment on federal corruption charges. The campaign between Curran and Martins touched on gang violence (MS-13) and runaway property taxes, but ultimately centered on ethics. When polls closed on election night Curran, an underdog in the historically Republican Nassau County, had won 51 percent to 48 percent. She is the third Democrat to hold the position in 80 years. Curran was sworn into office, January 1, 2018, by New York Governor Andrew Cuomo on the steps of the Theodore Roosevelt Executive and Legislative Building (formerly the Old Nassau County Courthouse) during a frigid outdoor ceremony. === Administration and policies === Among her first hires were former Long Island Rail Road President Helena Williams and former New York City Budget Director under Mayor Michael Bloomberg Mark Page. Williams was the railroad's longest-serving president in several decades, president of the nation's busiest commuter railroad, and the first woman to run any Metropolitan Transportation Authority agency. Page, as director of the city's Office of Management and Budget under NYC Mayor Michael Bloomberg, oversaw the city's finances through the September 11 terror attacks, the Great Recession, and Super Storm Sandy. Other early hires include an assistant state attorney general and former special counsel to the New York State Attorney General Public Integrity Bureau to enforce new ethics and procurement reform policies. Curran also appointed the first permanent commissioner of the Nassau County Police Department in more than four years. Curran's appointment, Patrick Ryder, previously served as commanding officer of the Asset Forfeiture and Intelligence Unit. Within the department, Ryder was largely credited with widespread adoption of new advances in technology to assist in crime reduction. Examples include Nassau's successful use of gunfire locator technology to reduce gun crime. Senator Chuck Schumer  Assessment and Tax Relief  Under Curran's predecessor, Nassau County froze the tax rolls in 2011. The rolls would remain frozen for nearly seven years. According to an expos√®, the policy resulted in a $1.7 billion shift in the property tax burden that largely benefited wealthy residents over low-income, middle-class and elderly residents. In effect, the policy created a \\"separate and unequal\\" tax assessment and challenge system that benefited those who frequently challenged their annual property tax assessment over others who did not or were unable to do so. To address the issue Curran issued an executive order unfreezing the tax rolls in March 2018 and signed legislation that would allow for the reassessment of all county properties by 2019. Additionally, Curran introduced a proposal providing tax relief to the homeowners who shouldered the majority of the tax burden shift under the 2011 freeze. The proposal called for a five-year, partial tax exemption that would be granted to owner of homes built before the freeze began in 2010, are assessed at a high level, and are worth $1 million or less. The resulting exemption would primarily benefit middle-income property owners who have not challenged their assessments successfully since the 2011 freeze and resultant tax shift.  Public Safety (Opioids)  Upon taking office Curran confronted the growing opioid epidemic which saw the drug claiming a record number of lives in the region. Curran, and Commissioner Ryder, quickly established a tech and intel- driven response to the opioid and heroin crises by working in conjunction with the U.S. DEA HIDTA program. Through the HIDTA program Curran and Ryder were able to fund and roll out the Overdose Detection Mapping Application Program (OD Map). Through ODMap police track overdoses reported to hospitals, fire and police officials and are able to predict waves of overdoses and try to prevent them as well as the crimes that often follow drug use. Curran, Ryder, and the program gained national attention when early results showed a precipitous drop in both fatal and non-fatal overdoses; 32 and 34 percent respectively.  Reforms  Curran signed an executive order barring appointees from holding leadership positions in political parties or donating to her campaign. At the time the measure was considered to be the first in New York State history. Shortly after, Curran issued a \\"zero-tolerance\\" executive order banning gift- giving among vendors and employees involved with procurement or contracting procedures. Previously county employees could not accept gifts worth $75 or more.  No Names On Signs  During the campaign Curran pledged that if elected she would remove the county executive's name from the county's parks and welcome signs. The pledge was a sharp break with tradition and an unusual measure by political standards. Of the pledge, The New York Times wrote, \\"Across the county's many parks, large signs welcome visitors with the county executive's name in giant letters, with the park's name in a smaller typeface. Ms. Curran has asked the county's public works department to simply remove the county executive's name altogether.\\" Curran criticized the signs as self- promotional and a waster of taxpayer dollars.  Legalizing Marijuana  In opposition with rising public opinion of her electorate and popular sentiment within the New York State Legislature, controlled by the Democratic Party in all 3 chambers at the time, Curran took a hardline stance against the legalization of recreational marijuana and announced that she intended to have Nassau County opt-out of the clause which would legalize marijuana that was included in an early version of the 2019 New York State Budget.  Bail reform  Following a measure that eliminated cash bail passed by the New York State Legislature as part of the 2019 budget and was hailed as a landmark progressive legislation by supporters, Curran vigorously spoke out against the legislation to numerous media outlets, appeared on Fox News to oppose bail reform, and continued on efforts to form a coalition against the legislation.  AIPAC  In a February 25, 2020 Facebook post, Curran wrote, \\"AIPAC is a vital voice for our relationship with one of our most important allies, Israel. And that‚Äôs why I‚Äôm proud to join them at their #AIPAC2020 conference next week.\\" ==Personal life== Curran lives in Baldwin, Nassau County, New York, near the town of Hempstead. She is married and has three daughters. ==References * Laura Curran, County Executive at Nassau County Government * Category:1967 births Category:Living people Category:Nassau County Executives Category:New York (state) Democrats Category:Politicians from St. Catharines ","title":"Laura Curran"},{"id":"56841361","text":"Merle Temkin is a New York City-based painter, sculptor and installation artist, most recognized for her vibrant, abstracted paintings based on her own enlarged fingerprint, and her earlier site-specific, mirrored installations of the 1980s.

By 1990, she embarked on the fingerprint paintings that would dominate her efforts for the next two decades. Temkin often finds inspiration in travel; seeing zebras in Africa suggested a new, striated approach to her fingerprint works, while an observation in London in 2010 spurred an ongoing change in subject matter to trees. Temkin has exhibited throughout the U.S. and in Israel, Germany and South Korea, with solo exhibitions at PS1,MoMA exhibition archives. \\"The Artist in Place: The First Ten Years of MoMA PS1.\\" Retrieved March 15, 2018.The MoMA PS1 Archives 1976‚Äì2000.

While distinct, each body share Temkin's \\"additive, bit-by-bit construction\\" method, use of fragmentation or scale to create perceptual surprises, and concentrated exploration process.Page, Judith. Interview in Merle Temkin: Personal Markings, New York: A.R.T. Press, 2000. === Site-specific installations & sculpture === Temkin's sculptural work has engaged with issues of identity, perception and participation, typically through the use of mirrors that create fragmented or distorted views, as well as visual blending of installation and environment. In the 1980s, Temkin created a series of six-foot tall, sometimes-undulating \\"passageway\\" or arbor-like installations featuring two- inch strips of mirrored plexiglass with matching open intervals between them. These works elicited participation through the \\"confusion\\" caused by \\"strobe- light-quick alternations of reflection and background,\\"Silverthorne, Jeanne.

Catalogue essay, Area Sculpture ‚Äì Ward's Island, New York: AREA, June 1981‚ÄìApril 1982. The New York Times' Michael Brenson described one such work, State of the Art (1986), as a funhouse-like, voluptuous sculpture suggesting both Minimalism and Surrealism, through its effects of spatial and visual dislocation. Critic Grace Glueck wrote of an earlier work, Backfire (1984), that its \\"glamorous Art Deco look\\" \\"happily enlivened\\" its CUNY mall site.Glueck, Grace. Review, New York Times, July 6, 1984.

Merle Temkin, Couple, diptych; acrylic paint, dye, thread on canvas; 46\\" x 76\\", 2003 === Fingerprint mixed media paintings === In 1990, Temkin began experimenting with her own dramatically enlarged fingerprints, mixed-media, and non- traditional needlework. Working on large, unprimed canvasses that she stained, painted and stitched, she employed strategies of overlap, repetition, slippage, and disorienting shifts of scale to add rawness, incongruity and ambiguity to the pieces. Her spots, whorls, ridges and scrabbled lines, rendered in heavily layered impasto surfaces, rough embroidery and hot palettes of red, magenta, purple and black, moved toward abstraction,Sozanski, Edward J. \\"Healthy Abstraction,\\" Philadelphia Inquirer, May 6, 2005, p. W27. yet also suggested mazes, exotic animal hides, and \\"energetic patterns, recalling swarm cells, weather movements, cluster formations and other emergent phenomena.\\"Norris, Doug. \\"Five artists make their points known,\\" South County Independent, February 28, 2002, p. C2. Aesthetically, reviewers have most frequently noted the paintings' \\"evocatively sumptuous\\" color, pulsating surfaces, and expansive and varied visual language. Merle Temkin, Berries, acrylic paint, dye, thread, 36\\" x 42\\", 2003 The richness of that language also opened the work to divergent interpretations, despite its seemingly narrow motif. According to Temkin, she explored a symbol that was personal and unique yet \\"anonymous, universal and genderless,\\" with exposed, hanging threads from stitching subversively suggesting \\"a secret side or something turned inside-out.\\"Temkin, Merle. \\"'Fingerprints' exhibition, artist statement,\\" Chicago Cultural Center, 2007. Some critics took a feminist approach, saying the work \\"wittily links the sewer and the sewn,\\" suggesting and carrying on \\"the legacy of anonymous craft performed by women.\\"Dinoto, Andrea. \\"Corporal Identity‚ÄîBody Language,\\" American Crafts, April/May 2004. ARTnews' Barbara A. McAdam called it \\"gently self-reflective,\\" \\"hinting at exposed secrets and women's work.\\"McAdam, Barbara A. \\"Corporal Identity‚ÄîBody Language,\\" ARTnews, April 2004. Artist and writer Lois Martin attributed much of the work's impact to Temkin's needlework, suggesting its crude sutures and patterns expressed feminist, as well as, formal and philosophical concerns, while others observed how it touched on modernist and postmodern considerations of the role of the hand and hand-made in art. Temkin's own words lend some support to these interpretations: \\"Years ago, the 'fine art' I saw in museums was invariably by male artists. Women's work was domestic handiwork (like sewing), and not considered fine art.\\" Discussing the line \\"that traditionally exists between the craft of needlework and the fine art of paint,\\" she said, \\"I want to erase that line.\\" Critics have also focused on psychological and sociopolitical themes, with the latter gaining resonance in the post-9/11 years.Bischoff, Dan. \\"psst‚Ä¶‚Ä¶somebody's watching you,\\" Sunday Star-Ledger, February 12, 2006. In a review of Temkin's \\"Fingerprints\\" exhibition at the Chicago Cultural Center, Kevin Nance called it \\"effective and haunting,\\" noting the work's \\"sliced-and-reconfigured quality suggests a fracturing and reassembling of identity with implications that are both psychological and‚Äîespecially in this era of increasing surveillance‚Äîpolitical.\\" Others remarked on the expressive effects of her processes‚Äîscraping, tearing, and sewing‚Äîwhich created the effect of \\"layers of flayed skin that have been roughly patched and sewn back together,\\" evoking \\"a sense of both vulnerability and resilience.\\"Van Siclen, Bill. \\"Beneath the surface at URI,\\" Providence Journal, February 21, 2002, p.12. === Trees paintings === Merle Temkin, \\"Tree\\" works, TulipTree; oil on canvas; 36\\" x 38\\" 2014 In 2010, Temkin shifted subject matter from fingerprints to trees, still retaining her labor-intensive working process. Recalling both her fence installations and her re-assembled fingerprints, she describes her process as perceiving \\"negative space on canvas in three dimensions‚Ä¶ By carving away this space with paint, the tree is revealed, a process of working from the outside to depict the inside.\\"Merle Temkin website, Statement. Retrieved March 14, 2018. In these in-depth explorations of color, Temkin allows under-layers to show through, creating depth, vitality and a visual record of its own development. The series, evolving through Temkin's rigorous exploration, has moved in varying degrees toward and away from abstraction, producing often surprising results that range from \\"striking cactus-like silhouettes, painted in desert-twilight tones\\"Jenkins, Mark. \\"Rooted in nature but not always natural,\\" Washington Post, March 6, 2015. to graphic forms resembling thermographic maps, visual afterimages, and reversed video stills. == Recognition == Temkin's work is held in the permanent collections of several institutions and organizations. In 2015, the Racine Art Museum acquired 35 works on paper from five series between 1995 and 2008. The same year, the David Owsley Museum of Art at Ball State University acquired an installation of paper \\"Fingerprints\\" works, titled My Left Finger (2008), and exhibited in 2016. Three of her \\"Trees\\" paintings were installed permanently in 2014 in the David Geffen Hall at Lincoln Center in New York City.

In the castle there were large stores of ammunition that Swedes the needed. The castle was held by Colonel Cronlood, with barely 280 men. However, Swedish garrison managed to flee down the river San in boats, saving most of the provisions, while the main army's artillery shelled the Poles. However, 4000 grenades were left with matches lit, so the castle was blown in the air, together with several hundred Poles. In the evening 300 Swedish soldiers departed from the Swedish camp, and in three boats crossed the San River. The troops immediately removed the Polish guards and more Swedish troops crossed the river, including cavalry who swam over with their horses. Lithuanians who held this river bank believed the entire Swedish army was on them, and fled in panic. On March 26, Swedish army built a bridge over the River San, and the entire army crossed over.

In other words, the sequence of the fractional parts of each term will be uniformly distributed in the interval [0, 1). == In computing == In computing, an integer version of this sequence is often used to generate a discrete uniform distribution rather than a continuous one. Instead of using an irrational number, which cannot be calculated on a digital computer, the ratio of two integers is used in its place. An integer k is chosen, relatively prime to an integer modulus m. In the common case that m is a power of 2, this amounts to requiring that k is odd. The sequence of all multiples of such an integer k, ::0, k, 2k, 3k, 4k, ‚Ä¶ : is equidistributed modulo m. That is, the sequence of the remainders of each term when divided by m will be uniformly distributed in the interval [0, m). The term appears to originate with George Marsaglia‚Äôs paper \\"Xorshift RNGs\\". The following C code generates what Marsaglia calls a \\"Weyl sequence\\": ::d += 362437; In this case, the odd integer is 362437, and the results are computed modulo because d is a 32-bit quantity.

Her work documents the lives of black people from across the African Diaspora. Her work strives to display and celebrate the normal, the vibrant and the subtle nuances of each of these people lives that she encounters. Johnson Artur works as a photojournalist and editorial photographer for various fashion magazines and record labels all over the world, as well as her independent artistic practice. Her monograph with Bierke Verlag was included in the \\"Best Photo Books 2016\\" list of The New York Times. == Early life  Childhood === Liz Johnson Artur was born in Bulgaria but grew up in Eastern Europe and Germany. Her father was Ghanaian and she was raised by her Russian mother. She says that she is \\"‚Äúa product of Migration\\". She lived in West Germany for three months with her mother on a tourist visa before it expired; then they lived as illegal immigrants. Johnson Artur spent most of her days on the streets unable to go to school due to her status. This was when her initial encounters with strangers occurred; \\"What I most remember about this time is the pleasure I got from meeting strangers on the street, I think this has affected me as a photographer in a big way.\\" === Introduction to photography === In 1985 she got her first camera and began taking photos during a trip to New York City. During this trip, she stayed with a Russian family in a black neighbourhood in Brooklyn. In an interview with The Fader, she said: \\"I'd never been in a black neighbourhood before and I didn't take any pictures then. But my memory of what I saw made me want to start taking pictures.\\" This began her journey to take and compile photographs of weddings, parties, church and everyday life. In an interview with i-D Magazine, Johnson Artur explained that she got into photography because she \\"wanted to record the normality of black lives and black culture, which is something that isn't often reflected in the mainstream media.\\" For her, photography was a way of gaining access to people and spaces that sparked her curiosity. The goal of her work is to move beyond stereotypes of black people and represent each person as a unique individual. Johnson Artur received her MA in Photography from the Royal College of Art in London and has taught at the London College of Communication. == Career == Johnson Artur has spent the past 30 years photographing the diverse experience of black people across the globe. For the majority of her recent career, she has been focused on representing black people in South London. === Artistic practice === Photography is a very personal act for Johnson Artur. She has a collaborative attitude toward her work and makes close connections with her subjects as a way of respecting the vulnerability they show by letting her into their spaces. This process gives a sense of intimacy to her photographs. The photographs have an unfinished quality to them. Though some photos are posed, the attention Johnson Artur pays to each individual‚Äôs sense of self presentation lends an element of authenticity to the work. In an interview with The Photographers' Gallery she described this need to represent the personal style and the people she is capturing: \\"This way I believe photography can show us something very unique and still familiar.\\" === Ideology === Johnson Artur is committed to consistently photographing black people globally, and noticing the diverse aesthetics in these communities. When asked if she considered her work to be political, she responded: \\"I take what I do very seriously, but I wouldn't necessarily have called it political unless you asked me that question. My work's political in the sense that it's about communicating, about being able to understand people's struggles, to learn how we can live together.\\" Johnson Artur's work focuses on themes of self-presentation and issues of representation. The photographs are taken in public spaces in an endeavour to capture moments; to connect, see, hear and photograph with authenticity. In taking the photo she is establishing their presence. These brief encounters are prompted by style, flamboyance and body language of people who catch her attention. === Exhibitions === Brooklyn Museum, New York: Liz Johnson Artur: Dusha (3 May-18 August 2019) This solo exhibition, curated by Drew Sawyer, featured material from the Black Balloon Archive, including the artist's photo sketchbooks. The term Dusha is the Russian word for \\"soul.\\" David Nolan Gallery, New York: This Synthetic Moment (18 January‚Äì10 March 2018) Curated by David Hartt, this exhibition also included work by James Barnor, Kwame Brathwaite, David Hartt, Zoe Leonard, and Christopher Williams. The show focused on themes of national identity, border crossing, transition and how we view each other in the public sphere. Lothringer 13 Halle, Munich: A Thousand and X Little Actions (10 October‚Äì21 November 2016) In this exhibition, Johnson Artur‚Äôs Black Balloon Archive was shown for the first time. She was included in this show because of her focus and curiosity towards the lives of others, and her exploration of relationships between human beings. The show was curated by J√∂rg Koopmann and also included artists Jacob Holdt, David Hartt, William E. Jones, and Jason Larkin. Kunstverein, Leipzig: 1.-3.Personal plural: wir, ihr, sie (20 August‚Äì6 September 2016) Thirteen of Johnson Artur‚Äôs photographs were included in this exhibition curated by Anna Voyswinckel. The themes explored included border crossing, personal and community identity, Othering, and the relationship between artist and viewer. The Photographer's Gallery, London: Made You Look: Dandyism and Black Masculinity (15 July‚Äì25 September 2016) Twelve of Johnson Artur‚Äôs photographs from the Black Balloon Archive were included in this group photography exhibition, curated by Ekow Eshun. Among other artists included in the exhibition were Malick Sidib√©, Jeffrey Henson Scales, and Samuel Fosso. The theme of the show was to explore the complications of the identity of the black dandy, how these men are trendsetters in many media realms while also at a high degree of vulnerability and at risk of state violence and incarceration. === Editorial and commercial work === Liz Johnson Artur has worked for the last 30 years as a freelance editorial and commercial photographer on countless publications, including Vibe Magazine, Fader, i-D Magazine, and Spin Magazine. She has said that working commercially has provided her with opportunities photograph people and places relevant to her own artistic practice that she would not have had access to otherwise to. She has photographed the likes of Mos Def, Blur, Amy Winehouse, the Spice Girls and toured with M.I.A, Lady Gaga, and Seun Kuti. == Other projects  Black Balloon Archive === Consisting of hundreds of gelatin silver prints and chromogenic prints, Black Balloon Archive is an archive of images that reflect black communities and their members globally. It began in 1991 and is an ongoing project that involves a desire to create powerful images of the black diaspora and is motivated by a hunger to make connections with communities which, until her mid twenties, she barely knew existed. The name Black Balloon Archive comes from a song by Syl Johnson called \\"Black Balloons\\". Black Balloon Archive is a project whose goal is to show respect to her subject‚Äôs ability to control how they are presented in their own lives by honestly representing that image. In a media climate that often dehumanizes black people and uses their images in unethical ways,Artur‚Äôs body of work is especially important as she focuses on her subjects‚Äô ability to self-determine how they present and are seen by the viewer. The artist explained to i-D magazine that \\"there's a sense of pride in how people display themselves. It's why I like street portraits, because I think there's a real presence that everyone has.\\" === Russians of Colour === Inspired by reconnecting with her father in 2010, Johnson Artur began documenting the stories of \\"Russians of Colour\\". Working in conjunction with journalist Sarah Bentley, the project focuses on black Russians who have grown up without either or both of their parents and who collectively describe themselves as Afro-Russians. == Publications == In 2016, Liz Johnson Artur, a monograph on the artist, was published by Bierke Verlag. This is the first comprehensive overview of her work which captures more than 30 years of photographing strangers globally. This cloth hardcover book was designed by Hendrik Schwantes and is 22x27cm, 136 pages with 114 colour & black and white images. == Awards == AIMIA AGO Prize Liz Johnson Artur was a nominee for the 2017 AIMIA AGO Prize alongside Raymond Boisjoly, Taisuke Koyama, and Hank Willis Thomas. She received a prize for her place on the shortlist. During this competition the Black Balloon Archive was displayed at the Art Gallery of Ontario alongside sketchbooks and two larger prints. == Press == * \\"Hunger and Black Balloons: An Interview with Liz Johnson Artur\\", Canadian Art, 18 April 2016. * Brief Encounters: An interview with Liz Johnson-Artur, The Photography Gallery, 17 August 2016. * liz johnson-artur‚Äôs photos celebrate black communities, black aesthetics, and black creativity, i-D Magazine, 29 September 2016 * Photographer Liz Johnson Artur On Capturing Beautiful Moments Of Everyday Black Life Around The World, The FADER, 28 November 2016. *Yasufumi Nakamori, Liz Johnson Artur, A Conversation from South London, Camera Austria International 149  2020 == References  External links == * Official website * #1 Shirley: Black Balloon Archive.

Hooda was acquiring land from poor, illiterate farmers at a low rate in the name of \\"public interest\\" only to later license this to builders after granting out-of-turn favors that helped the land value increase exponentially. During his 10-year rule as Chief Minister, Hooda, licensed a massive 24,825 acres of land compared to just 8,550.32 acres by successive Chief Ministers in the 23 years preceding Hooda rule.Hooda‚Äôs land largesse for pvt builder ‚Äòclear fraud‚Äô, SC restores it to HUDA, Firstpost, 15 May 2016. ==DetailsModus of scam=== Builders coerce farmers to sell their land by getting the government to use the Section 4 of the land law to have a government notification issued to the farmer that their land is required for the \\"public purpose\\". Builders try to acquire this land by offering a small premium above the government's rate for the acquisition of the land. If landowners farmers still resist the sale, then Section 6 of land law is applied by declaring the government's intention to acquire land, which forces the reluctant farmers to sell the land to builders at small premium. Once the land is acquired by the builders, government cancels the acquisition process and releases the land to new build owners, along with the change in land use permission to build residential and industrial building on the farm land. This results in steep rise in the land prices, resulting in massive gains for the builders, opportunity cost loss to the farmers and land tax revenue loss to the government. Robert Vadra and DLF were the beneficiary builders in Hooda's regime. Vadra made an illegal profit of more than INR50 crore after buying 3 acre land for INR 7 crore and by onselling it to DLF for INR 58 crore after a few months after Hooda's Indian National Congress government had granted a Change in Land Use license to convert its usage from agriculture to commercial. vadra has bought properties using unsecured loans from DLF.All you need to know about Robert Vadra's shady Haryana land deal, Times Now, 22 Dec 2017.

The famous artist-designer, Platon Andreevich, wants to prolong the life of a man by sculpting and drawing, trying to overcome death and improve the world around him with the help of his talent.

She founded Mercyhurst College in 1926 and served as its first president. As an advocate of women's higher education, she believed that women should have the same chances and opportunities that men do. This was the foundation of her journey, along with her Catholic faith. Mother Borgia Egan Photograph Headshot ca 1930 == Life == Borgia Egan was born on 22 March 1876. She graduated from Catholic University and Duquesne University. She joined the Sisters of Mercy in 1831, and brought the lessons from the sisters to Erie, Pennsylvania, in the year 1920. Egan became Mother Superior of the Sisters of Mercy in Erie, Pennsylvania and became a well-known and well-liked member of the Diocese of Erie. She was a very enthusiastic speaker for women's higher education and with the assistance and support of Bishop Gannon, she sought to establish an institution of higher education for women in Erie. She founded Mercyhurst College in 1926 and became the first president of the institution, serving from 1926 to 1962. She was known as the \\"6 foot nun\\" because she towered over all other students and faculty. She was described by her students as having \\"a towering stance and ready sense of humor combined with this intellectual prowess to make her an unforgettable woman.\\" During her served time as President of Mercyhurst College, she suffered a stroke in 1956 and was hospitalized for three years after. Borgia Egan remained the president of Mercyhurst College until her death at age 84 on 11 February 1962. == Sisters of Mercy == The Sisters of Mercy were founded in 1831 by Catherine McAuley in Dublin, Ireland. She encouraged peace and harmony in all people. Born in Dublin Ireland, McAuley wanted to change the religious views of Dublin and to promote peace and safety for women and children. To carry out her mission, she created a house for religious worship, run and organized by other women like her. Titled, \\"The House of Mercy,\\" this was a place for poor women and children to feel safe and was the foundation of the Sisters of Mercy. The three main values and purposes that Sister Catherine wanted to enforce in the religious safeplace were healthcare, education, and social welfare. The Sisters of Mercy, also known as the Religious Sisters of Mercy (RSM), is a Catholic women's religious order. The main goal of the Sisters is to serve anyone who is suffering from illness, poverty, or struggling with day to day life. They have founded schools in countries like Ireland, United States, and Canada. There were over 11,000 members of the Sisters of Mercy across the globe in 2001. === Core Values of the Sisters of Mercy === # Spirituality # Community # Service # Social Justice and Our Critical Concerns # Works of Mercy === Mission Statement === \\"We carry out the mission of mercy guided by prayerful consideration of the needs of our time.\\" == Mercyhurst University == Mother Borgia Egan brought the Sisters of Mercy to Erie, Pennsylvania, in the United States to help spread the values of the Sisters throughout the world. After they arrived in Erie, Bishop Gannon of the Diocese of Erie approached Mother Borgia about creating an institution that focused on the women in the community. With the help of the Sisters of Mercy, Mother Borgia, took out all of the money from the bank and bought a large piece of land to fulfill Bishop Gannon‚Äôs wishes. On 8 September 1924, construction started for the new college. The building itself was designed by architect F. Ferdinand Durang in a Tudor Gothic style. Mother Borgia wanted the exterior to have as much detail as the interior of the building. However, near the end of the project, the workers went on strike and the Sisters of Mercy in Erie had to complete the project on their own. Mercyhurst College was founded on 7 September 1926 in Erie, Pennsylvania. Originally an all Catholic, women‚Äôs institution, Mercyhurst College opened with the help of the Sisters of Mercy in the Diocese of Erie. With Mother Borgia as the first president, the college sought to enhance the learning experiences of young women and to give them a chance to use their potential. There was only 23 students that attended the college when it first opened, but the number of students grew soon enough. Mother Borgia Egan remained president of Mercyhurst College from 1926-1963, all while maintaining the position of Mother Superior for the Sisters of Mercy in the Diocese of Erie. Mercyhurst College became a co-ed institution in 1969. On 25 January 2012, Mercyhurst College was officially renamed Mercyhurst University.

He is the principal of Peter Cardew Architects based in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. His portfolio includes projects ranging across different scales, including single family housing, schools, art galleries, office buildings, and exhibition buildings. Cardew has won numerous awards for his work, including the Royal Architectural Institute of Canada (RAIC) Gold Medal in 2012. Many critics regard him as an \\"architect's architect\\" for his innovative exploration of structure, materiality, and spatial experiences. His work has been featured in various exhibitions and publications. == Early Life and Education == Born in 1939, Peter Cardew grew up in the suburbs of Surrey, England. Some of his earliest childhood memories were filled with terrors of World War II. He moved into a safer refuge in Lancashire during wartime. These early memories caused Cardew to be inclined to use bare concrete in his architecture, as it resonated with childhood feelings of safety. Peter Cardew attended Kingston College of Art in the Royal Borough of Kingston Upon Thames in England in 1958. Prior to his completion of a Diploma in Architecture in 1965, he took a year off to work on a exhibition pavilion with Max B√§cher Architect in Stuttgart, West Germany during 1961 to 1962. Following work for a number of small firms after his graduation, Cardew worked as a project architect with Roman Halter & Associates in London, England until the year of 1966. In the same year, despite an offer of partnership at a young age, he decided to emigrate to Vancouver, Canada. == Career  1967-1980: Tenures with Rhone & Iredale Architects === Peter Cardew gravitated to Rhone & Iredale Architects after he arrived in Vancouver in 1967. Rhone & Iredale Architects was considered as an innovative architectural firm at that time, and it has incubated many notable architects: Richard Henriquez, Peter Busby, Rainer Fassler, and Miller & Hull to name a few. During Cardew's tenures with Rhone & Iredale‚Äîwhere he became a partner in 1974‚Äîhe contributed to several fine designs, including the Crown Life Building and False Creek Row Houses.  Crown Life Plaza, Vancouver, 1978  Peter Cardew was the project architect of Crown Life Plaza when he served as a partner for Rhone & Iredale. The project was commissioned by the Regina-based Crown Life Insurance Company. Located on 1500 West Georgia Street, the building serves as a gateway to Vancouver's central downtown area. The triangular 20-storey office building is shaped by its unique site where Vancouver's urban grid meets the harbor-facing street. Characterized by glass cladding and a concrete core, the building rests on a brick plinth, showing the rich materiality of the properties. The plaza features a reflecting pool, a cascading waterfall and one-storey retail pavilion that imitates the triangular footprint of the office tower. === 1980 - Present: Peter Cardew Architects === As Rhone & Iredale was closing in 1980, Peter Cardew established his private eponymous practice in Vancouver. Cardew has consistently kept his practice small, low-profile, and limited in size and number of projects, so as to remain significantly involved and assure the quality of work. Some notable former employees include Russell Acton, Michael Kothke, Rob Grant, David Scott, and Elizabeth Shotton; many of Cardew's employees have moved on and established their own successful careers.  C.N. Pavilion, Expo 86, Vancouver, 1986  During a transformative decade in which Vancouver hosted Expo 86, Peter Cardew designed the C.N. (Canadian National) Pavilion to showcase the Canadian National Railways. Cardew aspired to create a socially interactive architecture, in part through providing generous public spaces. Situated along Vancouver's downtown waterfront, the design of the pavilion addressed its intention, context, circulation, and functions well. It was conceived as a fully exposed steel framework wrapping around a cylinder theatre, which could only be entered by a bridge. Because of the poor condition of the site, Cardew designed the main structure as a grand steel canopy suspended by a gantry system with three foundation locations. This structural design not only embraced the sounding beautiful harbour views, but also provided better accessibility for visitors. This pavilion took cues from 19th century railway terminals and was a counterpoint to the traditional design of exposition pavilions at the time. This exhibition pavilion received the Canadian Architect Award of Excellence in 1985.  Stone Band School, Stone Indian Reserve NO. 1, British Columbia, 1992  Completed to serve the community of Chilcotin region in central British Columbia, Stone Band School houses a library, offices, classrooms for kindergarten and grade levels, and a yet unbuilt gymnasium for a second phase. The surrounding topography, kikwilli vernacular cultures, and community lifestyle became the driving forces behind the design. The building appears quite horizontal, responding to the contextual land form. Clusters of classrooms and offices are placed around a central gathering core, illuminated by a glazed conical skylight which is assembled of peeled fir poles. Morris and Helen Belkin Art Gallery, Vancouver, 1995 by Peter Cardew Architects  Morris and Helen Belkin Art Gallery, Vancouver, 1995  Morris and Helen Belkin Art Gallery is configured by the plaza it shares with other arts faculties on the University of British Columbia's campus. The exterior of the art gallery is manipulated carefully to reflect programs, circulation and site conditions. The main entrance faces a tree-lined boulevard, and the other entrance within the shared plaza accommodates a loading dock with a suspended canopy. The open interior arrangement allows administrative offices on the mezzanine floor to overlook gallery space. Cardew also used two pivoting walls to enhance flexibility. The Belkin Gallery has won multiple awards, including a Royal Architectural Institute of Canada Governor General‚Äôs Medal for Architecture in 1999. === Academics, Publications and Exhibitions === Peter Cardew is very active in academia and in architectural education. He has been an adjunct professor at the University of British Columbia, the University of Calgary, Washington State University, the University of Texas at Austin. He has also widely lectured across continents, including North America, Latin America, Asia, and Europe. Cardew was Chairman of the City of Vancouver Urban Design Panel in 1978. Peter Cardew: Ordinary Buildings In 1996, Charles H. Scott Gallery at Emily Carr College of Art and Design in Vancouver held the exhibition Peter Cardew: Ordinary Buildings, which later on toured across North America. An eponymous accompanying catalogue was published at the same time. The publication features eight projects by Peter Cardew, supported by essays, photographic materials and architectural drawings. == Awards == * Canadian Architect Awards, Award of Excellence (1977, 1980, 1985, 1988, 1991, 1992, 1996, 1999, 2002, 2006) * Royal Architectural Institute of Canada Festival of Architecture Award of Merit (1980) * Architectural Institute of British Columbia Design Award (1982) * Royal Architectural Institute of Canada Governor General‚Äôs Medal for Architecture (1982, 1999) * Architectural Institute of British Columbia Lieutenant Governor‚Äôs Medal for Architecture (1999, 2005) * Royal Architectural Institute of Canada Gold Medal (2012) == Bibliography == * Peter Cardew: Ordinary Buildings, Charles H.

A referendum to change the Bergen County form of government was held in 1974 and was rejected by a margin of 132,168 to 123,106, making Bergen one of four counties to reject proposals modifying the structure of county government, while four other counties passed changes. The measure was supported by the League of Women Voters and other groups as a method of improving the management of the county, while the loss of \\"home rule\\" in the county's 70 municipalities was one of the issues driving opposition to the referendum.Phalon, Richard. \\"Democrats Take Over Bergen's Board\\", The New York Times, November 7, 1974.

Similar propositions were rejected in Passaic, Camden and Middlesex Counties, and approved in Atlantic, Hudson, Union and Mercer.\\" In 1985, a second referendum was held. The proposal to create an executive branch was approved by a high margin: of the 490,437 registered voters, 116,031 voted for and 70,331 against.

She was born to a painter and lithographer, Alexandre-Marie Colin and his wife, who was also a painter. == Biography == Ana√Øs was the second oldest sister of the Colin family. She had an older sister, H√©lo√Øse, and two younger sisters, Laure and Isabelle. All of the siblings were artists and H√©lo√Øse and Ana√Øs worked closely together on many projects for fashion plate illustrations and had similar styles. They came from a long line of ancestors that were also artists including, Jean-Baptise Greuze. The daughters learned skills from their father instead of attending an academy. Ana√Øs‚Äô father was a supporter of the Romantic movement and close friends to Eug√®ne Delacroix, Th√©odore Gericault, and Paul Gavarni. This sparked Ana√Øs‚Äô interest in the Romantic movement as well, and she followed her father‚Äôs footsteps in joining that style for her artwork. Her father had a studio called P√©re in the ‚Äúcenter of the artistic activity in Paris.‚Äù This kept the girls very involved and immersed in the art world. Each of the girls won awards and medals at the Salon between the ages of 14-20. Their paintings and illustrations were admired by viewers. Unlike other female artists during this time, the Colin sisters did not keep to historical or religious themes that were considered high art, and were encouraged by their father to learn proper techniques even though they did not receive official academic training. Ana√Øs went to marry an architect and aquafortist engraver named Gabriel Toudouze in 1845. They were only married for 9 years before he died in 1854, leaving Ana√Øs to take care of their three young children. To provide for her family, Ana√Øs worked and produced many fashion illustration plates for fashion magazines, journals, and books. Ana√Øs‚Äô daughter Isabelle followed in her mother‚Äôs footsteps and became a fashion illustrator and painter. Her oldest son Gustave became a novelist, and his son Georges-Gustave wrote a book about his family's fashion illustration and artistic history titled, Le Costume fran√ßois. Her second son also Edouard became a painter. Ana√Øs died in 1899. == Professional work == Ana√Øs worked for over 35 fashion publications during her career. Fashion magazines became hugely popular from 1830 ‚Äì 1870, providing ample work for female illustrators. She did the majority of her work for the fashion magazine in France called La Mode Illustr√©e. La Mode was distributed weekly and highlighted Victorian fashion trends of the time including accessories to go with the piece. All of the prints for the magazine were hand-colored and inserted with text descriptions explaining the fashions being showcased. Ana√Øs did not only illustrate for French fashion publications, she also illustrated for British fashion journals such as La Belle Assemblee, The Queen (which was equivalent to today‚Äôs Vogue), and Englishwoman‚Äôs Domestic Magazine. Additionally, she illustrated books, depicting leisure and historical romantic scenes. Her main competitor who also did fashion plates was Jules David. David was a painter and lithographer that worked with Adolphe Goubaud, a publisher. When fashion plates became a popular form of illustration this provided a way for Ana√Øs's work to be mass produced. Instead of making the illustrator redraw the same exact image over and over, the artist would either etch, engrave, or lithograph the image and then color it in by hand. This form of production was much more efficient and realistic to produce fashion magazines at the weekly rate they were being printed. The figures being depicted in fashion plates were often very stiff and placed in positions that displayed the fashions best. One of the downsides to fashion plates are that they did not show three- dimensional perspectives. Ana√Øs ended up having a slightly more successful career than her sister H√©lo√Øse due to the fact she lived longer and had a larger collection of work. Museums like The Metropolitan Museum of Art carry a collection of her prints while others are still around for sale. == Principal works == * The Colin Family (1834-1835), watercolor by Ana√Øs and H√©lo√Øse Colin, Musee de la Mode et du Costume. * A Girl and Her Cat, graphite pencil on paper * Portrait d‚Äôune dame portant une robe √† crinoline, watercolor * Portrait of a young woman seated in a chair (1842‚Äì1842), watercolor == Public collections == * The Metropolitan Museum of Art. ** La Saison (1868) ** Study: Two Women in an Evening Dress (1860) ** Fashion Illustration, from La Mode Illustr√©e, no. 28 (1886). ** Fashion plate, from Le Conseiller des Dames et de Demoiselles (1859) ** A Lady in a Hunting Costume with a Lady in Walking Costume on a Mountain Path from La Mode Illustr√©e (1881). ** Toilettes de Mme.

In 1932, as one of the founding members of the group called the Ind√©licats, he participated to its activities. They published an anarchist magazine, in the form of booklets containing ten linocuts (engravings on linoleum) printed at about a hundred copies, which took a political and critical look on society. Some of the social issues dealt with by Est√®ve, Pignon, Roger Falck, Georges Ort, Adrien Cumora, Gis√®le Delsine, Louis F√©ron, Fougeron, Marcel Debarbieux and Gabriel Robin with very effective graphic force were Bastille Day (14 July), unemployment, the elite, athletes, colonization and war. Paul Rosenberg was the first art dealer to take notice of Robin. He went to visit him in Aulnay-sous-Bois in 1938 and immediately bought two large canvases Robin had just finished. Rosenberg showed these paintings to Braque and Picasso and Braque advised him to keep an eye on the artist. He went back to Aulnay several times and bought a dozen canvases. The declaration of war interrupted these transactions as Paul Rosenberg left for the United States in 1940 in order to escape the Nazis and later opened a gallery in New York. During his too short career as a recognized and celebrated artist both by critics and by the art market, Robin took part in many exhibitions with his friends Esteve, Fougeron and Pignon. In February 1943, he participated in the exhibition Douze peintres d‚Äôaujourd‚Äôhui (Twelve Painters of Today) organized by the art critic Gaston Diehl (who founded the Salon de Mai that same year) t the Galerie de France. It also included the painters Bazaine, Bor√®s, Est√®ve, Fougeron, Gischia, Lapicque, Le Moal, Manessier, Pignon, Robin, Singier and Jacques Villon. It is thanks to Andr√© Lhote and Jacques Villon, with whom he had a long time friendship that Robin rose to great successes. Andr√© Lhote and his wife, Simone Camin, were very interested by Robin's colorful research built upon the work of Georges de La Tour, nd they organized his first solo exhibition at the gallery Pittoresque in 1943. In 1945, Ren√© Drouin, who had just founded his gallery Place Vend√¥me, signed a contract with him as well as with Fougeron Gischia, Singier, Manessier and Le Moal. Two years later, he signed with the Billiet ‚Äì Caputo gallery which organized two exhibitions of his work. Until 1950, Robin exhibited his works many times in Paris in places such as the Salon d‚Äôautomne, and at the exhibition on French Contemporary Art (in 1946) at the Mus√©e du Luxembourg. He also presented his works in Lyon (Galerie Folklore of Marcel Michaud in 1945), in Saint-√âtienne (an exhibition entitled Young Masters of the School of Paris in 1946 at the Mus√©e de Saint-Etienne), in Nantes (Galerie Michel Columb in 1946 and 1948, and at the Galerie Mignon ‚Äì Massart in 1950) and finally in Lille (Galerie Evrard in 1950). He will also exhibit in Rio de Janeiro and S√£o Paulo in 1945 at French Painters Today exhibition and in Tokyo et Osaka ein 1962, during the International Exhibition of French Painting. In the early fifties, Robin started moving away from the glowing lights √† la Georges de la Tour and began a new visual and stylistic research close to lyrical abstractionism (abstraction lyrique). The art market did not like this change and started moving away from Robin. During the same period, he was an active member of Orph√©on, a bunch of happy friends from Aulnay ( Jean Buclet, Guy Robin, Georges S√©n√©chal, Jacques Six, Andr√© Laude et Serge Wellens) and Wellens) who shared the common desire to bring poetry to the suburbs and make it a living thing. The artist went back to his cobbler shop in Aulnay-sous- Bois. He continued painting, away from the art market, until his death in 1970. A year after his death, a retrospective of Robin's work was presented at the City Hall of Martel (Lot), during the Roger Vitrac festival. In November and December 2008, his adopted hometown of Aulnay honored him with a retrospective at the Espace Gainville and showed a selection of his works in the exhibition entitled Lights, Colors, Shapes: Creation in France during the Years 1940 ‚Äì 1950 at the l'H√¥tel of Ville of Aulnay-sous-Bois. == The work == In his early years, Gabriel Robin was influenced by Impressionism (Sisley), Fauvisme (Vlaminck, Derain), Cubism (Juan Gris, Andr√© Lhote, La Fresnaye).

These special lightings inspired by the works of Georges de La Tour give to his paintings a tragic constructive power which reveals the anxiety of the artist about his epoch and his contemporaries.

His painting evolved towards movement and color. Now, violent tones in dancing flames and superimposed layers of dominate his work which has shifted towards a powerful lyric abstraction. His Terres chaudes and Terres froides (Warm lands and Cold lands, 1949 ‚Äì 1961) are abstract landscapes which evoke terrible fires in the forest, storms and shipwrecks in oceans full of despair. The colors vibrate, move and inevitably material has to be used : he incorporates sand in his compositions.

The organization was founded in the early 1970s with headquarters in Kaduna. It became operational in 1979 and gained wider acceptance as an advocacy group in 1987. MACBAN represents the interest of about 100,000 semi-nomads and nomads in the country. ==History== Official records of the early history of Miyetti Allah are sparse, the oral history by some members trace it to the 1960s while others to 1972 when the association was formed in Kaduna. The association's early members were largely dominated by settled Fulanis whose early concept of Miyetti Allah was to promote the welfare of all Fulanis through self help. In the 1970s, the organization was led by Muhammadu Sa'adu with membership in Kaduna and Plateau States. Sa'adu who was born in Jos but spent his adulthood in Kaduna was a key figure in the campaigns to get new members to join. Both Kaduna and Plateau states had local branches affiliated with a local government or community, the meetings were irregular and not all national or state level resolutions were adhered to. But as the association expanded to more states, aims favoring nomadic education and access of grazing reserves by cattle breeders became a common theme. ==Mission== A major goal of MACBAN is to be the umbrella organization of Fulani herdsmen within the country. The activities of the organization involves liaising with the government on behalf of pastoralists, land use rights, nomadic education and conflict resolution between pastoralists and farmers. The group also supports protecting and increasing grazing reserves for cattle breeders in the country. However, not all pastoralists intend to stay within grazing reserves and the organization provides information to convince grazing reserve skeptics among the nomads to buy into the idea. As the major promoter of welfare of Fulani pastoralists, increase incidence of farmer-herder conflicts and cattle rustling since 2011 brought the previously unknown group into wider consciousness. ==Structure== The group's board of trustees is led by the Sultan of Sokoto and it receives funding from the board and other donors. The national chairman is elected every four years. When MACBAN was founded it received support from Sultan Abubakar III, Aminu, Emir Zazzau, Usman Nagogo, the Emir of Katsina and Ado Bayero, late Emir of Kano. The emirs of these emirates compose a part of the group's board of trustees. MACBAN has a national secretariat at Kaduna and state offices. ==References== Category:Advocacy groups in Nigeria Category:Fula people ","title":"Miyetti Allah"},{"id":"56842133","text":"Siege of Zamo≈õƒá was part of The Deluge, a series of campaigns in the Polish‚ÄìLithuanian Commonwealth, that took place in early 1656. == Prelude == In the summer of 1655, the joint Russo-Cossack army approached the fortress, but did not try to capture it. During the Deluge in 1655, when the rest of Poland quickly surrendered to Charles X Gustav of Sweden, Lord of Zamo≈õƒá, Jan II Zamoyski, decided to support King John II Casimir of Poland. == Siege == On February 25, 1656, Swedish troops appeared at the gates of the stronghold. According to a legend, when Swedish representatives came to the town and proposed the capitulation of the fortress, Jan 'Sobiepan' Zamoyski answered: \\"I am the Lord for myself and I will not give Zamo≈õƒá to the Swedes\\". The Swedes began with artillery barrage, but due to lack of heavy guns, it was not successful. Within a few days, Charles X Gustav realized that capturing Zamo≈õƒá, whose fortifications had been strengthened since 1648, was impossible, and on March 1, the invaders withdrew. == Aftermath == Next year, the Transilvanian army under George II R√°k√≥czi appeared near Zamo≈õƒá, but it did not even try to capture the mighty fortress. In the last stage of the war, Zamo≈õƒá was a prison for high-ranking officers of the Swedish Army. Among those kept there, was Field Marshal Arvid Wittenberg, who died in prison of natural causes. == In popular culture == Swedish siege of Zamo≈õƒá was described by Henryk Sienkiewicz, in his popular book The Deluge (1886). == References == Category:Second Northern War Category:Conflicts in 1656 Category:1656 in Europe Zamosc Zamosc Zamosc Category:1656 in the Polish‚ÄìLithuanian Commonwealth Category:Zamo≈õƒá ","title":"Siege of Zamo≈õƒá"},{"id":"56842160","text":"The Flying Marine is a 1929 American action film directed by Albert S.

About to break her engagement, Sally receives word that Steve has been injured in an accident resulting from stunt work for a film. She and Mitch agree their relationship must be kept secret from Steve. The younger brother who had lost his hearing as a result of the injury, finds out that Mitch and Sally raised the money for an operation he needs.

It has won the second highest number of gold medals at the championships (after the United States) and also has the second highest medals total (after the U.S.). The vast majority of its medals have come in middle- and long-distance running events, mostly on the men's side. It ranks fourth on all-time placing tables at the competition, reflecting its narrow event focus. The nation typically sends medium-sized delegations of 40‚Äì50 athletes. Kenya ranked number one on gold medals at the 2015 World Championships in Athletics and has finished in the top five nations on the medal table at all but five editions. The country's most successful athlete at the competition is Ezekiel Kemboi, who has won four gold medals and three silver medals in the men's 3000 metres steeplechase. Kenya's most successful woman, Vivian Cheruiyot, has also won four gold medals and also a silver in the 5000 metres and 10,000 metres events. Men's steeplechaser Moses Kiptanui won three straight titles from 1991 to 1995 and Asbel Kiprop achieved the same feat in the 1500 metres from 2011 to 2015. Julius Yego is the country's only field event medallist, having won the men's javelin throw in 2015. Kenya's dominance in the steeplechase event is such that a Kenyan-born man has won every title since 1991. Former Kenyans have also had impacts for other nations at the championships, including 2007's double champion Bernard Lagat (United States), two-time steeplechase champion Saif Saaeed Shaheen (Qatar) and marathon winner Rose Chelimo (Bahrain). == Medal table == {   - ! rowspan=\\"2\\" Championships ! colspan=\\"3\\"  Men ! colspan=\\"3\\"  Women ! colspan=\\"6\\"  Total - ! style=\\"background-color: gold;\\"  Gold ! style=\\"background-color: silver;\\"  Silver ! style=\\"background-color: #cc9966;\\"  Bronze ! style=\\"background- color: gold;\\"  Gold ! style=\\"background-color: silver;\\"  Silver ! style=\\"background-color: #cc9966;\\"  Bronze ! style=\\"background-color: gold;\\"  Gold ! style=\\"background-color: silver;\\"  Silver ! style=\\"background-color: #cc9966;\\"  Bronze !

He laments the Elizabethan golden age and recalls how England's joy was suddenly eclipsed by Elizabeth's death. Dekker personifies Death and blames him for taking the Queen's life.Dekker, Thomas. The Non-Dramatic Works of. Thomas Dekker: In Five Volumes, Volume 1. 1598-1603. Accessed from Google Books, Page 86. Dekker recalls how the announcement of Elizabeth's death \\"tooke away hearts from millions\\" and plunged her subjects into grief.Dekker, Thomas. The Non-Dramatic Works of. Thomas Dekker: In Five Volumes, Volume 1. 1598-1603. Accessed from Google Books, 86. He recalls the widespread lamentation at her death and includes in his work some of the epigrams written for her funeral at Whitehall.Dekker, Thomas. The Non-Dramatic Works of. Thomas Dekker: In Five Volumes, Volume 1. 1598-1603. Accessed from Google Books, 93. Dekker was not the only one to view the outbreak of plague as a divine consequence of Elizabeth's death.Jones, Emily Griffiths. \\"Hereditary Succession and Death in The Wonderful Year and the Revenger's Tragedy.\\" SEL: Studies in English Literature 1500‚Äì1900, no. 56, vol 2. (2016): p. 327+, 332.Bayman, Anna. Thomas Dekker and the Culture of Pamphleteering in Early Modern London. Farnham, Surrey: Ashgate, 2014. Page 131. Dekker then turns to the accession of James I: he says that the \\"holesome receipt of a proclaymed King\\" temporarily cured the grief caused by Elizabeth I's death.Dekker, Thomas. The Non-Dramatic Works of. Thomas Dekker: In Five Volumes, Volume 1. 1598-1603. Accessed from Google Books, Page 95. He recalls the sudden change in monarch and the particular effect that this has on the kingdom: \\"Upon Thursday it was treason to cry God save king James of England, and upon Friday treason not to cry so\\".Dekker, Thomas. The Non-Dramatic Works of. Thomas Dekker: In Five Volumes, Volume 1. 1598-1603. Accessed from Google Books, 97. He says that the feeling of the golden age returned in the first months of James I's rule, but when the plague struck in the summer of 1603, people were once again struck with lamentation. The remainder of The Wonderful Year recounts the horrors of the plague epidemic in 1603, both in London and the surrounding countryside. Dekker also gives the Plague a persona in order to personally blame it for the thousands of deaths that it causes, and describes how the plague cannot be avoided: it affects everyone to some extent and takes its victims without warning.Dekker, Thomas. The Non-Dramatic Works of. Thomas Dekker: In Five Volumes, Volume 1. 1598-1603. Accessed from Google Books, 105. Dekker comments on how the number of plague victims could double from morning to night.Dekker, Thomas. The Non- Dramatic Works of. Thomas Dekker: In Five Volumes, Volume 1. 1598-1603. Accessed from Google Books, 106. Overall, Dekker concludes that Death has the last say, and the widespread fear of and the struggle to avoid death during 1603 made \\"fooles\\" of everyone.Dekker, Thomas. The Non-Dramatic Works of.

This is on Roman Road, the original A1 road Hang EastSometimes referred to as East Hang. was a Wapentake (Hundred), which is an administrative division (or ancient district), in the historic county of the North Riding of Yorkshire. It was one of the smaller wapentakes by area and consisted of nine parishes and two towns; Bedale and Masham. ==History== Its name derives from its meeting place of Hang Bank which was halfway between Hutton Hang and the village of Finghall. Hang is believed to derive from the Old English word Hangar which meant a wooded slope. The place is mentioned in the Domesday Book as Hotun. Both Hang East and Hang West, were originally one wapentake (Hang) until they were divided in the 13th century; this is why Hang East wapentake derives its name from a hill which was no longer in its area. Hang East was divided up into nine parishes; Bedale, Catterick, Hornby, Kirkby Fleetham, Masham, Patrick Brompton, Scruton, Thornton Watlass and Well. It was bordered to the south by Claro Wapentake and to the east by HallikeldThe spelling of this Wapentake varies between Halikeld and Hallikeld. and Gilling East Wapentakes. To the north lay Richmond and Gilling West Wapentake with Hang West on its western edge. In 1831, the Wapentake was measured as covering and was across at its widest and was from north to south. It was chiefly agricultural in nature and possessed two market towns; Bedale and Masham. Its land was described as being more fertile and low-lying than Hang West wapentake (to the west) which contained steeper valleys and higher peaks. In modern times, the area that the Wapentake covered is divided between the Hambleton and Richmondshire districts of North Yorkshire. ==Settlements== The table below lists the settlements within the Hang East Wapentake.

Distributed by Sony Pictures Releasing, it is intended to be the second film in the Sony Pictures Universe of Marvel Characters. The film is directed by Daniel Espinosa from a script by the writing teams of Matt Sazama and Burk Sharpless, and Art Marcum and Matt Holloway, and stars Jared Leto as Michael Morbius alongside Matt Smith, Adria Arjona, Jared Harris, Al Madrigal, and Tyrese Gibson. In the film, Morbius becomes a vampire after attempting to cure himself of a rare blood disease. After announcing plans for a new shared universe of films inspired by Spider-Man characters beginning with Venom (2018), Sony began developing one based on Morbius. Sazama and Sharpless had written a script by November 2017, with Marcum and Holloway joining later. Leto and Espinosa officially joined in June 2018. Work began in earnest at the end of the year with further casting, ahead of a production start in February 2019 in London. Filming was confirmed to have been completed by June 2019. Morbius is scheduled to be released in the United States on March 19, 2021, delayed from an initial July 2020 date due to the COVID-19 pandemic. == Premise == Suffering from a rare blood disease, Michael Morbius tries a dangerous cure that afflicts him with a form of vampirism. == Cast == * Jared Leto as Michael Morbius: A scientist suffering from a rare blood disease since his early childhood whose attempts to cure himself afflict him with a form of vampirism, gaining superhuman abilities but none of the superstitious weaknesses associated with vampires. Leto was drawn to the character's struggle with his disease and the moral implications of a hero who has a thirst for blood. * Matt Smith as Loxias Crown: Morbius' friend who suffers from the same rare blood disease. Smith joined the film, after previously turning down other superhero film roles, due to director Daniel Espinosa's involvement and encouragement from Karen Gillan, who portrays Nebula in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) and previously worked with Smith on Doctor Who. * Adria Arjona as Martine Bancroft: Morbius' fianc√©e. * Jared Harris as Morbius' mentor. * Al Madrigal as Alberto Rodriguez: An FBI agent hunting Morbius. * Tyrese Gibson as Simon Stroud: An FBI agent hunting Morbius. Gibson noted that the character is white in the comic books, and the producers \\"made him black\\" to cast the actor. Stroud has a \\"hi-tech weapons-grade arm\\" in the film, and Gibson described him as a superhero. Gibson signed a three-picture deal when he joined the film. Additionally, Michael Keaton will appear in the film. He previously portrayed Adrian Toomes / Vulture in the Marvel Cinematic Universe film Spider-Man: Homecoming (2017), but has not been confirmed to be reprising that role. == Production  Development === Artisan Entertainment announced a deal with Marvel Entertainment in May 2000 to co-produce, finance, and distribute several films based on Marvel Comics characters, including Morbius, the Living Vampire. Previously, the character was set to appear in Blade (1998), portrayed by director Stephen Norrington in a cameo appearance ahead of a larger role in a sequel. However, the character was cut from the first film and not introduced in Blade II (2002) after Norrington chose not to return for that film. In May 2017, Sony announced plans for a new shared universe named the \\"Sony Pictures Universe of Marvel Characters\\", to feature Spider-Man- related properties beginning with Venom in October 2018. That November, Matt Sazama and Burk Sharpless submitted a script to Sony for a Morbius film, after a \\"secret development process\\" at the studio. Jared Leto became \\"loosely attached\\" to star in the title role, but would not commit to the film until he was happy with its direction; Leto asked to personally meet with several director candidates. By the end of April 2018, Sony had approached Antoine Fuqua about potentially directing the film. He expressed interest in taking on the project, and said that if he was to make a film in the superhero genre he would want to make it \\"something that's closer to what I get excited about.\\" He ultimately chose not to take on the project. Other directors that Sony approached about the film included F. Gary Gray, who considered directing the film but ultimately turned down the role, and Daniel Espinosa, who previously directed the film Life (2017) for the studio. In May, while on tour in Germany with his band Thirty Seconds to Mars, Leto met with Espinosa to talk about the film, and the pair were both confirmed for the project at the end of June. Avi Arad, Matt Tolmach, and Lucas Foster were set to produce, and Sony was expected to give the film a release date shortly after with filming set to begin by the end of 2018. The studio hoped the film would fit in with its already-set Marvel slate, including Venom and Spider-Man: Far From Home (2019). === Pre-production === By the end of September, Sony was intending for production on the film to take place in Atlanta, Georgia‚Äîwhere Spider-Man: Homecoming (2017) and Venom were previously produced‚Äîbut had still not set a release date for the film. Screen Rant's Cooper Hood opined that Sony was likely waiting to see the response to Venom in early October, with Arad confirming at that time that there was excitement at Sony to produce Morbius, especially due to the story of a \\"healer that becomes a killer, and how do you deal with [that?]\\" Tolmach said the project was \\"very far along\\" at that stage and they were now planning to begin filming in early 2019, with the intention that Morbius would be the second film released as part of Sony's shared universe after Venom. He added that Leto was bringing the same \\"intensity\\" to the film that he had brought to playing the Joker in Suicide Squad (2016). By November, box office analysts believed that Venom had been successful enough for Sony to move ahead with other films like Morbius, and at the end of that month the studio dated an untitled Marvel film that was believed to be Morbius for a July 10, 2020, release. Adria Arjona entered negotiations to portray the film's female lead, Martine Bancroft, in December; her involvement was confirmed a month later when Sony pushed the release date to July 31, and Matt Smith also joined the cast. === Filming === Principal photography began during the last week of February 2019 in London, under the working title Plasma. Oliver Wood served as cinematographer for the film. With the start of filming, Jared Harris and Tyrese Gibson joined the cast as Morbius's mentor and an FBI agent hunting Morbius, respectively. Smith was revealed to be portraying the villainous Loxias Crown. In March, filming took place in Manchester's Northern Quarter, doubling for New York City. A month later, Gibson revealed that he was portraying Simon Stroud, and that Al Madrigal had been cast as his partner, Alberto Rodriguez. At the end of the month, Justin Haythe was believed to have contributed to the film's script. Filming was scheduled to take 12 weeks, and Venom producer Amy Pascal said in June that production had \\"just wrapped\\" on the project. === Post-production === In September 2019, Sony announced a new agreement with Disney that extended a previous deal to have Marvel Studios and its president Kevin Feige produce a sequel to Far From Home, keeping Spider-Man in Marvel's shared universe, the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU). As part of the new agreement, Feige stated that moving forward the MCU's Spider-Man would be able to \\"cross cinematic universes\\" and appear in Sony's own shared universe as well. This interaction was said to be \\"a 'call and answer' between the two franchises as they acknowledge details between the two in what would loosely be described as a shared detailed universe\\". The film's first trailer, released in January 2020, included an image of Spider-Man that commentators equated to the Sam Raimi-directed Spider-Man films though it appeared to be used as a reference to the ending of Far From Home. The trailer also included a brief appearance by Michael Keaton, who previously portrayed Adrian Toomes / Vulture from the co-produced Marvel Studios Spider-Man film, Spider-Man: Homecoming. At that time, Sony also revealed that Art Marcum and Matt Holloway had contributed to the film's script. Reshoots for the film had begun in Los Angeles by early February 2020. A month later, as film productions around the United States were halted due to the COVID-19 pandemic, Sony was said to no longer be in production on the film. At the end of the month, the film's release date was pushed back to March 19, 2021, due to the pandemic closing theaters around the world. == Music== By October 2019, Jon Ekstrand was set to compose the score for Morbius after doing the same for Espinosa's previous films. == Marketing == The first trailer for the film was released on January 13, 2020. Julia Alexander at The Verge described the premise of the film as presented by the trailer as \\"ridiculous\\", while Matt Goldberg of Collider felt it looked \\"silly\\" and also noted that the film looked very similar to Venom, which he acknowledged was commercially successful. Scott Mendelson, writing for Forbes, agreed with the comparison to Venom which he felt was a good move by Sony due to the success of their last few Spider-Man films, but cautioned that Leto may not have the same box office draw for general audiences that Tom Hardy gave to Venom. Much of the discussion surrounding the trailer centered on the revelation of Keaton's role and the visual reference to Spider-Man, which led to questions about the film's relationship with the Spider-Man films and the wider Marvel Cinematic Universe. == Release == Morbius is scheduled to be released in the United States on March 19, 2021 in IMAX. It was previously set for release by Sony on July 10, 2020, before moving three weeks later to July 31, 2020.

He was a descendant of the nobleman Hwfa ap Cynddelw to the Owens of Orielton, Pembrokeshire, a family known for parliamentary and military service in Pembrokeshire. His surname was changed to Owen when his father inherited the estates of Hugh Owen's cousin Sir Hugh Owen, 6th Baronet, whom Owen was named after. Educated at Eton College in 1817, and graduating from Christ Church, Oxford in 1822, he first married Angelina Maria Cecilia, daughter of Sir Charles Morgan, 2nd Baronet in 1825, and they had five sons and three daughters, including: Hugh Charles Owen (1826‚Äì1909); John Owen (1828‚Äì1890); Arthur Owen (1829‚Äì1876); and, William Owen (1832‚Äì1889). After Angelina's death in 1844, he remarried in 1845 to Henrietta Fraser, daughter of Edward Rodney, and they had one son and three daughters, including: Alice Henrietta Rodney Owen (died 1925); Ellen Rodney Owen; Edith Rodney Owen; and George Rodney Owen (1859‚Äì1886). ==Political career== Both Owen's father and cousin Hugh had been Tory MPs for Pembroke between 1809 and 1812, with the father also holding Pembrokeshire between 1812 and 1841. Owen also entered Parliament when he was first elected MP for Pembroke unopposed at the 1826 general election as a Tory, after which he admitted his youth and experience, and declared support for religious toleration but not Catholic relief. Although he was re-elected numerous times, including as a Conservative in 1832, Owen was often criticised for an \\"inattention for his parliamentary duties\\". In Parliament, he voted against abolition of the Welsh courts, arguing \\"our sessions should be held in future where they are at present held and, when the bill received Royal Assent, he signed a memorial expressing regret for it. Owen was also against the parliamentary reform scheme put forward by Lord Blandford, divided against emancipation and the Galway franchise bill, and presented petitions for the abolition of slavery. In 1831, he divided against the Grey ministry's reform bill and for Isaac Gascoyne's wrecking amendment, and later divided against a reintroduced version of the former in 1831, and then again upon its second and third readings. He later resigned in 1838 when his father obliged him to vacate the seat for Sir James Graham, 2nd Baronet. ==1861 Pembrokeshire by-election== After 23 years of absence from Parliament, in January 1861, he attempted to be elected as a Liberal for Pembrokeshire at a by-election resulting from the elevation of the sitting member, Lord Emlyn, to the peerage following the death of his father. Owen's candidacy was from the outset impacted upon by his financial difficulties, even though it was confidently asserted that his ebts would be honoured. Nominating him at Haverfordwest, Thomas Davies Lloyd of Bronwydd referred to the tradition of the house of Orielton and trusted that their fortunes would be revived. Owen was however, unsuccessful. ==Member for Pembroke Boroughs== Nevertheless, the next month, he was elected as a Liberal in his former constituency, Pembroke, succeeding his father who had recently died, at a by-election in 1861. There was mounting opposition to Owen during the 1860s, and in 1864 there were suggestions that he be replaced by Richard Potter, chairman of the Great Western Railway. However, he held the seat until he was defeated in 1868. ==Baronetcy== Owen succeeded his father as Baronet of Orielton, Pembrokeshire on 6 February 1861 and, upon his own death in 1891, the title was passed to his son Hugh Owen. ==Other activities== In 1830, Owen was made Lieutenant-Colonel Commandant of the Pembrokeshire militia, and later, between 1872 and 1875, was a Colonel of the Pembrokeshire artillery militia. From 1872 to his death, he was also aide-de-camp to Queen Victoria. He was also at some point Deputy Lieutenant of Pembrokeshire. Owen died at Barnes in September 1891 aged 87. The passing years had erased some of the bitterness of political contests and the Pembrokeshire Herald, which was so hostile to him in the 1860s, described him as \\"accomplished, courteous and genial\\" and \\"in all respects a gentleman.\\" ==References * Category:Liberal Party (UK) MPs for Welsh constituencies Category:Tory MPs (pre-1834) Category:Conservative Party (UK) MPs for Welsh constituencies Category:Members of the Parliament of the United Kingdom for Pembrokeshire constituencies Category:Baronets in the Baronetage of the United Kingdom Category:Deputy Lieutenants of Pembrokeshire Category:UK MPs 1826‚Äì1830 Category:UK MPs 1830‚Äì1831 Category:UK MPs 1831‚Äì1832 Category:UK MPs 1832‚Äì1835 Category:UK MPs 1835‚Äì1837 Category:UK MPs 1837‚Äì1841 Category:UK MPs 1859‚Äì1865 Category:UK MPs 1865‚Äì1868 Category:1803 births Category:1891 deaths Category:People educated at Eton College Category:Alumni of Christ Church, Oxford ","title":"Sir Hugh Owen Owen, 2nd Baronet"},{"id":"56842337","text":"The Jean-Pierre Bay is a freshwater body of the south-eastern part of the Gouin Reservoir, in the territory of the town of La Tuque, in Haute-Mauricie, in the administrative region of Mauricie, in the province of Quebec, in Canada.

Members of this gens are first mentioned in the time of the Gracchi, but they did not rise to prominence until imperial times. The first of the Rubrii to obtain the consulship was Rubrius Gallus, some time before AD 68.Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology, vol. III, p. 664 (\\"Rubria Gens\\"). ==Origin== The nomen Rubrius is derived from the Latin ruber, red or ruddy. Chase classifies it among those gentilicia that either originated at Rome, or cannot be shown to have come from anywhere else.Chase, p. 131. The nomen Rubrena was probably derived from it using the suffix -enus, which was typically applied to form names from other gentilicia.Chase, p. 118. ==Praenomina== The Rubrii used a variety of praenomina, including Gaius, Lucius, Marcus, Publius, Quintus, and Titus, all of which were among the most common names throughout Roman history. ==Branches and cognomina== The Rubrii of the Republic bore the cognomina Dossenus, Ruga, and Varro, of which Dossenus is known only from coins. Other surnames are found in imperial times. A number of Rubrii had no cognomen. Of these, Gallus, a cockerel, and Nepos, grandson, seem to have represented distinct families, each of whom rose to the consulship during the latter part of the first century.New College Latin & English Dictionary, s. vv. gallus, nepos. ==Members== * Gaius Rubrius C. f., one of the senators named in the Senatus Consultum de Agro Pergameno, an inscription tentatively dated about 123 BC. He might be the same as Gaius Rubrius, tribune of the plebs in 122.Broughton, vol. I, p. 519 (note 5). * Gaius Rubrius, tribune of the plebs in 122 BC, introduced the lex Rubria, establishing a colony at Carthage, as part of the ambitious program of reforms proposed by Gaius Gracchus. He was probably also the author of the lex Rubria Acilia, together with his colleague, Manius Acilius Glabrio.Plutarch, \\"The Life of Gaius Gracchus\\", 10.Broughton, vol. I, pp. 517, 519 (note 5). * Quintus Rubrius Varro, described by Cicero as an enthusiastic prosecutor in the law courts, was one of those proscribed by Sulla in 88 BC, along with Gaius Marius.Cicero, Brutus, 168. * Rubrius, an ally of Verres, whose intelligence led Verres to the house of Philodamus at Lampsacus, where Rubrius' men attempted to seize his host's beautiful daughter, and Rubrius himself scalded Philodamus by pouring boiling water on him. A riot ensued in which Verres barely escaped with his life, but his influence was such that Philodamus and his son were executed for the murder of Verres' lictor.Cicero, In Verrem, ii. 1. 63‚Äì85. * Publius Rubrius, prosecuted Quintus Apronius, a notorious plunderer who flourished under the government of Verres in Sicily.Cicero, In Verrem, ii. 3. 132, 135. * Quintus Rubrius, an eques, and one of the wealthy residents of Sicily, whom Verres sought to influence by bestowing gifts and honours upon him.

The emperor decided that Augustus would have to be the judge of whether he had been wronged, and what penalty to exact.Tacitus, Annales, i. 73. * Rubrius Fabatus, one of the equites suspected of having conspired with Sejanus. After the latter's downfall, when his associates were being imprisoned, Rubrius was apprehended near the Strait of Sicily, where it was thought he might be attempting to flee to Parthia. He escaped punishment due largely to the emperor's forgetfulness.Tacitus, Annales, vi. 14. * Titus Rubrius Nepos, either the colleague of, or an assistant to Aulus Didius Gallus, when the latter was curator aquarum, or superintendent of the aqueducts, from AD 38 to 49..PIR, vol.

Jansen stated that as both she and Lofstad are busy in their respective bands, Northward is a studio side- project and not a proper band, and that it would not perform live. == History  Creation (2007-2008) === At the 2007 ProgPower USA festival, on which Jansen performed with her band After Forever and Lofstad performed with Pagan's Mind, the festival concluded with an \\"All Star Jam\\" featuring members of the bands who had performed at the festival, including Jansen and Lofstad. Back then, Jansen had the idea of taking a year off in 2008 so she could work on writing a heavy metal album, after spending the ten previous years doing progressive metal. Having been impressed by Lofstad at ProgPower, Jansen offered him to be involved in the project together, and the two wrote an entire album worth of music. Jansen and Lofstad put together a line-up in 2008 and recorded the drums for the album, but, as they were about to sign a recording deal, After Forever disbanded (although they would only make it public in February 2009), and as the result, Jansen and Lofstad's recording deal was cancelled. Now in need of a new main band, Jansen decided to put their side-project on hold to focus on a new full-time band, which became ReVamp. === Failed reunion attempts (2008-2016) === The two tried to reunite during the following years, but difficulties on Jansen's part made it impossible: first, she suffered health issues in 2011 and a severe burnout which forced her to stop working and teaching, and to cancel the rest of ReVamp's tour, while also making it impossible to work with Lofstad after the tour; then, after recovering in 2012, she was asked by Nightwish to act as lead vocalist of their tour, before becoming a full member the following year. As the result, Jansen's schedule became very busy, and put Northward on hold once again as she was focusing her side activities on keeping ReVamp active. === Recording years (2016-present) === In 2016, ReVamp disbanded, as all members agreed that it would be better for all of them to focus on their own respective projects rather than waiting for Jansen to have free time from Nightwish. This finally gave Jansen free time to reunite Northward, as Nightwish was going to take a year off in 2017; her pregnancy made recording uncertain once again, but the two managed to finally complete the album before Jansen resumed touring with Nightwish in March 2018. The backup band for the album consists of bassist Morty Black of TNT, drummers Jango Nilsen and Stian Kristoffersen, and keyboardist Ronny Tegner, the latter two also being members of Pagan's Mind. The album is mixed and mastered by Volbeat producer Jacob Hansen. It features a duet between Jansen and her sister Irene on the song \\"Drifting Islands\\". ==Reception== Northward's self-titled debut album earned positive reviews. Devils Gate Media praised the variety in Jansen's singing and Lofstad's guitar work. Blogger Man of Much Metal rated the album 8.5 out of 10, stating that \\"whilst this kind of rock music isn‚Äôt my usual fare, I cannot deny that this is a very striking record with plenty of positives that ensure that I enjoy the experience of listening to it.\\" The album was a listener pick for best album of the year on Chicago Public Radio's Sound Opinions. ==Members== *Floor Jansen ‚Äì vocals *J√∏rn Viggo Lofstad ‚Äì guitars === Guest musicians === *Morty Black ‚Äì bass *Jango Nilsen ‚Äì drums *Stian Kristoffersen ‚Äì drums *Irene Jansen ‚Äì co-lead vocals on \\"Drifting Islands\\" *Ronny Tegner ‚Äì keyboards ==Discography== *Northward (2018) ==Music videos== *\\"While Love Died\\" (2018) *\\"Get What You Give\\" (2018) *\\"Storm in a Glass\\" (2018) ==References * Category:Nuclear Blast artists Category:Heavy metal musical groups Category:Musical groups established in 2007 Category:Musical groups reestablished in 2018 ","title":"Northward (band)"},{"id":"56842435","text":"Akhtar Mohiuddin (1928-2001), born Ghulam Mohiuddin Wani, was a Kashmiri novelist, playwright and short story writer from India, who made significant contribution to the development of modern Kashmiri literature.

As part of the company's formation, BAMTech has been placed under Direct-to-Consumer & International. ==Background== In 1997, Disney and Sony Pictures formed a film distribution joint venture in Southeast Asia which covered five countries. From 1999 to 2000, Bob Iger was president of Walt Disney International and chairman of ABC TV Group. until he was promoted to president and chief operating officer of the Walt Disney Company. Andy Bird became the next president of Walt Disney International in 2004. At the time of Bird's appointment, most countries' units except in Latin America operated independently. He took the Latin America-integrated operation as a guide for other regions. Strategically, Bird wanted their companies to be the Walt Disney Company of India and other countries, not the Walt Disney Company of a certain country, basically tailoring the company to the country with, for example, localization of programming. Diego Lerner, who led Disney Latin America, was thus named President of Disney Europe, Middle East & Africa in 2009. Buena Vista International and Sony Pictures Releasing International formed fourteen distribution joint ventures, including in Mexico, Brazil, Thailand, Singapore and the Philippines. Another Buena Vista-Sony distribution joint venture was set up in Russia in December 2006. The Walt Disney Company's CIS office in Russia opened in 2006. The company's original plan was for to release three films per year. Translation. In 2009, Disney CIS released its first Russian language-film, The Book of Masters which took in 10.8 million on a budget of $8 million. By April 2011, the company announced that director Vladimir Grammatikov was hired by the company as creative producer, while two more Russian films were placed into production: A fairy tale and a youth story. Instead, the country's unit took a seven-year hiatus until they announced the production on The Last Knight in April 2016. On November 26, 2017, the film became the highest-grossing local-language release of all time in Russia, with a gross of 1.68 billion rubles ($28.8 million). In 2014, Walt Disney International appointed Luke Kang to head its Greater China unit. Disney's South East Asia managing director Rob Gilby appointed three managers for Indonesia, Philippines and Thailand, who were Herry Salim, Veronica Espinosa- Cabalinan, and Subha-Orn Rathanamongkolmas (Soupy) respectively, in May 2017. Paul Candland was promoted from president of Walt Disney Japan to president of The Walt Disney Company Asia, consisting of Japan, Korea, Southeast Asia, and Greater China in July 2014. Stanley Cheung was also promoted from managing director to chairman of TWDC Greater China. Both reported to Andy Bird, chairman of Walt Disney International. With the retirement of the Asia unit's head Paul Candland after 19 years in September 2017, Disney split the Asia unit into two: North Asia and South Asia. North Asia consists of Japan, South Korea and Greater China and is headed by Kang, while South Asia combined India and South East Asia. The India unit's head Mahesh Samat would assume leadership of the South Asia unit by October 1, and the South East Asia unit's head Gilby left the company. Later in September, Lerner was transferred to a new position within Walt Disney International, with Rebecca Campbell, the then-president of ABC Daytime and ABC Owned Television Stations, named to replace him as president of Disney EMEA. In February 2017, Sony Pictures withdrew from the Philippines-distribution joint venture, followed by a withdrawing in August 2017 from the remainder of the Southeast Asian distribution joint venture with Disney. In November 2015, Disney UK started Disney's test streaming service, DisneyLife, with Disney films, TV series, books and music tracks, under general manager Paul Brown. The original plan had the service spreading to other countries in Europe, including France, Spain, Italy and Germany in 2016. In October 2017, the Republic of Ireland was the second country where DisneyLife was made available. DisneyLife was launched in China in December 2017 through a partnership between Disney and Alibaba Digital Entertainment, only to have the Chinese government shut it down in August 2018 because of foreign content rules. Instead, in February 2018, Disney and Alibaba reached a new deal that placed Disney content on Alibaba's Youku streaming platform. On May 25, 2018, DisneyLife was expanded to the Philippines, making it the third country where the service was available. In 2019, following the announcement of the UK Disney+ release date, Disney revealed that existing service DisneyLife would be folded into Disney+. In August 2016, The Walt Disney Company acquired a 1/3 stake in BAMTech for $1 billion, with an option to acquire a majority stake in the said company the future. On August 8, 2017, Disney announced that it would increase its ownership in the company to a 75% controlling stake for $1.58 billion. Disney also reiterated its plan to launch an ESPN-branded over-the-top service in early-2018, followed by a Disney-branded direct-to-consumer streaming service in 2019. ==History== Walt Disney Direct-to-Consumer and International (DTCI) were formed as part of The Walt Disney Company‚Äôs March 14, 2018 strategic reorganization in anticipation of integrating 21st Century Fox's assets, with units coming from all of the other segments.

The election was won by the centrist Christian Democracy, as it happened at national level. Six Lombard provinces gave a majority or at least a plurality to the winning party, while the agricultural Province of Pavia and Province of Mantua, and this time the industrial Province of Milan, preferred the Italian Communist Party. ==Background== As the red rising seemed to be stopped in Italy, many center-right electors began to think no more necessary a vote for Christian Democracy which lost many seats to minor parties, especially to the Italian Republican Party of former Prime Minister Giovanni Spadolini. ==Electoral system== The electoral system for the Senate was a strange hybrid which established a form of proportional representation into FPTP-like constituencies. A candidate needed a landslide victory of more than 65% of votes to obtain a direct mandate. All constituencies where this result was not reached entered into an at-large calculation based upon the D'Hondt method to distribute the seats between the parties, and candidates with the best percentages of suffrages inside their party list were elected. ==Results== - - bgcolor=\\"#E9E9E9\\" !rowspan=\\"1\\" align=\\"left\\" valign=\\"top\\"Party !rowspan=\\"1\\" align=\\"center\\" valign=\\"top\\"votes !rowspan=\\"1\\" align=\\"center\\" valign=\\"top\\"votes (%) !rowspan=\\"1\\" align=\\"center\\" valign=\\"top\\"seats !rowspan=\\"1\\" align=\\"center\\" valign=\\"top\\"swing - !align=\\"left\\" valign=\\"top\\"Christian Democracy valign=\\"top\\"1,747,002 valign=\\"top\\"34.4 valign=\\"top\\"17 valign=\\"top\\"4 - !align=\\"left\\" valign=\\"top\\"Italian Communist Party valign=\\"top\\"1,447,823 valign=\\"top\\"28.5 valign=\\"top\\"15 valign=\\"top\\"= - !align=\\"left\\" valign=\\"top\\"Italian Socialist Party valign=\\"top\\"615,644 valign=\\"top\\"12.1 valign=\\"top\\"6 valign=\\"top\\"= - !align=\\"left\\" valign=\\"top\\"Italian Republican Party valign=\\"top\\"349,351 valign=\\"top\\"6.9 valign=\\"top\\"3 valign=\\"top\\"2 - !align=\\"left\\" valign=\\"top\\"Italian Social Movement valign=\\"top\\"255,667 valign=\\"top\\"5.0 valign=\\"top\\"2 valign=\\"top\\"1 - !align=\\"left\\" valign=\\"top\\"Italian Liberal Party valign=\\"top\\"197,084 valign=\\"top\\"3.9 valign=\\"top\\"2 valign=\\"top\\"1 - !align=\\"left\\" valign=\\"top\\"Italian Democratic Socialist Party valign=\\"top\\"192,172 valign=\\"top\\"3.8 valign=\\"top\\"2 valign=\\"top\\"= - !align=\\"left\\" valign=\\"top\\"Radical Party valign=\\"top\\"103,697 valign=\\"top\\"2.0 valign=\\"top\\"1 valign=\\"top\\"= - !align=\\"left\\" valign=\\"top\\"Others valign=\\"top\\"168,885 valign=\\"top\\"3.3 valign=\\"top\\"- valign=\\"top\\"= - bgcolor=\\"#E9E9E9\\" !rowspan=\\"1\\" align=\\"left\\" valign=\\"top\\"Total parties !rowspan=\\"1\\" align=\\"right\\" valign=\\"top\\"5,076,325 !rowspan=\\"1\\" align=\\"right\\" valign=\\"top\\"100.0 !rowspan=\\"1\\" align=\\"right\\" valign=\\"top\\"48 !rowspan=\\"1\\" align=\\"right\\" valign=\\"top\\"= } Sources: Italian Ministry of the Interior ===Constituencies=== - - bgcolor=\\"#E9E9E9\\" !align=\\"left\\" valign=\\"top\\"N¬∞ !align=\\"center\\" valign=\\"top\\"Constituency !align=\\"center\\" valign=\\"top\\"Elected !align=\\"center\\" valign=\\"top\\"Party !align=\\"center\\" valign=\\"top\\"Votes % !align=\\"center\\" valign=\\"top\\"Others - align=\\"left\\"1 align=\\"left\\"Bergamo align=\\"left\\"Angelo Castelli align=\\"left\\"Christian Democracy align=\\"left\\"49.6% align=\\"left\\" - align=\\"left\\"2 align=\\"left\\"Clusone align=\\"left\\"Enzo Berlanda align=\\"left\\"Christian Democracy align=\\"left\\"55.8% align=\\"left\\" - align=\\"left\\"3 align=\\"left\\"Treviglio align=\\"left\\"Vincenzo Bombardieri align=\\"left\\"Christian Democracy align=\\"left\\"49.6% align=\\"left\\" - align=\\"left\\"4 align=\\"left\\"Brescia align=\\"left\\"Pietro Padula Gino Torri align=\\"left\\"Christian Democracy Italian Communist Party align=\\"left\\"37.5% 28.5% align=\\"left\\" - align=\\"left\\"5 align=\\"left\\"Breno align=\\"left\\"Franco Salvi align=\\"left\\"Christian Democracy align=\\"left\\"48.4% align=\\"left\\" - align=\\"left\\"6 align=\\"left\\"Chiari align=\\"left\\"Giovanni Prandini align=\\"left\\"Christian Democracy align=\\"left\\"49.3% align=\\"left\\" - align=\\"left\\"7 align=\\"left\\"Sal√≤ align=\\"left\\"Elio Fontana align=\\"left\\"Christian Democracy align=\\"left\\"42.2% align=\\"left\\"Italo Nicoletto (PCI) 26.2% - align=\\"left\\"8 align=\\"left\\"Como align=\\"left\\"Gianfranco Aliverti Gianfranco Conti Persini align=\\"left\\"Christian Democracy Italian Democratic Socialist Party align=\\"left\\"35.7% 7.5% align=\\"left\\" - align=\\"left\\"9 align=\\"left\\"Lecco align=\\"left\\"Maria Paola Colombo Pietro Fiocchi align=\\"left\\"Christian Democracy Italian Liberal Party align=\\"left\\"41.4% 9.0% align=\\"left\\" - align=\\"left\\"10 align=\\"left\\"Cant√π align=\\"left\\"Vittorino Colombo align=\\"left\\"Christian Democracy align=\\"left\\"41.6% align=\\"left\\" - align=\\"left\\"11 align=\\"left\\"Cremona align=\\"left\\"Renzo Antoniazzi Vincenzo Vernaschi align=\\"left\\"Italian Communist Party Christian Democracy align=\\"left\\"35.9% 34.7% align=\\"left\\" - align=\\"left\\"12 align=\\"left\\"Crema align=\\"left\\"Francesco Rebecchini Unconstitutional result Incumbent MP Paolo Zanini helped his party running for this seat.

The first combat Su-25 unit to be formed was the 200th Independent Attack Squadron (OShAE) based out of Sital-Chai in Soviet Azerbaijan. The first aircraft from the unit arrived in Afghanistan in May 1980 with the full unit deploying in June to Shindand airfield in the western part of the country. The deployment was called Operation Exam and involved a team of engineers and technicians who would oversee the aircraft and evaluate its performance. The first Su-25 combat missions began on 25 July with the 200th OShAE flying counterinsurgency sorties and close air support in support of the 5th Motorized Rifle Division. By 1982, the Su-25's area of responsibility expanded and the aircraft began flying missions sometimes as far as Kabul with pilots flying on average 4‚Äì5, sometimes as many as 8, sorties a day. The aircraft typically flew with external fuel tanks to increase its range but was barred from flying in poor weather conditions or nighttime due to faulty navigational equipment. By the time the squadron left Afghanistan in October 1982, its Su-25s had logged more than 2,000 sorties with no losses, however some had sustained damage due to ground fire. The deployment allowed engineers to make several modifications to the aircraft's weapons systems, replacing them with ones more suited for mountain operations and installing increased countermeasures and defensive systems. Paris International Air and Space Show in 1989. The introduction of the Su-25 in Afghanistan led to a vastly expanded scope of operations by Soviet ground commanders who could now insert their troops deeper into guerrilla territory with better air cover. The Mujahideen grew to fear and respect the Su-25 as the war grew on, adapting their tactics around the assumption of its use. Su-25s were used as development platforms for Soviet precision guided munitions, being some of the first Soviet aircraft to use such munitions in combat, typically against cave entrances or weapons storage sites. In April 1986, the Su-25 used a precision-guided weapon in combat for the first time, firing a Kh-25 and Kh-29 missile against enemy targets. The introduction of precision bombs and missiles allowed the Su-25 to begin flying missions at higher-altitude, reducing the risk posed by anti-aircraft artillery and shoulder launched surface-to-air missiles. Due to the fact Su-25s were often tasked with flying low-altitude, subsonic, close air support missions in support of ground forces in combat, they made frequent targets for Mujahideen anti-aircraft fire and surface-to-air missiles. Some 23 aircraft were shot down over the course of the war, with an additional dozen or so were lost in non-combat related incidents, while another dozen were written off due to extensive damage, and a further nine were destroyed by bombardments on the ground in Kabul and Kandahar. In all, Su-25s represented a quarter of Soviet Air Force (VVS) fixed-wing losses in the campaign. On 16 January 1984, a Su-25 piloted by a Soviet lieutenant colonel was struck by a 9K32 Strela-2 missile and downed near Urgun, Afghanistan, making it the first shootdown of a Su-25 in the war. In August 1988, a Su-25 piloted by Colonel Alexander Rutskoy was hit by anti-aircraft fire and crashed. Rutskoy ejected but landed on Pakistani soil where he was captured and later repatriated to the Soviets. Some sources state he was shot down by Pakistani warplanes. The aircraft's wreckage was reportedly salvaged by Pakistan and handed over to the United States. In October of that year, a Su-25 sustained a powerful hit at high-altitude north of Gardez, heavily damaging it but remaining flyable. The strike was reportedly the result of a missile fired by a Pakistani fighter jet. In January 1989, a missile hit a Su-25 near Kabul killing the pilot in the last combat loss of the aircraft in Afghanistan. === Iran‚ÄìIraq War === The Iraqi Air Force was the first non-Eastern Bloc country to receive the Su-25, with Iraq receiving 69 'K' single-seat variants and four 'UBK' two-seater variants between 1986 and 1987, enough to equip two ground-attack regiments. The Su-25 saw extensive use in the latter stages of the Iran‚ÄìIraq War, its first action outside of Afghanistan, in combat against Iranian forces. One Su-25K purportedly survived a direct hit from an Iranian MIM-23 Hawk surface-to-air missile battery, managing to return to base and land. In total, the Su-25 took part in 900 combat sorties in the conflict and many of their pilots were personally decorated by Saddam Hussein. Two Su-25Ks were lost in combat in the war, of which one was lost to Iranian air defenses. == 1990‚Äì2000  Persian Gulf War === A Su-25 Frogfoot aircraft destroyed during Operation Desert Storm The Iraqi Air Force's Su-25 aircraft played little part in the Persian Gulf War as did most Iraqi aircraft. At least one Su-25 squadron saw action during the August 1990 Invasion of Kuwait. During the war, seven of the IAF's Su-25 aircraft were flown to neighboring Iran to shield them from air strikes.. Jane's Defence Weekly, 13 September 2006. Two Su-25 jets were shot down by U.S. F-15C interceptors on 6 February 1991 using AIM-9 Sidewinder air- to-air missiles. However, most of Iraq's Su-25 fleet was destroyed on the ground in precision strikes on hardened aircraft shelters during the war and they were not used for ground attack against coalition forces. === Angolan Civil War === Angola received its first batch of Su-25 jets from the Soviet Union in 1988. During the Angolan Civil War, the Angolan Air Force used the Su-25 against UNITA forces advancing on Luanda but to little tactical effect as they often flew bombing missions from high altitudes, reducing the aircraft's effectiveness, an issue exacerbated by a withdrawal of Soviet support in 1991 which caused serviceability issues. The Su-25 was also flown by mercenaries from the South African private military company Executive Outcomes based out of Saurimo Airport against UNITA forces beginning in the early 1990s. === War in Abkhazia === During the War in Abkhazia, the Su-25 was used by the Georgian Air Force, the Abkhazian Air Force, and the Russian Air Force in a series of combat actions in the breakaway province. The Georgian Air Force flew as many as 215 combat missions in the Su-25 during the war. Russian Su-25s flying on the side of Abkhazian separatists performed numerous raids on Georgian positions near the besieged port city of Sukhumi, flying out of an airfield in Gudauta. On at least one occasion, a Russian Su-25 bombed a residential district of Sukhumi, killing a civilian and destroying numerous homes and other buildings. During the conflict, the Russian government asserted that Su-25s bombing Georgian positions were not Russian but, in fact, Georgian warplanes with painted Russian insignia, a claim that drew much doubt since many of these Su-25 aircraft were flying uninhibited through Russian airspace. On 6 January 1993, a Georgian Su-25 crashed in Abkhazia province with the pilot ejecting to safety. On 19 March 1993, a Russian Air Force Su-25 piloted by Major Vazlav Shipko was shot down by Georgian air defenses near Sukhumi, however some sources state he was flying a Su-27. On 4 July 1993, a Georgian Su-25 was struck by an Abkhazian surface-to-air missile, forcing the aircraft into the sea off Sukhumi and killing the pilot. === Eritrean‚ÄìEthiopian War === The Ethiopian Air Force operated the Su-25 during the Eritrean‚ÄìEthiopian War, after receiving a delivery of a pair of Su-25Ts and two Su-25UBKs from the Russian Air Force in March 2000. Combat operations were flown from Mek'ele and Debre Zeyit. On 15 May 2000, a Su-25 piloted by Flight Lieutenant Wondu Ghenda was shot down by an Eritrean Air Force MiG-29, killing the pilot.\\"Ethiopia.\\" acig.org. Retrieved: 10 August 2010. === Nagorno-Karabak War === During the Nagorno-Karabakh War, both Armenia and Azerbaijan used Su-25 aircraft inherited from the Soviet Union. However, Armenia's use of its modest five jets during the war was minimal while the Azeri Air Force utilized it heavily in strafing and bombing missions against Armenian targets. At least three Su-25s operated by Azerbaijan were downed during the conflict. One was shot down in 1992 by a missile while conducting a ground attack mission over Armenian territory. In 1994, two were lost in separate incidents. One in February where the aircraft was struck by ground fire causing the pilot to eject and become captured. Another Su-25 was lost the following April with the pilot managing to eject. Human Rights Watch alleges in a 1994 report that Azerbaijan used its Su-25 aircraft in an indiscriminate manner against civilian population centers in Nagorno-Karabakh and Armenia.https://www.hrw.org/sites/default/files/reports/AZER%20Conflict%20in%20N-K%20Dec94.pdf === Chechen War === Su-25s saw heavy use by the Russian Air Force again during the First and Second Chechen War. During the First Chechen War, some 140 Su-25s flew 5,300 strike sorties, notably playing an instrumental role in the destruction and the capture of the heavily defended Grozny Presidential Palace, dropping BETAB-500 anti-concrete bombs on it. However, Russian Su-25s rarely operated at night or in poor weather due to faulty equipment and insufficient training, and aircraft rarely used precision munitions, utilizing unguided bombs and rockets for the most part instead. This lack of precision munitions and poor training led to several friendly fire incidents where Russian aircraft hit buildings occupied by Russian troops. However, Russian air losses during the campaign were low due to a lack of capable air defenses. Four Su-25s were lost in combat. Presidential palace in Grozny in 1995. * On 4 February 1995, a Su-25 piloted by Major Nikolay Bairov crashed three miles southeast of Grozny after being hit by ZSU-23-4 anti-aircraft fire. The pilot was able to eject but was still killed after his parachute failed to fully deploy. Another Su-25 piloted by Lieutenant Colonel Evgeny Derkulsky was damaged but was able to return to base. * On 5 May 1995, a Su-25 piloted by Colonel Vladimir Sarabeyev from the 4th Air Army was hit by 12.7mm DShK fire while flying a low altitude patrol near the village of Serzhen-Yurt. The bullets pierced the unarmored side canopy glass of the cockpit, killing the pilot and causing the plane to crash. Chechen rebels managed to recover maps and charts from the wreckage. * On 4 April 1996, a Su-25 piloted by Major Alexander Matvienko flying a reconnaissance mission near Goiskoye was shot down with a Stinger missile forcing the pilot to eject. The pilot was successfully rescued by helicopter. * On 5 May 1996, a Su-25UB crewed by Colonel Igor Sviryidov and Major Oleg Isayev was shot down by a 9K34 Strela-3 shoulder-launched surface to air missile while flying near Serzhen-Yurt, killing both pilots. During the initial push into Chechnya, Russian Su-25 and Su-24 strike aircraft destroyed the majority of the dilapidated Chechen air fleet on the ground in a matter of hours. In 1995, facilitated by clear weather, air cover provided by Su-25s allowed Russian troops to push across the Argun River and into the towns of Gudermes and Shali, setting the stage for a decisive victory over separatist forces in the region.Russian Airpower in the Second Chechen War pg. 11 Chechen separatist leader Dzhokhar Dudayev was killed on 21 April 1996, after a Su-25 fired two laser-guided missiles at his position, after an A-50 aircraft pinpointed his satellite phone signal and relayed the location to the Su-25. A picture purportedly from the warhead as it approached Dudayev later surfaced in Argumenty i Fakty, a Russian newspaper. In 1999, Russian Su-25s once again saw heavy use in Chechnya with the onset of the Second Chechen War in 1999. During the war, the Su-25 was again primarily a close air support platform, providing support for ground troops at low altitude in conjunction with Mi-24 Hind and Ka-50 helicopters while Su-24s flew higher altitude precision strikes. Su-25s would often fly at altitudes between 16,000 and 20,000 feet before visually acquiring and attacking their targets at lower altitudes, typically utilizing unguided rockets and bombs. For more accurate strikes, Su-25s used Kh-25ML and Kh-29 laser-guided missiles. In a newer tactic not utilized during the First Chechen War, Su-25s engaged in \\"free hunt\\" operations, flying ahead of larger Russian formations in visual search of targets of opportunity. On occasion, these flights would be accompanied by reconnaissance Su-24s to increase the probability of locating mobile targets.Russian Airpower in the Second Chechen War pg. 32‚Äì34 A new all-weather with night capability variant, the Su-25T, was introduced into combat during this conflict with notable successes with six of the aircraft flying a total of 20 sorties throughout the fighting. The 'T' model had improved sighting and was modified to include the new B-13 rocket pod. Six Su-25 aircraft were lost during the Second Chechen War. * On 3 October 1999, a Su-25 flying a reconnaissance mission over the village of Tolstoy-Yurt was hit by a missile and shot down, killing the pilot. * On 9 September 1999, a Su-25 from the 960th Air Assault Regiment was struck in the fuel line by ground fire, possibly by a shoulder-launched surface-to-air missile causing the pilot to eject and crash. * On 13 December 1999, the rocket pod of a Su-25 piloted by Colonel Sergey Borisyuk malfunction resulting in a fire that caused the pilot to eject. Col. Borisyuk was rescued on the ground. * On 22 January 2000, a Su-25 was hit by a MANPAD, resulting in the loss of the left-engine. The pilot was able to land the aircraft safely however the aircraft was written off. * On 14 June 2001, a pair of Su-25s piloted by Lieutenant Colonel Yuriy Yakimenko and Captain Oleg Podsitkov crashed into mountainous terrain, killing both pilots. * On 29 April 2002, a Su-25 piloted by Major Igor Bezryadin crashed after entering an unrecoverable nosedive.https://wikileaks.org/gifiles/attach/178/178771_mdb_2_2010_adv.pdf == 2000‚Äì2010  Macedonian insurgency === Su-25UB that was used by the Macedonian Air Force In June 2001, the government of Macedonia procured four Su-25 aircraft (three single seat, one two-seater) from Ukraine which promptly entered service in the Macedonian Air Force. In the first aerial combat action of the Macedonian military, they were used to combat ethnic Albanian insurgents in Macedonia. Mostly flown from an air force base near Petrovec, these aircraft were piloted by Ukrainian mercenaries as Macedonia did not have any pilots trained in flying the aircraft. They saw heavy use in ground attack missions against insurgents. During the Battle of Radu≈°a in August 2001, the Su-25s supported beleaguered security forces in the town alongside Mi-24 helicopters. === Ivorian Civil War === Four Su-25 aircraft (two one seaters, and two two-seaters) were procured from Belarus by the Ivory Coast in 2004. After the outbreak of the First Ivorian Civil War, the government of Laurent Gbagbo used his air force to bomb rebel forces. On 6 November 2004, a pair of Su-25 aircraft based out of Abidjan and piloted by mixed crews of Ivorians and Belorussians bombed a French encampment near the city of Bouak√©, killing nine French Licorne peacekeepers and an American aid worker, and destroying several vehicles. The attack triggered the French to destroy the Ivorian air force, firing MILAN missiles at the two Su-25s that had attacked the French troops shortly after they landed, damaging them, and seizing the other two and disabling them. === Sudan and Chad === The Sudanese Air Force has obtained fifteen Su-25 aircraft from Belarus since 2008. Despite Sudanese government assurances that the aircraft would not be used in the Darfur conflict, United Nations inspectors discovered four Su-25 bombers at El Fasher Airport in the region and numerous reports have surfaced of the aircraft taking part in indiscriminate targeting of villages. Chad Air Force Sukhoi Su-25 inflight Chad obtained six Su-25 jets from Ukraine to enhance its close air support capability. In May 2009, the Su-25s operated by the Chadian Air Force bombed rebel columns in southeastern Chad, near Ab√©ch√©. === Russo-Georgia War === The Su-25 was once again pressed into service in the skies of Georgia during the Russo-Georgian War in 2008, seeing extensive use by both the Russian and Georgian air forces. At the beginning of the war, Georgia had a fleet of twelve Su-25 aircraft (two of them trainers) at its disposal. The aircraft saw particularly heavy use in fighting around Tskhinvali, the South Ossetian capital. Out of six Russian aircraft lost in the war, three were Su-25s. All were most likely lost to friendly fire. The first Russian air loss of the campaign was a Su-25 piloted by Lieutenant Colonel Oleg Terebunsky of the 368th Attack Aviation Regiment, shot down over the territory of South Ossetia near the Zarsk pass, between Dzhava and Tskhinvali. He was hit by a MANPADS missile fired by South Ossetian militia around 6.00 p.m. on 8 August, in a case of friendly fire. Earlier in the day, a flight of four Georgian Su-25 planes had attacked a Russian army convoy in the same area. This was one of the few missions conducted by Georgia's Su-25s during the brief conflict as Tblisi reasoned that its aircraft would soon become easy targets for Russian interceptors. The aircraft returned to their bases and were hidden under camouflage netting to prevent them from being located. At 10:30 a.m. on 9 August, a Su-25 piloted by Colonel Sergey Kobylash, commander of the 368th Attack Aviation Regiment, was shot down during an attack on a Georgian military formation south of Tskhinvali, on the Gori-Tskhinvali road. After making his initial approach, Kolybash's aircraft was struck by a missile that impacted his left engine, rendering it inoperable. Not long after, as Kobylash was returning to base at an altitude of 1,000 meters, a MANPADS missile struck his right engine, leaving the plane without thrust. Kobylash ejected north of Tskhinvali in a South Ossetian village of the Georgian enclave of in the Great Liakh gorge, where he was recovered by a Russian combat search and rescue team. Shortly after Kobylash was rescued, South Ossetian militants made the claim they had downed a Georgian Su-25 however this possibility was rejected as Georgia's air force had ceased air operations the day before, more than likely making the shootdown of the Su-25 another incident of friendly fire. At 1:00 p.m. on 9 August, another Su-25 from the 368th Attack Aviation Regiment, piloted by Major Vladimir Edamenko, was struck by fire from a Russian ZSU-23-4 Shilka anti-aircraft gun near Dzhava killing the pilot. Two hours later, a Su-25 mistakenly attacked a Russian military convoy near Liakhva, destroying a fuel tanker and injuring several troops. The Russian soldiers returned fire with a MANPADS damaging the Su-25. Russian Su-25s also hit numerous targets deep inside Georgian territory including the Marneuli air base, however none of Georgia's Su-25 aircraft were lost. In Tskhinvali, Russian Su-25s attacked Georgian infantrymen as they rested in the outskirts of the city. The strikes killed 20 Georgian troops and injured countless more, causing the entire battalion to abandon their equipment and flee sparking rumors about the battalion's annihilation which played a hand in the Georgian withdrawal from the city. The Tbilisi Aircraft Manufacturing, a factory that produces Su-25s, was also bombed damaging a runway but otherwise causing no casualties.http://www.cast.ru/files/The_Tanks_of_August_sm_eng.pdf == 2010‚Äìpresent  Syrian Civil War === In September 2015, the U.S. Department of Defense released satellite photos of an airfield in Latakia, a Syrian government-controlled city, showing twelve Su-25 planes on the tarmac. Airstrikes by Russian forces in support of the Assad government began later that same month. The aircraft have been used predominantly to strike opposition vehicles, fighting positions, artillery pieces, and other non- strategic targets in the country. In January 2015, Syrian Air Force MiG-29s and Russian Su-25s took part in a joint-strike mission against militant targets in what was the first time Syrian and Russian warplanes flew a combat mission together. A pair of Sukhoi Su-25s take off at Latakia In 2016, Alexander Galkin, the Russia's Southern Military District commander, said Su-25s had flown more than 1,600 sorties and dropped around 6,000 bombs since the beginning of Russia's intervention in September 2015. In September 2017, the Russian Ministry of Defence released a video showing two Su-25s helping to rescue Russian troops encircled by Tahrir al-Sham militants. Two months later, a pair of Su-25s flying near Mayadin, in eastern Syria, was suddenly intercepted by a U.S. F-22 jet which abruptly entered the flight path of the two Russian warplanes and deployed flares and chaff in an attempt to cause the Su-25s to change their heading. The United States claimed the incident was not a provocation but a response to the Russian jets crossing the Euphrates River deconfliction line and not responding to radio calls. On 3 February 2018, a Russian Su-25 piloted by Major Roman Filipov flying over Idlib Governorate was hit by a surface-to-air missile, downing the aircraft and forcing the pilot to eject. Filipov committed suicide to avoid capture on the ground. === Ukrainian crisis === Su-25UB of the Ukrainian Air Force The Ukrainian Air Force has made use of its fleet of Su-25 warplanes in the War in Donbass, using them for strike missions against pro-Russian separatists, and at times Russian government forces. During the First Battle of Donetsk Airport, Su-25s were witnessed partaking in ground attack missions, at times firing unguided rockets at separatist positions. During fighting at Kramatorsk Airport, Su-25s were used to deliver supplies to besieged Ukrainian troops, flying at a low altitude and parachuting provisions. A rocket and strafing attack on a regional administration building in Luhansk was purportedly carried out by a Ukrainian Su-25 aircraft. During the Battle of Debaltseve in 2015, Russian Air Force Su-25s participated in the route of Ukrainian troops and the subsequent capture of the city. After the shootdown of Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 in 2014, the Russian military cited the appearance of a Ukrainian Su-25 on its radar in the vicinity of the airliner as evidence that the Ukrainian military were the culprits behind the shootdown. Four Ukrainian Su-25 aircraft have been lost in combat during the conflict. On 16 July 2014, a Ukrainian Su-25 was struck by a missile and downed over eastern Ukraine. The pilot was able to eject and survived. The Ukrainian government placed the blame for the shootdown on a Russian Su-27 fighter jet. On 23 July 2014, a pair of Su-25 jets flying near separatist-held Savur-Mohyla were shot down while flying at an altitude of 17,000 feet (5,200 meters). Both pilots were able to eject. The Ukrainian military said the aircraft had been downed by a long-range missile system, possibly fired from Russia. On 29 August 2014, a Su-25 flying near Luhansk was shot down by a surface-to-air missile. The pilot ejected and was recovered by Ukrainian troops. === Iraqi Civil War (2014‚Äì2017) === In late June 2014, twelve Su-25 planes arrived in Iraq aboard cargo planes after being purchased second-hand from Russia, entering combat service shortly later in the war against the Islamic State, despite having few munitions in its stockpile compatible with the type. The delivery was accompanied by technicians in order to train the Iraqis in the plane's operation and maintenance. The purchase was made after several delays complicated Baghdad's purchase of U.S. F-16 fighters. Seven more Su-25s from Iran arrived in Iraq before the end of June as well. These aircraft were formerly Iraqi Air Force jets that had fled to Iran during the 1990‚Äì1991 Gulf War. Experts noted that some of the aircraft has visible signs of wear and corrosion. In 2015, Iraqi pilots received training in Belarus on flying the Su-25. By 2016, Iraq had 21 Su-25s in its possession. Iraqi Air Force Su-25s were used for close air support during the Battle of Ramadi and other battles in western Al Anbar Governorate. On 12 August 2014, a Su-25 piloted by Iraqi Colonel Jalil Al Awadi crashed after takeoff at Muthenna Air Base, severely damaging the plane and killing the pilot. Another Su-25 was withdrawn from service after suffering damage when it was hit by a surface-to-air missile during a mission over Kirkuk. == See also == * List of Ukrainian aircraft losses during the Ukrainian crisis * List of Soviet aircraft losses during the Soviet‚ÄìAfghan War * 2004 French‚ÄìIvorian clashes * Russian military intervention in the Syrian Civil War == References == Category:History of aviation Category:1970s Soviet attack aircraft ","title":"Operational history of the Sukhoi Su-25"},{"id":"56842967","text":"Ajdin Penava (born March 11, 1997) is a Bosnian basketball player for Belfius Mons-Hainaut of the Belgian Pro Basketball League.

It had six stories, 5,000 square feet of space, stores on the ground floor, and commercial lofts in the rest. None of the sides were of equal length; the front facade was long and the other facades measured , , and . Western Union sold it in 1888. The building was the focus of a complex tort in the 1890s over property value loss due to the operation of the Manhattan Elevated Railroad (later IRT Sixth Avenue Line) in front of it. The builder (Western Union) and the defendant (railway) were both controlled by the same group of investors, who were asserted to be in collusion against buyer Augustus D. Shepard to nullify any damages collected. Mutual Life Assurance foreclosed on the building in 1914, and auctioned it to Alliance Realty. It was sold in 1919 to Frazar & Co, which was believed to have had plans to replace it with a new skyscraper. == Second building == The second Trinity Court Building (left) in 2009 The old building was torn down in 1926 to make way for a 24-story, skyscraper. It was completed in 1927. One of the earliest tenants of the new building was a company managing miniature golf courses and a golf school. Not long after its completion, the Irving Trust began started construction on the Irving Trust Company Building at the corner of Wall Street and Broadway, visible from the Trinity Court Building. The builder commissioned a time study of the construction process. Eight images from that study have been preserved at the Canadian Centre for Architecture. == Third building == Trinity Church, which owns the site, had its offices and preschool in the 1927 building. In 2015, the church faced a choice of a $33 million renovation to bring it up to code, or to replace it with a new building at a cost of about $35 million. The vestry decided on the latter and tore the structure down. In its place, it planned to construct a new building with an address of 68-74 Trinity Place. Originally, of primarily luxury condominiums with a modern glass facade was planned. Due to community opposition the plans were changed, with a smaller commercial building incorporating community-friendly uses. The new design also uses bronzed aluminum to better fit in with the church and a preserved footbridge from the previous building, and incorporates stained glass and terra cotta embellishments salvaged form the 1927 edifice. The third building, known as Trinity Commons, topped out in 2018 and will open in 2021. == References  * Category:Buildings and structures demolished in 2015 Category:Demolished buildings and structures in Manhattan Category:Financial District, Manhattan Category:Office buildings completed in 1927 Category:Office buildings completed in 2019 Category:Skyscraper office buildings in Manhattan Category:Western Union ","title":"Trinity Court Building"},{"id":"56843082","text":"Frank Hazelbaker may refer to: * Frank A.

It began in 1988, and most films focus, at least partially, on the character of William Spanner, who is a powerful warlock who fights for good despite having an evil lineage. ==SettingMythology=== The series begins when Grace Churchill discovers her husband and mother-in- law's plan to use her newborn child, William, as a means to bring about the end of the world. The husband and mother-in-law are evil witches, who worship Satan. While Grace prevents this from happening, it is thought that only William and his mother survives the first film. In the second movie, 18 year old William, unaware of his heritage, and having been adopted by the Adams family, finds that his next door neighbor, the witch who survived from the first film, attempts to seduce him to use his powers for darkness. The Adams are white witches who had rejected the evil of the coven from the first film and stole William away. Spanner resist the temptation, and in between the second and third movie, becomes a lawyer, getting a job in the district attorney's office. After being fired from the district attorney's office (a move which later movies reveal was caused by his black magic roots being discovered) he opens his own law office. Spanner resists his heritage, preferring a normal life, but events conspire to force him to use his powers, often with the fate of the world at stake. Spanner later becomes more comfortable with his powers and his role in protecting the world against the dark powers. Beginning in Witchcraft VI, Spanner often serves as an unofficial consultant for the Los Angeles Police Department, usually working with Detective Lutz and/or Garner. While Spanner is the main character of the series, he is not in movies 8 and 10, and is only an infant in the first film. He dies at the end of the seventh movie, and remains dead during the eighth movie, but is resurrected in the ninth movie. He does not appear during the tenth movie, which is set in London, England and follows Lt. Lutz as she assist Interpol with a case, although he is referenced. Keli is Spanner's Girlfriend in many of the movies, and they are engaged sometime between the tenth and the eleventh movie, but she disappears and is not referred to after the 11th movie. The 14th‚Äì16th movies form a connected trilogy. The 16th film takes place in the \\"real\\" world, pokes fun of the film series recasting of the leads and the low budget nature of the series, using the actors from the 14th and 15th movie. The 16th movie explains that the entire series, and its oft recasting of the leads, is part of a careful plot by Satan to control the world. ==Films== * Witchcraft (1988 film) * Witchcraft II: The Temptress (1990, DTV) * Witchcraft III: The Kiss of Death (1991, DTV) * Witchcraft IV: The Virgin Heart (1992, DTV) * Witchcraft V: Dance with the Devil (1993, DTV) * Witchcraft VI: The Devil's Mistress (1994, DTV) * Witchcraft VII: Judgement Hour (1995, DTV) * Witchcraft VIII: Salem's Ghost (1996, DTV) * Witchcraft IX: Bitter Flesh (1997, DTV) * Witchcraft X: Mistress of the Craft (1998, DTV) * Witchcraft XI: Sisters in Blood (2000, DTV) * Witchcraft XII: In the Lair of the Serpent (2002, DTV) * Witchcraft XIII: Blood of the Chosen (2008, DTV) ===Witchcraft Trilogy=== After an eight-year hiatus, the series resumed with three films all filmed and released at the same time. The first two movies of the trilogy have Spanner investigating a cult of witches.

Berkley Boulevard TV Guide states \\"It's hard to fathom why this cheap-looking, uninspired series has run so long. Perhaps video store buyers and their customers figure that any series with this many installments has to have something going for it. But they'd be wrong.\\" In many of the movies in the series the acting is quite poor by reasonable standards, with the actors sometimes even stumbling over their lines. The sex scenes are often unrealistic and extremely - laughably - fake looking (intercourse movements will be taking place in scenes but in numerous shots you can plainly see the male actor wearing underwear and his genitals will over a foot away from those of the female). Video Reviewer 22 Shots found that the first 4 movies has a small amount of low budget, cheesy charm, the rest of the series \\" went more exploitative and sleazy\\" and were only recommended for fans of ultra-low budget films.https://www.22shotsofmoodzandhorror.com/home/i-watched- all-16-witchcraft-films-and-lived-to-tell-the-tale The series claims to be the longest-running horror movie series.

B. Colley, on 7 June 1856. Among official guests were Sir John Morphett. The Pier Hotel opened Christmas Day 1856. It was a three-storey affair, to a design by architect John William Holmes, and built by Henry J. Moseley, who then operated the hotel as proprietor and publican. Only the first floor had a balcony; it is likely that the second floor was for the publican's private use. Its naming was not only premature, as the pier (or \\"jetty\\" in SA parlance) was not opened until 1859, but also prescient, as its placement was a matter for debate until 1857. The first cargo unloaded at the new jetty was 200 tons of coal off the barque Anna for Henry Moseley on 7 November 1865. His son Henry Moseley, jun. was for a time landlord of the \\"Pier\\", but moved on when he declared insolvency despite a great deal of financial assistance from his father.

The second leg of the tour began and ended with two shows at Kawaguchiko Stellar Theater in Fujikawaguchiko, Yamanashi in August 2017. ==First leg== On January 16, 2017, the first leg of the tour, dubbed Dai-sanj≈´san-kai JTB Sekai Isan Gekij≈ç: Kagoshima Sengan-en Sekai Isan T≈çroku Kinen Misia Candle Night (Á¨¨33ÂõûJTB‰∏ñÁïåÈÅ∫Áî£ÂäáÂ†¥‚ÄêÈπøÂÖêÂ≥∂ ‰ªôÂ∑åÂúí‚Äê ‰∏ñÁïåÈÅ∫Áî£ÁôªÈå≤Ë®òÂøµ Misia Candle Night) and consisting of two shows scheduled for March 25-26, 2017 at the Japanese garden Sengan-en, to celebrate it receiving the distinction of World Heritage Site, was announced. On March 2, 2017, Misia issued a statement through her official website and social media saying that she had been hospitalized with acute viral hepatitis and would have to postpone her upcoming guest appearance at the benefit concert The Unforgettable Day 3.11, as well as the two Misia Candle Night dates. A week later, Misia posted on her instagram that she had been discharged from the hospital and was recuperating at home. The Misia Candle Night shows were re-scheduled for May 27-28, 2017. On March 31, 2017, a poll was set up through Misia's official mobile app World of Misia where fans could vote for which songs they would like Misia to cover in concert. The top ten vote-getters, including Stevie Wonder's \\"Don't You Worry 'Bout a Thing\\", which Misia covered earlier in 2017 for the Japanese dub of the movie Sing, Miyuki Nakajima's \\"Ito\\" (Á≥∏) and Koji Tamaki's \\"Melody\\" („É°„É≠„Éá„Ç£„Éº) at the top of the list, were revealed on May 26, 2017.

She was also the chief organizer of the HowDoYouSayYaminAfrican? artist collective and the director of its digital work, Good Stock on the Dimension Floor: An Opera which was accepted for the 2014 Whitney Biennial. ==Early life== Shields was born in Alaska in 1976. Both her parents were teachers and she and two siblings were home-schooled for a time while living outside Anchorage. She graduated from Lewis & Clark College, Portland, Oregon with a degree in Caribbean and Latin American history in 1998. in 2001, she moved to the DUMBO collective in Brooklyn. ==Artistic style== Shields's working process has been influenced by the \\"energy and chaos\\" of the collectives in which she lived for much of her working life. Many of her works are variations on collages of acrylic paint and multiple layers of cut or torn paper, assembled into large abstract pieces. She developed this working style after college in part due to financial restraints. Other works include bead sculptures, mixed media art, and digital imagery. ==2014 Whitney Biennial== The Whitney Biennial of contemporary art is an invitation-only exhibition which generally favors young artists and in the past helped bring greater recognition to artists like Georgia O‚ÄôKeeffe, Jackson Pollock and Jeff Koons. The Biennial has often faced criticism over issues of privilege, access and inclusivity. Shields organized the Yams Collective (short for HowDoYouSayYaminAfrican?) of 38 international mostly black and queer musicians, poets, actors, writers and visual artists to create a digital film about racial identity for the 2014 edition. Shields was encouraged by this diversity, saying: \\"I‚Äôd go to art events, and I‚Äôd be the only black person in the room ‚Äî here in New York. It was ridiculous.\\" One of the Biennial's curators, Michelle Grabner, had visited Shields in her studio and seen a short video loop she had made in Alaska. This became the instigation for the collective's submission, a 53-minute digital piece in 35 parts titled Good Stock on the Dimension Floor: An Opera. Despite the collective's membership, one of the few individual black female artists invited that year was \\"Donelle Woolford\\", a creation of Joe Scanlan. Scanlan, a white, male, Princeton University professor hired a succession of actresses to play \\"Woolford\\" at events. The inclusion of this \\"fake\\" artist led the Yams Collective to withdraw their submission,objecting to \\"Woolford's\\" inclusion in a show alongside their work. Shields explained the withdrawal was due to not only Scanlan but also:\\"...the history of the Whitney and its lack of any kind of initiative in changing its white supremacist attitudes.\\" The collective also considered the inclusion of Scanlan to be a reflection of larger issues of racism in the elite art world. The film instead premiered at the Trinidad and Tobago Film Festival. ==Other notable exhibitionsSolo exhibitions=== *July 11-September 12, 2009, The Other Line, Brooklyn, Superfront Gallery Artist in residence exhibition *January 7-February 6, 2019 Invisible Woman, Chicago, Kruger Gallery ===Joint and group exhibitions=== *November 6-December 20, 2009, Francis Young & Sienna Shields, Berlin, Kuma-Galerie. *November 8, 2012-March 10, 2013, FORE, New York, Studio Museum in Harlem reoccurring group show survey of the work of contemporary young minority artists of importance. ==Personal life== Shields married fellow artist Chuck Close in 2013 and he included her as a subject in his 2017 series Subway Portraits although they had by that time divorced. ==See also== *Whitney Museum of American Art *Artivism *Chuck Close ==References *Official website *Photographic blog *Portraits with artwork *The Yams Collective Category:1976 births Category:Living people Category:21st-century American women artists Category:American photographers Category:Artists from Alaska Category:American contemporary artists Category:African-American contemporary artists Category:American activists Category:Political artists Category:People from Brooklyn Category:Lewis & Clark College alumni ","title":"Sienna Shields"},{"id":"56843342","text":"Mootwingee County.Bengoro located at 31¬∞02‚Ä≤54‚Ä≥S 142¬∞08‚Ä≤20‚Ä≥ is a remote civil parish of Mootwingee County in far North West New South Wales.

He was the Justice of Scotland between 1296 and 1297 after the invasion of Scotland by England in 1296. ==Life== His family originated from the village of Ormesby, in East Norfolk. On 10 April 1292 he was appointed, with Hugh de Cressingham and others as justice in eyre in the counties of Lancashire, Westmoreland, and Cumberland, with special injunctions to hear and determine complaints against the king's bailiffs and ministers. His commission was extended on 28 August to include Northumberland. In 1296 he became a justice in the court of king's bench. Ormesby met King Edward I of England at Berwick on the king's return from his triumphant progress through Scotland. At that meeting Ormesby was appointed Justice of Scotland. Edward I requested that Ormesby exact homage and fealty from the Scottish tenants in chief, which Ormesby carried out with unflinching severity and with no politic respect to persons, driving into exile all those who refused the oaths to Edward I. With the absence of John de Warenne, Earl of Surrey and Hugh de Cressingham in England, Ormesby bore the chief weight of responsibility for Edward's harsh rule over the Scots. When William Wallace's revolt broke out in May 1297, Ormesby was attacked by Wallace at Scone. Ormesby who had been given warning at the last moment, succeeded in escaping, having to leave all his personal property. After the English defeat at the battle of Stirling Bridge on 11 September, Ormesby was appointed on 23 October to raise foot soldiers in Northumberland, Yorkshire, Derbyshire, and Nottinghamshire for the further campaign against the Scots. In March 1298 he was summoned to a council in London and continued duties at the king's bench. In 1305 he was also chief of the justices of trailbaston assigned for the counties of Norfolk and Suffolk. Ormesby continued to act as a judge under King Edward II of England, though it is not known whether he continued at the king's bench. William continued to be summoned with the judges to parliament until his death and served as justice of assize in the eastern counties, especially Norfolk and Suffolk. In April 1311, Ormesby was appointed with three others to act as justices of common pleas in the liberties of the bishopric of Durham. Ormesby died before 12 June 1317, which was the date his executors were ordered to send to the crown the rolls, writs, and other records in his possession as justice itinerant in the eastern counties. He was buried in the Benedictine monastery of St. Benet's, Hulme. ==Marriage and issue== William is known to have married Sybilla, the widow of Roger Loveday. ==CitationsReferences== *Foster, Joseph.

CECL replaces the current Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses (ALLL) accounting standard. The CECL standard focuses on estimation of expected losses over the life of the loans, while the current standard relies on incurred losses. ==Background== The financial crisis of 2007-2008 demonstrated that the Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses (ALLL) accounting standard does not allow for timely adjustment of reserve levels based on reasonable expectation of future conditions. It relies on losses that are incurred but not realized, i.e., when it is known with some certainty that future cash flows will not be collected. During the crisis, negative outlook of the economy was not taken into account for losses calculations. As a result, reserves were not adjusted for future expected losses. The FASB reviewed the standard and replaced it with CECL. CECL requires expected losses to be estimated over the remaining life of the loans, as opposed to incurred losses of the current standard. FASB stated that the new standard will improve ‚Äúfinancial reporting by requiring timelier recording of credit losses on loans and other financial instruments held by financial institutions and other organizations.‚Äù The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) and Federal Reserve predicted that industry allowances would go up by 30% to 50%. ==CECL impact== CECL is expected to have a substantial impact on multiple financial institutions. * Larger allowances will be required for most products. It is argued that this effect alone can change the structure of the products to scale down the impact. * As allowances will increase, pricing of the products will change to reflect higher capital cost. * Losses modeling will change. This will impact both data collection (data need to be more granular) and modeling methodology (backward-looking over a short period of time to forward-looking for the life of the loan). ==CECL criticism== The Bank Policy Institute points out that CECL forces banks to recognize expected future losses immediately, but does not allow them to recognize immediately the higher expected future interest earnings banks receive as compensation for risk. This could result in a decrease in availability of lending to non-prime borrowers, stunting economic recovery following a downturn. Another criticism regarding CECL is that in order to estimate expected credit losses, banks are required to forecast the state of the economy. As noted by the American Bankers Association (ABA), ‚ÄúForecasting is difficult, even for the experts‚Ä¶ forecasting organizations largely missed forecasting the financial crisis and openly admit the difficulty in forecasting turns in the economic cycle.‚Äù Additionally, CECL was implemented primarily to force banks to maintain countercyclical reserves. Per the American Banker, all thorough analyses of the effect of the new rules have shown, to differing degrees, that allowances will continue to be procyclical after CECL comes into force during 2020. ==References== Category:Banking terms ","title":"Current Expected Credit Losses"},{"id":"56843439","text":"A.

It lies to the east of the city centre, mostly between Pages Road and the Avon river estuary. ==History== Aerial image of sewage treatment plant Bromley was named after the town in north-west Kent in England. In 1883, a sewage farm was established next to the Avon estuary. This was later developed when sewage works were built between 1958 and 1962. As of 2018, the area includes oxidation ponds and a wildlife reserve. From 1913, Christchurch City Council looked for additional cemetery space and one of the options under consideration was a reserve that the city owned in Bromley, which at the time was located in Heathcote County. In 1915, the designation of the land was changed, preparatory work happened in 1917, and in July the Bromley Cemetery opened for burials. This was just prior to the 1918 flu pandemic and the new cemetery became the main burial ground for flu victims from the eastern part of the city. The cemetery was extended in size in 1940. Ruru Lawn Cemetery opened in 1941 and is the burial ground for the victims of the 1947 Ballantyne's fire. Memorial Park Cemetery has been in use since 1956 and, like Ruru Lawn Cemetery, is operational. The various parks and cemeteries in Bromley form a buffer between the residential area in the west, and the industrial area and sewage treatment plant in the east. The exception is Maces Road, where the north side is industrial and the south side is residential. Like other suburbs in the east of Christchurch, and in proximity to the Avon River or the Avon Heathcote Estuary, Bromley suffered great damage in the 2011 Christchurch earthquake. None of the land in the suburb was red zoned, though. ==Education== * Bromley School, which opened on 16 February 1880 ==References * A local guide of the people buried in Bromley cemetery Category:Suburbs of Christchurch ","title":"Bromley, New Zealand"},{"id":"56843562","text":"The double-collared crescentchest (Melanopareia bitorquata) is a species of bird in the family Melanopareiidae.

The background to the plate has reflective sheeting which contains a high security seal (watermark). At the lower left of the plate a security serial number is laser engraved into the plate. In the background of the center of the plate is a three-dimensional interwoven sine wave. The plates are made of aluminum and are 150 mm tall by 300 mm wide except for motorcycles which are 110 mm tall by 190 mm wide. The holographic seal is also smaller on the motorcycle plates. ===Region and province codes=== The new series of plates began to be issued in January 2010.

It has one or two grass-like leaves and up to five bright yellow flowers with blackish markings. It has a very limited distribution near Byron Bay. ==Description== Diuris byronensis is a tuberous, perennial herb with one or two leaves long, wide and folded lengthwise. Between two and five bright yellow flowers with blackish markings, wide are borne on a flowering stem tall. The dorsal sepal is more or less erect, long and wide. The lateral sepals are long, wide and turned downwards. The petals are held horizontally, often turned backwards with an elliptic blade long and wide on a brown stalk long. The labellum is long and has three lobes. The centre lobe is egg-shaped, long and wide and the side lobes are long and less than wide. There are two ridge-shaped calli long at the base of the mid-line of the labellum. Flowering occurs in August and September. ==Taxonomy and naming== Diuris byronensis was first formally described in 2003 by David Jones from a specimen collected near Byron Bay and the description was published in The Orchadian. ==Distribution and habitat== The Byron Bay donkey orchid is only known from a small part of the Arakwal National Park where it grows with sedges and grasses in a rare type of heath known as Byron Bay Dwarf Graminoid Clay Heath. ==Conservation== Diuris byronensis is classed as \\"critically endangered\\" in the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species and as \\"endangered\\" under the New South Wales Threatened Species Conservation Act. The main threats to the species are its limited geographic range, loss of habitat and weed invasion. Projects are underway to protect the habitat of this orchid and other threatened species. ==References== byronensis Category:Orchids of New South Wales Category:Endemic orchids of Australia Category:Plants described in 2003 ","title":"Diuris byronensis"},{"id":"56843696","text":"The 1913 Giro d'Italia was the fifth edition of the Giro d'Italia, one of cycling's Grand Tours.

He was a prominent member of the Woodstock Art Colony in the early and mid-20th century whose works have been exhibited throughout the United States and internationally. ==Early life== Bolton was born and raised in Wallingford, Connecticut. He attended the School of Fine Arts at Yale beginning in 1913, where he studied sculpture under Lee Lawrie,Margaret Ruff, \\"Bolton's Lithograph on Display in New York,\\" Catskill Mountain Star, Mar. 5, 1954. who created the sculpture of Atlas at Rockefeller Center in New York City. Because of his frail health, he was unable to complete his studies and graduate; in 1917 he was exempted from the draft due to pulmonary tuberculosis. In 1917 Bolton traveled to Woodstock to visit a friend who lived there and to play a musical gig, and fell in love with the town. Bolton remained in Woodstock for the rest of his life.Woodstock School of Art, description of Clarence Bolton at 2012 exhibition, at www.woodstockschoolofart.org/woodstock-prints. In 1921, he met Mary Louise Cashdollar, from a prominent Woodstock family, and they married in 1922. ==Career== In Woodstock, Bolton became enthralled with the local Catskill Mountains landscape, and so, in his words, ‚Äúsort of forsook‚Äù sculpture in favor of focusing on landscape painting. He quickly began studying landscape painting under John F. Carlson, a prominent landscape painter who in 1911-1918 had headed the summertime Woodstock School of the Art Students League. Bolton later took up lithography, again focusing on landscapes. He was one of the first members of the Woodstock Artists Association. During the Great Depression, Bolton was engaged to paint federal government artwork, most notably working jointly with Charles Rosen in painting the murals at the Beacon, New York, Post Office, which was visited by Eleanor Roosevelt when it was nearing completion.Smith, p. 151. It was during this work for the Works Progress Administration‚Äôs Federal Arts Project that Bolton became interested and studied lithography. Bolton produced woodcut and linoleum-cut prints, many of which appeared in his publication, The Clatter. He also painted signs for Woodstock-area businesses. Bolton‚Äôs artwork was often made into Christmas cards. He also ventured into textile design, and in 1928 won first prize out of some 1,500 entrants in the textile design competition held in New York City by the Art Alliance. Bolton also purchased a press, on which he published in 1930-1931 a magazine entitled The Clatter. The material was a mix of Bolton‚Äôs own articles and opinion pieces on art, the seasons, and local events, as well as short stories, poetry, and humor pieces; it also included writings by others. It was illustrated with his own woodcut and linoleum-cut prints. Bolton was most notable for his lithographs, especially for his high level of technical expertise and technique. His style has been described as being stylistically linked with Precisionism which flourished when Bolton was most active. While most of his subjects were traditional serene landscapes and scenes of local village life, he gave their portrayals a highly original, personal twist that also reflected contemporary American and international trends in painting. This can be seen, for example, in his lithographs Politics, Country Church, In the Woods, Still Waters, Butternut Trees, Solitude, March Winds, and The Birches. Bolton‚Äôs work has been exhibited locally in the Catskills area, in major U.S. art venues and internationally. In addition to numerous local exhibitions and exhibitions at several university art museums, notable exhibition venues of his works have included the Library of Congress, the National Academy of Design, the Art Institute of Chicago, the Corcoran Gallery, the Kennedy Galleries in New York City, the Denver Art Museum, and in London at the coronation of Queen Elizabeth II.See partial list of Bolton's exhibitions at Blue Heron Gallery, Clarence Bolton, at www.blueherongallery.net/clarence-bolton/. Bolton received a number of prizes and honors in addition to the above-mentioned textile design prize, including the Warren H. Manning Purchase Prize of the Southern Society, (1938), and the Purchase Prize of the Oklahoma Art League (1939).\\"Paradox Gallery Offers Bolton and MacReady Art,\\" Post Star, Oct. 11, 1984. ==Personal life== He and his wife Louise collaborated in local Woodstock business ventures. In the early and mid-1920s they owned a soda fountain caf√© called The Nook, which was a hangout for the students at the Art Students League of New York who studied next door, and where artworks were exhibited. Later, after WWII, he assisted Louise in running her antique shop at The Red Barn, tending shop and refinishing early American furniture. Bolton retained his interest in music. He was an accomplished mandolinist, and also frequently played the piano at dances, hotels, and social events. He also played piano as the live musical accompaniment to silent movies in the local movie hall. == References Bibliography== *Smith, Anita. Woodstock: History and Hearsay.

In particular, they argued that - despite the relative monetary weakness of France and Italy - Germany had merely an independent but not a dominant role within the EMS .Fratianni, M., von Hagen, J. (1990). German dominance in the EMS: The Empirical Evidence. Open Economies Review, 1(1), pp. 67-87.Von Hagen, J., Fratianni, M. (1990). German dominance in the EMS: evidence from interest rates. Journal of International Money and Finance, 9(4), pp. 358-375. Another set of studies by J√ºrgen von Hagen (together with Kerstin Bernoth, Ludger Schuknecht and Guido Wolswijk) compares the bond yield spreads between countries within the EMU and Canada,Schuknecht, L., von Hagen, J., Wolswijk, G. (2009). Government risk premiums in the bond market: EMU and Canada. European Journal of Political Economy, 25(3), pp. 371-384. analyses the impact of the financial crisis on these spreads,Von Hagen, J., Schuknecht, L., Wolswijk, G. (2011). Government bond risk premiums in the EU revisited: The impact of the financial crisis. European Journal of Political Economy, 27(1), pp. 36-43. and between EU Member States.Bernoth, K., von Hagen, J., Schuknecht, L. (2012). Sovereign risk premiums in the European government bond market. Journal of International Money and Finance, 31(5), pp. 975-995. They notably find that risk premia increase with fiscal imbalances such as difficulties regarding deficit and debt service payments, making expansionary fiscal policy more expensive. A substantial body of von Hagen's academic work relates to the relationship between countries' fiscal governance, fiscal institutions and fiscal performance.Poterba, J.M., von Hagen, J. (1999).

Within this body of research, von Hagen has highlighted the effectiveness of formal fiscal restraints at the state level in the United StatesVon Hagen, J. (1991). A note on the empirical effectiveness of formal fiscal constraints. Journal of Public Economics, 44(2), pp. 199-210. and the importance of centralized budget processes and commitments to maintain fiscal discipline (with Ian Harden).Von Hagen, J., Harden, I.J. (1995). Budget processes and commitment to fiscal discipline. European Economic Review, 39(3-4), pp. 771-779. Later research has further emphasized the importance of the political setting within which fiscal decisions are taken.Hallerberg, M., von Hagen, J. (1999). Electoral Institutions, Cabinet Negotiations, and Budget Deficits in the European Union. In: Poterba, J.M., von Hagen, J. (eds.). Fiscal Institutions and Fiscal Performance. Chicago: University of Chicago Press, pp. 209-232. Studying the impact of fiscal rules in the European Union, von Hagen (with Guntram Wolff) finds that the Stability and Growth Pact induced EU governments to increase their use of creative accounting to hide fiscal deficits through stock-flow adjustments, especially during recessions,Von Hagen, J., Wolff, G.B. (2006). What do deficits tell us about debt? Empirical evidence on creative accounting with fiscal rules in the EU. Journal of Banking & Finance, 30(12), pp. 3259-3279. but had hardly any impact on the success or failure of attempts at fiscal consolidation among European countries in the 1990s; by contrast, von Hagen, Andrew Hughes Hallett and Rolf Strauch find that the economic conditions within which fiscal consolidations were begun in the EU during the 1990s had a strong impact on their likelihood of success by influencing governments' choices among consolidation strategies.Von Hagen, J., Strauch, R.R. (2001). Fiscal Consolidations: Quality, Economic Conditions, and Success. Public Choice, 109(3-4), pp. 327-346.Von Hagen, J., Hallett, A.J.H., Strauch, R. (2002). Budgetary Consolidation in Europe: Quality, Economic Conditions, and Persistence. Journal of the Japanese and International Economies, 16(4), pp. 512-535. Finally, research by von Hagen with Strauch and Mark Hallerberg finds that the centralisation of budgeting procedures was successful in reducing public debt among EU Member States by adjusting the flexibility of fiscal decision-making to the political alignment of the government (coalition), with e.g. fiscal contracts providing an effective commitment device within \\"ideologically dispersed\\" coalitions.Hallerberg, M., Strauch, R., von Hagen, J. (2007). The design of fiscal rules and forms of governance in European Union countries. European Journal of Political Economy, 23(2), pp. 338-359. === European monetary economics and the macroeconomics of European integration === J√ºrgen von Hagen has also published extensively on the macroeconomics of European integration and the Eurozone. Before the Eurozone's conception, in the mid-1990s, von Hagen (and Manfred Neumann) supported the vision of a \\"Europe of Two Speeds\\", with a monetary union including Germany, France, Benelux, Sweden and Austria that would allow the remaining economies within the EU to converge more quickly with this core union; failing that, he cautioned against the creation of a monetary union before such adjustments would have occurred.Von Hagen, J., Neumann, M.J.M. (1994). Real Exchange Rate within and between Currency Areas: How Far Away is EMU? Review of Economics and Statistics, 76(2), pp. 236-244. Moreover, he already emphasized in the 1990s the risk that excessive budget deficits in the Eurozone may pressure the European Central Bank to violate its fiscal restrictions and bail out excessively indebted governments ex post (by monetizing the government's debt) or ex ante (by keeping interest rates very low), thus in turn priming the Eurozone for high inflation (with Barry Eichengreen).Von Hagen, J., Eichengreen, B. (1996). Federalism, Fiscal Restraints, and European Monetary Union. American Economic Review, 86(2), pp. 134-138. More general contributions by von Hagen to monetary economics include his analysis (with Manfred Neumann) of the effectiveness of inflation targeting throughout the 1990s, wherein they conclude that it was effective in reducing the level and volatility of inflation by improving the credibility of central bank's monetary policiesNeumann, M.J.M., von Hagen, J. (2002). Does inflation targeting matter? Federal Review, 84(4), pp. 127-148. and his study of the determinants of banking crises (with Tai-Kuang Ho), which finds only a negligible role for money base growth on the likelihood of banking crises, whereas real GDP slowdown, low real interest rates, hyperinflation, large fiscal deficits and exchange rate overvaluation tend to be reliable predictors of banking crises.Von Hagen, J., Ho, T.-K. (2007). Money Market Pressure and the Determinants of Banking Crises. Journal of Money, Credit and Banking, 39(5), pp. 1037-1066. == Positions on economic policy == Mirroring his academic work, J√ºrgen von Hagen has repeatedly emphasized the importance of fiscal discipline and small fiscal deficits at the GermanHallerberg, M., von Hagen, J. (November 1st, 2005). The past can teach Germany fiscal lessons. Financial Times. Retrieved March 15th, 2018. and European level. In 1998, he was one of the signatories of the Petersberg Declaration on a Future-Oriented Labour Market Policy in Germany, which called for the deregulation of labour markets and making unemployment benefits conditional on searching a job (among else).Zimmermann, K.F. et al. (1998). Petersberger Erkl√§rung: Anst√∂√üe f√ºr eine zukunftsgerichtete Arbeitsmarktpolitik. Wirtschaftsdienst, 11, pp. 652-653. However, von Hagen was also very critical of the Hartz labour market reform, arguing that its focus on labour market matching was misplaced, and instead supported economic stimulus through reductions in corporate taxes, wealth taxes, and value added taxes.Von Hagen, J. (October 17th, 2002). Le malaise √©conomique de l'Allemagne. Project Syndicate. Retrieved March 15th, 2018. During the Eurozone crisis, von Hagen supported sovereign debt restructuring procedures for overly indebted countries over the introduction of Eurobonds, an expansion of the European Financial Stability Mechanism, or structural adjustment programmes.Von Hagen, J.

The season was produced by ABC Studios, with series creator Joshua Safran, Mark Gordon, Robert Sertner, Nicholas Pepper and Jorge Zamacona serving as executive producers. The third and final season consisted of thirteen episodes, down from the twenty-two episode count of the two previous seasons. The season aired on Thursdays in the United States at 10:00 pm. The show was cancelled on May 11, 2018, by ABC. On May 14, Deadline reported that the network would finish airing the remainder of the third season on Friday nights. ==Overview== Three years after the events of the Constitutional Convention, former CIA analyst, Alex Parrish had to escape outside the United States in order to avoid arrest from law enforcement authorities. After living anonymously in Italy, she is forced to return to America after Ryan shared information to her about Shelby's kidnapping by a notorious international arms dealer known as The Widow. In order to save Shelby, Ryan and Alex recruit Owen and Harry to help them with their mission. Owen invites Jocelyn Turner to the team as the former FBI agent has intelligence about the arms dealer, due in part to their past encounter. Owing to the extreme circumstances of the covert operation, the team must retrieve Shelby at all costs, before time runs out. ==EpisodesCast Main === * Priyanka Chopra as Alex Parrish * Jake McLaughlin as Ryan Booth * Johanna Braddy as Shelby Wyatt * Russell Tovey as Harry Doyle * Blair Underwood as Owen Hall * Marlee Matlin as Jocelyn Turner * Alan Powell as Mike McQuigg === Recurring === * Amber Skye Noyes as Celine Fox * Vandit Bhatt as Jagdeep Patel * Donald Paul as Leon Riggs * Jayne Houdyshell as The Widow * Nathan Darrow as Felix Pillay * Jamie Jackson as Gavin Pillay * Brayson Peter Isaya as Bray Bill Broonzy * Timothy V.

As part of the renewal process, Safran stepped down as showrunner of the show but remained as a consultant. The following month, it was announced that Michael Seitzman would be Quantico showrunner and Safran would be credited as an executive producer. The third season premiered on April 26, 2018. === Casting === After the third season renewal announcement, it was reported that Yasmine Al Massri and Pearl Thusi would leave the series, and in June 2017, it was reported that Ellis and Tovey would not return as part of a creative overhaul. However, in August 2017, it was confirmed that Tovey would in fact be returning as a series regular. In late July 2017, Marlee Matlin joined the show as a series regular in the third season. She will play the role of ex-FBI agent, Jocelyn Turner. On November 21, 2017, it was announced that Alan Powell will join the show as a series regular in the third season.

On February 16, 2018, it was confirmed that Aunjanue Ellis has exited the series. === Filming === Certain scenes of the third-season premiere were shot on location in Italy. Filming for the third season started on October 10, 2017. In March 2018, it was confirmed by showrunner Michael Seitzman that the last few episodes of the third season would be shot on location in Ireland. Filming for the third season ended on April 21, 2018. ==ReceptionCritical response=== The third season received mixed feedback from critics, who were divided over its direction in comparison to its predecessors. The season premiere was poorly received. Despite praising the episode's action and pacing and its introduction of Marlee Matlin's character, Dishya Sharma of the International Business Times wrote that \\"it leaves you asking for more\\". The Quint's Dipti Kharude said that \\"the briskness of the episode suffocates it\\". Mark Perigard of the Boston Herald was critical of the season's new format and storylines, writing that it \\"doubles down on the dumb\\". During a review of the series finale, TV Fanatic's Allison Nichols praised how the season \\"show[ed] the team putting the pieces together\\", but cited the relationship between Ryan and Shelby as unbelievable and \\"one of the more controversial parts\\". ===Hindu terrorist plot=== The fifth episode of the season, titled \\"The Blood of Romeo\\", was criticized by some Indian social media users for its alleged anti-Indian sentiment. In the episode, Alex Parrish (Priyanka Chopra) uncovers a plot by Indian Hindu nationalists to commit a terrorist false flag attack with nuclear weapons in Manhattan, and have it blamed on Pakistan. Users had described the plotline as \\"ridiculous\\" and \\"unrealistic\\" and felt that it had damaged the image of Indians abroad. In addition, they denounced Chopra's participation in the episode as her international profile had made her a \\"quasi-ambassador for India in the West\\". Chopra apologised for any hurt caused by the episode and stated that she was a \\"proud Indian\\". ABC also apologised and defended Chopra from what they felt was unfairly aimed criticism commenting that she did not have a role in writing, directing or creating the show. Indian-born British chef Atul Kochhar's contract at the Rang Mahal restaurant in Dubai was terminated by JW Marriott Marquis Dubai after he made comments criticising Chopra's involvement in the episode, which included allegations that Hindus had been terrorized by Islam for thousands of years. Bangladeshi-American writer Sharbari Zohra Ahmed who had previously worked on Quantico but was not involved in the writing of the episode was also targeted on social media. These attacks included threats of violence, including rape. ===Ratings=ReferencesGeneral=== * * == External links == * * * Category:2018 American television seasons Category:Quantico (TV series) Category:Anti-Indian sentiment ","title":"Quantico (season 3)"},{"id":"56843846","text":"Prasat Ta Krabey or Prasat Ta Krabei, in Khmer () and also known as Prasat Ta Khwai, in Thai (), is a disputed Khmer temple which was built during Angkor period, the golden age of Cambodian history.

Brown and Fannie D. Brown (n√©e Parker). He grew up in Salt Lake City, Utah. == Education == Brown studied Mandarin Chinese as an officer in the United States Navy during World War II. After working in U.S. Naval Intelligence in Washington D.C., where he translated Chinese telegrams, he returned to the University of Utah to study on the G.I. Bill. In order to extend his studies, he transferred to the University of California. There he began studying Thai under linguist Mary Haas, who had been teaching the language on the Berkeley campus in the Army Specialized Training Program. He earned a Bachelor of Arts degree with Honors in Oriental Languages, followed by a Master of Arts degree. He began a Ph.D. in linguistics on a scholarship at the University of California, but moved to Cornell University after J Milton Cowan asked him to teach a planned course in Thai there when William J. Gedney became unavailable. At Cornell he taught Thai and continued his doctoral studies with the Cornell Southeast Asia Program. In 1953 Brown left for Bangkok to continue his research on Thai linguistics and study of the Thai language and remained in Thailand for four years, funded by grants from the Ford Foundation. Returning to Cornell in 1957, he continued his dissertation work there and taught Thai and Burmese. The next year he obtained a Fulbright Fellowship and returned to Thailand to teach linguistics and English in order to train Thai teachers of English, followed by research for his dissertation. Brown had been working on an analysis of Thai grammar, but with time running out he changed to a historical study involving reconstructing ancient Thai from modern dialects. With students from every province of Thailand attending the teacher training college where he had taught, Brown wrote that he was able to obtain the pronunciations of over 1000 words in each of 70 dialects without difficulty. He returned to Cornell in 1960 to teach Thai and Burmese as a teaching fellow and use the data he had collected to reconstruct the phonology of ancient Thai. Brown refused the offer of an assistant professor position at Cornell, having decided to return to Thailand instead. Brown completed his dissertation and received his doctorate from Cornell around January 1962. It was published in 1965 as From Ancient Thai to Modern Dialects by Social Science Association of Thailand Press and has been republished in subsequent years with other writings by Brown about historical Thai linguistics and his theories about phonology. == AUA Language Center == AUA Language Center Brown returned to Bangkok in March 1962 and was hired as staff linguist at American University Alumni Language Center (AUA) by Gordon F. Schmader, whom he had worked alongside at Cornell writing books to teach English to Thais and Burmese respectively. These texts were based on the \\"General Form\\", which AUA had been using to teach English since it had opened in 1952. As staff linguist at AUA, Brown oversaw the teaching of English to Thais and Thai to foreigners. His work included developing English teaching materials and techniques and training new English teachers. He prepared textbooks to teach Thai to foreigners, producing a popular three-volume course on the spoken language, intended for classroom use with a native speaker of Thai, and books on reading and writing Thai. Brown left AUA in 1980 to study physics at the University of Utah. He returned to AUA in 1984 and began the teaching of Thai using his version of the natural approach, which he would develop into Automatic Language Growth. == Automatic Language Growth == Brown is notable for originating the Automatic Language Growth (ALG) approach to language teaching, which claims that adults can effortlessly become near-native or native-like in second languages if they learn them implicitly through experience, without consciously practicing speaking. Brown came to believe that, contrary to the critical period hypothesis that adults have lost the ability to learn languages as children do, adults actually retain this ability but obstruct it by using abilities they have gained to consciously study, practice, and analyze language. \\"[Brown's] goal had always been to find a way for an adult to become native in their second language,\\" says David Long, the coordinator of the AUA Thai Program. Beginning with his study of Thai under Mary Haas using the Army Method, also known as the audiolingual method, Brown sought to prove the effectiveness of study and practice to this end. However, he described being confounded by observations over his years in Thailand of people who had studied Thai for fewer hours than him achieving fluency in less time, while others who had studied more than him taking longer to become fluent. At AUA, Brown devised elaborate drills for Thai learners with the goal of having them speak correct English without thinking, but found that these had no effect on real language use. During the 1970s, Brown was influenced by thinkers such as William T. Powers, taking from his Perceptual Control Theory \\"that language learning must consist of looking and listening, not practicing,\\" and Timothy Gallwey, from whose Inner Game writings he \\"saw that thinking just got in the way of performance.\\" Nevertheless, he persisted with trying to achieve fluency in language through conscious practice. While studying physics at the University of Utah, Brown studied Japanese with drills and practice of speeches, but found that \\"[n]ot a single sentence was ever triggered by a thought.\\" He described hitting \\"rock bottom\\" after teaching a Japanese class to use the same method he had used and learning from the students' reviews that \\"they all hated [him] and [his] practice.\\" Brown experienced a \\"sudden conversion\\" upon reading a copy of The Natural Approach by Stephen Krashen and Tracy Terrell that his colleague Adrian S. Palmer gave him the next day. \\"In 1983, I first came across Krashen's idea that we acquire languages by understanding messages, and in no other way,\\" recalled Brown. \\"The thing that caught my attention was 'and in no other way.' I was pretty well sold on understanding happenings, but now I could consider ruling out everything else. No memorizing, no practicing, no speaking!\\" In 1984, Brown began teaching language using a comprehension approach of listening to comprehensible input, starting with the following semester's Japanese class, then a natural approach Thai class. He returned to Bangkok to give a demonstration term of natural approach Thai to students and observers funded by the United States Information Agency, and was hired by AUA to give natural approach classes along with the regular structural approach classes. From the start, Brown's version of the natural approach at AUA differed from that of Krashen and Terrell in significant ways. There was no speaking practice on the part of students, in accordance with Krashen's input hypothesis that \\"speaking ability emerges on its own after enough competence has been developed by listening and understanding\\". \\"We're trying to find out what will happen if we hold strictly to this part of Krashen's theory,\\" Brown and Palmer wrote in 1988 in The Listening Approach, naming the book after what they called the approach at that time. Therefore, Brown extended to hundreds of hours the silent period where students were not to speak until they could produce language spontaneously, without conscious effort. Brown's approach also had two teachers speaking to one another in front of the class, which allowed students to observe interaction in the target language without speaking it themselves. \\"[S]tudents watched two or three Thais act out easy-to-understand scenarios describing Thai customs.\\" wrote author Cleo Odzer of the natural approach Thai classes at AUA in the late 1980s. According to Brown, students who adhered to the long silent period by first listening to Thai for hundreds of hours without trying to speak were able to surpass the level of fluency he had achieved after several decades in Thailand within just a few years, without study or practice, while other students who tried to speak from the beginning found themselves \\"struggling with broken Thai like all long-time foreigners.\\" In Brown's view, trying to speak the language before developing a clear mental image through listening had permanently damaged their ability to produce the language like a native speaker. Brown also reported that students who refrained from speaking but still asked questions about the language, took notes, or looked up words all failed to surpass his level of ability, and some of those who refrained from speaking and all these things still failed to surpass him. In order to experience his version of the natural approach for himself, Brown attempted to learn the Shantou dialect of Chinese by setting up classes with the same format of the AUA natural approach Thai classes. He found that as a linguist he was unable to stop himself from analyzing the language he was hearing, and said this interfered with developing the ability to use the language like a native speaker. From his experience and observations Brown concluded that, contrary to the critical period hypothesis for second language acquisition, where adults have lost the ability that children have to learn languages to a native-like level without apparent effort, adults actually obstruct this ability when learning a new language through using abilities they have gained to consciously practice and think about language. == Later life == Brown retired from AUA in 1995 and returned to the United States. He died on August 29, 2002 at the age of 77. Brown wrote an autobiography, From the Outside In, detailing his life as a linguist and the development of ALG. This was published posthumously on the Education Resources Information Center (ERIC), an online library sponsored by the Institute of Education Sciences of the United States Department of Education. A longer version was subsequently published on the ALG World website with chapters on Brown's theories about physics, the brain, and other topics. == Languages == \\"I‚Äôve been trying to learn languages and teach them all my life,\\" Brown wrote in the preface of his autobiography. \\"I spent the war trying to learn [Mandarin] Chinese, and I spent the next 50 years trying to learn 20 more languages and trying to teach two.\\" Brown studied Latin in high school and French, Spanish, and Italian in the late 1940s at the University of Utah. He both studied and taught Thai and Burmese at Cornell. He had also studied German and Indonesian. When he taught Thai and English at AUA using his structural approach, he studied Vietnamese to remind him how it felt for students who were beginners at Thai. Returning to the University of Utah in the early 1980s, he studied Japanese and again studied Mandarin. In the 1990s he attempted to learn the Shantou dialect of Chinese by setting up classes that were like his AUA natural approach Thai classes. According to Brown, while his ability in Thai was reputed as \\"legendary\\" and he could be mistaken for a native speaker over the phone, unlike his native English, he had to consciously monitor his production to speak Thai correctly. \\"When I speak Thai, I think in Thai,\\" he wrote. \\"When I speak English, I think only in thought‚ÄîI pay no attention to English.\\" Brown claimed that, in contrast, the ALG approach of implicit learning without study or practice can produce adults who fluently speak a second language like a native speaker without conscious attention to language. == Works == * Brown, J.

Hwang deferred his attendance at Harvard Business School to start the company while Yao took a leave of absence from Emory University. At the time, FiscalNote began its service as a state legislative tracking service. Hwang, Yao, and Chen, bootstrapped the business with several thousand dollars and incorporated FiscalNote in June 2013. FiscalNote soon moved the company to Washington, DC and raised several rounds of venture capital. The firm has grown to become one of the largest software employers in the District of Columbia.

They have all been involved in the world of superheroes and suffered because of it, facing various forms of sexism from heroes and villains alike. Their afterlife, Deadtown, is a mix between a pleasant bohemian neighborhood and a forbidding necropolis. It is populated by a race of friendly, cultured gargoyles who do their best to take care of the ghosts. People frequently leave Deadtown (either willingly or unwillingly) due to the unreliable nature of comic book deaths. They enjoy extinct food and forgotten culture, sharing their stories in order to pass the time. Everyone in Deadtown is forced to wear the clothes they were buried in, even if those clothes say nothing about their real natures. Each woman is a parody of a famous character from the mainstream Marvel or DC universe, retelling their famous storylines from a new, feminist perspective. Their group is known as the Hell Hath Club, with Paige Embry (an alternate version of Gwen Stacy) serving as the primary keeper of their stories and the group's unofficial leader. She also provides connecting narration for each of the stories. The novella examines the double standards of superheroics, along with the \\"Women in Refrigerators\\" practice of killing or torturing female characters in order to assist male character development. The characters consider themselves \\"released\\" from the dark and painful world of superhero storylines, ending the book with a punk rock celebration. https://www.barnesandnoble.com/blog/sci-fi-fantasy/guide-comic-book-wives- girlfriends-inspired-refrigerator-monologues/ ==Reception== Publishers Weekly called it \\"dazzling\\", \\"brilliantly furious\\", and \\"a rage-filled pleasure\\", and noted that \\"no comic book expertise is required\\" ‚Äî although the Portland Press-Herald felt that it \\"depends a great deal on an insider‚Äôs knowledge of comic book lore for maximum enjoyment\\".Well-placed outrage makes ‚ÄòThe Refrigerator Monologues‚Äô an entertaining read, by Michael Berry, in the Portland Press-Herald; published June 4, 2017; retrieved March 15, 2018 Den of Geek described it as \\"cathartically angry\\", and commended the \\"vivid, specific voice\\" of each character.The Refrigerator Monologues Review, by Kayti Burt, at Den of Geek; published July 6, 2017; retrieved March 15, 2018 Vox stated that it was \\"bitingly sarcastic and wistfully regretful, and always ferociously angry\\".In The Refrigerator Monologues, Catherynne M.

During World War II, he was a kapo in the Auschwitz concentration camp. After the war, he wrote memoirs about his experiences. == Biography== Eliezer Gruenbaum was born in Warsaw in 1908, the second son of a prominent Polish-Jewish politician Yitzhak Gruenbaum. With his father's help, Eliezer arrived in Mandatory Palestine in 1946, where he started writing memoirs. He was however subject to \\"attacks by right-wing and religious groups eager, among other things, to discredit his father.\\" Due to his past, the Haganah refused to draft him, however following a plea from his father to David Ben-Gurion he was enlisted. He was killed in 1948 Arab‚ÄìIsraeli War during the Battle of Ramat Rachel on 22 May 1948. After his death rumors spread that he committed suicide or might have been murdered in revenge for his kapo past.History Lesson  The Tragic Story of Eliezer Gruenbaum (Hebrew, Tom Segev, 28 August 2009 (updated 2011), Ha'aretz ==Political activism== At age of 16, he joined the Communist Party of Poland, and in 1929 was imprisoned by Polish authorities for four and half years for his communism-related activism (the Communist Party was at that time delegalized in Poland). He escaped or was released early from prison (after serving two or two and a half years, sources vary) and then moved to Paris, where he was an editor of a Polish worker's newsletter. He fought in the Spanish Civil War on the Republican side, and after returning to France, was once again arrested, this time by the French authorities, on charges of sedition (here, the accounts vary again, according to another source, he was arrested in Spain, but escaped safely back to France). After the German invasion of France, he volunteered for the French Army, eventually joining the Polish Army in France, and later joined the French Resistance. ==Deportation to Auschwitz == In 1942 he was arrested (as a communist, not as a Jew) and sent to Auschwitz concentration camp. In Auschwitz, he became a kapo, a title given to prisoners supervising forced labor or carrying out administrative tasks. He survived the camp, and after the war he was accused of collaboration with Nazi Germany, and of \\"mercilessly beating inmates\\". He was also accused of murdering \\"tens of thousands of Jewish prisoners\\". He defended himself claiming that he only accepted the position at the request of other Jews, who wanted one of their own in the position, which was otherwise often filled by anti-Semitic non- Jewish people, including German criminals. Research based on analysis of his memoirs, however, concluded that he became a kapo due to \\"intervention by communists\\". At the end of 1943 Gruenbaum was moved from the concentration camps to work in coal mines in Jawiszowice, and finally ended in the Buchenwald concentration camp. After the war, in 1945, he was tried by a communist tribunal on charges of participating in violent beatings, but was shortly acquitted. He resumed his political activities, advocating for the communist takeover of Poland, but he was soon arrested again, in France, accused by fellow Jews of having been the ‚Äúhead of the Birkenau death camp.‚Äù In a trial that lasted eight months, he was acquitted again, because the French court concluded that \\"neither the accused nor the victims were French\\". As noted by Galia Glasner-Heled and Dan Bar-On, \\"Eliezer Gruenbaum was never formally convicted, but nor was he actually acquitted of these accusations\\". He was not welcomed in France, nor in Poland, where the communist party expelled him from its ranks. == Published works == His memoirs has been called \\"an extraordinary piece of testimony\\", since it is the only document of its type written by a concentration camp kapo. They were partially published in 1952 in the Scrolls of Fire album, and their inclusion in this memorial book is attributed to his father's political pressure (at that time he was Israel's Minister of the Interior). The excerpt published in the Scrolls... album is titled 'In the Courtyards of Death'. ==ReferencesFurther reading== * * mirror at academia.edu Category:Writers from Warsaw Category:Polish communists Category:Polish Jews Category:Auschwitz concentration camp survivors Category:Buchenwald concentration camp survivors Category:Polish memoirists Category:Polish emigrants to Mandatory Palestine Category:Jewish collaborators with Nazi Germany Category:Polish soldiers Category:French Resistance members Category:International Brigades personnel Category:Kapos (concentration camp) Category:Israeli memoirists ","title":"Eliezer Gruenbaum"},{"id":"56844108","text":"The 2018 Canadian U18 Curling Championships was held from April 9 to 14 at the W.C.

Incumbent Republican Mayor Richard Crotty was unable to seek re-election due to term limits, and four candidates ran to replace him. A nonpartisan primary election was held on August 24, 2010, but because no candidate won a majority of the vote, former County Commissioner Teresa Jacobs, a Republican, advanced to a runoff election against fellow County Commissioner Bill Segal, a Democrat. Following a contentious general election, Jacobs was elected Mayor over Segal in a landslide, winning her first term 68-32. ==Primary electionCandidates=== * Matthew Falconer, businessman * Teresa Jacobs, former County Commissioner * Bill Segal, County Commissioner * Linda Stewart, County Commissioner Dropped out * Mildred Fern√°ndez, County Commissioner ===Campaign=== The race to succeed term-limited Mayor Richard Crotty, a Republican, initially included incumbent County Commissioners Mildred Fern√°ndez, Bill Segal, and Linda Stewart, former County Commissioner Teresa Jacobs, and businessman Matthew Falconer. Though officially nonpartisan, Segal and Stewart were Democrats, while Falconer, Fern√°ndez, and Jacobs were Republicans. Segal started off as the frontrunner, raising vastly more money than his opponents combined, benefiting from independent expenditures from a business-affiliated campaign group, and winning support from much of the county's political establishment. He emphasized his business experience and campaigned on a plan to create jobs by providing employment incentives to businesses. Segal was criticized by his opponents, however, for his pro- development policies. He also came under scrutiny for attending private, men- only meetings with lobbyists and developers, and for voting for county projects that benefited his business partner financially. Segal, however, compared the meetings to other routine events that he regularly attended, and said that he \\"never made a dime\\" on his votes. Though Stewart raised little money, she launched an \\"aggressive\\" and \\"progressive campaign,\\" focusing on her support for environmental causes, improving public transportation, LGBT rights, and ethics reform. She campaigned on her strong support for SunRail and other transportation projects, which she would've funded through a rental car surcharge and a half-cent sales tax increase, though she called for rolling back a 25-cent toll increase. Stewart was criticized for supporting tax increases and her inability to run the county, with Segal arguing that she didn't have the \\"savvy,\\" \\"worldliness,\\" or the \\"management ability\\" to lead the county. Falconer, meanwhile, positioned himself as the Tea Party candidate, and campaigned on his support for slashing the size of county government and his opposition to infrastructure projects like SunRail. Fern√°ndez campaigned on a fiscally conservative platform, arguing for tax cuts, a reduction in the size of government, and strong ethics reform. However, on April 27, 2010, following an undercover sting she was arrested on charges of \\"bribery, grand theft, and accepting illegal campaign contributions.\\" Segal's campaign manager, Eric Foglesong, had spoken with State Attorney Lawson Lamar's office about Fern√°ndez, and was listed as a \\"confidential source\\" in court records. Fern√°ndez claimed that \\"special interests\\" had conspired to launch a \\"brutal character assassination\\" against her, and her lawyer accused Segal of coordinating the arrest. Fern√°ndez dropped out of the race and was suspended as County Commissioner by then- Governor Charlie Crist, and she would later resign on November 15, 2011, as part of a plea deal. Finally, Jacobs focused on ending the \\"good ol' boy network\\" that she said had long run Orange County and scared off businesses looking to relocate to the region. She emphasized her support for ethics reform and said that she would build the Wekiva Parkway by \\"renegotiat[ing] bond deals, reprioritiz[ing] current road projects, and look[ing] for private partners to complete the project.\\" Though it did not make an endorsement in the race, the Florida Democratic Party campaigned against Jacobs, attacking her for being a \\"lobbyist\\" and for \\"spen[ding] her career working against us for special interests\\" and linked her to former President George W. Bush and former Alaska Governor Sarah Palin. Jacobs argued that the Party repeated Segal's \\"false accusations,\\" and that she had \\"never been a lobbyist.\\" The Orlando Sentinel endorsed Jacobs, praising her as \\"[c]reative and courageous, with a budget director's mind and an environmentalist's heart.\\" The Sentinel criticized Segal for his disregard for unbridled development and lack of transparency, and noted that if he won, Falconer would be a \\"detriment to the county and the region\\" and would make Orange County \\"a bleak place.\\" Though it praised Stewart's positions, the Sentinel argued that \\"Jacobs would champion them more forcefully,\\" and that Stewart was \\"more advocate than administrator.\\" ===Endorsements=Results=General electionCampaign=== Despite Bill Segal's frontrunner status and expectations that he would finish first in the primary, he finished a distant second, only narrowly edging out Linda Stewart. As Jacobs and Segal advanced to the general election, the rhetoric between both campaigns became heated. Segal attacked Jacobs on ethics, for not supporting gay rights, and for making it \\"more difficult for minority-owned businesses to get access to county contracts.\\" Jacobs countered that she supported an effort to expand the county's human rights ordinance, and that Segal \\"fought and ignored\\" financial disclosure and conflict-of-interest rules as County Commissioner. On racial issues, Jacobs argued that Segal misrepresented her record and pointed to her work improving quality of life in Tildenville, a small African-American community. And despite Segal's earlier fundraising advantage over Jacobs, as the general election approached, Jacobs took a fundraising lead over Segal, and released polls showing that she maintained a sizable edge over him. Meanwhile, Stewart refused to endorse Segal, a fellow Democrat, over Jacobs, a Republican, criticizing their \\"stark differences on the environment and growth policies.\\" Stewart attacked Segal's environmental record, his pushes to \\"put urban development into rural settlements,\\" and his \\"extremely poor judgment in attending lavish 'men-only' cocktail parties funded by lobbyists.\\" However, she declined to endorse Jacobs, either, noting that she had \\"areas of disagreement\\" with her. ===Results=References== Category:2010 Florida elections Orange County, Florida Category:Orange County, Florida ","title":"2010 Orange County, Florida mayoral election"},{"id":"56844334","text":"Operation Byrd was a security operation conducted during the Vietnam War by the U.S. 2nd Battalion, 7th Cavalry Regiment and the Army of the Republic of Vietnam (ARVN) 44th Regiment in B√¨nh Thu·∫≠n Province, South Vietnam from August 1966 to 1 December 1967. ==Background== The southern provinces of II Corps, namely Ninh Thu·∫≠n, B√¨nh Thu·∫≠n, Tuyen Duc, and L√¢m ƒê·ªìng Provinces and B√¨nh Tuy Province in northern III Corps formed the Viet Cong (VC) Military Region 6 controlled by General Nguy·ªÖn Minh Ch√¢u. Ch√¢u controlled 4 VC Battalions and approximately 6 district companies. The area had seen little combat due to its small population and low rainfall and limited rice production. ==Operation== On 25 August 1966 the 2nd Battalion, 7th Cavalry, equipped with 38 UH-1 helicopters, plus a battery each of 105-mm. and 155-mm. howitzers was deployed to Firebase Betty south of Phan Thi·∫øt the capital of B√¨nh Thu·∫≠n Province for a search and destroy operation that was expected to last 2 months. At the conclusion of this phase the VC had lost over 250 dead for minimal Allied losses. Following the conclusion of that operation, I Field Force commander LTG William B. Rosson decided to keep Task Force Byrd in place to provide a mobile strike force to support ARVN forces in the area, particularly the 44th Regiment commanded by the Province chief Lt. Col. Nguyen Khac Tuan. On the evening of 16 October units of the VC 482nd Battalion attacked the Thien Giao district headquarters 18km north of Phan Thi·∫øt, penetrating the perimeter and destroying three of four bunkers before being driven off by 1st Cavalry Division helicopter gunships. The 2/7th Cavalry and ARVN units conducted combined operations throughout late 1966 and into 1967, gradually improving security in the province but seldom encountering large VC units. By late October 1967 the operation had accounted for over 850 VC killed and 300 weapons captured for losses of 23 killed and 278 wounded. In late 1967 COMUSMACV General William Westmoreland sought to reopen and improve Highway 1 from Xu√¢n L·ªôc to Phan Rang, restoring the overland link between III Corps and II Corps. Task Force Byrd was to provide security to military engineers as they repaired and improved Highway 1 across B√¨nh Thu·∫≠n Province. The engineers would also construct platoon-size bases along the highway to provide security for the highway itself and to support pacification efforts. On 8 November 1967 the VC 840th Battalion and the 450th Local Force Company attacked the under construction Fort Mara (), 15km northeast of Phan Thi·∫øt which contained the headquarters and an infantry company from the ARVN 3rd Battalion, 44th Regiment. The unit's U.S. adviser called for support and the commander of Task Force Byrd, Lt. Col. Joseph T. Griffin Jr., sent a 3 UH‚Äì1 Night Hunter team, with the first helicopter carrying infantrymen equipped with Starlight scope rifles flying low to the ground, the second helicopter dropped flares from a higher altitude and the third helicopter was armed with aerial rockets to return any hostile fire. An AC-47 Spooky gunship also arrived to assist the defenders and together they succeeded in holding back the VC until dawn when a company from the 2/7th Cavalry arrived forcing the VC to withdraw. ARVN losses were 28 killed and 35 wounded, while VC losses were 42 killed. On 22 November the VC launched a mortar attack on an ARVN outpost at Thien Giao. Lt. Col. Griffin sent an infantry platoon to engage the VC. When the helicopters landed in a clearing near the outpost, they were met by small arms and machine gun fire from the VC 482nd Battalion which had planned to ambush such an air assault. Lt. Col. Griffin sent the rest of the 2/7th Cavalry to relieve the stranded platoon and these helicopters were also met by intense fire around the landing zone with 2 forced to crash-land. After several hours the 482nd Battalion disengaged from combat. U.S. losses were 11 dead and 36 wounded, while VC losses were estimated as 21 killed. ==Aftermath== Operation Byrd was suspended on 1 December 1967 and the 2/7th Cavalry join the 1st Brigade, 101st Airborne Division, in Operation Klamath Falls along the border between B√¨nh Thu·∫≠n and L√¢m ƒê·ªìng Provinces. Operation Byrd was succeeded by Operation McLain conducted by the 3rd Battalion, 506th Infantry Regiment. ==References== Category:Conflicts in 1967 Category:Battles and operations of the Vietnam War in 1967 Category:Battles and operations of the Vietnam War Category:History of B√¨nh Thu·∫≠n Province ","title":"Operation Byrd"},{"id":"56844356","text":"Kristen Bicknell (born December 29, 1986) is a Canadian professional poker player. ==Early life== Bicknell was born in St. Catharines, Ontario.

For reasons unknown, his advancement to the consulate was much delayed; according to the Lex annales, for non-patricians the gap between praetor and consul was 12 years, while it took Afrinus at least 17 years to advance to the consulate.As pointed out by Paul A.

Tayuan Temple was originally a stupa of Xiantong Temple. The stupa, named the Great White Pagoda, was constructed in the 6th year of of the Yuan dynasty (1302 AD). In the 5th year of Yongle reign of the Ming Dynasty (1407AD), it was expanded to a temple and got its name as Tayuan Temple. It is listed in the Major Historical and Cultural Sites Protected in Shanxi Province, China. == About == It is one of the five famous temples for practicing Zen, and also one of the ten famous temples for accommodating monks in Mount Wutai. Tayuan Temple stands in the north facing the south, consisting of rows of temple buildings and dorms for monks. Its axis is filled with magnificent structures such as screen walls, stone tablets, arches, stone stairways, passing doors, gates, drum towers, Tianwang Hall, Daci Yanshou Hall, Cangjing Mansion, Shanhai Mansion, Manjushri Hair Pagoda, and so on. It has an area of 15,000 square meters with over 130 halls and houses. Currently, there are three exquisite wooden-arch structures that were built during the Wanli reigh of the Ming Dynasty. Shakyamuni Buddha Hall stands in front of the temple, Cangjing Mansion (library for sutras) in its back and the Great White Pagoda (Sharira Pagoda) in its middle. The statues in the halls are all well- preserved. There are 20 layers of wooden rotating wheels in the Cangjing Mansion, each of which is placed with over 20,000 Buddhism sutras in Chinese, Mongolian and Tibetan characters. Among them, there are over 2,000 complete and widely-read sutras that were written between the Song Dynasty to the Qianlong Reigh of the Qing Dynasty. The Great White Pagoda is the main building in the temple. It is a Tibetan-style pagoda sits on a rectangle base. It is 75.3 m tall, constructed of brick with a lime coating on the outside that gives its white color, towering amongst the mountains and trees and standing out with its white pagoda. The tower spires, trays and pearls are all made of bronze. Wind-bells are decorated in the middle of the pagoda and the trays. When the bells all dance to the blowing wind, you will find the pagoda is so charming and enticing. To the east of the Great White Pagoda stands a smaller white pagoda. Legend has it that inside the pagoda stores the golden hairs of Manjushri Bodhisattva when He presents himself to the people on earth. Therefore, the smaller white pagoda is also called ‚ÄúManjushri Hair Pagoda.‚Äù In 1983 it has been designated as a \\"National Key Buddhist Temple in Han Chinese Area\\". Today, people recognize this pagoda as a symbol of Mount Wutai. The Tayuan Temple has significant importance in China. == Gallery == File:‰∫îÂè∞Â±±Â°îÈô¢ÂØ∫.jpgTayuan Temple File:Great White Pagoda1.JPGGreat White Pagoda ==References Category:Buddhist temples on Mount Wutai Category:Wutai County Category:Xinzhou Category:Major National Historical and Cultural Sites in Shanxi ","title":"Tayuan Temple"},{"id":"56844504","text":"Yttrium(III) sulfate is an inorganic compound with the formula Y2(SO4)3.

SCF complexes, formed by SKP1, cullin, and F-box proteins, act as protein- ubiquitin ligases. F-box proteins interact with SKP1 through the F box, and they interact with ubiquitination targets through other protein interaction domains. Biochemically, Fbx15 is a substrate receptor of an ubiquitin ligase belonging to the family of the F-box proteins. Differently from other F-box proteins, Fbx15 recognizes its substrate Kif1-Binding Protein (KBP) in an acetylation dependent manner. == Importance in embryonic stem cells == Fbxo15 is a protein expressed in undifferentiated embryonic stem cells. It is expressed during coexpression of Oct3/4, c-Myc, Klf4, and SOX2, four genes identified to be important in embryonic stem cell self-renewal and differentiation repression. In mice having a beta-galactosidase gene knocked into the Fbx15 locus, stain was detected in ES cells, early embryos (from two- cell to blastocyst stages), and testis tissue. There is an enhancer site upstream of the Fbx15-encoding transcription gene that contains an octamer- like binding motif and a Sox-like binding motif. Reporter gene analyses demonstrated that the ES cell-specific expression required this 18-bp enhancer element located approximately 500 nucleotides upstream from the transcription initiation site. Deletion or point mutation of either motif abolished the enhancer activity. It became active in NIH 3T3 cells when Oct3/4 and Sox2 were coexpressed and cooperatively bind to the enhancer sequence. Targeted deletion of the Fbx15 gene in mice does not result in embryonic lethality or gross developmental aberrations, despite the fact that Fbx15-/- mice are sub-fertile when compared to their wild-type counterparts. This might be explained by the fact that Fbx15-/- embryonic stem cells display a proliferation defect - caused by the accumulation of the Fbx15 substrate KBP - generating a short- term bottleneck during the early stages of embryogenesis. In fact, targeting of KBP is required to prevent an unscheduled mitochondrial biogenesis that, in na√Øve pluripotent stem cells, causes increased mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation and production of reactive oxygen species. The selective expression of Fbx15 and its dependency on the activity of the pluripotency core factors Oct3/4 and Sox2 promoted the use of the expression of Fbx15 as the first marker of reprogramming of fibroblasts into induced pluripotent stem cells. == References == ","title":"F-box protein 15"},{"id":"56844706","text":"Kenneth Michael Wallace (1944‚Äì2018) was a British engineer.

Sex√© was a reporter during World War I. == Around-the-world trips == He made several trips across the world including travelling the Soviet Union in 1926 on a motorcycle. He also visited the Belgian Congo and the United States. His exploits and photographs were printed in many newspapers across France and Belgium. He received notable press attention when he would visit a country including Russia, Japan, and the United States. In 1926, Sex√©, along with Henri Andrieux, travelled around the world with their Belgian built Gillet Herstal motorcycles. They left Paris on 14 June and ended their trip in Brussels on 3 December. They received cooperation from the Soviet government in their travels in the USSR, with fuel being placed in convenient areas for them to refill their bikes. ==Tintin== Sex√©'s travels, use of motorcycles, and his similar appearance were all mirrored in Tintin's first two adventures. Herge, the creator of Tintin, started drawing the character in 1929 setting his first adventure in the Soviet Union. Tintin in the Land of the Soviets, came almost three years after Sex√© travelled the country. Sex√©'s photos of his travels in the country were printed in Belgian newspapers, where Herge resided. According to the BBC documentary Tintin's Adventure with Frank Gardner, some of the photos that Sex√© took match what Herge would later draw, replacing Sex√© with Tintin. Tintin was even depicted riding the same model motorcycle, the Belgian-made Gillet Herstal, that Sex√© rode across the Soviet Union. The Herg√© Foundation in Belgium has admitted that it is not too hard to imagine how Herg√© could have been influenced by the exploits of Sex√©. The creator of Tintin never revealed who inspired his characters. == Later life == During World War II, Sex√© wrote articles for La Gerbe, a French collaborationist weekly newspaper that promoted Vichy or Nazi beliefs. Sex√© died in 1986 in Poitiers, France. == References == Category:1890 births Category:1986 deaths Category:French photojournalists Category:Long-distance motorcycle riders Category:Alumni of the London School of Economics Category:French travel writers ","title":"Robert Sex√©"},{"id":"56844838","text":"Location of the nature park in Germany Bavarian Forest Nature Park bei Ruhmannsfelden Suspension bridge in the Buchberger Leite in the nature park Countryside near Ruhmannsfelden Treetop walk in Sankt Englmar-Maibrunn The Bavarian Forest Nature Park () covers an area north of the Danube as far as the border ridge with the Czech Republic. Its sponsor organisation is the Naturpark Bayerischer Wald whose head office is in Zwiesel, Bavaria. It was established in 1967 and is thus the oldest nature park in Bavaria. == Location == The Bavarian Forest Nature Park lies in the southeast of Germany between the Danube and the highlands of the Bavarian Forest along the Bavarian- Bohemian border. In the east it is adjoined by the Bavarian Forest National Park and in the north by the Upper Bavarian Forest Nature Park. Its neighbouring protected areas on the Czech side of the border are the Bohemian Forest (≈†umava) Protected Area and Bohemian Forest National Park. In the southeast the area of the nature park borders on the Upper Austrian district of M√ºhlviertel. == Natural region == The territory of the Bavarian Forest Nature Park begins at the Danube at a height of about 320-metres above sea level. Here there are the last remains of riparian woodland and structurally rich ox-bow lakes. The Lallinger Winkel is well known for its scattered orchards. On the anterior chain of the Bavarian Forest, the so-called Danube Hills, the last examples of the threatened capercaillie still survive, as they do in the highlands of the inner Bavarian Forest. An ecologically very rich rock formation is the Pfahl. It runs in a southeasterly direction for about 140 kilometres from the neighbouring Bavarian province of Upper Palatinate to the state of Upper Austria. The weather resistant quartz rock protrudes above the surrounding gneisses by several metres and offers a habitat for many warmth-loving animal and plant species. In the Inner Bavarian Forest there are still structure-rich mixed mountain woodlands and the typical highland spruce forests with raised bogs and areas of Schachten, the last relicts of mountain pasture. The Bavarian Forest is part of the largest contiguous forest in Central Europe and, together with the neighbouring Bohemian Forest, is of outstanding importance for nature and landscape conservation. The partly near- natural woods in the border region and the attractive, historical cultural landscape make the Bavarian Forest Nature Park an important component in the conservation of major landscapes. Numerous animal and plant species which have become very rare or are threatened with extinction in Bavaria and Germany as a whole, have found their last refuge areas in this region. == See also == * List of nature parks in Germany * Bavarian Forest Club == External links == *Bavarian Forest Nature Park Bavarian Forest Bavarian Forest Nature Park Category:Regen (district) Category:Deggendorf (district) Category:Straubing- Bogen ","title":"Bavarian Forest Nature Park"},{"id":"56844867","text":"Potter (also Old Potter, Rust) is an unincorporated community in Polk County, Arkansas, United States.Arkansas Department of Transportation-Polk County ==Notes== Category:Unincorporated communities in Polk County, Arkansas Category:Unincorporated communities in Arkansas ","title":"Potter, Arkansas"},{"id":"56844876","text":"Crokicurl is a Canadian winter sport invented by Liz Wreford and Leanne Muir of Public City Architecture and first played in Winnipeg, Canada.

In the crokicurl version of the game, rocks are used instead of discs which are roughly the size of a curling stone. The stones are made from a lighter material. The game is played by teams consisting of two players, trying to score points by throwing the stones into the center of the ice where the circles are marked. The highest circle is marked with twenty points. Crokicurl has spread from Winnipeg to Saskatoon, Calgary, Regina, Guelph, Penetanguishene, and Fort St. John, with more crokicurl rinks popping up in Gull Lake, SK, Melfort, Sylvan Lake, AB, Prince Albert, SK, Estevan, and Orillia. == References == Category:Ice sports Category:Curling in Canada Category:Sports originating in Canada ","title":"Crokicurl"},{"id":"56844887","text":"Leonardo da Vinci this name has been borne by at least four ships of the Italian Navy and may refer to: * , a launched in 1911 and sunk in 1916. * , a launched in 1939 and sunk in 1943. * , a launched in 1942 as USS Dace for the United States Navy and transferred in 1955.

The battle was a clear victory for Prince Ivan Khovansky of the Tsardom of Russia over Swedish Governor-General Count Magnus De la Gardie allowing the Russians to regroup after a brief resurgence of Swedish resistance. == Prelude == After the defeat at Walk, in July 1657, Ivan Khovansky was appointed as the Pskov voivode. His army was reinforced with 10 companies of Reiters and 3 companies of Dragoons (about 1,200 men). In September, the Swedes under Governor-General Count Magnus De la Gardie invaded the Gdov district, but Prince Khovansky timely learned about the invasion of the Swedish army and managed to reinforce the garrison of the city to 1,000 men (300 noble militia, 300 Don Cossacks, 200 Streltsy, 100 Luga Cossacks, 100 mercenaries), but with only two guns. Nevertheless, the garrison managed to repel all attacks, and even make several successful sorties. == Battle == Upon learning of the arrival of the Swedes, Prince Khovansky hastily advanced to Gdov. On the night of September 16, Russian troops caught the retreating army of Delagardi 3 versts from Gdov on the river Chermi. Beginning the persecution, Prince Khovansky sent forward the cavalry: 12 noble hundreds, Don Cossacks and Reiters. The decisive action was the attack of the Russian Reiters, who knocked the enemy out of position and fled. De la Gardie ordered all his artillery to be thrown into the water. In 15 versts of persecution, Russian troops scattered enemy forces. Swedes lost many officers, banners, artillery and over 1.000 men. == Aftermath == Having broken the troops of the Governor-General Count De la Gardie, the victory of Prince Khovansky greatly diminished the recent successes of the Swedish army in 1657, and restored the strategic initiative of the Russian army. == References == Category:Second Northern War Gdov(1657) Gdov(1657) Category:Conflicts in 1657 Category:1657 in Europe ","title":"Battle of Gdov"},{"id":"56844943","text":"Schachten is a German word for a type of pasture.

The film serves as a sequel to the 2013 film The Hundred-Year-Old Man Who Climbed Out of the Window and Disappeared, based on the novel of the same name by Jonas Jonasson. == Plot == One year after the events of previous film, Allan Karlsson and company celebrate Alan's 101st birthday in Bali. Allan offers Miriam and Julius his last \\"Folksoda\\", a carbonated beverage Allan accidentally helped create during his double agent days at the height of the Cold War in the 1970s. As Miriam and Julius argue over who gets to finish the soda, Allan's pet capuchin Erlander finishes the whole bottle. Soon after, Miriam and her husband Benny depart for Malmk√∂ping, while Allan and Julius stay at the resort with G√§ddan. Allan mentions that while that was the last Folksoda in existence, he stashed away the secret formula inside a Montecristo cigar box in Berlin. Allan tells the story of how his disastrous visit to a Russian lab with Popov led to the creation of Folksoda after the lab burned down in an electrical fire. Julius convinces Allan to call Amanda Einstein, who invites them to come to Berlin and retrieve the formula from her apartment. Julius, Allan, and G√§ddan flee the resort (without paying their bill) and head for the airport. During check-in, a pair of security guards recognize Julius from a viral video in which he chases after Erlander on the beach. On the flight to Berlin, a stewardess named Rebecca opens Allan's carry-on suitcase and unknowingly allows Erlander to escape. The pilot contacts the nearest communications tower and makes an emergency landing in Moscow. Meanwhile, a woman named Stirna meets with her therapist, H√•kan, after she sees news coverage of the viral video featuring Julius and Erlander on the beach and the plane's emergency landing in Russia. She recognizes Allan as the man who stole the secret formula from her father, Popov. Hysterical, she convinces H√•kan to join her in tracking down Allan and company in Moscow. At the same time, Rebecca returns home to her husband Bas, who recognizes Allan's description as the man who stole 50 million dollars from Bas's deceased brother, Pim. Bas packs a bag full of weapons and heads to Moscow. Allan, Julius, and G√§ddan are freed by Russian authorities but keep Erlander under quarantine at the airport. They check into a hotel where Allan recounts the story of how creating Folksoda led to top-secret meetings with Leonid Brezhnev and Richard Nixon. During a film shoot for Folksoda in East Germany, Allan met Popov's young daughter, Kristina. At the airport, Stirna bribes the Russian authorities into giving her Erlander. She pressures H√•kan into organizing a swap with Allan: Erlander in exchange for the secret formula. When Allan and Julius arrive, they discover H√•kan dead, having choked on the cork of a champagne bottle during an altercation with Erlander. Allan, Julius, and G√§ddan board a train for Berlin, with Stirna and Bas in hot pursuit. In Malmk√∂ping, Inspector Aronsson receives word that two CIA agents will be investigating a slew of suspicious activity in town, brought upon by Miriam and Benny making international calls about Folksoda to Allan. Stirna lies about her identity and joins the group on their trip to Berlin. Bas attempts to hold G√§ddan at gunpoint but two passengers disable his weapon. G√§ddan hotwires a car in Warsaw and the group proceeds to Berlin. Allan falls asleep and dreams about the night Popov was killed by East German border patrol guards as he tried to leave the country with Allan and the secret formula. With his final breath, he tells Allan that the secret formula must be delivered to \\"K\\". The group arrives in Berlin and finds Amanda. She reminisces with Allan about a wild party in the 1970s where Allan got a tattoo on his left buttock while under the effects of LSD. Julius walks in on the two of them having sex. At Miriam's behest, Benny goes to Allan's old nursing home and collects his belongings, hoping to find more bottles of Folksoda. Inspector Aronsson meets with the CIA agents, who make plans to visit Benny at his home by the lake. Stirna and Allan locate the cigar box inside a secret compartment, only to find that it contains nothing but cigars. Allan discerns that the formula is in his other cigar box in Malmk√∂ping. Unknown to the group, Bas is tracking Stirna using cellphone locator software and follows the group to Sweden. Inspector Aronsson and the CIA agents arrive at Benny's home, where their questioning is interrupted by Benny's constant vomiting from nervousness. They head to the nursing home and speak with the staff as to Allan's whereabouts. Concurrently, Allan and Julius sneak into the nursing home's storage area but Allan's belongings are already gone. Allan, Julius, G√§ddan, and Stirna race to Benny's house and arrive just in time to save the cigar box from being used as kindling. They retrieve the formula, in microfiche form, and attempt to decipher it on Benny's microfiche reader. Stirna confesses to Allan that she is Popov's daughter Kristina. Having finally found \\"K\\", Allan gives her the formula and tells her to return home. As Julius tries to stop her, the CIA agents arrive along with Bas, who holds everyone at gunpoint. Benny gives Bas the money Allan stole from Pim and the microfiche reader. Inspector Aronsson shoots Bas, who falls into a well and is killed by his own exploding grenade. The explosion destroys the money and the microfiche reader. The CIA agents arrest G√§ddan and extradite him to the United States for his past crimes. Inspector Aronsson receives a medal from the government for his service. Julius discovers that Allan's tattoo on his buttock is a Russian transcription of how to make Folksoda. Some time later, Miriam and Benny organize a luncheon at their house for Allan Jr., their newborn son. Stirna, having decided to stay with her new friends, helps Julius with creating Folksoda in an outdoor synthesis lab, but are missing a vital step in the creation process. Allan sits down with his friends to enjoy the meal as he carries both Allen Jr. and Erlander. A lighting bolt strikes Julius's makeshift lab, mimicking the electrical fire Allan caused all those years ago. == Cast == * Robert Gustafsson as Allan Karlsson * Iwar Wiklander as Julius Jonsson * David Wiberg as Benny * Shima Niavarani as Miriam * Jens Hult√©n as G√§ddan * Svetlana Rodina Ljungkvist as Stina * Ralph Carlsson as Inspector Aronsson * Jay Simpson as Bas * David Shackleton as Herbert Einstein * Georg Nikoloff as Popov * Eric Stern as H√•kan * Eleanor Matsuura as Rebecca * Colin McFarlane as Seth * Erni Mangold as Amanda Einstein * Crystal the Monkey as Erlander == References  External links == * * Svensk film databas Category:Swedish comedy films Category:Films set in Russia Category:Cultural depictions of Leonid Brezhnev Category:Swedish films Category:Films set in Sweden Category:Films about old age Category:Cultural depictions of Richard Nixon Category:Films set in Germany Category:Films set in Poland ","title":"The 101-Year-Old Man Who Skipped Out on the Bill and Disappeared"},{"id":"56844963","text":"Chinese characters for transcribing Slavonic were Chinese characters created for the purpose of transcribing Slavonic sounds into Chinese. The Russian Orthodox Church's mission in China had an interest in translating liturgical texts into Chinese and Japanese, and sought to devise new characters for this purpose. Many of these new characters were proposed by Archimandrite Gurias, the 14th head of the Russian mission from 1858‚Äì1864. They would have transcribed certain syllables normally not valid in standard Chinese phonology, such as vin, gi, or reia. These characters were later used for transcription into Japanese as well, with the character pronunciations changed to account for Japanese phonology. However, in both China and Japan, leaders of the Russian missions eventually decided to translate liturgical texts using standard vernacular Chinese and katakana, respectively. The majority of the new characters were composed through combining two existing characters side- by-side as radicals, which would also indicate their pronunciation. Unlike the typical rule of pronouncing the character based on the side radical, used in pronouncing phono-semantic compounds, the radicals are presented in initial- rime pairs. In a method similar to Fanqie, the right-hand character would indicate the syllable initial, while the left-hand character would be used as an indicator of the final. This approach to character formation was intended for vertical reading, where the flow of the text is from top-to-bottom, and ordered from right-to-left.

Eliza Emily Donnithorne (8 July 1821 - 20 May 1886) was an Australian woman best known as a possible inspiration for the character of Miss Havisham in Charles Dickens' 1861 novel Great Expectations. ==BiographyEarly life=== Cambridge Hall (known as Camperdown Lodge by the time this photo was taken), Eliza Donnithorne's Newtown home. Eliza Donnithorne was born at the Cape of Good Hope, South Africa, and spent her early childhood in Calcutta where her father, James Donnithorne, worked for the East India Company as master of the mint and later as a judge. Her mother was Sarah Elizabeth Donnithorne, nee Bampton. Sarah Donnithorne and the couple's two older daughters died during a cholera epidemic in the 1830s. In 1838, when Eliza was about 17 years old, her father retired and moved to Sydney. Eliza seems to have lived in England for some years with her brother and his wife, before joining her father in New South Wales in 1846. In Sydney they lived at Cambridge Hall (later known as Camperdown Lodge) at 36 King Street, Newtown. When her father died in May 1852, Eliza inherited most of his estate. ===Broken engagement and later life=== Although there are multiple versions of the story and historical evidence is scarce, most accounts of Donnithorne's life focus on a broken engagement when she was about 30 years old. Some sources name her fianc√© as George Cuthbertson, a clerk with a shipping company. On the morning of the wedding, her fianc√© did not arrive at Cambridge Hall for the wedding breakfast. The story goes that she ordered that the feast and decorations be left out, and spent the rest of her life as a recluse. Some versions say that she never took off her wedding dress. A 1946 retelling captures the recurring details of the story: > The guests were assembled, and the wedding breakfast prepared. Eliza, clad > in her bridal gown, awaited the arrival of the groom. He never came. She > never heard from him again. When the guests had departed, Eliza pulled down > the blinds of her house, and for 30 years remained a hermit. The front door > was chained pemitting it to open only a few inches; callers never saw her, > for when she was forced to speak to them, she remained out of sight. Here, > for those long years, lived a woman in whom hope had died. When death at > last came to Eliza, those who came to carry her to the greater peace of > Camperdown Cemetery found her still clad in her bridal gown. Dust lay thick > on the floor, and the window panes were thick with grime. And in the dining > room, the wedding feast was uneaten, and the food had mouldered into dust. ===Death and legacy=== Donnithorne died in 1886 and was buried at St Stephen's church in Newtown (now Camperdown Cemetery) alongside her father. Her grave remains one of the cemetery's most visited by tourists. When it was vandalised in 2004, the Australian National Trust and the UK Dickens Society contributed to the cost of its restoration. ==As inspiration for Miss Havisham== The claim that Eliza Donnithorne inspired the character of Miss Havisham in Great Expectations has been part of Australian literary lore since at least the last decades of the 19th century. Charles Dickens never visited Australia, but he was interested in the Australian colonies and wrote frequently about them in his weekly journal, Household Words. There are several theories as to how he may have encountered the story of Eliza Donnithorne. One 1935 newspaper report describes Donnithorne's father, James, as \\"a great friend of the famous writer\\", but offers no source for this statement. Another theory suggests that the Sydney-based social reformer Caroline Chisholm, who met Dickens in England in 1850 and corresponded with him about the Australian colonies, may have told Dickens about Donnithorne. Chisholm's descriptions of life in New South Wales were published in Dickens' Household Words, and the character of Mrs Jellyby in Dickens' Bleak House was likely based in part on Chisholm. Chisholm would have had opportunity to hear about Donnithorne: she ran a school for girls in Newtown, near Donnithorne's home; Chisholm and her husband were part of the same small Sydney philanthropic circle as Donnithorne's father; and Chisholm and Eliza Donnithorne were at one point treated by the same Sydney doctor. Some versions of the story speculate that Dickens' sons, two of whom spent time in Australia, told the story to their father. However, they arrived in Australia after Great Expectations was published. Other historians propose an alternative explanation: that Dickens did not base Miss Havisham on Donnithorne, but that Sydney readers drew the connection when Great Expectations was published in 1861, and over time embellished Donnithorne's story with details borrowed from Dickens' book. This is the tentative conclusion reached by Evelyn Juers in her 2012 book The Recluse, the most thorough recent investigation of the story. == In popular culture and the arts == Opera: Miss Donnithorne's Maggot is an operatic work, with music by Peter Maxwell Davies and text by Randolph Stow. Literature: Eliza Donnithorne features in the children's novel I Am Susannah by Libby Gleeson (Angus & Robertson, 1987). ==Bibliography== *Juers, Evelyn. The Recluse.

Auxiliary blows were applied from Pskov to Dorpat (Russian: Yuryev) and from Novgorod to Noteburg (Oreshek) and Nyenschanz. The capture of Dorpat was entrusted to the army of Alexey Trubetskoy. The army of Trubetskoy was quite numerous. On the paper there were 5546 cavalry (3327 nobles, 832 Reiters, 622 Cossacks and102 Tatars) and about 5,000 infantry (3 Streltsy orders and 4 regiments of the New Order). The garrison of the fortress, commanded by Lars Fleming, consisted of an infantry regiment (448 soldiers in 5 companies), 45 artillerymen and about 100 regular cavalrymen. They were supported by several hundred armed burghers. == Siege == The main forces of the Russian army approached the fortress in the early days of August. The Swedish garrison actively opposed siege operations, undertaking frequent forays. The fighting was not limited to fighting at the walls of the fortress. The Swedish troops attempted to break through the blockade and conduct reinforcements to Dorpat. The attempt to undermine the walls was not successful, and artillery was also not effective. The best siege guns were sent to the main army near Riga, the quantity and power available was not enough. By this time the main army had already failed at the siege of Riga . On October 23, the Swedish garrison had agreed to an honorable surrender. This was affected by heavy losses from shelling and disease (there were only 140 soldiers left) and the lack of assistance and news from the outside. == Aftermath == The capture of Yuryev became the greatest success of the Russian army in the war, especially significant against the background of the failure of the main Russian army in the siege of Riga. The city, despite the attempt of the Swedes to retake it, remained in the hands of the Russian troops until the end of the war. Only in 1661 according to the peace treaty the city was returned to Sweden. == References == Category:Second Northern War Dorpat(1656) Dorpat(1656) Category:Conflicts in 1656 Category:1656 in Europe ","title":"Siege of Dorpat (1656)"},{"id":"56845136","text":"Jenna Butler is an Australian politician.

The operation used many of the tactics of what would later become known as the Phoenix Program. In September 1967 the 222nd National Police Field Force Battalion replaced the 816th Battalion.

After her husband was murdered in 1931 the party nominated her to seek election to the Hamburg Parliament (\\"Hamburgische B√ºrgerschaft\\") in his place. She was successful, and sat as a member of the Hamburg Parliament from September 1931 until democratic institutions were withdrawn during the early summer of 1933. == Life == Marie Caroline Henriette MahnkeAlfred Dreckmann: In Bergedorf war alles genauso!. Schlo√üheft 9, Bergedorf 2004, pp. 172‚Äì173 was born at Nossentiner H√ºtte, a small village in the marshy flatlands between Rostock and Berlin. By 1920 she was living in Hamburg and had been married, since 1913, to Ernst Henning. They were both activist members of the recently launched Communist Party. She was a member of the Women's Policy department of the party district leadership (\\"Bezirksleitung\\") for the Wasserkant district (surrounding Hamburg to the north of the river. She also belonged to the Soviet sponsored Red Aid workers' welfare association. Meanwhile her husband became a member of the Hamburg Parliament (\\"Hamburgische B√ºrgerschaft\\") in 1927/28. However, he was murdered by Nazi fanatics on 14 March 1931 while heading back from a political meeting to the city on a late night bus. The event resonated widely, with 35,000 demonstrators reportedly following his coffin to its final resting place at Hamburg's Ohlsdorf Cemetery. At the next election, which took place in September 1931, despite being the widowed mother of three small children, Marie Henning stood for election to the parliament in his place. She was elected. R√©gime change in January 1933 was followed by a Nazi paramilitary invasion of parliament in March 1933, during the course of which communist members were arrested. Democratic processes were being systematically abolished and the final sitting of the parliament took place in June 1933. Marie Henning was arrested several times during the twelve Nazi years, although sources are vague as to times and places. She appears to have been arrested between May and June 1933 and again in March 1936. Her final arrest came in the context of \\"Aktion Gitter\\", a mass arrest of more than 5,000 people that took place overnight on 22/23 August, probably in response to an assassination attempt against the leader on 20 July 1944. Those arrested were identified on (in many cases out of date) lists of people who had been politically active members of (non-Nazi) political parties before 1933. Marie Henning was one of those who were released in September 1944 after just a few weeks in detention. War ended in May 1945 along with the Nazi r√©gime. Marie Henning lived on for another two and a half years during which she was an active member of the Committee of former political prisoners in Hamburg- Bergedorf (\\"Komitee ehemaliger politischer Gefangener in Hamburg-Bergedorf \\"). However, during these final years much of her time was spent in hospital, and she died of cancer in Hamburg on 5 January 1948. == Family == Marie Henning was married twice: both her husbands predeceased her, and both died violent deaths. Her first marriage, to Ernst Henning, ended when her husband was murdered on a bus in 1931. This marriage produced one son and two daughters. The couple's son, Otto, was killed on the Russian front in August 1944. Her second marriage was to Carl Rohde, a former leader of the pre-Nazi Black-Red- Gold anti-extremist organisation. He was conscripted into the army and died on 5 June 1944 at a munitions depot in B√ºchsenschinken when an anti-tank \\"Panzerfaust\\" gun exploded. == Celebration == In 1995 a street was renamed the \\"Marie-Henning-Weg\\" in the Neuallerm√∂he (Bergedorf) quarter of Hamburg. == References == Category:Communist Party of Germany politicians Category:Members of the Hamburg Parliament Category:1895 births Category:1948 deaths ","title":"Marie Henning"},{"id":"56845304","text":"The It Won't Be Soon Before Long Tour was the third concert tour by the American pop rock band Maroon 5, in support of their second studio album, It Won't Be Soon Before Long (2007). ==Opening acts== * OneRepublic * Sara Bareilles * Justin Timberlake * Kanye West * Ry Cuming * Kevin Michael * Augustana * Dashboard Confessional * The Counting Crows * Phantom Planet * Brandi Carlile * The Hives *Captain Stu ==SetlistShows== {  style=\\"text-align:center;\\" ! scope=\\"col\\" style=\\"width:12em;\\" Date ! scope=\\"col\\" style=\\"width:10em;\\" City ! scope=\\"col\\" style=\\"width:10em;\\" Country ! scope=\\"col\\" style=\\"width:16em;\\" Venue - - ddd;\\"  colspan=\\"4\\" North America -  September 29, 2007  Auburn Hills  rowspan=\\"3\\" United States  The Palace of Auburn Hills -  October 1, 2007  Saint Paul  Xcel Energy Center -  October 2, 2007  Rosemont  Allstate Arena -  October 4, 2007  Toronto  Canada  Air Canada Centre -  October 5, 2007  Cleveland  rowspan=\\"18\\" United States  Quicken Loans Arena -  October 7, 2007  Columbus  Nationwide Arena -  October 8, 2007  Charlottesville  John Paul Jones Arena -  October 10, 2007  New York City  Madison Square Garden -  October 12, 2007  Uncasville  Mohegan Sun Arena -  October 13, 2007  Philadelphia  Wachovia Spectrum -  October 15, 2007  Boston  TD Banknorth Garden -  October 16, 2007  Washington, D.C.

He was born in Kemnath, Upper Palatinate (at the time part of the Electoral Palatinate under Frederick V) as the son of the superintendent of the Reformed church there. His family was forced to move away in the wake of the Catholic victory at White Mountain, when Horn was still an infant. In 1635, he visited the gymnasium in Nuremberg, and in 1637 he was enrolled in University of Altdorf as a student of theology and medicine. He later worked as a private tutor, in Gr√∂ningen and later in Leiden, in the Dutch Republic. In Leiden, he was also enrolled as a student of Friedrich Spanheim. After a two year's sojourn in England, he returned to Leiden, compiling a history of the events of the ongoing English Civil War (Rerum Britannicarum libri VII, De statu ecclesiae Britannicae hodierno). In 1648, he completed a doctorate in Leiden and refused calls to both Frankfurt University and Heidelberg University as professor of theology, instead accepting the position of professor of history, politics and geography at the new University of Harderwijk, where he became rector in 1652. In 1653, he became professor of history at Leiden University, a position he held until his death in 1670. In his later life, Horn was also greatly interested in alchemy. In 1665, he was swindled out of the considerable sum of 5,000 guilders5,000 guilders (Carolusgulden) at the time corresponded to 8.55 kg of gold at 14 carat, or 5 kg (176 oz) of pure gold. by a fraudulent alchemist.

These works were re-published long after his death in both the Netherlands and Germany. His treated universal history in a modern manner, no longer divided into the history of the four classical empires (Assyria, Persia, Macedon, Rome) but based on the concept of national history, including the history of the peoples of the New World (De originibus Americanis). He was also one of the earliest historiographers to divide world history into three major epochs, antiquity from earliest times until the Migration period, the middle period from the Migration period to the year 1500, and modern history from 1500 to his own day. His coverage of the Migration period is presented as the history of the \\"Scythian\\" nation, which is divided into Germans, Huns and Slavs. In all his works, Horn presents himself as a pious Protestant and as a patriot of his homeland, considering himself a native of and exile from the Upper Palatinate (which had been annexed by the Catholic Duke of Bavaria in 1628).An example of his continued patriotic attachment to his homeland is his description of Rauher Kulm, a hill of 682 m close to his native Kemnath, in his Orbis Politicus (1667) as \\"standing in the center of Germany, standing taller than all mountains far and wide, as it were a Wonder of the World\\". == Works == * De statu ecclesiae Britannicae hodierno commentarius. 1647 * Rerum Britannicarum libri septem, quibus res in Anglia, Scotia, Hibernia, ab anno MDCXLV bello gestae, eponuntur 1648 * De originibus Americanis libri IV. 1652 * Historia philosophica libri septem: quibus de origine, successione, sectis & vita philosophorum ab orbe condito ad nostram aetatem agitur.

Charcoal production, alongside pressure to expand agriculture in Senegal to meet the quadrupling of population has led to increased loss of forest. In 2006, Senegal still had 45.1% ‚Äîor about 8,673,000 hectares‚Äîof forest with 18.4% ‚Äî or roughly 1,598,000 hectares ‚Äî classified as primary forest. In 2007 Senegal was losing 350,000 hectares of forest per year through slash-and-burn for farming because of its rapidly growing population. Variability of rainfall compounded with issues like climate change, lead About 13% of the land - holding about 22% of the population - are now considered degraded. In 2016, the government warned that the Casamance forest cover would have vanished by 2018, if illegal logging continued. === Mitigation === Since 1970s Senegal has lost 25% of its mangrove forests. Recent efforts have been led by the organization Oceanium to replant the mangroves. The national Forest Service designed in the early 2000s was designed to democratize and decentralize forest management. However, subsequent analysis by academics found that inequalities favor commercial interests and exploitation by economic forces. == Overfishing == West African communities face pressure from both overfishing by local fleets as well as Asian and European fleets harvesting from fisheries in West Africa as other fisheries become overfished or collapse. For example fleets in 2017 Saint-Louis, Senegal have seen a large decline in harvest, causing ripple effects on nutrition and food supply in the country, where 75% of animal protein comes from fish. ==See also== *Geography of Senegal *Agriculture in Senegal *Water supply and sanitation in Senegal *Ecological Monitoring Centre, Senegal *Rally of the Ecologists of Senegal *List of mammals of Senegal *List of non-marine molluscs of Senegal *Basse Casamance National Park ==External links== * ==References== ","title":"Environmental issues in Senegal"},{"id":"56845436","text":"√Åine Furey is an Irish singer.

It is also noted that, the mosque was constructed by the will of Fazlull–∞h Im–∞m ibn –ûsm–∞n Shirv–∞ni. For this reason, sometimes the mosque is called by his name. It gets clear from the other epigraphic writing on the facade that the monument was restored in 1772-1773 (Hijri 1186) by Masood Ali. In 2012, substantial repair and restoration works were held on the museum by Old City State Historical- Architectural Reserve Department. ==Architectural features== Stalactic mihrab, which consists of five tiers framed with a rectangle on the southern wall of the interior, forms certain motifs of Shirvan-Absheron architectural school as a whole. At edges small niches are placed. The main facade of the mosque is asymmetrical and its rigid, voluminous composition is emphasized with classic- type portal-entrance. Accurately profiled rectangular frame of the portal, profiled cavity and epigraphic heading of Arabic are represented in classic form, in the background of the entire wall of the facade. Among eastern style portals of middle ages of the city, the portal of this mosque is the most classic. ==Exposition== Ancient coins and coins are exhibited and preserved in the mosque. The main exposition of the museum is currency units and coins and other interesting ancient exhibits from the era of the Sasanids, Safavids, Shirvanshahs and others, which existed in various periods since the beginning of money circulation in Azerbaijan.

Her Birthday falls on the same day. ==Legend & Celebration== Historically, married women pray to the hindu goddess Gowri and pray for longevity and well- being of their respective husbands. Women try to echo the devotion and love shown by Savitri for her husband Satyavan, as seen in the tale of Savitri and Satyavan, told in the epic Mahabharata. Married women fast that day. Before the auspicious time, women draw kolam infront of their pooja room, take bath and officiate the ceremony with the pooja. Typically, an offering made out of rice powder and jaggery is prepared and offered to the goddess. It is said that Savitri's devotion towards the goddess Gowri gave her the strength and wisdom to win back her husband's life from lord Yama, the Lord of death. She won the battle not by arms or ammunition, but by her clever arguments. When Yama offered her a wish, she prayed for a thousand sons. After he agreed, Savitri sought the life of her dead husband back to fulfill this wish. ==Preparation of ada== Bhog is a special ada prepared out of rice flour, black eyed peas, jaggery and coconut.

The Airports Act 1986 transferred the powers relating to running government owned airports from the British Airports Authority from the public sector to the private sector as part of a Conservative Party government policy of privatisation. BAA plc. was created as a result of the act to take over the authority's responsibilities. The act also granted statutory authority to the CAA to continue to regulate civil aviation in the United Kingdom as well as BAA. At the time of passage, BAA became responsible for London Heathrow Airport, London Gatwick Airport, London Stansted Airport, Glasgow Prestwick Airport, Glasgow International Airport, Edinburgh Airport and Aberdeen Airport. The act only applied to Great Britain and does not apply to Northern Ireland. The act also included a number of miscellaneous provisions that were eventually mirrored in airport bylaws. This had the effect of making breaches of airport bylaws punishable under criminal law.

In 1951 Hislam moved to Gloucestershire, where he continued with anti- war protests and activism including having his head shaved in 1964 and 1965 for a vigil to commemorate the dropping of a nuclear bomb on Hiroshima, many local CND demonstrations and a pilgrimage to Rome hoping to influence Pope John XXIII to condemn nuclear weapons.letters, diary, newspaper cuttings in Hislam Family archive, reports in Peace News He was a founder member of the Committee of 100 and took part in many CND protests. He was killed in a car crash in 1966. Family photo of Laurie ==Early life== Hislam was born in 1909, the second of four children in a working-class family in Camberwell, South East London. His father worked in transport, including driving horse-drawn and then steam-powered buses. Until he was 28 Laurie lived a carefree existence. He was a conventional white-collar worker and his Denmark Hill tennis club, cricket team and its social activities occupied his free time. Then in 1938 he was confronted with peace posters outside Whitfield's Tabernacle in Rye Lane, Peckham, which changed his entire way of life. \\"War means total destruction.\\" \\"War solves nothing.\\" \\"It is the responsibility of each individual to see that it never happens again.\\" The posters were part of an awareness campaign by the Peace Pledge Union (PPU), which Laurie joined. He became involved with the care of Basque child refugees who were living in a house in Langham, Essex, sponsored by the PPU. He kept in contact with two of the refugees after they returned to Spain in 1940.Photographs and letters in Hislam Family archive On 28 August 1939, when war was imminent, Hislam went to 10 Downing Street, and opened a suitcase containing painted rubber balls.

He was invited by the BBC to appear on television to explain why he had done what he did.Syd Hislam Memoir (unpublished) The incident and its reporting were reprised in The Sunday Times colour supplement on 27 August 1989 in a section on \\"Fifty Years ago today\\". == World War II == Hislam expressed his opinion at London's Speaker's Corner. He registered as a conscientious objector and attended a tribunal, consisting mainly of retired military men. He was vociferous about his pacifist beliefs, confirmation of his registration was refused, and he became liable for military service. He evaded the authorities for a while, continuing anti-war activities, and then went underground under an assumed name.Syd Hislam Memoir Within the PPU Hislam belonged to the dissident Forward Movement of anarchists, with John Hewetson and Frederick Lohr. He wrote and distributed anarchist leaflets, including Enemies of the People, published December 1941 in War Commentary by Freedom Press. Through Lohr he met his future wife, Winifred: they lived with him and other anarchists in Westbourne Terrace, London.A Nest of Anarchists, by J. B. Pick. In 1947 he was working for the Freedom Defence Committee publishing the FDC Bulletin at the time George Woodcock was secretary.Letter from Laurie to Winifred in Hislam family archive Lohr, Winifred and other members of the London Forum converted to Catholicism under the guidance of Jesuit priests of the Farm Street church, but Laurie was not convinced that he could be both Catholic and pacifist.see ref 1 By 1951 the couple had three daughters and moved to Gloucestershire. == In Gloucestershire == Hislam lived near Stroud, Gloucestershire, where he worked as a clerk and later a postman. Winifred was a trained teacher and became the main breadwinner. During the fifties Laurie was confirmed a Catholic by William E. Orchard, the pacifist parish priest of St Mary of the Angels Church, Brownshill. In 1957 the couple bought a plot of land and Laurie built, single-handedly, a three-bedroomed wooden bungalow for the growing family. He took 'single-handed' to the extreme of making his own concrete blocks for the foundations as well as learning the skills of plumber and electrician. In 1957, while working on the construction, he was visited by Chelo and Chivvi, two of the Basque refugee children he had sponsored in 1938, now married and living in Bilbao.photo in Hislam family archive Making concrete block + house completed The site of the house was chosen for its position near the Catholic St Mary of the Angels Church at Brownshill. This was the church built for a lay community of Dominican nuns, for whom Hislam worked for a time as a gardener. In the cellar of the bungalow he set up a pottery, building his own wheel and kiln. He sold pots at markets in the West Country. He was a friend of the peace activist John Papworth, whom he had met when both were in prison following an anti-war demonstration and who also had a house in Gloucestershire at this time. Through his work for the Movement for Colonial Freedom, Papworth became a friend, and later personal assistant, of Kenneth Kaunda and he took Kaunda to meet Laurie and his family in Brownshill. By the time of Hislam's death in 1966, he and Winifred had six daughters aged from 19 to 2. == CND and Committee of 100 == Laurie was a member of the Direct Action Committee that preceded the formation of the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament. He was arrested and jailed for taking part in the DAC nonviolent protest against all nuclear armaments at Harrington rocket base (Northants) 2 January 1960.PAX Bulletin no. 82 Jan 1960 A report in the PAX Bulletin refers to a photo on the front page of The Observer that included Laurie at the protest. He took part in the first march to Aldermaston in 1958 (organised by DAC) and subsequent CND Aldermaston or other Easter Marches until his death in 1966. He was a founder member of the Committee of 100 and retained a lifelong commitment to nonviolent civil disobedience, often at a local level (by which time he was living in Gloucestershire). He was a long time associate of Pat Arrowsmith and family papers include correspondence with Hugh Brock and Bertrand Russell. Russell expressed support for Laurie in all his local pacifist activities and his action in writing to John F Kennedy, Harold Macmillan and Nikita Khrushchev in 1962 to protest against their recent nuclear tests.Copies of letters in Hislam Family Archive He received a reply from Macmillan.Gloucester Citizen 9 May 1962 In March 1961 Ralph Schoenman visited Laurie in Gloucestershire and the two planned the breakaway 'Grosvenor Square' demonstration while walking with the family in the wild daffodil fields of Dymock. This was a breakaway from the main CND march from Aldermaston to Trafalgar Square. Hislam and Schoenman led a group of protesters who sat down in front of the American Embassy. Both were arrested and later fined 40 shillings with 10 guineas costs at Marlborough Street Magistrates' Court.Daily Mail, 4 April 1961 On 17 September 1961 Laurie was arrested and jailed for his part in a mass sit-down organised by the Committee of 100 in Trafalgar Square.Daily Mirror 18 September 1961 In 1963 Laurie travelled to Berlin with four other Gloucestershire peace campaigners. They distributed leaflets near 'Checkpoint Charlie' and Laurie crossed briefly to East Berlin before being expelled.Gloucester Citizen 15 April 1963 == Local Activism in Stroud == Laurie was an active member of Stroud CND and initiated many small activisms of his own. He courted publicity in the local press (report extracts below) in order to get his message across to the people of Stroud. He lost no opportunity to have discussions with all and sundry about his beliefs and became known affectionately as Stroud's \\"Ban the bomb man\\". === Demand for C.D. cash fraudulent, he says === \\"A prominent member of the Stroud branch of CND protested today to Stroud magistrates against a rate demand for Civil Defence purposes. Laurence A Hislam was summoned for failing to pay 2s 3d. He said \\"I believe that the council are levying this money fraudulently in so far as they are taking money for a service which it is physically impossible for them to carry out ‚Äì namely, for protection of the inhabitants of Stroud in time of nuclear war\\"\\" Evening Post, 23 September 1960 === Protest at sale of goods to pay rates === \\"When a wheel barrow and a lawn mower, which Stroud RDC had seized, were put up for auction, the owner Mr Laurence Hislam, was there to protest and hand out leaflets. The articles were impounded because Mr Hislam, a member of CND, had refused to pay the Civil Defence portion of his rates. He claimed the council were taking money for a service they could not provide.\\" Gloucester Citizen, 3 June 1961 === Stroud nuclear disarmer jailed again === \\"Laurence Hislam of Brownshill, Stroud, the nuclear disarmer and member of the Committee of 100 was jailed for 14 days by Stroud Magistrates for failing to pay ¬£6 4s. 3d. of his rates. In defence he said he had refused to pay the portion of his rates allocated to civil defence. He had instead paid the money to the charity 'War on Want'. He declared ..... It is tragic that ordinary decent people are passively accepting this drift towards mass annihilation........ this is my small effort to make it clear that it is a heinous and devilish thing.\\" Gloucester Citizen, 5 January 1962. While in prison on this occasion Laurie produced a leaflet \\"Why I am in Jail\\" for local distribution. His eldest daughter, Susan (aged 14), wrote to him in prison to tell him she stood in Stroud bus station for two hours giving out the leaflets.letter in Hislam family archive === Stroud protester answered === Mr Harold Macmillan, the Prime Minister has replied to a protest made by Mr Laurence Hislam of Stroud against American nuclear tests. Mr Hislam, the Stroud CND member, who recently fasted for 99 hours, had sent the protest, with a petition signed by 1,000 people of Stroud, both to the Prime Minister and President Kennedy against the tests. The reply quotes an extract from The Times \\"In particular the President and the Prime Minister ..... reaffirmed their regret that the Soviet Government had not been willing to join in an effective treaty which would end testing...\\" Mr Hislam commented \\"In my view, the responsibility for our policy - based as it is on a threat to annihilate mankind - cannot be passed on to the Russians.\\" (Gloucester Citizen, 9 May 1962) Laurie has head shaved === Local demonstrators expelled by E. Berlin police === Five \\"ban the bomb\\" demonstrators were yesterday expelled by Communist secret police after they had distributed leaflets in East Berlin. At her Brownshill, Stroud home Mrs Laurence Hislam, wife of one of the demonstrators told reporters that she had not heard of her husband's success in penetrating East Berlin \\"but they were expecting to get over the border and I thought they would creep in somehow\\" Gloucester Citizen, 15 April 1963 === Ban-bomb man goes bald as Hiroshima protest === Nuclear disarmament campaigner Laurence Hislam (54) had his head shaved bald today - the anniversary of the dropping of the atomic bomb on Hiroshima. He said \\"I have done this as an unavoidable reminder to other people that they implicitly or explicitly accept the possibility of the use of the hydrogen bomb\\" He is keeping his beard and moustache \\"If I had them off too there would be the danger of my friends not recognising me in the street\\" His wife and five children he said had \\"come to accept pretty well anything I do\\". After the shearing Mr Hislam went to Stroud Roman Catholic Church for meditation before walking the 5 miles home to Brownshill. Stroud News and Journal, 6 August 1963 === Mr. Hislam has the Yul Brynner === \\"To mark the guilt of Hiroshima Mr Hislam a ban-the-bomb campaigner had his head shaved to remind people of the horrors of the bomb. Yesterday, he and members of Stroud CND staged a fast to mark the anniversary.\\" Gloucester Citizen 7 August 1964 == Walk to Rome == In autumn 1962, Hislam made plans for a pilgrimage to Rome. He had high hopes for the Second Vatican Council which was due to open in October, as Pope John XXIII was known as a man of peace. He began the 1,200 mile walk from his home in Gloucestershire and was joined in London by a younger companion, Neil Snelders. Before they left London an interview by ITV was broadcast on the 6 pm news. They had very little money, although some support from PAX, relying on the charity of the church (not always forthcoming) for accommodation along the route. Hislam wore a placard (re-made in French and then Italian along the way) setting out their purpose and there were many instances of interest and generosity from members of the public as well as occasional hostility. Laurie wrote regular reports for Peace News and kept a diary, completed each evening. The first entry states his purpose: > \\"Pilgrimage from Stroud to Rome,via London with the intention of seeking a > Private Audience with Pope John XXlll asking him whether he does not think > the time has come when the scandal of Catholics and other Christians (not to > mention others not adhering to Christianity) preparing for nuclear war, and > supporting policies based upon the readiness to prosecute such a war, should > be condemned, and all individual Christians be instructed that by so doing > they are acting contrary to the teaching of Christ.\\" He left home 1 October and reached Rome on 1 December. There followed much frustration with Vatican bureaucrats as the Pope was not in good health. He remained in Rome until 23 December and despite many meetings with Archbishop Roberts and others he was not able to arrange a Private Audience. He put what he wanted to say in a letter, accompanied by a petition from PAX, and was assured that this had been \\"sent to the Pope\\". He hoped for a reply, which did not happen, and he was not fully convinced that his letter had actually reached Pope John. A note in his diary towards the end of his time in Rome encapsulates his feelings of frustration and his own very personal commitment: \\"It is impossible it seems to convey to anyone the fact that one is really serious in one's intentions. It is difficult for anyone to grasp the idea that one might actually sacrifice something to achieve a step towards peace. On 11 April 1963 Pope John XXIII issued his final papal encyclical Pacem in Terris (Peace on Earth), on nuclear non-proliferation but not the full condemnation of nuclear weapons that Laurie had hoped for. == Untimely death == Laurie Hislam was killed on 26 August 1966 in a car crash in France while driving his family home from holiday in Yugoslavia. The death of the \\"Ban the bomb marcher\\" was reported in the Gloucester Citizen, Western Daily Press, Stroud News and Journal, Cheltenham Echo, Daily Sketch, Bristol Evening Post and also mentioned on the BBC News. An obituary by David Stayt, of Gloucester CND, appeared in the Stroud News and Journal, Peace News and Sanity (CND). A 'Personal Comment', written by John Papworth for Peace News September 1966 gives his thoughts on Hislam's character: \\"Laurie was always ready to pursue an argument as far a it would go ‚Ä¶ his talk was dominated by his concern for peace ‚Ä¶. many highly individual attempts to jolt people into a flicker of awareness of the war peril.\\"Newspaper cuttings in Hislam family archive == References  External links == *A Nest of Anarchists *Farm Street Church *St Mary of the Angels Church, Brownshill *BRIEF HISTORY OF THE PPU - Peace Pledge Union *The Association for the UK Basque Children Category:1909 births Category:1966 deaths Category:British anti-war activists Category:British conscientious objectors ","title":"Laurie Hislam"},{"id":"56845750","text":"Pietro Correr (18 June 1707 - 4 September 1768) was an Italian politician and diplomat.

He was on the books of Wolverhampton Wanderers without playing league football for the club, and also played non-league football for clubs including Gresley Rovers, Chelmsford City, Bedford Town, Peterborough United, Kettering Town, Rugby Town and Hinckley Athletic, where he was player-manager. ==Life and career== Taft was born in Leicester in 1926. He served in the Army during the Second World War, and was playing football for Gresley Rovers when he caught the attention of First Division club Derby County. He was of powerful build, tall and weighing . After demobilisation, he signed professional forms in November 1947, and began his career playing for the reserve team in the Central League. He made his first-team debut in the league match away to Stoke City on 11 December 1948, deputising for Jack Stamps who failed a late fitness test, and scored the opening goal after 14 minutes, but Derby went on to lose 4‚Äì2. He returned to the team for the Christmas fixtures against reigning champions Arsenal, and created the goal with which Derby opened the scoring in a 2‚Äì1 win at the Baseball Ground: :Harrison gained possession and pushed the ball down his own wing to the wandering Taft, who, with a brilliant piece of foot jugglery, sold the dummy to Smith and whipped across a perfect centre. Broome was there to nod the ball home via the goalpost. Taft kept his place for a few weeks, a period that included Derby's first three matches in the 1948‚Äì49 FA Cup. The Star Green 'Un thought he played his best game for Derby in the fifth-round win against Cardiff City and had developed a good understanding with inside left Billy Steel. However, Stamps returned to the side, and Taft made no more first-team appearances. He was one of 33 professionals placed on Derby's retained list, but did not remain with the club for long. In July 1949, as part of a deal that took Wolves' Les Mynard to Derby and in the same week as he celebrated his wedding to Norma Allwood, Taft signed for Wolverhampton Wanderers as backup to Jesse Pye. He soon suffered a knee injury that required surgery, which deprived him of a chance to play for the first team when Pye was injured in January. When fit again, Taft was still unable to break into the first team, so he requested a transfer, and was listed at a fee reported as ¬£5,000. There was interest from Second Division clubs, but eventually Taft signed for a Southern League club, Chelmsford City. His season was soon disrupted by injury and the need for a second cartilage operation, but he stayed on for a second season. Ahead of the 1952‚Äì53 season, he was still on Wolves' retained list at a fee reported as ¬£10,000. He reportedly came close to signing for Biggleswade Town of the United Counties League, but instead joined another Southern League club, Bedford Town. Because Ronnie Rooke, the club's player-manager, was established at centre forward, Taft played at inside left for Bedford. He ended the season with 29 goals from 53 appearances in all competitions, 22 from 40 in the Southern League, as the team finished third. The club wanted him to stay on, but the directors wanted to reduce the wage bill, and Taft was one of several professionals to refuse the terms offered. He signed for Midland League club Peterborough United. He made a spectacular start: he scored in the opening fixture, then contributed five goals to a 9‚Äì1 win against Gainsborough Trinity, and a hat-trick in his sixth match, against York City's reserves, took his total to twelve in the first month of the season. His scoring rate slowed, but he finished the season as the Midland League's top scorer with 42 goals. He captained the team in the 1954‚Äì55 season, but his goalscoring deserted him, and he played much of the season at right half. He was given a free transfer at the end of the season, and returned to Southern League football with Kettering Town. A season later, he moved on to captain Rugby Town of the Birmingham & District League, and \\"served his side quietly and efficiently by nearly always being in the open space when the ball has come out his side of the centre. That he has not scored more goals is almost entirely due the fact that he favoured a berth well back to help the halves and the wingers.\\" He moved on to Hinckley Athletic as player-manager, a post he resigned in January 1959. Taft died in Derby in 1987 at the age of 61. ==References== Category:1926 births Category:1987 deaths Category:Sportspeople from Leicester Category:English footballers Category:Association football forwards Category:Derby County F.C. players Category:Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C. players Category:Chelmsford City F.C. players Category:Bedford Town F.C. players Category:Peterborough United F.C. players Category:Kettering Town F.C. players Category:Rugby Town F.C.

After earning a master's degree in public administration from the Fluminense Federal University, she served as a city councillor of the Municipal Chamber of Rio de Janeiro for the Socialism and Liberty Party (PSOL) from January 2017 until her death. On 14 March 2018, while in a car after delivering a speech, Franco and her driver were shot multiple times and killed by two murderers in another vehicle, north of Rio de Janeiro. Franco had been an outspoken critic of police brutality and extrajudicial killings, as well as the February 2018 federal intervention by Brazilian president Michel Temer in the state of Rio de Janeiro which resulted in the deployment of the army in police operations. In March 2019, two former police officers were arrested and charged with the murder of Marielle Franco. ==Early life== Franco was raised in Mar√©, a slum in northern Rio de Janeiro, where she also resided for most of her life, and began to work to contribute to the household income in 1990 when she was 11 years old. Marielle gave birth to her first and only child in 1998 when she was 19 years old. Franco raised her daughter without the father's help and worked as a pre-school teacher on a minimum wage. In 2004, Franco, who throughout her career fought for LGBT rights, started a romantic relationship with M√¥nica Ben√≠cio. In 2017, the couple decided to move in together in the Tijuca neighborhood with Luyara, Marielle's daughter. Their wedding was scheduled for the end of 2018.\\"Viuva de Marielle conta que vereadora estava despreocupada dias antes do assassinato\\". O Estado de S√£o Paulo. 18 March 2018. Accessed 23 May 2020. ==Education== In 2000, she began her pre-university studies. Following the death of a friend from a stray bullet in 2000, Franco began working in human rights activism. In 2002, she entered the Pontifical Catholic University of Rio de Janeiro on a scholarship and continued working and raising her daughter as she worked towards a degree in social sciences. She subsequently earned a master's degree in public administration from the Fluminense Federal University. Her master's thesis (titled \\"UPP: The Reduction of the Favela to Three Letters\\") concerns the law enforcement program to retake control of Rio's favelas from gangs. ==Political career== Marielle Franco in August 2016 Beginning in 2007, Franco worked as a consultant for the state representative Marcelo Freixo, and she coordinated the state legislature's Committee for the Defense of Human Rights and Citizenship. She also worked for civil society organizations, including the Brazil Foundation and the Mar√© Center for Solidarity Studies and Action. In 2016, Franco ran for a seat on the Rio de Janeiro city council in the municipal elections. As a black woman and single mother from the favelas, Franco positioned herself as a representative and defender of poor black women and people from the favelas. With over 46,500 votes, Franco was one of the 51 representatives elected, receiving the fifth highest vote total out of more than 1,500 candidates. As a city council member, Franco fought against gender violence, for reproductive rights, and for the rights of favela residents. She chaired the Women's Defense Commission and formed part of a four-person committee that monitored the federal intervention in Rio de Janeiro. Working with the Rio de Janeiro Lesbian Front, Franco presented a bill to create a day of lesbian visibility in Rio de Janeiro in August 2017, but the bill was defeated by a vote of 19-17. ==Final days and assassination== Vit√≥ria to honor the memory of Marielle Franco and Anderson Pedro Gomes. Protest in March 2019 calling for justice for Marielle against those who killed her On 13 March 2018, Franco spoke out on Twitter against the police violence in Rio de Janeiro: ‚ÄúAnother homicide of a young man that could be credited to the police. Matheus Melo was leaving church when he was killed. \\"How many others will have to die for this war to end?\\" () The next day, Franco attended a round-table discussion titled \\"Young Black Women Moving [Power] Structures\\" (). Less than two hours after leaving the round-table, she and her driver, Anderson Pedro Gomes, were fatally shot by two men who were driving another car. The men fired nine shots at them, four of which struck Franco ‚Äì three in the head and one in the neck. Franco's press officer was next to her in the back seat and was injured, but survived. Marcelo Freixo, a Rio de Janeiro legislative assembly member from PSOL who came to the scene shortly after hearing of her killing, determined that the bullets had been directed at her in a clear execution. According to the Rio de Janeiro police, the direction of the nine shots supports the hypothesis that Franco was assassinated. The bullets that killed Franco are from a batch bought by the federal police in Bras√≠lia in 2006; Minister of Public Security Raul Jungmann later said that they were stolen from a post office storage facility in Para√≠ba, but the ministry subsequently retracted this explanation after the Post Office publicly denied it. In January 2019, police arrested Ronald Paulo Alves Pereira and issued a warrant for Adriano Magalh√£es da N√≥brega, both suspects in Franco's assassination. Each suspect received honors from president Jair Bolsonaro's son Fl√°vio Bolsonaro in the early 2000s. N√≥brega's wife and mother were still being employed in Fl√°vio Bolsonaro's office in 2018. In March 2019, police arrested two suspects, former members of the military police allegedly tied to a vigilante militia, for the murder. Prior to their arrest, both suspects had pictures taken with now President Jair Bolsonaro, and one was his neighbor at a luxury apartment complex in Rio. In November 2019, a number of Brazilian media outlets reported that police was investigating possible ties of President Bolsonaro's second son, Carlos, to the case. === Reactions to assassination === Thousands took to the streets in coordinated protests across Brazil, and both Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch condemned her killing. Journalist Glenn Greenwald, whose husband David Miranda a fellow City Council member at the time of her assassination and was a close personal friend of Franco's, listed what he referred to as the \\"most important subjects to cover\\" regarding Franco's assassination stating: > Her relentless and brave activism against the most lawless police > battalions, her opposition to military intervention, and, most threateningly > of all, her growing power as a black, gay woman from the favela seeking not > to join Brazil‚Äôs power structure, but to subvert it. The double murder of Marielle and her driver Anderson was the subject of condemnation across the political spectrum in Brazil. All presidential candidates in Brazil during the 2018 campaign condemned the crime, except for now President Jair Bolsonaro, who repeatedly declined to comment on the case; his campaign alleged that his views on the subject would be too controversial, despite his being the campaign that most exploited security issues prior to election day. == Legacy == A digital art workshop was held in Nairobi, Kenya titled \\"Portraits of Marielle: Creating Bridges between Kenya and Brazil\\" with young Kenyan artists participating, and the artworks were displayed at the Museum Mare in Rio de Janeiro on 10 November 2018. Amnesty International included Franco's name in its campaign for those who wrote for human rights and lost their lives, while an update was made and an online tribute listed Franco among over 400 human rights advocates for women by the Association for Women's Rights in Development. ==Personal life== Franco identified as bisexual. In 2017, she moved to the Rio de Janeiro neighbourhood of Tijuca with her partner, M√¥nica Tereza Ben√≠cio, and her 18-year-old daughter, Luyara Santos. Marielle and M√¥nica had met at a trip with friends when they were 18 and 24 years old, respectively. They had been dating for 13 years, although the relationship had often been interrupted due to the non-acceptance of their families and friends. In these times, M√¥nica had relationships with other women and men and Marielle with other men. Franco and Ben√≠cio had been planning to marry in September 2018. ==See also== * List of assassinations ¬ß Brazil ==References * *, by The Guardian Category:1979 births Category:2018 deaths Category:Activists from Rio de Janeiro (city) Category:African-Brazilian women Category:Brazilian politicians of African descent Category:Assassinated Brazilian politicians Category:Brazilian feminists Category:Brazilian women in politics Category:LGBT politicians from Brazil Category:LGBT African Brazilians Category:African-Brazilian feminists Category:Municipal Chamber of Rio de Janeiro councillors Category:Pontifical Catholic University of Rio de Janeiro alumni Category:Socialism and Liberty Party politicians Category:Brazilian sociologists Category:Brazilian socialists Category:Bisexual politicians Category:Bisexual feminists Category:Police brutality in Brazil Category:Women critics Category:Female murder victims Category:Brazilian critics Category:Cultural critics Category:Anti-poverty advocates Category:Deaths by firearm in Brazil Category:LGBT socialists ","title":"Marielle Franco"},{"id":"56845913","text":"Kristy Stratton (born 26 January 1995) is an Australian rules footballer playing for the Collingwood Football Club in the AFL Women's (AFLW). ==State football== In 2014, Stratton won the Victorian Women's Football League (VWFL) Division 1 best and fairest, while playing at Knox. After rupturing her anterior cruciate ligament, she underwent a knee construction in 2015. This surgery and advice from the surgeon prompted her to give up athletics and focus on football. Stratton played for Box Hill Hawks in the VFL Women's (VFLW). In 2017, she only managed to play seven games due to tearing her lateral meniscus. ==AFL Women's career== Stratton was drafted by Collingwood with the club's fifth selection and the 21st overall in the 2017 AFL Women's draft. Joining Collingwood, she teamed-up with Melissa Kuys who captained her when they played for Box Hill Hawks. She made her debut in a 14-point win over the Brisbane at Moreton Bay Central Sports Complex in round 6 of the 2018 season. Collingwood re-signed Stratton for the 2019 season during the trade period in June 2018. Midway through the season, she suffered another injury, this time breaking her hand. In April 2019, Stratton re-committed to Collingwood for the 2020 season, along with Jordyn Allen, Emma Grant, and Sharni Layton. ==Personal life== Stratton is the younger sister of champion athlete Brooke Stratton. Both of them attended Caulfield Grammar School in Wheelers Hill, Victoria and were active athletes, with Brooke holding many records and Kristy holding the record for 80 metres hurdles in the under-14 category.

He made the Grand Tour in 1775-76 but passed most of it in sexual and hunting adventures. Like his parents and uncle 25 years earlier, he was painted by Pompeo Batoni in Rome, and later employed Humphry Repton to lay out the gardens to his country manor, Uppark. Sir Harry was a good friend of the Prince of Wales (later King George IV), who stayed at Uppark during the mid-1780s. He took the teenaged Emma Hamilton as a mistress to live with him at Uppark in 1780 and to entertain his guests at the many parties he hosted, but rejected her when she became pregnant with his child in 1781. A frequent guest at Uppark, Charles Greville, took her in as his mistress on condition that the child, Emma Carew, was fostered out.

Al-Jeel were impressed by him and Abdullah Darwish, the manager at the time, insisted on Adam participating in the team's training. Adam officially signed for Al-Jeel during the 2014 summer transfer window. ===Al-Jeel=== Abdulfattah ended his first season with Al-Jeel scoring 10 goals during the course of the 2014‚Äì15 season helping them to a sixth-placed finish. During his second season with the club, Adam ended the season with 21 goals in all competitions. He finished as the league's top scorer for the first time in his career. During his last season, the 2016‚Äì17 season, Abdulfattah Adam finished the season with 21 goals in 31 appearances in all competitions. He also finished the season as the league's top scorer for the second consecutive season. In the 2016‚Äì17 season Adam became the all-time leading goal scorer for Al-Jeel with his 50th goal for the club. ===Al-Hazem=== On May 18, 2017, Abdulfattah Adam left Al-Jeel and joined Al-Hazem on a free transfer. Adam started the season poorly and scored just once in his first eight games. However, his form soon began to improve scoring 7 goals in 8 appearances. He left the club during the 2018 winter transfer window and ended his time with Al-Hazem with 17 appearances and 8 goals. ===Al-Taawoun=== On January 28, 2018, Adam signed for Pro League side Al-Taawoun.

During a 4‚Äì0 win over Ohod, Adam scored his first hat trick in the Pro League on 14 February 2019. Adam started the King Cup semi-final match against Al-Hilal and scored the second goal in a 5‚Äì0 away win.

In 1267 he appears as primicerius of St Mark's Basilica and in 1275 as rector of San Maurizio. Another document of 1268 shows him to have been a canon in Verona. On the death of Tomaso Franco the relevant cathedral chapter was called upon to elect his successor as bishop of Castello, but it split between Correr's supporters and the backers of Bartolomeo I Querini, a cathedral canon and papal chaplain. The conflict continued and see remained vacant for a long time. Correr looked like winning it but eventually in 1274 pope Gregory X invalidated the election and unilaterally made Querini bishop. The anti-Correr faction in the chapter had probably fallen back on an old law that members of the chapter of St Mark's could not hold titles in the diocese of Castello - Correr was still primicerius and thus was technically still part of that chapter.http://www.treccani.it/enciclopedia/pietro- correr_res-520dc2a5-87eb-11dc-8e9d-0016357eee51_(Dizionario_Biografico)/ In 1274 he acquired some funds from Aldinello of Bassano and the following year he attacked Alidnello's son Pietro. The dispute lasted three years and the town council of Bassano had to intervene. Several other documents also show he was still acting as primicerius at this time. In summer 1286 he was elected Latin Patriarch of Constantinople, an honorary title since the Latin Empire had been dissolved after the Byzantine Empire's reconquest of the city in 1261. The Latin Empire had sent western clergy to replace Orthodox ones, but the former were expelled after the reconquest. Even so, the see technically continued, with a chapter of canons electing a patriarch. Correr's election was confirmed by Pope Honorius IV and he was consecrated by Latino Malabranca Orsini, bishop of Ostia. It is unclear if Correr remained in Venice or went east to run the patriarchate's remaining possessions of Crete and at Negroponte - it may have been the former, since on 10 January 1296 he was given some properties in San Pietro di Castello by Cecilia, wife of Matteo Belegno. Some sources name him Archbishop of Candia but this is an error, possibly arising from Pope Boniface VIII's union of that diocese with the patriarchate in 1302, which occurred after Correr's death. ==References== Category:1235 births Category:1302 deaths Category:Latin Patriarchs of Constantinople Pietro Category:13th-century Venetian people ","title":"Pietro Correr (patriarch)"},{"id":"56845980","text":"Noonthorangee located at 30¬∞57‚Ä≤50‚Ä≥S 142¬∞17‚Ä≤53‚Ä≥ is a remote civil parish of Mootwingee County in far North West New South Wales. ==Geography== Mootwingee County.The area includes the Noonthorangee Range.Map of Noonthorangee Range, NSW.

The brand's signature product is a one-piece swimsuit with long sleeves; the upper half of the suit resembling and functioning as a rashie. The suit provides its wearer with UPF50+ sun protection for their arms and back, and a zippered front offers a selectable amount of protection for the chest. The \\"Original Sexie Rashie\\" design attracted favourable review in major fashion publications including Vogue, Elle, Marie Claire, and Vanity Fair, and won Brown second place in the Queensland University of Technology's Bluebox annual innovation challenge for 2017. Brown later named the Huffington Post, London Times, and Vogue reviews as giving her a sense of validation. The suits are manufactured from a 4¬Ω times chlorine resistant Italian fabric and feature 28 pieces in their construction (compared to four in a typical rashie). This structure is intended to \\"flatter and conceal\\", as a reviewer in The Times put it. The design went through eleven iterations before being finalised and is manufactured in a wide range of sizes: (Australian) sizes 6 to 18. The broad range of sizes was a deliberate choice by Brown to make the product as accessible to as many women as practical, stating in an interview \\"It's not fair just because you aren't a size 8 or 10, you can't get access to beautiful products\\". Prior to founding UNE PIECE, Brown was a marketing manager for The Coca-Cola Company and Revlon in London, and a senior marketing manager for Uber in Australia. The idea for the UNE PIECE design came to Brown when she was holidaying in Europe. While undertaking market research for the product, she amassed a waiting list of over 500 buyers, convincing her of the product's viability. The initial production run sold out within a week of availability with future buyers facing a wait of over a month for the second run. She left her position at Uber to work full-time on UNE PIECE in July 2016. The \\"Original Sexie Rashie\\" design was later joined by two variations with back zips in place of the front zip: the \\"Surfe Sexie Rashie\\" with a higher neck, and the \\"Twist Sexie Rashie\\" with a low-cut neck and twist detailing on the front. UNE PIECE also manufactures a conventional, halterneck one-piece swimsuit based on their \\"Twist Sexie Rashie\\" design. == References  External links == * UNE PIECE website * UNE PIECE Instagram account * UNE PIECE Twitter account Category:Clothing brands of Australia Category:Australian companies established in 2016 Category:Retail companies established in 2016 Category:Clothing retailers of Australia Category:Companies based in Brisbane Category:Sportswear brands Category:Swimwear brands Category:Swimwear manufacturers ","title":"UNE PIECE"},{"id":"56846176","text":"Happy Accidents is a British pop punk band based in London, consisting of Rich Mandell (guitar and vocals) and Phoebe Cross (drums and vocals). ==History== Happy Accidents was formed in Southampton in 2013 by siblings Neil (bass) and Rich Mandell (guitar and vocals), and Phoebe Cross (drums and vocals).

It consisted of station buildings, outbuildings and goods sheds, as well as an extension with ancillary facilities. It became more congested with the opening of the Altenbeken‚ÄìKreiensen railway in 1865. Following the opening of the Brunswick‚ÄìBad Harzburg railway of the Duchy of Brunswick and the Vienenburg‚ÄìGoslar railway in 1866, new construction at the station began in 1886. Reliefs of the Brunswick Lion on the east side and a Prussian eagle on the west side reflect its joint use by Hanover and Brunswick‚Äîthe Kingdom of Hanover was located directly north and south. Master builder Richard Herzig had 35,000 yellow and red facing bricks and 110,000 common bricks delivered. Since the tracks divided Kreiensen into two areas, a pedestrian bridge was built. It was designed according to the construction principle of Max M√∂ller with fish-bellied support ribs at spans of 124 m and 58 m. In 1923, there was a rear-end collision between two trains travelling at night and 47 people were killed. In 1956, the world's first track-plan signal box was installed by Siemens. It was able to take over the tasks of three old mechanical signal boxes. Two dispatchers each served half of the station, which was only connected on the south side by three tracks. An electronic interlocking that was remotely controlled by the control centre in Hanover was put into operation on 13 November 2011. The platforms and canopies were renovated in 2014. == Entrance building== North side of the entrance building, around 1890 The entrance building was built for the Hanoverian Southern Railway to plans by Hubert Stier in 1886-89. This building from the Wilhelminist period is a brick building with facades covered by tiles. Other elements of shaped stone are found in arched profiles and cornices. Formal design tools are used sparingly on the facades. The cladding with ochre-coloured ceramic tiles is complemented with pillars covered with various terracotta reliefs. Plinths and cornices are made of sandstone. Due to its external monumentality, the building does not reflect the townscape, but instead stresses its importance as a railway junction. It contains a F√ºrstenzimmer (\\"prince's room\\"), which was the location of a meeting between Otto von Bismarck and Tsar Alexander III of Russia in 1889. It was due to be sold at auction by DB Station & Service in September 2016. == Operations== The operations include freight and passenger trains. The station is a railway junction. It is served mainly by Deutsche Bahn, NordWestBahn and Metronom Eisenbahngesellschaft. It is used in freight operations by the Ilmebahn for shunting. It is also the location of a bus station of the Verkehrsverbund S√ºd-Niedersachsen. {  !Line !Route !Operator - IC 26 (individual services) Munich Hbf ‚Äì W√ºrzburg Hbf ‚Äì Kassel-Wilhelmsh√∂he ‚Äì G√∂ttingen ‚Äì Kreiensen ‚Äì Hannover Hbf ‚Äì L√ºneburg ‚Äì Hamburg Hbf ‚Äì Hamburg-Altona DB Fernverkehr -  align=\\"center\\" RE 2 Uelzen ‚Äì Celle ‚Äì Hannover Hbf ‚Äì Kreiensen ‚Äì Northeim(Han) ‚Äì G√∂ttingen Metronom -  align=\\"center\\" RB 82 Bad Harzburg ‚Äì Goslar ‚Äì Langelsheim ‚Äì Seesen ‚Äì Kreiensen ‚Äì Northeim (Han) ‚Äì G√∂ttingen DB Regio Nord -  align=\\"center\\" RB 84 Kreiensen ‚Äì Holzminden ‚Äì Bad Driburg(Westf) ‚Äì Altenbeken (‚Äì Paderborn Hbf) NordWestBahn } In addition, a single train pair operated by DB Regio Nord runs via Bad Gandersheim, Seesen and Salzgitter-Bad to Brunswick Hbf in the morning. ==ReferencesFootnotes=Sources=== * * Category:Railway stations in Germany opened in 1854 Category:Railway stations in Lower Saxony Category:Buildings and structures in Northeim (district) Category:Einbeck ","title":"Kreiensen station"},{"id":"56846193","text":"Richard Leatherbee (born 8 April 1949) is a Chilean alpine skier.

His first works fit into the academic realism of the new century and have hints of an aesthetic trend called tremendismo which uses realism to shock. The most outstanding one is La cuesta de la vida (Museo del Prado) for which he won the second medal at the Exposici√≥n Nacional de Bellas Artes in 1910. In 1913 he travelled to Paris where he came into contact with futurism and although he wasn't a futurist in the strict sense, the influence of Marinetti, with whom he had an epistolary relationship, contributed to the evolution of his sculpture. When he obtained the position of sculpture and casting teacher, he was assigned to the Escuela de Artes y Oficios in A Coru√±a. He lived there for two years and then, in 1920 he was transferred to the Escola de la Llotja in Barcelona. He stayed there until 1934, when he established himself permanently as a teacher at the Escuela de Artes y Oficios in Madrid. === First contact with the avant-garde === In Barcelona, he approached the noucentisme and avant-garde artists, whose influence is shown in La escolar, for which he won the first prize at the National Competition of Sculpture in 1926. The Junta de Ampliaci√≥n de Estudios gave him a scholarship and in 1927 he travelled to Vienna in order to update the pedagogical methods of the teaching of sculpture. During these years he spent in Barcelona, he exhibited his works in various art galleries and with different groups, as for instance, the I Exposici√≥n de la Sociedad de Artistas Ib√©ricos, in which he presented two nudes influenced by primitive art, the Sal√≥ dels Evolucionistes, the Cercle Art√≠stic de Sant Lluc, and the Asociaci√≥n de Escultores and Amigos de las Artes Nuevas (ADLAN.), a group akin to surrealism founded in 1931 that had √Ångel Ferrant as a very active member. In 1936 he participated in the Exposici√≥n Logicofobista in Barcelona, which was part of the surrealistic trend. His student Eduald Serra was also involved in this exposition. During these years, Ferrant started his investigation about objects, trying out new artistic material within the aesthetic of the objet trouv√©. He also made contact with Alexander Calder, which had his Circo en miniatura exhibited by Amigos de las Nuevas Artes. === The Civil War and the Artistic Treasure Committee === When the war began, he signed the ‚ÄúManifiesto de la Alianza de Intelectuales Antifascistas para la Defensa de la Cultura‚Äù published in the La voz newspaper on July 30, 1936. On early 1937, √Ångel joined the Seizure, Protection and Rescue of the Artistic Treasure Committee which was set up on December 15, 1936, and had Roberto Fern√°ndez Balbuena as president and his brother Alejandro Ferrant as chairperson. One of his responsibilities as technical assistant was to organise photographic files from all Committee's works. He was also named provisional director of the Modern Art Museum around that time, since the former director Ricardo Guti√©rrez Abascal moved to Valencia, and president of the Artistic Treasure Section of the Central Board of the Archives, Libraries and Artistic Treasure. These were positions that could truly exercised since the museum remained closed and the Central Board was an empty superstructure. √Ångel was arrested in the Committee units by agents from the Servicio de Informaci√≥n Militar (Military Information Service) or SIM of the Ej√©rcito del Centro on May 27. The same agents which the night before arrested the architect Francisco Ordeig (responsible of the stores that the Junta de Incautaci√≥n had in the Church of San Francisco el Grande), one of his sons and also the public employees from the Committee and members of the National Republican Guard who were in charge of the custody of the art works that were there. There was an accusation on these members because of connivance with the enemy. All Ferrant brothers were released on May 30, after the intervention of Fern√°ndez Balbuena and other colleagues from the Committee. They warned about exaggerations and forced interpretations of declarations heard by confidants in the accusations made by officers of the brigade. Apparently, there was no other reason for that arrest but their friendship with Ordeig, who was finally judged in Barcelona one year later. √Ångel was appointed as spokesperson of the Committee that was in charge of the different town tours and seizures in the center of the area, among others. In January 1938, after Fern√°ndez Balbuena's designation as representative of the Direcci√≥n General de Bellas Artes in Madrid and deputy director of the Museo del Prado, √Ångel Ferrant was named president of the Artistic Treasure Board in Madrid. Its reticences to some officials from the Ministry requests and to the Fine Arts management were causing continuous arguments. √Ångel presented his resignation in March, but soon he canceled it because he was unwilling to move The Descent from the Cross, of Rogier van der Weyden, to Valencia. In April 1938 √Ångel Ferrant was asked to go to Barcelona, where he stayed until June leaving as responsible of the Committee Matilde L√≥pez Serrano, a Francoist agent of the SIPM (Servicio de Informaci√≥n y Polic√≠a Militar). On September 6 those in charge of the Ministry of Finance, to which the competences of the Artistic Treasure were transferred, proceeded to reshuffle the Committees, headed by the civil governors. Ferrant became the technical assistant and had no executive functions. ===Post-war=== After the war, Ferrant and his brother were sued by the Duke of Valencia, whose properties had been saved thanks to the Committee of Madrid. In April, after facing disciplinary proceedings, Ferrant filed an exculpatory statement, in which he explained his actions towards the Committee. In July, Pedro Muguruza, Commissioner-general of the Servicio de Defensa del Patrimonio Art√≠stico Nacional, submitted a report to the Military Tribunal of Officials explaining the Committee's role in the preservation of the patrimony in Madrid. After this dispute he retook the artistic creativity he had left during the war. In this context were highly significant the series of terracotta reliefs of Tauromaquia (Museo Nacional Centro de Arte Reina Sof√≠a, Madrid), dating from 1939, in which Ferrant returns to figurative art with a budget unconnected to the academic field. In 1943 he was commissioned by the architects Dur√°n de Cottes and L√≥pez Izquierdo in collaborating in a set of sculptures designed for the fa√ßade of the Teatro Alb√©niz in Madrid, as a reinterpretation of the fa√ßades of the Spanish Baroque architecture. His task was to sculpt eleven wooden statues, which by a simple crankshaft mechanism and a small motor would move their jointed parts (they would appear playing guitar, fanning themselves, moving their torso, etc.). The statues could be seen in the fa√ßade until 1983. That year they were exhibited and, from then onwards, they were kept in the theatre's foyer. For economic reasons, Ferrant took different orders, such as some of the reliefs of the Descubrimiento column in La R√°bida (Huelva), but he also started working again in objetos hallados - shells, stones, sticks - assembled in structures of ‚Äúnon-utilitarian expression‚Äù. In 1948 he met the German artist Mathias Goeritz and his Escuela de Altamira, which promoted working with stone or clay objects in which human figures would be outlined. Ferrant and Goeritz published Figuras del mar, a book with texts in German and drawings made by Ferrant. In 1949, he exhibited his m√≥viles, similar to Calder and his sculpture Est√°ticas. In 1960, Ferrant won the special sculpture award in the XXX Bienal of Valencia. == Notes == *Alix, Josefina (1985). Escultura Espa√±ola 1900/1936. Madrid, Ed.

Such platforms are typically online matchmakers or technology frameworks. By far the most common type are \\"transaction platforms\\", also known as \\"digital matchmakers\\". Examples of transaction platforms include Amazon, Airbnb, Uber, and Baidu. A second type is the \\"innovation platform\\", which provides a common technology framework upon which others can build, such as the many independent developers who work on Microsoft's platform. Forerunners to contemporary digital economic platforms can be found throughout history, especially in the second half of the 20th century. Yet it was only in the year 2000 that the \\"platform\\" metaphor started to be widely used to describe digital matchmakers and innovation platforms. Especially after the financial crises of 2008, companies operating with the new \\"platform business model\\" have swiftly come to control an increasing share of the world's overall economic activity, sometimes by disrupting traditional business. Examples include the decline of BlackBerry and Nokia due to competition from platform companies, the closing down of Blockbuster due to competition from the Netflix platform, or the many other brick and mortar retailers that have closed in part due to competition from Amazon and other online retailers. In 2013, platform expert Marshall Van Alstyne observed that three of the top five companies in the world used the platform business model.Emerce Keynote: Rise of the Platform and What it Means for Business, Amsterdam, The Netherlands, Nov. 26, 2013. However, traditional businesses need not always be harmed by platforms; they can even benefit by creating their own or making use of existing third-party platforms. According to a 2016 survey by Accenture \\"81% of executives say platform-based business models will be core to their growth strategy within three years.\\" In the year 2000 there were only a handful of large firms that could be described as platform companies. As of 2016, there were over 170 platform companies valued at US$1 billion or more. The creation and usage of digital platforms is also increasing in the government and NGO sectors. The rise of platforms has been met by a mixed response from commentators. Many have been enthusiastic, arguing that platforms can improve productivity, reduce costs, reduce inefficiencies in existing markets, help create entirely new markets, provide flexibility and accessibility for workers, and be especially helpful for less developed countries. Arguments against platforms include that they may worsen technological unemployment, that they contribute to the replacement of traditional jobs with precarious forms of employment that have much less labour protection, that they can worsen declining tax revenues, and that excessive use of platforms can be psychologically damaging and corrosive to communities. Since the early 2010s, the platform economy has been the subject of many reviews by academic groups and NGOs, by national governments and by transnational organisations like the EU. Early reviews were generally against the imposition of heavy regulation for the platform economy. Since 2016, and especially in 2017, some jurisdictions began to take a more interventionist approach. Platform Economy Visualization ==Platform definition== The 'platform' metaphor has long been used in a variety of ways. In the context of platform economy, 21st-century usage of the word platform sometimes refers solely to online matchmakers such as Uber, Airbnb, TaskRabbit etc. Academic work and some business books often use the term in a wider sense, to include non-digital matchmakers like a business park or a nightclub, and also to other entities whose function is not primarily to support transactions. Platform co- author Alex Moazed explains that ‚Äúplatforms don‚Äôt own the means of production, they create the means of connection.‚Äù Platforms scholars Professor Carliss Y. Baldwin and Dr C. Jason Woodard have offered a generalised definition of economic platforms where the focus was on the technical side of the platform: \\"a set of stable components that support variety and evolvability in a system by constraining the linkages among the other components\\". Woodard and Baldwin have stated that at a high level of abstraction, the architecture of all platforms is the same: a system partitioned into a set of core components with low variety and a complementary set of peripheral components with high variety. Others define it based on the ecosystem perspective where the focus was on the actors around the platform ecosystem (e.g., buyers, sellers). For more discussion of definitions, see the paper Digital Platforms: A Review and Future Directions ==The platform economy== Also known as the digital platform or online platform economy, the platform economy is economic (the buying, selling and sharing of goods and services Analysing and Quantifying the Platform Economy (2020). p.11 https://freetradeeuropa.eu/platform-economy- study ) and social activity facilitated by platforms. Such activity is wider than just commercial transactions, including for example online collaboration on projects such as Wikipedia. While scholarship on platforms sometimes includes discussion of non digital platforms, the term \\"platform economy\\" is often used in a sense that encompasses only online platforms. ===Relationship with similar digital economy terms=== \\"Platform economy\\" is one of a number of terms aiming to capture subsets of the overall economy which are now mediated by digital technology. The terms are used with diverse and sometimes overlapping meanings; some commentators use terms like \\"sharing economy\\" or \\"access economy\\" in such a broad sense they effectively mean the same thing. Other scholars and commentators do attempt to draw distinctions and use the various terms to delineate different parts of the wider digital economy. The term \\"platform economy\\" can be viewed as narrower in scope than \\"digital economy\\", but wider in scope than terms like \\"on demand economy\\", \\"sharing economy\\" or \\"gig economy\\". Several scholars have argued that \\"platform economy\\" is the preferable term for discussing several aspects of emergent digital phenomena in the early 21st century. Digital economy The term digital economy generally refers to all or nearly all economic activity relying on computers. As such it can be seen as having the widest scope; encompassing the platform economy, and also digital activities not mediated by actual platforms. For example, economic transactions completed solely by email, or exchanges over EDIs, some of which operate between only two companies so are too closed off to be considered platforms. Some scholars draw a distinction between platforms and earlier websites, excluding even sites such as Craigslist that are used to support economic transactions. Such sites can be considered outside the platform economy, not because they are too closed off, but as they are too open to be classed as platforms. On-demand economy The terms \\"On-demand\\" or access economy are sometimes used in a broad sense, to include all activity from transaction platforms, and much else. Some commentators, however, assign the access economy a narrower definition, so that it excludes platforms in the sharing economy. Even when sharing and on-demand platforms are distinguished in this way however, they are still both included in the wider \\"platform economy\\". Sharing economy The term sharing economy is also used with a wide range of scopes. According to Rachel Botsman, one of the prominent analysts of the sharing economy, the ‚Äòsharing economy‚Äô as a term has been incorrectly applied to ideas where there is just a model of matching supply with demand, but zero sharing and collaboration involved. There is a fundamental difference between platforms such as Deliveroo, Dashdoor which operates on the basis of meeting instant demand with a constant pool of labour and platforms like BlaBlaCar or Airbnb, which are genuinely built on the sharing of underused assets. So, mere delivery may not qualify as a sharing economy, but it is a mobile-driven version of point-to-point delivery. However, due to the positive connotations of the word \\"sharing\\", several platforms that don't involve sharing in the traditional sense of the word have still liked to define themselves as part of the sharing economy. Yet academic and some popular commentators define the sharing economy as only including activity that involves peer to peer transactions; in these narrow definition most of the platform economy is outside of the sharing economy. Gig economy The Gig economy refers to various forms of temporary work. The phrase is sometimes used with a broad scope, to include traditional offline temporary and contract work; in that sense, parts of the gig economy are outside the platform economy. In the narrow sense of the phrase, the gig economy refers solely to work mediated by online labour market platforms, for example PeoplePerHour. In this narrow sense, an important sub division is between local and remote gig work. Local gigs require the worker to be present in person as is the case for Uber or most TaskRabbit work. For remote work, also known as the \\"human cloud\\", tasks can be done anywhere in the world, as is generally the case with Mechanical Turk or the upwork platform. A 2017 study estimated that worldwide, about 70 million people have registered on the remote labour platforms. The global gig economy, in 2018, generated $204 billion in gross volume (with vehicle for hire services comprising 58% of this value), while this number is expected to grow to $455 billion in 2023.Mastercard and Kaiser Associates. Mastercard Gig Economy Industry Outlook and Needs Assessment. May 2019. Moreover, surveys yield that 5‚Äì9 per cent of adult Internet users in various European countries are involved in working through such platforms weekly, while annual growth rate of the gig platform users is forecasted to be 26 per cent. The word 'gig' in the term 'gig economy' is suggestive of short-term arrangements typical of a musical event. 'Gig' suggests an arrangement similar to musicians being booked for a gig at a particular venue. Such bookings typically have a specified time and won't be long term. As a result, there is no guarantee of repeat bookings, and sometimes no defined method of payment. Parallels exist between etymological meaning of the term related to the musicians‚Äô tasks and the gig economy. For example, gig jobs are classified as contingent work arrangements (in the US-context) rather than full-time or even hourly wage positions. Tasks in the gig economy have been characterized as short, temporary, precarious, and unpredictable. They can also increase accessibility, geographic, and social inclusion in the labour markets, and provide workers with a sense of autonomy. ==HistoryPre Internet era=== Businesses operating on some of the principles underpinning contemporary digital platforms have been in operation for millennia. For example, matchmakers who helped men and women find suitable marriage partners operated in China since at least 1100 BC. Grain exchanges from ancient Greece have been compared to contemporary transactional platforms, as have medieval fairs. Examples of innovation platforms also predate the internet era. Such as geographic regions famous for particular types of production, institutions like Harvard Business School, or the Wintel technology platform that became prominent in the 1980s. ===Post Internet=== The viability of large scale transaction platforms was vastly increased due to improvements in communication and connectedness brought about by the Internet. Online market platforms such as CraigslistSome commentators on the platform economy draw a distinction between \\"web 1.0\\" sites such as Craigslist and modern platforms, but generally Craigslist is included as a platform. and eBay were launched in the 1990s. Forerunners to modern social media and online collaboration platforms were also launched in the 1990s, For example Friends Reunited or Nupedia with more successful platforms such as Myspace and Wikipedia emerging in the early 2000s. After the financial crisis of 2007‚Äì08, new types of online platforms have risen to prominence, including asset-sharing platforms such as Airbnb, and labour market platforms such as TaskRabbit. ==Scholarship and etymology== According to the OED, the word \\"platform\\" has been used since the 16th century, both in the concrete sense to refer to a raised surface, and as a metaphor. However, it was only in the 1990s that the concept of economic platforms began to receive significant attention from academics. In the early 90s, such work tended to focus on innovation or product platforms, defined in a broad sense that did not focus on online activity. Even as late as 1998, there was little focus on transaction platforms, and according to professors David S. Evans and Richard L. Schmalensee, the platform business model as it would be understood in the 21st century was not then recognised by scholars. The first academic paper to address the platform business model and its application to digital matchmakers is said to be Platform Competition in Two- Sided Markets by Jean-Charles Rochet and Jean Tirole. While not published until 2003, the paper began circulating among academics in 2000. More recent academic work on platforms typically calls them 'multi-sided' rather than two sided, as some platforms have more than two distinct groups of users. See Evans(2016), Chap1. An early management research book on platforms was Platform Leadership: How Intel, Microsoft and Cisco Drive Industry Innovation, by Annabelle Gawer and Michael Cusumano (published in 2002). One of the academics most responsible for connecting those working in the emerging field of platform scholarship was professor Annabelle Gawer; in 2008 she held the first international conference on platforms at London. ==The platform business model== The platform business model involves profiting from a platform that allows two or more groups of users to interact. The model predates the internet; for example, a newspapers with a classified ads section effectively uses the platform business model. The emergence of digital technology has \\"turbocharged\\" the model, although it is by no means a sure path to success. While the most successful \\"born-social\\" firms can in just a few years achieve multibillion-dollar valuations, along with brand loyalty comparable to the largest traditional companies, most platform business start ups fail. Some companies are dedicated to the platform business model; for example, many so- called born-social startups. Other companies can operate their own platform(s) yet still run much of their business on more traditional models. A third set of firms may not run their own platform, but still have a platform strategy for utilising third-party platforms. According to a 2016 survey by Accenture, \\"81% of executives say platform-based business models will be core to their growth strategy within three years.\\" According to research published by McKinsey in 2019, 84% of traditional firms either owned their own platform or utilised one operated by a third party, while for born digital firms, only 5% lacked a platform strategy. Mckinsey found that firms with a platform presence - either their own or via a third party - enjoyed on average an almost 1.4% higher annual EBIT growth. Some of the principles governing the operations of matchmaking platforms differ sharply when compared with traditional business models. The selling of products or services is central to most traditional businesses, whereas for transaction platforms, connecting different groups of users is the key focus. For example, a traditional mini cab company sells taxi services, whereas a platform company might connect drivers with passengers. Another distinguishing feature of the platform business model is that it emphasises network effects, and the inter-dependence of demand between the different groups that use the platform. So with a platform business, it often makes sense to provide services free to one side of the platform, e.g. to the users of a social media service like Facebook. The cost of this subsidy is more than offset by the extra demand a large user base generates for the revenue generating side(s) of the platform (e.g. advertisers). According to authors Alex Moazed and Nicholas L. Johnson, BlackBerry Limited (formerly RIM) and Nokia lost massive market share to Apple and Google's Android in the early 2010s, as RIM and Nokia were acting as product companies in a world now best suited to platforms. As former Nokia CEO Stephen Elop wrote in 2011 \\"We‚Äôre not even fighting with the right weapons, ... The battle of devices has now become a war of ecosystems.\\" ==Creating a digital platform== Many books covering the platform economy devote chapters to the challenges involved in creating platforms: both for new platform startups, and for traditional organisations wishing to adopt a platform strategy. Some books are even dedicated just to certain aspects of operating a platform, such as nurturing ecosystems. The work involved in creating a platform can be broadly divided into elements relating to technical functionality and network effects; for many but not all platforms, a great deal of effort also needs to go into the cultivation of ecosystems. ===Technical functionality=== Developing the core technical functionality can sometimes be unexpectedly cheap. Courtney Boyd Myers wrote in 2013 that a platform with the core functionality of Twitter could be developed almost for free. A person who already had a laptop could take a $160 Ruby on Rails course, spend about 10 hours writing the code, and then host the Twitter clone on a free Web hosting service. A service that would have a chance of attracting a good user base, however, would need to be developed to at least the level of being a Minimum viable product (MVP). An MVP requires development well beyond a core set of technical functionality, for example, it needs to have a well-polished user experience layer. Boyd Meyers reported estimates that to develop an MVP for a platform like Twitter, the cost could range from $50,000 to $250,000, whereas for a platform needing more complex functionality such as Uber, the cost could range from $1 to $1.5 million. This was in 2013, considerably more has since been spent on technical development for the Uber platform. For other platforms, however, developing the needed technical functionality can be relatively easy. The more difficult task is to attract a large enough user base to ensure long term growth, in other words to create sufficient network effects. ===Network effects=== Platforms tend to be a strong beneficiary of network effects; phenomena that can act to increase the value of a platform to all participants as more people join. Sometimes it makes sense for a platform to treat different sides of their network differently. For example, a trading platform relies on both buyers and sellers, and if there is say a shortage of buyers compared to the number of sellers, it might make sense for the platform operator to subsidize buyers, at least temporarily. Perhaps with free access or even with rewards for choosing to use the platform. Sometimes the benefits of network effects can be overestimated, such as with the so-called \\"grab all the eyeballs fallacy\\", where a large audience is attracted to a platform, but there proves to be no profitable way to monetise it. ===Ecosystems=== In the context of digital platforms, ecosystems are collections of economic actors not controlled by the platform owner, yet who add value in ways that go beyond being a regular user. A common example is the community of independent developers who create applications for a platform, such as the many developers (both individuals and companies) that create apps for Facebook. With Microsoft, significant components of their ecosystem include not just developers, but computer and hardware peripheral manufactures, as well as maintenance and training providers. A traditional company embarking on a platform strategy has a head start in creating an ecosystem if they already have a list of partners, alliances and/or resellers. A startup company looking to grow an ecosystem might expose elements of its platform via publicly available APIs. Another approach is to have an easily accessible partnership sign up facility, with the offer of free or subsidised benefits for partners. Platform owners usually attempt to promote and support all significant actors in their ecosystems, though sometimes there is a competitive relationship between the owner and some of the companies in their ecosystem, very occasionally even a hostile one. ==Typology== Scholars have acknowledged platforms are challenging to categorise, due to their variety. A relatively common approach is to divide platforms into four types, based on the principle ways they add utility, rather than being concerned with which particular sectors they serve. These four types are transaction, innovation, integrated, and investment. Other ways to categorize digital platforms are discussed in Digital Platforms: A Review and Future Directions ===Transaction platforms=== Also known as two-sided markets, multisided markets, or digital match making firms, transaction platforms are by far the most common type of platform. These platforms often facilitate various forms of online buying and selling, though sometimes most or all transactions supported by the platform will be free of charge. ===Innovation platforms=== Innovation platforms provide a technological foundation, often including a set of common standards, upon which an ecosystem of third parties can develop complementary products and services to resell to consumers and other businesses. Examples of platform companies include Microsoft and Intel. Innovation platforms often stimulate ecosystem innovation. ===Integrated platforms=== Integrated platforms combine features of both transaction and innovation platforms. Apple, Google, and Alibaba have been classified as integrated platforms. Several integrated platform companies operating multiple discreet platforms and could also be described as \\"platform conglomerates\\", while some others are more integrated and derive synergies from combining innovation and transaction platforms. ===Investment platforms=== Investment platforms are companies that might not themselves operate a major platform, but which act as holding vehicles for other platform companies, or which invest in multiple platform businesses. An example is PLAT, the world's first platform business exchange-traded fund, launched by WisdomTree in May 2019. ==Global distribution, international development, and geostrategy== Platforms are sometimes studied through the lens of their differing distributions and impact across the world's geographic regions. Some early work speculated that the rise of the platform economy could be a new means by which the United States could maintain its hegemony. While the largest platform companies by market capitalisation remain US-based, platforms based in India and Asia are fast catching up, and several authors writing in 2016 and later took the opposite view, speculating that the platform economy will help accelerate a shift of economic power towards Asia. ===Africa=== An M-Pesa Agent in Tanzania. The M-Pesa platform provides a form of Financial inclusion for people without bank accounts. They can send and receive credit on cheap SMS mobile phones, then exchange the credit for cash or goods at numerous shops and kiosks, which are far more common than bank branches in much of Africa. Numerous successful platforms have been launched in Africa, several of which have been home grown. In the early 2010s, there were reports by journalists, academics and development workers that Africa has been leading the world in some platform related technologies, such as by \\"leapfrogging\\" traditional fixed line internet applications and going straight to developing mobile apps. In the field of mobile money for example, it was the success of Kenya's M-Pesa that brought the technology to global attention. It was Smart Communications that achieved the first launch of a formal mobile money system, which occurred in the Philippines in 2001, about 6 years before the launch of M-Pesa. But it wasn't until the success of mobile money in Africa that the technology received widespread global attention. There are unconfirmed reports that Africans invented mobile money independently, without knowing about the Philippines system. Similar systems have been introduced elsewhere in Africa, for example, m-Sente in Uganda. M-Pesa itself has expanded out of Africa to both Asia and Eastern Europe. The system allows people who only have cheap SMS capable mobile phones to send and receive money. This and similar platform services have been enthusiastically welcomed both by the end-users, and by development workers who have noted their life-enhancing effects. Ushahidi is another set of technologies developed in Africa and widely used on platforms to deliver various social benefits. While many platforms in Africa are accessible just by SMS, uptake of smartphones is also high, with the FT reporting in 2015 that mobile internet adoption is happening at double the global rate. Compared to other regions, there may have been less negative effects caused by platforms in Africa, as there has been less legacy economic infrastructure to disrupt, which also has provided an opportunity to build new systems from \\"ground zero\\". Though some legacy businesses have still been disrupted by the rise of platforms in Africa, with sometimes only the more productive firms being able to overcome barriers to adopting digital technologies. By 2017, some of the excitement concerning home grown platform technology and the wider Africa Rising narrative has cooled, in line with recent falls in commodity prices reducing the short term economic prospects for much of the continent. Yet optimism remains that the continent is heading in the right direction. A global survey identified 176 platform companies with a valuation over one billion dollars, yet only one was based in Africa. This was Naspers, which is headquartered in Cape Town, a city that also hosts many other smaller platform companies. A survey focused on smaller platforms based in Africa found few are either wholly foreign or indigenously owned, with most being a mixture. ===Asia=== The 2016 global survey found that Asia was home to the largest number of platform companies having a market capitalisation over $930bn. Asia had 82 such companies,64 were in China, 8 in India and 5 in Japan. The other 5 Asian platforms were split across Australia, Malaysia, Singapore and South Korea. though their combined market value was only $930bn, second to North America with market capitalization of $3,000bn. Much of Asia's platform companies are concentrated in hubs located in Bangalore and Hangzhou. More specifically, according to the 2016 regional survey, China significantly accounted for 73% of market cap while Northeast Asia, India, and ASEAN had 22%, 4%, and 1% respectively.Evans, P. C. (2016). The Rise of Asian Platforms: A Regional Survey. The Center for Global Enterprise. Within China, homegrown platforms tend to dominate across the whole platform economy, with most of the big American platforms being banned. eBay is allowed to trade in China, but has a relatively small market share compared to Chinese eCommerce platforms and was eventually shut down in 2006. In 2018, Tmall (Alibaba) took the majority proportion of e-commerce market share in China at 61.5%, followed by JD at 24.2%. Outside of China, Asian-based platforms have been enjoying rapid growth in areas relating to eCommerce, but not so much in social media and search. Facebook, for example, is the most popular social media platform even in India, a country with several large homegrown platforms, while in Myanmar, the New York Times described Facebook as \\"so dominant that to many people it is the internet itself.\\" In 2016, Northeast Asia that consists of Japan and Korea had 17 platform companies with collective market capitalization of $244bn; the top five platform companies and their origin were Softbank (Tokyo, Japan), Yahoo Japan (Tokyo, Japan), Nintendo (Tokyo, Japan), Naver (Seongnam, South Korea), and Rakuten (Tokyo, Japan). India had less platform companies than Northeast Asia. There were 9 major platform companies with collective market capitalization of $39bn and the biggest platforms were two e-commerce companies Flipkart and Snapdeal. The smallest number of market share went to Southeast Asia that was home to three platform companies Garena (Singapore), Grab (Malaysia), and GO-JEK (Indonesia) that collectively had market capitalization of $7bn. ===Europe=== Europe is home to a large number of platform companies, but most are quite small. In terms of platform companies that were valued over $1bn, Europe was found to have only 27 in the 2016 global survey. So far ahead of Africa and South America, but lagging well behind Asia and North America.. However, as of 2020 the German and French governments with backing from the European Commission are now pushing the idea of GAIA-XGAIA-X Home page, an integrated super-platform that would give the EU digital autonomy from the influence of large American and Chinese platform providers, sometimes described as an \\"Airbus for Cloud\\". ===North America=== Market capitalisation of platform companies grouped by region, based on 2015 data from the United Nations. The global tech landscape changes rapidly, and all comparative data here should be regarded as a historical snapshot. North America, in particular the United States, is home to the world's top 5 global platform companies Google, Amazon, Apple, Facebook, and IBM. A 2016 global survey of all platform companies with a market cap over $1bn, found 44 such companies headquartered in the San Francisco Bay Area alone, with those companies having a total value of $2.2 trillion 52% of the total worldwide value of such platform companies. Overall, the United States had 63 platform companies valued over $1bn, with Canada having one. While North America has less large platform companies than Asia, it is the clear leader in terms of overall market capitalisation, and in having platform companies with a global reach. ===South America=== According to data from early 2016, only three home grown platform companies with a market capitalisation greater than $1bn had emerged in South America: these are MercadoLibre, Despegar.com, and B2W. The continent is however home to many start up companies. In Brazil, the Portuguese language gives an advantage to home grown companies, with an especially active start up scene existing in S√£o Paolo. Argentina has been the most successful in creating platforms used outside its own borders, with the countries relatively small home market encouraging a more global outlook from its start up platform companies. With a high proportion of workers already employed on an informal basis, the platform-based gig economy has not grown as fast in South America as elsewhere. Though from a progressive perspective, scholars such as Adam Fishwick have noted that Latin America's tradition of worker organised activism may have valuable lessons for workers elsewhere seeking ways to mitigate the sometimes adverse effects of platforms on their economic security. ==Platforms by ownershipPrivate sector=== Most of the widely used platforms are owned by the private sector. In the 2016 GCE survey of platform companies valued over $1 billion, a total of 107 privately-owned companies were found, versus 69 public companies (public in the sense of being private sector, but publicly traded ). While more numerous, the privately- owned companies tended to be smaller, having a total market value of $300 billion, compared to $3,900 billion for the publicly traded companies. ===Public sector=== Some digital platforms are run by multilateral institutions, by national governments, and by local municipal bodies. ===NGO=== Over 90% of NGOs maintain a presence on the large privately owned social media platforms such as Facebook, with some also operating their own platforms. ===Platform cooperatism=== Platform cooperatism involves mutually owned platforms, being run \\"bottom up\\" by the people involved. Sometimes these platforms can effectively be competing for business with the privately owned platforms. In other cases, platform cooperatism seeks to help ordinary people have their say about political questions of the day, possibly supporting interaction with local government. ==Assessment== thumbFrancesca Bria, an early critic of the large privately-owned platforms, a proponent of platform cooperatism, and as of 2018, CTO for the city of Barcelona. With the increasing centrality of digital platforms to the global economy following the 2008 financial crisis, there was an intensification of interest in assessing their impact on society and the wider economy. Many hundreds of reviews have been carried out: some by individual scholars, others by groups of academics, some by think tanks bringing together folk from a range of backgrounds, and yet others overseen by governments and transnational organisations such as the EU. Many of these reviews focussed on the overall platform economy, others on narrower areas such as the gig economy or the psychological impact of social media platforms on individuals and communities. Much early assessment was highly positive, sometimes even taking a \\"utopian\\" view on the benefits of platforms. It's been argued and to some extent demonstrated that platforms can enhance the supply of services, improve productivity, reduce costs (e.g. by disintermediation), reduce inefficiencies in existing markets, help create entirely new markets, increase flexibility, and labour market accessibility for workers, and be especially helpful for less developed countries. Both the IMF and World Bank for example have suggested that it's the countries and industries that are quickest to adopt new platform technologies that achieve the fastest and most sustainable growth. Various arguments have been made against platforms. They include that platforms may contribute to technological unemployment. That they accelerate the replacement of traditional jobs with precarious forms of employment that have much less labour protection. That they may contribute to declining tax revenues. That excessive use of platforms can be psychologically damaging and corrosive to communities. That they can increase inequality. That they can reproduce patterns of racism. That platforms have a net negative impact on the environment. ===Post 2017 backlash=== Until 2017, most mainstream assessments of the platform economy were largely positive about its benefits to wider society. There were some exceptions; a forthcoming techlash had been predicted by Adrian Wooldridge as far back as 2013. Further hardening of attitudes towards platforms from some commentators and regulators had been detectable from at least early 2015. There had been a few highly critical views, e.g. from Evgeny Morozov, who in 2015 described most platforms as \\"parasitic: feeding off existing social and economic relations\\". Yet such negative assessments were rare, especially from prominent commentators who had the attention of policy makers. This began to change in 2017. Across the world, the larger privately-owned platforms were subject to increasing questioning about their expanding role and responsibilities. In the US, the Financial Times reported a marked change of attitudes towards online platforms across the American political spectrum, triggered by their \\"sheer size and power\\". Among U.S. Democrats, leaders of the large platform companies reportedly went from \\"heroes to pariahs\\" in just a few months. There has also been growing hostility towards the large platform companies from some members of the American right. High-profile figures such as Steve Bannon and Richard Spencer have argued for the break up of the large tech companies, and more mainstream Republicans were reported to be running for the 2018 congressional elections on anti big-tech tickets. 2017 also saw increased critical attention towards the larger platforms from both European and Chinese regulators. In the case of China where several of the larger US owned platforms were already banned, the focus was on their biggest home grown platforms, with commentators expressing concerns that they have become too powerful. Much recent criticism focusses on major platforms being too big; too powerful; anti competitive; damaging to democracy, such as with the Russian meddling in the 2016 election; and bad for users mental health. In December 2017 Facebook itself admitted passive consumption of social media could be harmful to mental health, though said active engagement can be helpful. In February 2018, Unilever, one of the world's leading spenders on advertising, threatened to pull adverts from digital platforms if they \\"create division, foster hate or fail to protect children.\\" Additional concerns have been raised due to the increasing role of AI. Some scientists argue that AI is a block-box and often lacks explainability. AI can operate as a black-box in which principles of conduct and end decisions may not have been predicted or perceived by the AI‚Äôs creators, let alone users. Therefore, core operations carried out by AI in platforms can be criticized as biased and exploitative. The following threads of platform exploitation can be discerned: exploitation arising from relationship between algorithms and platform workers, from behavioural psychology tactics adapted to algorithmic management, and from information asymmetries enabling ‚Äúsoft‚Äù control. Despite criticism from media figures and politicians, as of early 2018 the large privately owned platforms tended to remain \\"wildly popular\\" among ordinary consumers. After leading US platform companies revealed high Q1 revenue growth in late April 2018, the Financial Times reported they are untouched by the backlash, in a \\"stunning demonstration of their platform power\\". The techlash continued to gather momentum however. In January 2019 \\"techlash\\" was chosen as the digital word of the year by the American Dialect Society. Yet despite ongoing high profile criticism and legal actions, including CEOs of platform giants being grilled by legislatures on both sides of the Atlantic, the Daily Telegraph suggested in December 2019 that the techlash had largely failed to halt the growing power of platforms. Further criticism of the big platform companies continued into 2020. In February Mark Zuckerberg himself repeated his view that the big platform companies need further regulation from the state. By May 2020, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic the techlash was reported to have been put on hold. Following the widespread introduction of lockdowns across the world, platforms had been credited as having helped keep economies running and society connected, with polls showing the popularity of platform companies among the public had increased. Yet some commentators, for example Naomi Klein, remain concerned about the still growing power of platforms. Commentators are also looking at the issue of migration and the platform economy. Migrant workers make up a significant portion of those involved in the platform economy. While this offers them job opportunities, there are concerns that migrants can become stuck in low-paid jobs with little opportunity for promotion and without established social security safety nets. ==Regulation== During their early years, digital platforms tended to enjoy light regulation, sometimes benefiting from measures intended to help fledgling internet companies. The \\"inherently border-crossing\\" nature of platforms has made it challenging to regulate them, even when a desire has been there. Yet another difficulty has been lack of consensus about what exactly constitutes the platform economy. Critics have argued existing law was not designed to deal with platform based companies. They expressed concern about elements such as safety and hygiene standards, taxes, compliance, crime, protection of rights and interests, and fair competition.Deloitte. The rise of the platform economy. December, 2018. With many large platforms concentrated in China or the U.S., two contrasting approaches to regulation emerged. In the U.S., platforms have largely been left to develop free of state regulation. In China, while large platform companies like Tencent or Baidu are privately owned and in theory have much more freedom than SOEs, they are still tightly controlled, and also protected by the state against foreign competition, at least in their home market. As of 2017, there had been talk of a \\"third way\\" being developed in Europe, less Laissez-faire than the approach in the U.S., but less restrictive than the approach in China. Possibilities for Co- regulation, where public regulators and the platform companies themselves cooperative to design and enforce regulation, are also being explored. In March 2018, the EU published guidelines concerning the removal of illegal media from social media platforms, suggesting that if platform companies do not improve their self-regulation, new rules will come into effect at EU level before the end of the year. The OECD is looking at regulating platform work, while the European Commission has stated that with new forms of work must come modern and improved forms of protection, including for those working via online platforms. With this in mind, the European Commission is planning to launch a new initiative on improving the working conditions for platform workers. In parallel with this, the European Commission has proposed a reform initiative for an EU minimum wage. New and existing labour unions have begun to become increasingly involved in representing workers engaged in the labour market section of the platform economy. With remote platform work having created what is in effect a planetary labour market, an attempt to encourage suitable working conditions on a global scale is being undertaken by the Fairwork foundation. Fairwork are seeking to move towards mutually agreeable conditions with the co-operation of platform owners, workers, unions, and governments. ==See also== * Circular economy * Digital ecosystem * Platform evangelism * Two-sided market * Uberisation * Platform capitalism * List of gig economy companies ==NotesCitationsReferences== * * * Category:Economic systems Category:Business models Category:Information economy ","title":"Platform economy"},{"id":"56846328","text":"The men's 1000 metres at the 2003 Asian Winter Games was held on 5 February 2003 in Hachinohe, Aomori Prefecture, Japan. ==Schedule== All times are Japan Standard Time (UTC+09:00) {class = \\"\\" style=\\"text-align:center;\\" ! width=220Date ! width=50Time ! width=100Event -  Wednesday, 5 February 2003  10:30  bgcolor=ffffccFinal } == Records Results== { class=  !width=40Rank !width=40Pair !width=250Athlete !width=80Time !width=50Notes - 7 align=left 1:13.96 - 6 align=left 1:14.01 - 5 align=left 1:14.05 - 45 align=left 1:14.06 - 58 align=left 1:14.15 - 63 align=left 1:14.98 - 74 align=left 1:15.10 - 81 align=left 1:15.16 - 92 align=left 1:15.59 - 104 align=left 1:15.67 - 117 align=left 1:15.74 - 128 align=left 1:16.31 - 131 align=left 1:16.40 - 146 align=left 1:17.18 - 152 align=left 1:21.89 - 163 align=left 1:36.73 } ==References== *Results ==External links== *Schedule Men 1000 ","title":"Speed skating at the 2003 Asian Winter Games ‚Äì Men's 1000 metres"},{"id":"56846332","text":"Andrey Belokrinkin (born 26 November 1946) is a Soviet alpine skier.

The tower is also referred as a keep. It is a part of Old City and located on Kichik Gala street, in the city of Baku, in Azerbaijan. The building was also registered as a national architectural monument by the decision of the Cabinet of Ministers of the Republic of Azerbaijan dated August 2, 2001, No. 132. ==History== The tower was built in the 14th century. The towers were built as an integral part of the fortress wall while building defensive fortifications in Baku, to maintain the look, the strength of the fortress walls and to make the defense system even easier. According to writings of medieval authors, within 70 semicircular and northern fortress walls there was a quadrangular fortress-type tower. In the Middle Ages, either during the period of stability or in war, it was used as a weapon armory. The fortress-tower was built mainly for two purposes: controlling the area to further strengthen the northern part of Baku by forming a view of the fortress walls and to use the tower as a weapon storage. In 2014 substantial repair and restoration works were held on the tower by Old City State Historical- Architectural Reserve Department and after that it started to operate as Old City Traditional Art Center under the name of The Tower of Arts. ==Architectural features== The height of the tower is 16 m, the thickness of the walls is 2 meters. For rapid movement of soldiers, an underground path, which continued along the bottom of the wall, was directed towards the tower gate. This underground path surrounded the city by the northern side. ==Gallery== File:Caste of the Fortress of Baku.jpg File:D√∂rdbucaqlƒ± qala.jpg File:Presidium of Azerbaijan National Academy of Sciences.JPG File:Fortress of Baku Walls.jpg ==See also== *Old City (Baku) ==References== Category:Buildings and structures in Baku Category:Castles and fortresses in Azerbaijan Category:Buildings and structures completed in the 14th century Category:Monuments and memorials in Azerbaijan Category:Azerbaijani culture Category:Tourist attractions in Baku Category:Tourist attractions in Azerbaijan ","title":"Quadrangular Tower"},{"id":"56846587","text":"Dorin Munteanu (born 6 March 1946) is a Romanian alpine skier.

His work was instrumental in helping to pass the Connecticut Tidal Wetlands Act (1969) which prevented the loss of wetlands to dredge and filling activities. He also worked on ecological restoration efforts on wetlands in Connecticut and Long Island. He was an authority on vegetation management through controlled burns and herbicide application, which he researched and practiced at the Arboretum. From 1974 to 1977, Niering was a member of the advisory group, North Atlantic Regional Advisory Committee. He contributed to policy statements on urban parks as well as contributed to the planning process of the National Park Service. His scientific contributions spanned over many projects throughout his duration on the Regional Advisory Committee. One study in particular focused on the Pine Barrens of New Jersey. In 1978 Congress designated the Pine Barrens as the Pinelands National Preserve; this would not have been possible without the scientific knowledge of William Niering. In February 1980, the United States Department of the Interior awarded Dr. Niering the title of Honorary Park Ranger. This title came equipped with all the privileges and benefits of being a Park Ranger.Archival Records from the United States Department of the Interior, National Park Service, February 15th, 1980 Niering was the editor of the scientific journal Restoration Ecology from its beginning in 1993 until his death. == Death == William Niering died suddenly on August 30, 1999 at the age of 75. He had just addressed the incoming class of students at Connecticut College when he collapsed. On December 4, 2000, the Goshen Cove Natural Area Preserve in Waterford was renamed the William A. Niering Nature Preserve to honor his life and work. ==References== Category:1924 births Category:1999 deaths Category:American botanists Category:American ecologists Category:Connecticut College faculty ","title":"William Niering"},{"id":"56846701","text":"ATM Abdullah (Rony) is a Bengali Indian politician from the state of West Bengal.

(The Knock Out) is the eighth studio album by American singer M√Ωa. It is the follow‚Äìup to her Grammy nominated album Smoove Jones (2016) and was released April 20, 2018, on her label Planet 9 to commemorate the twentieth anniversary of her debut album M√Ωa (1998). Recorded between 2015‚Äì2016, T.K.O. is solely produced in its entirely by musician and producer Lamar \\"MyGuyMars\\" Edwards with additional production from Los Da Mystro, Lyle LeDuff, Hardwerk and Khirye Tyler. Sonically, T.K.O. is a contemporary R&B; album fusing elements of 1970s and 1990s R&B; with a more modern, contemporary sound and serves as departure from her previous studio effort Smoove Jones, which paid homage to traditional R&B; from the 1970s, '80s, and '90s. T.K.O. has spawned eight singles ‚Äì \\"Ready for Whatever\\", \\"Ready, Part II\\", \\"You Got Me\\", \\"Damage\\", \\"Knock You Out\\", \\"With You\\", \\"Down\\" and \\"Open\\". ==Background== As tradition, on February 14, 2016, M√Ωa released her seventh studio album Smoove Jones (2016) to commemorate the release of her debut single \\"It's All About Me\\" and eighteenth anniversary in the entertainment industry. The release paid homage to R&B;/soul/hip-hop with old school elements from the 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s and was released exclusively through Apple Music. Critically, Smoove Jones received \\"generally favourable\\" reviews from music critics. In 2017, Smoove Jones received a nomination for Best R&B; Album at the 59th Annual Grammy Awards, which were held on February 12, 2017. Two days later, as a gift to her fans and commemorating her nineteenth anniversary, M√Ωa released a music video for the fan favorite \\"Coolin'\\". Filmed in Sydney, Australia, director Matt Sharp captures the singer's unmistakable beauty while she lets her vocals do the rest on a sandy beach. Later in 2017, M√Ωa made a guest appearance on GoldLink's album At What Cost on the track \\"Roll Call\\". ==Artwork== For the album's packaging, M√Ωa traveled to Nassau, Bahamas and completed a photoshoot for her single and album covers. On the album cover, M√Ωa is dressed in black lingerie with a black robe draping her body, while directing a smoldering stare into the camera. ==Development== T.K.O. (The Knock Out) was recorded between 2015‚Äì2016 after the release of Smoove Jones (2016) which received a Grammy nomination for Best R&B; Album. Like with all her independent projects, Harrison served as executive producer for T.K.O. (The Knock Out) as well which entailed her scouting for producers, songwriters, arranging the album's track listing, and keeping track of the accounting. With T.K.O. though, Harrison decided to form a partnership with musician and producer Lamar \\"MyGuyMars\\" Edwards. Edwards had contributed production on her last studio effort, Smoove Jones, which catered more towards traditional R&B.; The creation process for T.K.O. started when Harrison continued to work with Edwards and formed a musical partnership. Speaking with Billboard, Harrison acknowledged the process to the project was \\"easy.\\" However, before dabbling into the contemporary R&B; space for her next independent project, Harrison made the conscious decision to release Smoove Jones first to satisfy longtime fans that connected with that particular sound, which is more eclectic, classic and old school. Musically with T.K.O., since contemporary R&B; is more current sonically, Harrison and Edwards just essentially incorporated and fused it with 90's R&B;, SWV, Aaliyah, R.Kelly, Mint Condition along with Prince, Teddy Pendergrass and The Isley Brothers influences from the 70s. Using material she recorded back in 2011, 2015, and 2016 from her archive, Harrison commented it was all about \\"building\\" and \\"tweaking\\" songs. Commenting on the results, Harrison said, \\"It was all about creating a nice experience for R&B; fans, R&B; lovers, and have it apply to today‚Äôs sound of music, sonically, and that‚Äôs what we did.\\" As executive producer, Harrison was held responsible for drafting all of her contracts, handling publishing split sheets, and generating her own revenue for/funding each component of a project and to avoid early leakage of the project or any of her music, Harrison drafts and services a pre- and post-recording agreement to hold the producers, writers, artists, and engineers liable for leakage, sharing, placement, and playing of her music. ==CompositionMusic and songs=== Described as Smoove Jones part two, T.K.O. serves as continuation on Harrison's last studio effort except with Smoove Jones, she blended R&B;/soul/hip-hop genre with elements of 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s and geared towards traditional R&B;, while T.K.O. is current contemporary R&B; with a hint of 90's R&B; and influences from the 70s. In terms of sounds, M√Ωa revealed early on that the album is very heavily leaning on R&B; slow jams. T.K.O. (The Knock Out) starts with \\"Open\\" featuring DMV rapper GoldLink and is describe as a slice of atmospheric trap-flavored R&B.; The pulsating, \\"Down\\" serves as the album's fourth track. Track five, \\"Ready For Whatever 2.0\\" is a reimagining of the album's first single and is an homage to Aaliyah's effortless cool. Inspired by Mint Condition and Prince, \\"Damage\\" was recorded back in 2011 and serves as the album's sixth track. Track eight, \\"You Got Me\\" is a millennial slow jam that blends combination of steady drums and synths reminiscent of the 90's R&B.; The spacey, \\"Knock You Out\\" is an Isley Brothers-indebted bedroom jam with guitar licks and spaced- out vocal harmonies and serves as the album's tenth track. The album's final track, the 80's/90's big ballad \\"If Tomorrow Never Comes\\" was originally recorded back in 2011 and inspired by the vocal work of R&B; group Jodeci. ==Release and promotion== Initially, T.K.O. (The Knock Out) was scheduled for a Valentine Day release to commemorate the twentieth anniversary of her debut single, \\"It's All About Me,\\" however the project was unable to make its deadline and pushed back. In an interview with Hot 97, M√Ωa confirmed T.K.O. was scheduled for an April 20, 2018 release to commemorate the twentieth anniversary of her debut album M√Ωa (1998). Digitally, the release was distributed through indie distribution company, The Orchard. Her first release under Sony Music company. Through her official website store, physical copies was made available for purchase exclusively in standard, autographed or personalized editions. In honor of her twentieth anniversary and to celebrate T.K.O.s album release M√Ωa performed at the House of Blues in New York City on April 27, 2018. She held a private album listening session at UnplugdLA's The Study in Los Angeles, California. ===Singles=== In September 2017, M√Ωa began releasing a series of singles in support of the album. M√Ωa released the first single from T.K.O.(The Knock Out), \\"Ready for Whatever\\" on September 22, 2017. A music video for \\"Ready for Whatever\\" was produced and directed by M√Ωa co- starring R&B; singer Kevin McCall as her love interest. Less than two months, its follow up single and sequel, \\"Ready, Part II\\" was released on November 24, 2017. The song paid homage to R. Kelly's \\"It Seems Like You're Ready\\". A third single, \\"You Got Me\\", was released on February 14, 2018, to commemorate the twentieth anniversary of her debut single \\"It's All About Me\\". \\"Damage\\", the fourth single from T.K.O. was released on March 23, 2018. Less than a month, a week before the album's release, \\"Knock You Out\\" was released as an instant grat download when fans pre-ordered T.K.O. (The Knock Out) alongside previous singles \\"You Got Me\\" and \\"Damage.\\" In 2019, as tradition in honor her debut single, Harrison gifted her fans with a new music video to commemorate the anniversary. \\"With You\\" was released February 14, 2019. Approximately two months later, in honor of the one year anniversary of her thirteenth studio project, TKO (The Knock Out), Harrison gifted her fans with another new video. \\"Down\\" was released April 20, 2019. ==ReceptionCritical=== Paper magazine gave T.K.O. a favorable review and called it \\"impressive in its scope\\" and concluded, \\"throughout TKO, though Mya is a well-studied product of her influences, she is as an artist all her own, producing, writing, and owning all of it.\\" ===Commercial=== T.K.O. (The Knock Out) debuted at number forty-one on the Independent Albums chart. ===Accolades=== { ! Organization ! Country ! Accolade ! Year !

She was born in China and raised in New York for the majority of her life. She attended Barnard College and Columbia University and earned a PhD in Economics from Columbia University in 1921, becoming the first Chinese woman in the United States to earn a PhD in Economics. She was a leader of the American Baptist Home Mission Society and established the First Chinese Baptist Church and the Chinese Community Center in New York City's Chinatown which were dedicated to social services for the immigrant community. She became a well- known figure in the women's suffrage movement and rode horseback in the 1912 New York pro-suffrage parade. In 1920 the Nineteenth Amendment began to prohibit the states and the federal government from denying the right to vote to citizens of the United States on the basis of sex. However, as an immigrant, Lee was unable to vote because of the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882, at least until the Magnuson Act in 1943. == Early life == Mabel Ping-Hua Lee was born on October 7, 1896 in Guangzhou during the Qing dynasty of China. Her father was Lee To or Lee Towe, a minister who emigrated to the United States and worked in the American Baptist Home Mission Society. He first served as a missionary to the Chinese community in Washington state in 1898 and then was appointed to minister at the Morning Star Mission in New York City, where he became a leading member in New York's Chinatown. Her mother's name is recorded in US census documents alternately as Lennick or Libreck Lee. A 1911 photo of The Young China Association headquarters flying the flag of the Chinese revolutionary movement in New York. Morning Star Mission is to the left. Lee spent her early childhood in China, attending a missionary school where she learned English. She was raised by her mother and grandmother while her father was in America. It has been reported she traveled with her mother to America in the summer of 1900 when she was four years old to reunite with her father. However, most articles, including a 1912 New-York Tribune article, made mention that she settled with her family in New York by 1905. She was also an only child but the same New-York Tribune article writes of a baby sister. Her family lived in a tenement at 53 Bayard Street in Chinatown. She attended New York City's public schools, specifically Erasmus Hall High School in Brooklyn, which was a school meant to accommodate the increase in immigrant children. === Education === In 1913, Lee began attending Barnard College where she majored in history and philosophy. She joined the Debating Club and Chinese Students' Association. In 1916, she ran for president of this student association against Tse-ven Soong, who later became finance minister of China's national government. She wrote articles for The Chinese Students‚Äô Monthly, in which she championed for woman's suffrage and argued for equality as necessary in a democracy. While at Barnard College, she also received a master's degree in educational administration. In 1917, Lee was admitted to Columbia University for a doctorate in economics. The Chinese government was impressed with her research in the agricultural economy and granted her a Boxer Indemnity Scholarship which allowed her to continue her studies. She became the first woman to win this scholarship. She was the vice president of the Columbia Chinese Club and became associate editor of The Chinese Students‚Äô Monthly. Lee graduated in 1921 or 1922 and earned the PhD in Economics from Columbia University in 1921. She was selected by the Board of Council of Columbia University as the University Scholar in Economics for her research work in agricultural economics. This was the first time a Chinese student was given this award. Her final dissertation was titled \\"The Economic History of China: With Special Reference to Agriculture\\" and was later published. Her thesis was the first agricultural economics text written by a foreign Chinese student and maintained a balanced view of western economic ideology and Chinese traditional economic thought within the context of modern agricultural reform. === Post-education === After her studies, Lee traveled to Europe in 1923 to study postwar economics. A local Baptist newspaper reported, \\"On March 28, 1923, Miss Lee sailed for France where she is now engaged in the study of European Economics, in fuller preparation for her life work, in her native land, China. A position of great trust and signal honor awaits her arrival in China.\\" Lee had numerous job opportunities including an offer from a Chinese firm interested in trade from the United States to China. She was also recruited for the Dean of Women students at the University of Amoy, now Xiamen University. However, after the sudden death of her father, she went back to New York City in 1924 to care for her mother. She was appointed by the American Baptist Home Mission Society to take on her father's duties and became chairman of the Morning Star Mission. Lee continued to travel to her homeland, eager to join the new generation of workers and help the people of China, but on her third trip to China in 1937, she decided otherwise. Racial and sexist discrimination were likely to reduce her chances of attaining her goals and it became unsafe to live in China with the Japanese invasion and the start of the Second Sino-Japanese War. These factors coupled with her familial and religious duties ultimately helped her decide to stay in New York. == Women's suffrage == Mabel Lee pictured in the April 13, 1912 New York Tribune Mabel Lee's early suffragist and nationalist consciousness was influenced by her father's religious and nationalistic views for China and by New York's liberal environment. Before she was writing essays advocating equality in The Chinese Students‚Äô Monthly, she was riding horseback as a teenager in the campaign for women's suffrage in New York state. On May 4, 1912, a sixteen year old Lee led a parade in support of women's voting rights with the likes of Annie Rensselaer Tinker, the Women's Political Union, and Anna Howard Shaw in New York. The parade grew a large crowd, up to ten thousand people were in attendance. Shaw carried a National American Woman Suffrage Association banner that stated: \\"N.A.W.S.A Catching Up with China\\" while Lee rode on horseback. She also led Chinese and Chinese-American women in a parade down Fifth Avenue in 1917 as a member of the Women's Political Equality League. In a 1914 issue of The Chinese Students' Monthly, Lee wrote that feminism is ‚Äúthe extension of democracy or social justice and equality of opportunities to women‚Äù. She continued to write articles throughout college, calling for gender equality but also began giving speeches. At the Suffrage Workshop in 1915, Lee gave a speech that was covered in the New York Times. The speech was titled \\"China's Submerged Half\\" and stated: A photograph of the 1912 suffragist parade, in which Lee participated. In 1917, women won the right to vote in the state of New York, amending the state's constitution. However, Lee herself was unable to exercise that constitutional right because of the discriminatory federal naturalization laws of the time. The Chinese Exclusion Act, which was not repealed until 1943, barred Chinese immigrants from the process of naturalization. While Lee fought for equality and the right to vote, she and other immigrant women, were unable to reap the benefits until years later. Her mother supported the suffrage movement but also could not vote. It is unclear if Lee ever voted or if she became a US citizen. According to the only directly-attributed quote from Lee in a 1912 New-York Tribune article about her, entitled Chinese Girl Wants Vote, Lee's definition of suffrage was framed in the context of its benefit to the family, specifically a husband. In a later essay, The Meaning of Woman Suffrage Lee authored and published in The Chinese students' monthly, while providing arguments in favor of suffrage for the \\"interest\\" of the race, community, woman herself, husband, and child, she articulated her definition of the feminist movement as follows. == Ministry == The First Chinese Baptist Church at 21 Pell Street, founded by Mabel Lee in 1926 When Mabel Lee's father died from a heart attack in 1924, she took over his role as head of the Baptist mission in Chinatown at the age of 28. Although this was meant to be a temporary position, it would become her life's work. Lee traveled three times to China during the 1920s and 1930s, and even had job offers awaiting her there, but she eventually chose to settle permanently in New York and focus on her father's church. Lee began raising funds from the American Baptist Home Mission Society and local Chinese American organizations to help fund a Chinese Christian Center in memory of her father. In 1926, she purchased a building for this community center at 21 Pell Street in Chinatown. The center offered English classes, a medical clinic, and a kindergarten. Lee believed that an independent Chinese church was crucial for providing support and a feeling of freedom to its community members, who were otherwise marginalized and oppressed in American society. Lee's view that there needed to be a Chinese Christianity and not a European American Protestantism sometimes brought her into conflict with the larger white-led Baptist mission in New York City. In 1954, Lee was able to secure the title of the 21 Pell Street property solely under First Chinese Baptist Church which from then on became fully independent. Paradoxically, this independence coincided with the increasing secularization of younger generations of Chinese Americans, and led to dwindling membership at the church. However, under her leadership the church became the first \\"self- supporting Chinese church in America.\\" As a bilingual Chinese-American, Lee was able to provide significant assistance to the working class Chinese immigrant community by providing classes teaching the English language, typewriting, and broadcasting and carpentry among other useful skills. Lee even participated by preaching and taught kindergarten and Sunday school. In many ways the church functioned as an underground social service center for the Chinese community. The First Chinese Baptist Church is still standing and continues to offer the social services Lee started and strives to maintain the community's civil rights she fought for. == Personal life and death == Mabel Lee never married and managed to maintain economic independence. This was a lifestyle only women with higher education could have had during Lee's lifetime. She never went back to her academic studies, even after friend Hu Shih suggested she continue her \\"scholastic and intellectual interests\\". Lee chose to dedicate her life to Christ and the Chinatown community until her death in 1966. She was 70 years old. == Legacy == In November 2017, a motion was introduced in Congress by Rep. Nydia Velazquez to rename the Chinatown Station U.S. Post Office at 6 Doyers Street in honor of Mabel Lee. The bill was passed in the U.S. House of Representatives in March 2018. There was a dedication ceremony at the First Chinese Baptist Church at 21 Pell St. on December 3, 2018 at 11am. In March 2018, Lee was honored as one of a featured series of women's suffrage activists displayed on LinkNYC kiosks in New York City as part of a partnership with the Museum of the City of New York. Lee was named a National Women's History Alliance honoree in 2020. == References  External links == * \\"Chinese Girl Wants Vote\\" - New York Tribune, April 13 1912 * \\"The Economic History of China: With Special Reference to Agriculture\\" at Google Books *Archival Photographs by Mabel Lee *\\"Asian American Legacy: Dr. Mabel Lee\\" by Timothy Tseng Category:1896 births Category:1966 deaths Category:American suffragists Category:Chinese Baptists Category:American Christian missionaries Category:Activists from New York City Category:Barnard College alumni Category:Columbia University alumni Category:Place of death missing Category:Qing dynasty emigrants to the United States Category:People from Guangzhou Category:American women activists Category:American civil rights activists Category:People from Chinatown, Manhattan Category:Erasmus Hall High School alumni Category:American people of Cantonese descent ","title":"Mabel Ping-Hua Lee"},{"id":"56846830","text":"Mauritius requires its residents to register their motor vehicles and display vehicle registration plates.http://www.worldlicenseplates.com/world/IN_MAUR.htmlhttp://www.plateshack.com/y2k/Mauritius/mauritiusy2k.htm { - !Image !First issued !Design !Slogan !Serial format !Serials issued !Notes - 150px       - } ==References== Mauritius Category:Transport in Mauritius Category:Mauritius-related lists ","title":"Vehicle registration plates of Mauritius"},{"id":"56846832","text":"The men's 5000 metres at the 2003 Asian Winter Games was held on 2 February 2003 in Hachinohe, Aomori Prefecture, Japan. ==Schedule== All times are Japan Standard Time (UTC+09:00) {class = \\"\\" style=\\"text-align:center;\\" ! width=220Date ! width=50Time ! width=100Event -  Sunday, 2 February 2003  11:15  bgcolor=ffffccFinal } == Records Results== { class=  !width=40Rank !width=40Pair !width=250Athlete !width=80Time !width=50Notes - 5 align=left 7:06.11 - 5 align=left 7:06.46 - 4 align=left 7:12.45 - 43 align=left 7:13.30 - 54 align=left 7:14.91 - 63 align=left 7:15.64 - 76 align=left 7:15.77 - 86 align=left 7:18.66 - 92 align=left 7:23.18 - 102 align=left 7:26.93 - 111 align=left 7:34.82 - 121 align=left 7:42.84 } ==References== *Results ==External links== *Schedule Men 5000 ","title":"Speed skating at the 2003 Asian Winter Games ‚Äì Men's 5000 metres"},{"id":"56846839","text":"Luitel or Luintel () is a surname found in Nepal and India.

The numbers, in relief, were assigned serially and the plates were made of metal, with the fasces as a seal. The colonial codes were: *ERITREA, later ER for Eritrea *SOMALIA, later SOM for Somalia *TRIPOLI for Tripolitania *CNA for Cyrenaica Between 1937 and 1941 there was an Italian governorate in Ethiopia and in those years a new type of Italian license plate was issued. They were exactly the same as the previous ones, but they had three squares on the left, colored top to bottom green, white and red, like the Italian flag, with the letters AOI (Africa Orientale Italiana) for Italian East Africa inside. The front plates resembled standard Italian front license plates, as these were smaller, and only sometimes had the colored squares like the rear license plates.http://www.targheetarghe.it/it-it/p/29/escursioni-esteri The abbreviations used to indicate the origin are: *AA for Addis Ababa *AM for Amara *ER for Eritrea *GS for Galla e Sidama *HA for Harrar *SC for Scio√† *SOM for Somalia ==References== Somalia Category:Transport in Somalia Category:Somalia-related lists ","title":"Vehicle registration plates of Somalia"},{"id":"56846920","text":"The Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids is an American non-profit membership organization that advocates in favor of reducing tobacco consumption.

From there he transitioned to mini-road racing on kart tracks and then to full sized tracks on a Honda RS125. He competed successfully for two seasons in the USGPRU (United States Grand Prix Racer's Union) finishing 3rd in points in 125GP in 2010. At the end of 2010 he was invited to the Red Bull MotoGP Rookies Cup try-outs for the 2011 season and was one of 12 selected from 100 applicants. Roberts spent 3 seasons (2011‚Äì2013) with the Red Bull Rookies. In his first season he recorded a win and a track record at Brno, a track he had never seen before. He improved his results in 2012 with best finishes of 2nd, 4th, 5th and was one of very few riders to be invited back for a 3rd year in 2013 to ride the new KTM Moto3 bike. Roberts showed good promise on the 4 stroke machine leading races in Jerez, Brno and Silverstone but some bad luck saw him fail to finish a number of races which lowered his final standing. That same year, just 6 days after his 16th birthday, he competed back in the US in the AMA aboard a Honda CBR600RR, recording a sensational double win at Barber Motorsports, setting a record for the youngest win in AMA Pro Road racing. He won again at Laguna Seca and scored another double win at Miller Motorsports Park, thereby scoring 5 wins from the 5 AMA races he entered. In 2014 he returned full-time to the US to ride for Team Hammer in AMA Daytona Sportbike on a Honda CBR600RR. However, the combination of an uncompetitive package and some injuries meant he wasn't able to continue his run of success from 2013. For 2015, Roberts returned to his winning ways aboard a Yamaha R6 in the new AMA/FIM MotoAmerica Stock600 class with 9 wins and a 2nd from 11 starts, sealing the championship at Laguna Seca, before the final round of the series at New Jersey, where he moved up to the Supersport class. There, he dominated practice and qualifying, had a runaway victory in Race 1 and finished a close second in Race 2. Finishing 3rd in Superprestigio in Las Vegas at the end of the year. 2016 saw him compete in AMA/MotoAmerica Supersport on a Yamaha R6 where he climbed the podium 3 times and scored 3 pole positions. He was unfortunately forced to miss several races due to injury. In 2017 Roberts returned to Europe to compete in the FIM CEV Moto2 class with the AGRteam. Mid-year due to his strong performance on the Kalex machine, he was invited by AGR to join the World Championship Moto2 team and made a sensational debut in Brno coming from 29th on the grid to finish 10th in his first race at the world level. In Roberts qualified on pole position at the opening round of the season, becoming the first American rider to do so since Ben Spies at the 2010 Indianapolis motorcycle Grand Prix and the first one in Moto2 since Kenny Noyes at the 2010 French motorcycle Grand Prix. He finished the race in fourth, after never having finished better than 13th over the previous two seasons. He would qualify for pole again in the fourth round and finished the race in third, becoming the first American driver on the podium since Spies at the 2011 Valencian Community motorcycle Grand Prix and the first in mid class since John Kocinski at the 1993 Dutch TT. ==Career statisticsGrand Prix motorcycle racing=== By season { style=text- align:right !Season !Class !Motorcycle !Team !Race !Win !Podium !Pole !FLap !Pts !Plcd - !

She has created multiple murals as part of the Philadelphia Mural Arts Program, many of them in poorer neighborhoods of Philadelphia. == Biography == Born in Colombia, Uribe grew up in Medell√≠n, Colombia. She took lessons in painting from Mariela Ochoa and Libe de Zulateg√ºi. After studying architecture at Universidad Pontificia Bolivariana, she moved to Philadelphia in 1973 to attend Moore College of Art and Design in the United States. After she graduated in 1977, Uribe spent time in the Andes. Uribe painted a mural, \\"Sunflowers, a Tribute to Aimee Willard,\\" in Hope Garden Park in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania in 1999. It is part of the City of Philadelphia Mural Arts Program. Another mural, on Fifth and Berks streets in Philadelphia is Tropical Landscape With Waterfall (1999). The mural includes a large waterfall, at the request of the community, who wanted the flowing water \\"to show how things were going to be cleaned up and get better.\\" Also in 1999, she exhibited \\"Tangled Paint\\" at the Salon des Amis Gallery. The Philadelphia Inquirer wrote that the pictures in the show together had \\"vigor, with an expressionist style as the vehicle for strong emotions and emphatic statements.\\" In 2006, The Philadelphia Inquirer listed her mural, Magic Wall (2006) as number three in a list of the city's best murals. Also in 2006, she collaborated with disabled consumers of JEVS Human Services in the Germantown neighborhood of Philadelphia to paint a mural titled \\"Ability to Fly\\", inspired by the style of Marc Chagall. The building where this mural was painted was destroyed by arson in 2009. In an interview for the Community College of Philadelphia, Uribe explains in Spanish that some of her mural art works have not survived due to fire or demolition. Uribe's mural, The Palm Tree, received a prize from the Philadelphia Green program, and is based on a garden located in Medell√≠n. Uribe was included with four other artists in the group show Colombians: Between Emotion, Nation and Imagination, at the Cambridge Multicultural Arts Center, curated by Shaari Neretin and Angela Perez Mejia in 2001 with the support of the David Rockefeller Center for Latin American Studies and the Colombian Consulate in Boston.

The jury found that UCLA discriminated against Pinter-Brown based on her gender and retaliated against her. The $13 million verdict was delivered in Judge Michael Linfield's courtroom on February 15, 2018, after approximately 14 days of trial. The jury found that Pinter-Brown deserved $3 million in lost earnings and $10 million in damages for emotional distress. Dr. Lauren Pinter-Brown started working at UCLA's medical center as the director of its lymphoma program in 2005. She received excellent peer reviews and awards throughout her tenure. Pinter-Brown began raising concerns about being harassed by a male colleague but was subsequently targeted in audits. She later had her research privileges suspended and her title damaged. According to court documents, UCLA made no significant efforts to fix the problem filing verbal and written complaints. Pinter-Brown was forced to ‚Äúplay dead‚Äù at work to avoid additional conflicts. She eventually resigned from her position in 2015. At trial, UCLA argued that Pinter-Brown mischaracterized the harassment, and contended the alleged conduct were her not getting along with the alleged harasser. UCLA further asserted that it properly handled her reports of harassment through the internal grievance process.

The service was launched in 2012 by six large Swedish banks, in cooperation with Bankgirot and the Central Bank of Sweden. It had 6.5 million users as of September 2018. Swish is a member of the European Mobile Payment Systems Association. The service works through a smartphone application, through which the user's phone number is connected to their bank account, and which makes it possible to transfer money in real time, a few seconds until confirmation is received by both parties. The user must have a second mobile application called Mobilt BankID S√§kerhetsapp, which is an electronic identification issued by several banks in Sweden. This requires that the user has a bank account in a Swedish bank participating in the system, and also a national ID number. Users who have a Swedish bank account but no suitable phone can register for reception of payments. The phone number can be of another country. The actual transfer is done by the Bankgirot clearing system, which developed instant payments for the Swish system. Swish was originally intended for transactions between individuals, but soon it started to be used for flea markets and collections at church services, and by sports clubs and other organisations as payment at small events where a credit card reader would be too expensive or otherwise impractical. Small companies who wished to avoid credit card charges and simplify online payments soon followed suit. In 2014 organisations could register for receiving payments, although some organisations used a private bank account of someone in the organisation before that. In January 2017 Swish was launched for web based sales which quickly became popular, for example used by the train operator SJ.4 miljoner betalningar p√• ett √•r ‚Äì Swish en succ√© f√∂r SJ 2018-03-28 It is possible to pay by scanning a QR code. Prior to the implementation of Swish, cash was the primary means for many of these types of real-time transactions. As such, Swish is used for transactions that used to be mostly cash-based. The service is free for private users since the start 2012. Companies and registered organisations pay around 1‚Äì3 SEK (depending on bank) per received payment in addition to a small yearly fee, and are not allowed to charge the customer for their Swish fee. The fees are decided by each bank for the reason of not limiting price competition, considering that Swish has a near monopoly on instant phone payments in Sweden. Since the minimum Swish payment (currently 1 SEK but depends on the bank) may be lower than the fee, an organisation may lose money if many small Swish payments are made to it.Dyrt f√∂r f√∂reningar att anv√§nda Swish; Translation:\\"It may be expensive for non-profit organisations to use Swish\\", Aftonbladet 2017-06-14 (In Swedish) In some cases of media attention towards such cases banks have donated their Swish profit to the organisations. ==See also== *BLIK is an equivalent system in Poland. *Vipps and MobilePay are similar systems in Norway and Denmark respectively.

Whereas his first marriage had been a happy one, he described his second wife in his will as one \\"whom without great grief and sorrow inconsolable I cannot remember, in regard of her exceeding unkindness and intolerable evil usage towards myself and my late good lord and father deceased\\". Dorset had complained about his second wife's \\"misconduct\\", and was considering a separation from her at the time of his death. However, Cecily, one of his daughters from his first marriage, married his stepson Henry Compton, by whom she had three children.G.E. Cokayne; with Vicary Gibbs, H.A. Doubleday, Geoffrey H.

It was built in 1878 as the main building of St. Michael's College, the predecessor of St. Michael's High School and the College of Santa Fe. The building is a contributing property in the Barrio De Analco Historic District and currently serves as the headquarters of the New Mexico Tourism Department. ==History== St. Michael's College was established at the behest of Archbishop Jean-Baptiste Lamy, who had arrived in New Mexico in 1851 to find that formal schooling in the territory was nonexistent. After establishing the Loretto Academy for girls in 1852, Lamy recruited the De La Salle Christian Brothers to open a similar school for boys, and St. Michael's held its first classes in the fall of 1859. In the 1870s, the school appointed a new leader, Brother Botulph, who oversaw its growth into an institution of higher learning. Under Botulph, St. Michael's began offering high school diplomas, and later, teaching certificates. In 1874 it received a charter from the territorial legislature, making it the oldest chartered college in New Mexico.Colleges and Universities, City of Santa Fe Economic Development The college eventually phased out its post-secondary courses but continued to operate as St. Michael's High School, while a new St. Michael's College was established at a separate campus in 1947. In 1877, Brother Botulph started a fundraising campaign to construct a new building for the school which netted sheep, goats, and cattle in addition to cash and building materials. Ground was broken on the building in April 1878 and it was ready for classes by November. The first two stories were constructed from adobe, while the third floor was wood-framed to save weight. In 1926, the wooden upper story was destroyed by a fire, reducing the building to its present two-story height. After this, it remained in use as a dormitory but was vacated when St. Michael's moved to a new campus in 1966. The building was sold to the state of New Mexico and renamed in honor of Archbishop Lamy; it now houses the New Mexico Tourism Department. It was remodeled in the Territorial Revival style in the 1950s, adding brick coping and a bellcote to the parapet. The building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places and New Mexico State Register of Cultural Properties in 1968 as a contributing property in the Barrio De Analco Historic District. with ==Architecture== In its present form, the building is a nearly symmetrical two-story adobe structure, in length by in width with a two-story Territorial Style portal or veranda wrapping around the north and east sides. The original wooden third floor had a mansard roof with evenly spaced dormer windows, a gambrel-roofed cross-gable above the main entrance, and a tall tower. After the fire in 1926, the building was truncated at the second floor with a flat roof. The present brick coping and bellcote were added during a 1950s remodeling. ==References Category:National Register of Historic Places in Santa Fe, New Mexico Category:School buildings on the National Register of Historic Places in New Mexico Category:Government buildings on the National Register of Historic Places in New Mexico Category:Education in Santa Fe, New Mexico Category:School buildings completed in 1878 Category:Government buildings completed in 1878 ","title":"Lamy Building"},{"id":"56847397","text":"Mitromorpha pleurotomoides is a species of sea snail, a marine gastropod mollusk in the family Mitromorphidae.MolluscaBase (2018).

The Union School was demolished in 1893, and this building was constructed in its place. The building was constructed for $12,000 by H. Heitsch, a local builder/contractor. It was designed to accommodate 320 students in eight classrooms, four per floor, for students in grades 1-8. An addition was constructed in 1917, designed to be compatible with the original building. A second, more contemporary addition was constructed in 1957. By the 1980s, the school housed the adult education and job placement program of the Pontiac School District. By the 2000s it was vacant. ==Description== Central School is a two-and-one-half story Richardsonian Romanesque brick structure situated on a small hill near Pontiac's central business district. The building is topped with a steeply-pitched hip roof with projecting side gables and hipped dormers. The main facade is dominated by a four-story, pyramid-roofed central projecting tower. The main entrance is located in the base of the tower. Secondary entrances are at the sides underneath the dormers. The 1917 addition continues the materials, scale and detailing of the original structure. ==References== Category:National Register of Historic Places in Oakland County, Michigan Category:Romanesque Revival architecture in Michigan Category:School buildings completed in 1893 ","title":"Central School (Pontiac, Michigan)"},{"id":"56847538","text":"Ferencv√°rosi Torna Club is a Hungarian professional football club based in Ferencv√°ros, Budapest.

The film follows Harris, an online dating man, who meets a woman with an unpredictable temperament. ==Plot== Harris is an average man who regularly uses an online dating service to seduce women into hookups and then proceeds to ghost them the next morning. On one such date, he meets Riley Miller. When Harris attempts, as usual, to leave before Riley wakes up the next morning, she wakes and tries persistently to get him to stay longer. Harris eventually talks his way into leaving. During the course of the following day, Riley repeatedly texts Harris at work, much to his annoyance. That night, he initially attempts to complete a project for work, but invites Riley over after she sends a nude image. They once again have sex, and she stays the night. The next morning, Harris wakes to a phone call from his job informing him that he missed an important presentation. Riley mentions she accidentally silenced his alarms hours ago and apologizes. Harris, upset, leaves in a hurry, trusting Riley to see herself out. At work, he manages to smooth things over with his boss Terri Webster, although she isn't pleased. As the day goes on, Riley continues to call and text Harris with apologies, although he ignores her. Upon returning home at the end of the day, Harris is shocked to discover Riley still in his apartment, cooking an apology dinner for him. He sends Riley home, but fails to express to her that he doesn't wish to see her again. He spends the rest of the night playing video games with a teenager online. Their trash-talk gets heated, causing the teenager to leave the game abruptly. Riley continues to call Harris throughout the night and he continues to ignore her. The next day, Harris hangs out with his friends at a bar. Eventually, Riley becomes the topic of conversation and Harris describes her as a lunatic who he slept with twice against his better judgement. Riley, who tracked Harris down via Facebook, overhears this, makes a scene, then storms out, indicating she doesn't want to see him again. The next day, Riley repeatedly tries to get in contact with Harris, threatening suicide if Harris doesn't \\"rescue\\" her. Harris goes to Riley's apartment, finding her seemingly dead on the floor. However, she reveals it was a prank. Harris is furious, shattering a mirror and storming out. The next day, Harris's boss informs him that his Twitter account was hacked, and he is fired as a result. The following day, the police arrest Harris after discovering child pornography on his computer that Harris was unaware of. Harris is convinced Riley is responsible for him getting fired and for downloading the child pornography onto his computer and realizes that a confession is likely the only way for him to avoid prison time. He goes to Riley's apartment, intending to get her to confess while recording their conversation. Riley apologizes for faking her suicide, but refuses to acknowledge hacking his Twitter account or downloading child pornography onto his computer. Harris, frustrated, gets violent, but leaves once Riley screams out for help. The following day, Riley files a restraining order against Harris. Harris, still determined to get Riley to confess, lures her away from her friends with a fake Facebook account, drugs her, then kidnaps her. He tries to get her to confess at knifepoint and she agrees, although seems confused as to what she's supposed to confess to. She convinces Harris to untie her so she can reapply makeup, pointing out that no one will believe a confession video if she looks disheveled. Once Harris unties her, she attacks him, eventually gaining the upper hand and striking his head repeatedly with a golf club, possibly killing him. Riley leaves into the parking lot but can't find a way past the parking lot's locked gates. She continues searching for an exit when she is suddenly murdered by Harris. After Riley dies, Harris is defeated, wondering why Riley refused to simply confess. He receives a call from his lawyer informing him that all charges have been dropped due to a confession by the teenager from Harris's online video game whom he'd insulted. As Harris processes this, a security guard discovers him and Riley's body and calls the police. ==Cast== * Jack Cutmore-Scott as Harris * Lili Simmons as Riley Miller * Brandon Scott as Chuck * Chase Williamson as Robby * Noureen DeWulf as Terri * Max Haaga as Shadowman * Kahyun Kim as Lydia * Christine Donlon as Rachel * Seth Morris as Ronald Dale * Eric Podnar as Brett * Trent Haaga as Officer Dean * Cynthia Rose Hall as Officer Rich * Clarissa van der Berg as Susan ==Release== The film was released on November 3, 2017. ==Reception== On Rotten Tomatoes the film holds a 100% among critics based on 8 reviews, with an average rating of 6.7/10.

Probably first century. Shams, also called or Shamsum or Dhat- Ba' dhanum, is a sun goddess of Arabian mythology. She was the patron goddess of the Himyarite Kingdom. Her name meant shining, Sun, or brilliant. She was the South Arabian equivalent of the North Arabian sun goddess Nuha. Prior to Islam, religion on the Arabian Peninsula focused on local gods, with every tribe and kingdom having their particular protective deities. However, there were also gods common for all Arabs, and the trinity of gods representing the Sun, the Moon and the planet Venus seem to have been worshipped throughout Arabia, though their names, gender and worship differed between regions. Thus, Nuha was the name of the sun goddess in Northern Arabia, while the name of the sun goddess in Southern Arabia was Shams. As Nuha, Shams was also worshipped in a trinity alongside the male gods of the Moon and Venus. In Saba', the sun goddess Shams was worshipped with the god of the planet Venus, Athtar, and Almaqah, the god of the Moon. In Hadhramaut, Shams was worshipped with Athtar and the moon god Syn. Shams was described as the spouse of Athtar. She was given votive offerings in the shape of horses. In Mesopotamia, Athtar was identified with the goddess Ishtar, and Shams with the sun god Shamash. ==See also== * List of solar deities ==References== * Encyclopedia of World Religions, Encyclopaedia Britannica, Inc., 2006 * Yoel Natan, Moon-o-theism, Volume I of II * Tenri Journal of Religion, Tenri University Press, 1975 Category:Arabian goddesses Category:Solar goddesses ","title":"Shams (deity)"},{"id":"56847718","text":"Bitch is a 2017 American dark comedy film written and directed by Marianna Palka. == Plot == Jill Hart, a stay-at-home mom in the L.A. suburbs, is at breaking point from stress, and from the lengthy work absence of her philandering husband Bill, Alone, she toys with and fails to commit suicide by hanging herself with a dog leash. Her state worstens, in parallel with being troubled by a mysterious dog that visits their garden much of the time, watching the house. Jill suffers a mental breakdown,and vanishes, leaving Bill torn between work and care of their four children. Initially fearing she has left or been abducted or harmed, the children find her feces smeared clothing and phone in the house after school, and later locate Jill in the basement where she has snapped and reverted to behaving like a dog. She snarls and barks at the family as they peer downstairs. Out of his depth and trying to maintain the appearance of normality, Bill seeks refuge in focusing on his work needs and minimising his engagement with his wife's condition. He is pressured by Jill's sister Beth to stop shirking and contact the family doctor, but focuses on his work stresses and on keeping the matter secret. He blames his wife for the change to their situation and for selfishly (as he sees it) placing extra work on him to support the family, and blames the doctor for suggesting she needs to be taken into psychiatric hospital care. He begins secretly drinking vodka from the bottle, flushes his wedding ring down the shower drain, neglects work and is fired, and his behaviour disconcerts and pushes away the children. Jill remains in the basement, her behaviour remains feral and aggressive in both bark and snarl. However, gradually Bill and Beth begin to open up to each other and he begins to work with her and support the children as a family, for the good of all. He buys dog toys for Jill, then gently suggests the children stop offering the toys to her, when their attempts to engage increase Jill's stress. The co-worker whom Bill had been having an affair with, visits Bills house. He sends her away but Beth is furious believing he invited her, and Jill, agitated, escapes, although they find her unharmed by the roadside. Later Beth reveals her family is filing legal papers for custody of her sister, and leaves. At an initial medical meeting, Bill believes the concern is his conduct rather than Jill's best interests, and begins to understand how selfish he had been to her, during their marriage. He sadly accepts medical help and Jill is sedated and removed to a hospital. Living with the children, he does chores, and cleans the basement. His wedding ring is found by a plumber, and he puts it back on. The family move house. His development as a caring parent continues and is reciprocated by the children. The relationship with Beth is healed. Jill comes home for the first time, the children staying with Beth. She still behaves like a dog but is much calmer. He takes Jill on all 4s to the local dog park to meet other dogs, and plays on all 4s himself to encourage her to play. Later that night, his attempt to help her by offering a shower triggers an aggressive relapse, and then results in Jill traumatically remembering herself. He holds her and talks reassuringly as she uncontrollably sobs. The next morning, in bed, she tentatively gives Bill her first real smile ==Cast== *Marianna Palka as Jill Hart *Jason Ritter as Bill Hart *Jaime King as Beth *Brighton Sharbino as Tiffany Hart *Rio Mangini as Max Hart *Jason Maybaum as Jed Hart *Kingston Foster as Cindy Hart *Sol Rodriguez as Annabelle *Arielle Kebbel as Cindy's teacher (name unknown) ==Release== The film was released on November 10, 2017. ==Reception== On review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 65% based on 37 reviews, and an average rating of 5.98/10.

She was one of the first women to make a living as a recording artist, and the first woman to run a record company. ==Biography== Mann was born on November 1, 1871 in Nashville, Tennessee, to Eugene and Maria Mann. She studied vocal performance with Tino Mattioli at the College of Music of Cincinnati in the early 1890s, gaining a certificate in 1893 and a diploma in 1894. She toured briefly as a soloist with Sousa's Band then moved to New York to sing for concerts and opera. At the time, New York was the center of a boom of independent record companies supplying musical records for phonographs and graphophones, which were just beginning to be sold for home listening (rather than phonograph parlors). In early 1898 she and her singing partner John C. Havens formed the Lyric Phonograph Company. The company showcased records of the Lyric Trio (of Mann, Havens, and bass William F. Hooley) singing opera, comic opera and concert solos, duets and trios. By September of the same year, the company had begun shipping records abroad, had begun recording other artists such as Joseph Weber and Jack Simonds, and had opened a branch office in San Francisco. The company moved to an expanded headquarters in early 1899 and added band, violin, organ, mandolin and other types of records to their catalog throughout the year. The Lyric Phonograph Co. was still advertising in Phonoscope through May 1900, but Harry Macdonough had replaced Havens as tenor and Grace Spencer had replaced Mann as soprano. The boom of independent phonograph companies had largely bust as Edison and Columbia streamlined and expanded record manufacture and regained control of this aspect of the industry. Mann recorded 13 disc sides for the Berliner and Zonophone companies in 1899 and 1900, then returned to touring, singing opera with Eugenia Mantelli's Grand Opera Company, and singing comic opera and vaudeville. Mann retired from performance \\"in her early thirties\\" (approximately 1905) according to her brother William, whom Jim Walsh interviewed in 1950 for an article in \\"Favorite Pioneer Recording Artists\\". She cared for her aging mother in Evansville, Indiana, then died decades later at her brother's house in the same town, though nothing is said about her life in the intervening years. 1898 portrait of the original Lyric Trio from Phonoscope ==See also== *Ada Jones *Minnie Emmett ==References== Category:American sopranos Category:19th-century American singers Category:20th-century American singers Category:20th-century American women singers Category:Pioneer recording artists Category:American music industry executives Category:1871 births Category:1947 deaths Category:19th-century women singers ","title":"Estella Louise Mann"},{"id":"56847732","text":"Aphonogelia is a rare neuropsychological condition with which a person cannot laugh audibly. ==References== Category:Neuropsychology Category:Laughter ","title":"Aphonogelia"},{"id":"56847746","text":"Adam White (c. 1627 ‚Äì 19 December 1708) was a Scottish Presbyterian minister imprisoned for non-conformity in Northern Ireland in the 1660s before being pardoned by King Charles II. ==Biography== White entered the University of Glasgow in the fourth class of 1645 and graduated in 1648 with a Master of Arts degree.[http://www.universitystory.gla.ac.uk/biography/?id=WH5756&type;=P University of Glasgow biography for Whytus, Adamus.

He remained until his death on 19 December 1708 and was buried in the churchyard. ==Excommunication, Imprisonment, and Appeal to Charles II== In 1664, White and three other ministers, John Hart of Monreagh, William Semple of Letterkenny, and Thomas Drummond of Ramelton, were summoned to appear before the Bishop of Raphoe's court to answer for their non-conformity. When they failed to appear, Bishop Leslie passed a sentence of excommunication against them and issued a Writ De Excommunicato Capiendo Act 1562. They were apprehended and imprisoned in Lifford gaol without bail. After a time the sheriff allowed them to move to a house in the town of Lifford where they were able to have guests, but they were still deprived of their freedom. They took various steps to secure their release, first contacting Thomas Butler, 6th Earl of Ossory who was the Deputy of Ireland and the son of the Duke of Ormond. When this failed, they procured a habeas corpus to have their matter decided at the King's Bench, but found no relief. They requested to be heard by the Court of the Chancery, however, the Archbishop of Dublin ordered their re-imprisonment in the gaol at Lifford. Finally, they sent a petition to Charles II who upon hearing that they had previously suffered for his cause and that their only crime was not appearing before the Bishop of Raphoe, wrote to the Lord Lieutenant of Ireland in October 1670 and ordered their immediate release. ==Children== Though the name of his wife is not known, Adam White is believed to have had at least three sons: George, Hugh, and Moses. George received a grant of land from his father in 1699 and is believed to have stayed in Scotland. Hugh was a Jacobite and took part in the Rising of 1715. He was captured at the Battle of Preston in Lancashire, England and transported to the American Colonies in 1716 as punishment for treason and levying war on the king. Moses went to America in 1722 with the wives and children of both brothers to reunite the families in Pennsylvania. ==Descendants== Though he never came to the New World, White is the ancestor of several prominent United States politicians and leaders. Some of these include: Hugh Lawson White, U.S. Senator;Sketches of western North Carolina, historical and biographical : illustrating principally the Revolutionary period of Mecklenburg, Rowan, Lincoln, and adjoining counties, accompanied with miscellaneous information, much of it never before published by Hunter, C. L. General James White, founder of Knoxville, Tennessee; Edward Douglass White Jr., United States Senator and the ninth Chief Justice of the United States; Edward Douglass White Sr., Governor of Louisiana; Stephen Decatur Miller, Governor of South Carolina; and Joseph Lanier Williams, United States Congressman from Tennessee.

At the age of 12 he was playing in bands, as he did throughout and even after his High School years. He worked for a construction company, which traveled to several different states, where he would form new bands. One job took him to California, where he met David Enos and joined the band Emerald. He recorded on the band's debut EP, Armed for Battle, and following its completion, moved on from the band. After finishing his stint with Emerald, he played a few shows with Holy Right before leaving that band. Martin then went on to play for Sanctuary Church's band ‚Äì Sanctuary Celebration Band ‚Äì for a brief time in 1986. Afterward, Martin was introduced to Doug Thieme, who started Sacrifice with Martin. The two brought in Thieme's friend Larry Farkas, who was in Deliverance. The three then began searching for a drummer and vocalist to play for the band. Originally, the three found Steve Bertram on Drums and Sharon on Vocals. Bertram left the band, and was replaced by Mike Betts of Neon Cross. However, Sharon and Betts both departed. The group then found Glen Mancaruso, who agreed to play for the band temporarily until they could find a more permanent drummer, and Glenn Rogers on guitars. The group wrote some material and were introduced to Vocalist Roger Martinez by Pastor Bob Beeman. Rogers left the band, but after writing a majority of the songs. With the lineup of Martin, Thieme, Farkas, Mancaruso and Martinez, the band now known as Vengeance Rising began recording their debut album, Human Sacrifice. The band toured around and signed to Medusa Records, which then got bought out by the Christian label, Intense Records, a subsidiary of Frontline Records. The band played several shows and got secular distribution and became respected by many metal bands. In 1990, the band recorded and released Once Dead. While supporting the album on the Once Dead Tour, the band members, including Martin, felt a disconnect with Martinez. After the tour finished, the four signed over all debts to Martinez, which he agreed to. The ordeal was documented in Heaven's Metal Magazine. Much drama followed after this, with Martinez blaming the members of the band as stealing from him and abandoning him with all the debt. Martin then joined Triple Ace, a ministry based biker band, which was a part of Bikers for Christ. Several months later, the four formed a project called Die Happy with former Joshua vocalist Robin Basuri and recorded a self-titled album, which was released in 1992. Martin departed from Die Happy in 1993, as he was moving to Nashville and started a ministry band called Pond Scum. Not much else was heard from Martin musically until 2004, when the four members of Vengeance attempted to do a reunion show with the band and Scott Waters of Ultimatum on vocals. The group were sued by Martinez, claiming he owned the rights to the name. Since the band could not play as Vengeance, they formed under the name of Once Dead and released a DVD titled Return With a Vengeance. However, by 2006, a three members of the band - Mancaruso, Waters and Martin - departed from the band. In August 2017, it was announced that Vengeance Rising would be reuniting for So Cal Metal Fest in honor of Dale Huffman, a radio show host of Metal Pulse Radio and writer at Untombed Zine. The band also re-released Human Sacrifice on vinyl for the 30th Anniversary of the album. Martin also had personal hand written notes within the 30 year pressing on the album. The band performed at the Festival with the original lineup, with Jim Settle (ex-Tantrum of the Muse, Hand of Fire) on vocals. The band, as this incarnation, are currently working on new material and have gained a record deal in the process. Later, it was announced, that the band would be going under the name of Once Dead, reviving their old project with Jim Settle and Roger Sampson (ex-Precious Death) on Vocals and Drums respectively.In 2019, it was announced that Emerald would reunite, with Martin being a part of the lineup once more. ==Personal life== Roger Dale Martin is an outspoken Christian. He has been described by reviews as having a fun presence and as a fantastic bass player. ==Bands== Current *Emerald (1984-1986, 2019-present) *Once Dead (2004-2006, 2018-present) *Vengeance Rising (1987‚Äì1990, 2004, 2017‚Äìpresent) Former *Holy Right (1986) *Sanctuary Celebration Band (1986) *Triple Ace (1990) *Die Happy (1990-1993) *Pond Scum (1994-1996) ==Discography== Emerald *Armed for Battle (1987) *Selah/Armed for Battle (2001) Vengeance Rising *Human Sacrifice (1988) *Vengeance (1988) *Hot Metal Summer II (1989) *Once Dead (1990) Die Happy *Die Happy (1992) Once Dead *Return with a Vengeance DVD (2005) *Return with a Vengeance: Live in Anaheim (2010) ==External links== *Roger Dale Martin on Discogs ==References== Category:Living people Category:American Christians Category:Thrash metal musicians Category:Christian metal musicians Category:Heavy metal musicians Category:Die Happy (band) members Category:Once Dead members Category:Year of birth missing (living people) ","title":"Roger Dale Martin"},{"id":"56847982","text":"Huigobio exilicauda is a species of cyprinid fish found in the Pearl River basin in China.

It was a single-engined parasol monoplane that was intended for use by civil training schools. Two examples were built, with the Japanese Military's control of resources preventing any further production. ==Design and development== In 1938, the Tachikawa Aircraft Company, which was building large numbers of its Ki-9 and Ki-17 basic and primary trainers for the Imperial Japanese Army, began work on a new training aircraft for use by civilian training schools. The aircraft, the Tachikawa R-38, was a single- engined parasol wing monoplane. It had a fabric-covered welded steel tube fuselage and a wood and metal wing. The student and instructor sat in separate tandem open cockpits. The first prototype was powered by a Gasuden Jimpu seven-cylinder radial engine driving a two-bladed propeller and made its first flight on 22 February 1939. The aircraft was tested by the Japanese Army, with the conclusion that the lighter R-38 was superior to the Army's Ki-17 primary trainer, which used the same engine. As the Ki-17 was already in production, however, the Army had no need for a new trainer. A second prototype, the R-38-Kai was built powered by an experimental Kosoku KO-4 four-cylinder air- cooled inline engine, produced by a subsidiary of Tachikawa. The R-38-Kai flew in July 1941. No production of the R-38 or the R-38-Kai followed. From 1938, all major Japanese aircraft companies were required to be licensed by the government, with the armed services controlling the management of the companies. As there was no military requirement for the R-38, the Japanese Army prevented any further production. ==Specifications (R-38) References== * * R-38, Tachikawa R-38 Category:Aircraft first flown in 1939 ","title":"Tachikawa R-38"},{"id":"56848170","text":"Kachankawal () is a rural municipality out of 7 rural municipalities of Jhapa District of Province No. 1 of Nepal.

Flying Pages Europe SARL, 2015. The prototype was built in the 1990s and exhibited it at PFA (now LAA) airshows. Although Diesel Air engines have been fitted to an AT-10 airship and to a Luscombe 8A monoplane, production numbers have been very limited. ==Design and development== The Dair 100 engine is a twin- cylinder two-stroke, opposed-piston, displacement, liquid-cooled, diesel engine direct drive design. It produces at 2500 rpm, with a compression ratio of 18:1. The engine has two cylinders and two crankshafts linked to four pistons, the combustion chamber formed between the crowns of the pistons. There are no poppet valves, each cylinder having a ring of ports at each end. In this \\"one-direction (uniflow)\\" engine these ports, respectively, admit air and expel exhaust gases. This design eliminates the need for a cylinder head and camshafts. Scavenging is assisted by a centrifugal air pump, the pump also serving to provide a mild supercharging effect. Fitment of an exhaust-driven turbocharger is permissible. The engine may use either diesel fuel (DERV) or Jet-A1 kerosene (AVTUR). Jet-A1 is more readily available at airfields, but its reduced lubricity (compared to diesel fuel) could mean that additional cylinder lubrication may be required. Fuel is directly injected into each cylinder, pressure being supplied by a hydraulically-governed mechanical fuel pump. Dry sump lubrication is by high pressure pump delivering oil to plain main bearings and con-rod bearings. ==Applications== *Advanced Airship Technologies Group AT-10 airship *Luscombe 8A ==Specifications (Dair 100) See also== *Zoche aero-diesel ==References * Category:Diesel Air aircraft engines Category:Two-stroke aircraft piston engines Category:Liquid-cooled aircraft piston engines Category:2010s aircraft piston engines ","title":"Diesel Air Dair 100"},{"id":"56848229","text":"Loizos Michael (; born 14 April 1990) is a Cypriot football defender who currently plays for P.O.

It had a gross registered tonnage of 554 tons. The vessel was specifically designed with capabilities to load and unload within a matter of hours. The vessel was built with economy in mind, ignoring artistic sensitivity. ==History== Margaret Olwill was constructed in 1887 by Henry D. Root of Cleveland, Ohio for L. P. Smith and J. A. Smith of Cleveland. The ship was named for the maiden name of the first wife of L. P. and J. A.'s father, Pat Smith who was the founder of the family business. It was built in the Smith brothers' yard in the old river bed of the Cuyahoga River. Her captain for the 1888 season was William H. Johnson. In 1890 Margaret Olwill was overhauled to run with a propeller. In 1892 her captain was P. J. Carr. It was re-purposed yet again in 1893 to be a steam barge. John Brown of St. Clair, Michigan, was assigned Margaret Olwills captain in 1894 at the age of 39. That year the Smiths signed an eight year contract to haul limestone quarried from Kelleys Island, Ohio to a project extending the west arm of Cleveland harbor's breakwater. The assigned crew largely drew from the circle of John Brown's friends and family. William Doyle, the fireman, was the brother of Brown's wife. George Heffron, the wheelsman, was a cousin of Mrs. Brown. Engineers Luke Cynski and Patrick Murphy were long-time family friends of the Browns. ==Shipwreck== Margaret Olwill's last voyage took place June 28, 1899, in which it was carrying limestone weighing 900 tons. Among the 12 or 13 individuals on board the ship were Captain Brown's wife and young son Blanchard. A close personal friend of Mrs. Brown's, Cora Hitchcock Hunt, had been invited aboard for what had been invariably a routine excursion. Also invited were Captain Brown's parents, but his father declined after viewing the vessel. Missing this particular voyage was chief engineer Murphy, who had just been reassigned to another vessel owned by the Smiths over the protestations of both Brown and Murphy. With the hatch filled to the coaming, the ship could haul 300 tons. For this voyage an additional 600 tons were placed on the deck. Although weather conditions were unfavorable and deteriorating, Captain Brown set course for Cleveland right at midnight. Soon after departure conditions included winds of 50 miles an hour. Seams opened in the ship's hull, and Margaret Olwill took on water, which mixed with the limestone causing a significant list. Brown attempted to pilot the ship to shelter in Lorain, Ohio, but the steering chains failed at about 4:30 am, and the ship became broadside to the waves. With knowledge that the ship was certain to be wrecked, Brown ordered those aboard into lifeboats. Before his order could be carried out, a rogue wave swept over Margaret Olwill and capsized the ship, which soon sank at approximately 6 am. Before he was tossed overboard, Luke Schinski had the presence of mind to grab a piece of canvas for assistance in rescue. Four of the crew were rescued by the steamer State of Ohio and the steamer Sacramento, who found the men clinging to the boat's wreckage. Smith, McLea, and Schinski had spotted the State of Ohio after several hours in the water, but the ship did not observe their wavings and hollerings, which greatly discouraged the men. However, the State of Ohio later found George Heffron and Duncan Coyle alive, clinging to a piece of the deckhouse amongst a large field of wreckage. The storm was still fierce, but ropes were thrown within reaching distance of both men. Coyle was able to tie the rope around his waist, but Heffron was too exhausted to grab onto the rope that was thrown to him, and slipped underwater as the State of Ohio's crew and passengers watched helplessly. The other group of three men renewed their frantic shoutings as they observed this rescue, but they remained yet undetected. Utterly discouraged, their hope was renewed when another ship was spotted by Schinski. This time they made the decision to coordinate their shouts, with the idea the sound would carry further. This was successful, as the Sacramento gave a whistle and turned around to rescue the sailors. The Sacramento was a much larger vessel, and had considerable difficulty maneuvering with sufficient accuracy to rescue the men. Another vessel, the Cascade, noticed the unusual movements of the Sacramento and supposed the Sacramento to be encountering difficulty. Drawing alongside, the Cascade was able to pick up the two men that the Sacramento had been unable to reach. Eight people died in the accident, including Captain Brown, his wife and son. The bodies of the deceased washed ashore east of Vermilion, Ohio. Much of the ship's wreckage beached at Cedar Point, Ohio and was sighted by John Brown's brother George Brown, who was captaining the steamer Arrow. Captain Brown had a reputation for following orders, thus historian Mark Thompson posits that Brown was obeying the ship's owners when he commenced the voyage, with ship overloaded and weather adverse. A contemporaneous insurance review supposed that Captain Brown, with long experience on Lake Erie, would not believe a small storm would become a major gale in June. ===List of crew and passengers=== * John C.

It has a cubic fluorite structure. It is the most stable form of praseodymium oxide at ambient temperature and pressure. == Properties and structure == Pr6O11 adopts a cubic fluorite crystal structure, measured by XRD, TEM and SEM methods. It can be considered an oxygen deficient form of praseodymium (IV) oxide (PrO2), with the Pr ions being in a mixed valency state Pr(III) and Pr(IV). This characteristic is what gives the oxide its many useful properties for its catalytic activity. == Synthesis == Praseodymium oxide nanoparticles are generally produced via solid-state methods such as thermolysis, molten salt method, calcination or precipitation. Practically all processes, however, contain a calcination step in order to obtain a crystalline Pr6O11 nanoparticles. === Calcination === Typically, praseodymium nitrate Pr(NO3)3¬∑6H2O or praseodymium hydroxide Pr(OH)3 is heated at high temperatures (usually above 500 ¬∞C) under air to give praseodymium (III,IV) oxide. While less common, synthesis from other organic precursors such as praseodymium acetate, oxalate and malonate have also been reported in literature. The physical properties of the prepared nanoparticles such as particle shape or lattice parameter depend strongly on the conditions of calcination, such as the temperature or duration, as well as the different preparation methods (calcination, sol-gel, precipitation, for example). As a result, many synthesis routes have been explored to obtain the precise morphology desired. == Uses == Praseodymium (III,IV) oxide has a number of potential applications in chemical catalysis, and is often used in conjunction with a promoter such as sodium or gold to improve its catalytic performance. === Oxidative coupling of methane === Sodium or lithium promoted praseodymium (III,IV) oxide displays good conversion rate of methane with a good selectivity towards ethane and ethene as opposed to unwanted byproducts such as carbon dioxide. While the precise mechanism for this reaction is still under debate, it has been proposed that typically, methane is activated to a methyl radical by oxygen on the surface of the catalyst which combines to form ethane. Ethene is then formed by reduction of ethane either by the catalyst or spontaneously. The multiple oxidation states of Pr(III) and Pr(IV) allows rapid regeneration of the active catalyst species involving a peroxide anion O22-. This reaction is of particular interest as it enables the conversion of abundant methane gas (composing up to 60% of natural gas) into higher order hydrocarbons, which provide more applications. As a result, the oxidative coupling of methane is an economically desirable process. === CO oxidation === In the proposed mechanism for Pr6O11-catalysed oxidation of CO to CO2, CO first binds to the catalyst surface to create a bidentate carbonate then converted to a monodentate carbonate species which can now decompose as CO2, completing the catalyst cycle. The conversion of a bidentate carbonate to a monodentate species leaves an oxygen vacancy on the catalyst surface which can quickly be filled due to the high oxygen mobility deriving from the mixed oxidation states of Pr centres. This proposed mechanism is presented schematically below, adapted from Borchert, et. al. Praseodymium oxide- catalyzed CO oxidation mechanism Addition of gold promoters to the catalyst may significantly lower the reaction temperature from 550 ¬∞C to 140 ¬∞C, but the mechanism is yet to be discovered. It is believed that there is a certain synergistic effect between gold and praseodymium (III,IV) oxide species. The interest in CO oxidation lies in its ability to convert toxic CO gas to non- toxic CO2 and has applications in car exhaust, for example, which emits CO. Pr6O11 is also used in conjunction with other additives such as silica or zircon to produce pigments for use in ceramics and glass == References == Category:Praseodymium compounds Category:Oxides ","title":"Praseodymium(III,IV) oxide"},{"id":"56848316","text":"Tsamma juice ( ) is a brand of watermelon juice, produced by Frey Farms since 2014.

V√©fa de Bellaing (Nantes: Ouest √âditions, 1992), pp. 114‚Äì117. ==Life== Haudebert was born in Foug√®res, D√©partement Ille-et-Vilaine, Brittany. He received his first music lessons at age 5 from the local organist at the Catholic church of Saint L√©onard and was able to play his first Bach prelude at age 7. He studied philosophy at a college in Laval and subsequently received a degree in business studies (Dipl√¥me des Hautes √âtudes Commerciales), following his father's wishes. He spent his military service at Vitr√© until September 1900. Musically largely self-taught, against his parents' wishes he then went to Paris where he made the acquaintance of Gabriel Faur√©, then organist at the Eglise de la Madeleine, and received private lessons from him, cut short by his suffering from anemia. Roman Catholic himself, he married his Protestant wife Mary (1879‚Äì1958) in Paris in 1907, a poet who often provided the words for Haudebert's songs and choral pieces. He participated in World War I, leaving the army as lieutenant. He spent his life mainly in Paris where he died. ==Music== The strength of Haudebert's music lay in his melodic inventiveness and his music's \\"singability\\". Although he created a large oeuvre of orchestral and chamber music, his vocal and choral music are regarded as his main achievement. His greatest success was the oratorio Dieu vainqueur for vocal soloists, mixed chorus, organ and orchestra, given with 600 participants in December 1927 at Mannheim, Germany. Harmonically conservative, he wrote in a late Romantic style, often coloured by Breton folk music, particularly in his instrumental music. He was a member of the short- lived Association des Compositeurs Bretons and often participated in Breton cultural events in Paris. He was awarded the Prix Paul Dukas in 1945. He was a personal friend of a number of other Breton composers as well as of composers Ernest Bloch and Swan Hennessy and the writer Romain Rolland. ==Selected worksVocal music=== * La Rose et les papillons (1898), song * Dieu vainqueur, Op. 15 (1916) for soli, chorus, organ, orchestra * Dans la maison (1921), songs * Huit chants intimes (1921), songs * √âglogue (1921, pub. 1922), for voice, flute, piano * Geths√©mani (1921, pub. 1922), for voice, violin, organ * Ma lande au grand soleil (1923) for choir * Le Cahier d'Elisabeth (1924), songs * Chant de P√¢ques, Op. 23 (1925) for soli, chorus, organ, orchestra * Trois √âvocations (1925) for voice, flute, string quartet * Nativit√©, Op. 25 (1926) for soli, chorus, organ, piano * Ode √† la musique, Op. 28 (1927) for female choir and orchestra * Mo√Øse, Op. 29 (1928) for baritone solo, choir, orchestra * Requiem, Op. 31 (n. d., unpublished) for soli, chorus, organ, orchestra * Ubi caritas (1934) for two voices and organ * Chants fun√®bres, Op. 45 (1934), songs * Chants spirituelles, Op. 42 (1936), songs * Cantique √† sainte Th√©r√®se, Op. 47 (1939) for voice and piano or organ * Nocturne √ât√©, Op. 57 (1943), song * Te Deum, Op. 59 (1948) for soli, chorus, organ, orchestra ===Orchestral music=== * La Sacrifice d'Abraham, Op. 11, symphonic poem (pub. 1921) * La Fille de Jepht√©, Op. 27 (1926), symphonic poem * Symphonie bretonne, Op. 44 (1936) * La Reve inachev√©, Op. 49 (1937), incidental music * Saint Louis, Op. 50 (1938), incidental music * Voyages en Bretagne. 9 Pi√®ces symphoniques, Op. 55 (n. d.) * Po√®me celtique, Op. 56 (1943) for violin and orchestra * Jeanne d'Arc de Domr√©my, Op. 58 (1944), incidental music * Rapsodie celtique, Op. 64 (1956) for wind orchestra ===Chamber music=== * Bienvenue √† Claudie, Op. 9, for string quartet (published 1931) * Berceuses (1920) for violin and piano * Pr√©lude et variation (1920) for violin and piano ===Piano music=== * Cinq petites pi√®ces (1924) * Le Cahier d'Eve, Op. 30 (1928, pub. 1930) ==Bibliography== * Andr√© Tessier: Lucien Haudebert et son oeuvre (Paris: Max Eschig & Maurice S√©nart, not dated [1928]) ==External sources== * data page of Biblioth√®que nationale de France ==References== Category:1877 births Category:1963 deaths Category:19th-century classical composers Category:19th-century French composers Category:19th-century male musicians Category:20th-century classical composers Category:20th-century French composers Category:20th-century French male musicians Category:Breton musicians Category:French classical composers Category:French male classical composers Category:Oratorio composers ","title":"Lucien Haudebert"},{"id":"56848348","text":"Robert Ghansah (born 23 October 1994) is a Ghanaian football player who plays .

John Walters faced CM Punk in the first match. Walters delivered a Hurricane DDT to Punk and covered him for the pinfall but Punk put his foot on the rope. Walter then rolled up Punk, who reversed it to pin Walter for the win. Next, Chris Sabin faced Doug Williams in the second quarter-final match. Sabin managed to hit a Cradle Shock on Williams but got a near-fall and then Williams delivered a Chaos Theory to Sabin's injured neck for the win. Next, Matt Stryker defeated Josh Daniels by making him submit to the Stryker Lock for the win. The last quarter-final match featured A.J. Styles competing against Jimmy Rave.

Rave then ran to attack Styles but Styles hit a discus clothesline for the win. Next, Special K (Dixie, Hydro and Izzy) took on The Carnage Crew (DeVito, Justin Credible and Loc) in a Country Whipping match. Credible delivered a That's Incredible to Izzy and then Angel Dust brought out DeVito's daughter to distract him, which led to DeVito and Credible rushing to the backstage to save her leaving Loc alone against Special K. Loc was then hit with a spike piledriver on a table outside the ring and Izzy pinned him for the win. ===Semifinals=== The semi-final round of the Pure Wrestling Championship tournament started as Doug Williams took on CM Punk. Williams was tied into the corner in a tree of woe by Punk, who hit a shoulder block in Williams' knee and proceeded to hit another but Williams reversed it into Chaos Theory but his shoulder were also down on the mat and Punk put his shoulder up on the two-count for the win.

It took place on February 8, 2003 at the Elks Lodge in Queens, New York. ==EventPreliminary matches=== The first match was a Four Corner Survival match between EZ Money, Chad Collyer, Colt Cabana and Michael Shane. Collyer had applied a Texas Cloverleaf to Shane but Shane made it to the ropes and Money entered the ring and delivered a Cha-Ching to Collyer for the win. Next, Texas Wrestling Academy students Don Juan, Fast Eddie and Hotstuff Hernandez took on The Carnage Crew members DeVito, HC Loc and Masada. Fast Eddie attempted to hit a springboard moonsault to HC Loc but Loc hit him with a hubcap in the mid-air, resulting in Carnage Crew getting disqualified. They continued to attack their opponents after the match until Christopher Street Connection made the save. Next, Jay Briscoe took on Mark Briscoe. Jay delivered three consecutive Jay- Drillers' to Mark for the win. Next, Homicide took on Steve Corino, who brought out Simply Luscious, Samoa Joe, C.W. Anderson and Michael Shane as members of his Group. Homicide attacked Corino with the microphone to start the match. Near the end of the match, Corino delivered an Old School Expulsion to gain a near-fall and then applied a cobra clutch on Homicide but he made it to the ropes so Corino dragged him in the middle of the ring to apply the cobra clutch and win by submission. After the match, Corino continued to choke Homicide, leading to the crowd jumping the rail to brawl in the ring. Later, a match was about to begin between The Ring Crew Express (Kevin Dunn and Kirby Marcos) and The Outcast Killaz but Gary Michael Cappetta interrupted them before the match even began and brought out C.W. Anderson, who attacked both teams and issued an open challenge for a match which was answered by CM Punk. Anderson was about to hit an Anderson Spinebuster but Punk rolled through with a sunset flip and pinned Anderson for the win. Next, Bryan Danielson took on Samoa Joe. Joe apparently knocked out Danielson with knee strikes in the head and nailed a powerbomb but as he went to pick up him, Danielson pinned him with a small package for the win. The following match was a three-way between A.J. Styles, Low Ki and Paul London for a future ROH Championship opportunity. Ki nailed a Ki Krusher to Styles from the top rope, which put both men down on the mat, so London hit a shooting star press on Styles for the win. ROH Champion Xavier challenged London immediately after the match. London nailed a shooting star press on Xavier and covered him for the pinfall but Allison Danger pulled Xavier out of the ring right before the three count. Danger entered the ring but Alexis Laree speared her. The match continued between Xavier and London as Xavier ended up pinning London with a roll-up to retain the title. ===Main event match=== The team of Da Hit Squad (Mafia and Monsta Mack), Divine Storm (Chris Divine and Quiet Storm), The S.A.T.

Whipwreck turned on his team mid-way into the match by hitting Whippersnappers on his teammates and joined Special K. Trinity confronted Whipwreck on it and Slugger hit her with a bodybag and then Whipwreck and Slugger took her to the backstage. The action continued between the two teams. Mafia delivered a Burning Hammer to Deranged from the top rope for the win. ==Reception== J.D.

Although sometimes described as a copyist, a greater share of her oeuvre has been made public in recent years, allowing Cany Peale to earn recognition for her genre and landscape paintings. She has been located in contemporary scholarship as an artist of the Hudson River School.Krieger, Jennifer C. \\"Women Artists of the Hudson River School.\\" American Art Review, vol. 22, no. 3, May/June 2010, pp. 140-45. == Family == Harriet Christina Cany was born in 1799, the daughter of Charles and Mary Cany, in Philadelphia. She was widowed sometime before 1840, and worked in her family's \\"fancy goods business.\\" She studied with the artist Rembrandt Peale, whom she married in 1840, becoming his second wife. Her association with the more famous Peale usually places her within the famous Peale family of painters, overshadowing her individual achievements as an artist in her own right. == Career == Harriet Cany Peale first exhibited in 1840 at the Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts, where she continued to exhibit for the rest of her life, as well as at the Artists' Fund Society. She and her husband shared a studio in Philadelphia. Her 1848 painting, Her Mistress's Clothes (private collection) has gained notoriety for its exploration of power differentiation in a scene of an African American woman dressed--presumably by her employer--in a bourgeois white woman's clothes and jewelry. Cany Peale depicts the \\"mistress\\" as an ideal, serene, light-skinned figure clasping the neck of the African American servant, whose features appear cruder in contrast. Together, they peer into a mirror to examine the effect of the clothes (relics of an earlier generation) and jewelry on the servant. Harriet Cany Peale. Kaaterskill Clove, 1858.

She was chair of the Women Theologians' Convent of the Evangelical- Lutheran Church in W√ºrttemberg. == Life == Lenore Volz was born in Waiblingen, a short distance from Stuttgart, and grew up in nearby Esslingen. She was the youngest of her parents' three recorded children. Hugo Volz, her father, had a well paid job in Esslingen as a tax official which enabled him to secure a good education for his children. Her mother, born Amalie Sixt, was an education pioneer who founded the first Lutheran \\"Mothers' School\\" (\\"M√ºtterschule\\") in W√ºrttemberg in 1928/29 and again, in the context of post- Nazi reconstruction, in 1945 \\"because there was literally nothing\\" (\\"weil es buchst√§blich nichts gab\\"). Lenore Volz attended the girls' school in Esslingen and then moved on to the elite K√∂nigin-Katharina-Stift-Gymnasium (girls' secondary school) in Stuttgart. In preparation for her university studies she learned Latin, Greek and Hebrew. In 1933 she enrolled as a Theology student at T√ºbingen University. T√ºbingen was a major centre for her subject, with approximately 900 Theology students: around twelve of these were women. The next year she took over leadership of the \\"German Christian Women Students' Movement\\" (\\"Deutschen Christlichen Studentinnenbewegung\\"/ DCSB ). In 1935 she transferred for a year to Greifswald on Germany's northern coast. Back in T√ºbingen she successfully completed her studies in 1939. In September 1939, as war broke out, Lenore Volz began her theological internship at M√ºnsingen. After six months she was unexpectedly transferred to nearby Cannstatt where in April 1940 she was appointed \\"parson's female assistant\\" (\\"Pfarrgehilfin\\"). Because all except the oldest the ministers had been conscripted for war service she found herself conducting services. Her formal status remained unclear, but congregations evidently accepted that she was able to conduct services and preach sermons as well as male colleagues. She was not permitted to conduct weddings or funerals, which remained male preserves.Lenore Volz: Talar nicht vorgesehen (Lenore Volz's autobiography). Stuttgart 1994, Children's services and work with women's and girls' groups were more typical of the \\"women's work\\" assigned to her, along with visiting of the elderly and sick. After the minister at the hospital was called up to serve the military she also took on hospital pastoral care. Early in 1943 she passed her level 2 Theological Practicing Exam (\\"Theologische Dienstpr√ºfung \\") which came with the title \\"Pfarrvikarin\\" (loosely: \\"parson-vicar\\"). However, after war ended and surviving male ministers returned from the prisoner of war camps she, and other women ministers who had been filling the men's shoes, were no longer able to conduct services before full congregations, but restricted to traditional core areas such as religious instruction in those smaller groups, restricted to children, girls and women. One change that could not be overlooked was the continuing shortage of male clergy due primarily, at this stage, to the slaughter of war. In 1948 the regional church passed a \\"Law on the service of women theologians\\" (\\"Gesetz √ºber den Dienst der Theologinnen\\"). As a result, female theologians were formally admitted to full time ministry by the Evangelical-Lutheran Church in W√ºrttemberg. Their appointments remained subordinate ones, \\"dependent on the ordained parish officers\\" (\\"in Abh√§ngigkeit vom ordinierten Pfarramt\\"), and the changes certainly did not deliver gender parity, but they did at the very least bring legal and financial improvements. It would need more thorough bible based theological groundwork to overcome significant residual doubts about women's ordination. By the end of the 1950s Lenore Volz would be one of the people engaged in that groundwork. During the early 1950s Volz turned her focus to the inter- relationship between psychotherapy and pastoral care. She recognised the need for church ministers to incorporate the ground rules of psychology in their pastoral care, in order to be able to respond adequately to people's spiritual needs. The leading proponent of these ideas was the theologian Otto Haendler, a qualified psychotherapist and the professor for Practical Theology at the Humboldt University in (East) Berlin till his retirement in 1959. Volz began to attend Haendler's lectures on psychology and got to know him in the course of her follow-up studies with the \\"Doctor and Pastor\\" (\\"Arzt und Seelsorger\\") community. Haendler became her mentor as she pursued her psychological studies in greater depth, providing her with a study plan and reading recommendations. For her personal education on the topic she contacted Jutta von Graevenitz with whom she underwent analysis training. The connection between psychology and theology, especially in the context of gender relations, was at the heart of Lenore Volz's life. From 1959 she turned her attention more directly to the issue of women's ordination, working closely on the theology and politics of the issue with Friedrich Lang, another T√ºbingen theologian. Presentations and discussions took place which raised the matter up the church agenda. In December 1961 Volz held a church-theological working session in the deanery at Bad Cannstatt during the course of which she gave a presentation under the title, \\"Has the time not come to update the 1948 Law on women theologians?\\" (\\"\\"Ist die Theologinnen-Ordnung von 1948 revisionsbed√ºrftig?\\"). The question set a stone rolling. Over the next few years she devoted herself to the issue of equal rights for women theologians. Working with the \\"Women Theologians' Convent\\" (\\"Konvent evangelischer Theologinnen\\"), of which she became president in 1965, she published in 1967 \\"Women in the pulpits? A burning question for our church\\" (\\"\\"Frauen auf der Kanzel? Eine brennende Frage unserer Kirchen\\"\\"). This study became the template for a new \\"Law on the service of women theologians\\" (\\"Gesetz √ºber den Dienst der Theologinnen\\"). After a deeply felt and moving debate it was adopted by the synod on 15 November 1968. The ordination of women was a reality. As Volz noted in her biography, women pastors were now permitted almost the same rights as male pastors. By this time Lenore Volz was already 55, and instead of remaining in the mainstream church ministry she became a hospital pastor, and worked on ideas for another great reform, this time to put pastoral care in hospitals on a new footing. She retired ten years later, in 1978. That was also the year in which further adjustments were made as a result of which men and women working in parish ministry finally received completely equal status and treatment from the Evangelical-Lutheran Church in W√ºrttemberg. Even after her retirement she remained an active presence in evangelical church politics. == References == Category:20th-century Lutheran clergy Category:Women Lutheran clergy Category:Evangelical-Lutheran Church in W√ºrttemberg Category:German women's rights activists Category:People from Esslingen am Neckar Category:1913 births Category:2009 deaths ","title":"Lenore Volz"},{"id":"56848481","text":"Supercard of Honor V was the 5th Supercard of Honor professional wrestling event produced by Ring of Honor (ROH), which took place on May 8, 2010 at Manhattan Center in New York City, New York. ==Storylines== Supercard of Honor V featured professional wrestling matches, which involved different wrestlers from pre-existing scripted feuds, plots, and storylines that played out on ROH's television programs.

In 1937 her family moved to an eighteenth century brick house in Much Hadham where Tilly and her younger brothers were raised. Motivated by ‚Äúa strong sense of public duty‚Äù, as an adult she ‚Äúserv[ed] in the Civil Defence Corps to be the better prepared to help in the event of any disaster‚Äù. Following a long illness, she died at Oxford in 2001. ==Education and career== After attending a local school in Much Hadham, de la Mare departed for a final three years at Queen‚Äôs College, Harley Street, then read history at Lady Margaret Hall, University of Oxford. In 1954, she registered as a postgraduate student at the Warburg Institute, London. Her M.A. thesis ‚Äî examining the Vite di uomini illustri of Florentine bookseller Vespasiano da Bisticci, and striving to trace the manuscripts he published ‚Äî proved so promising that her supervisor, Ernst Gombrich, promoted her to a PhD dissertation under his own supervision. ‚ÄúIt took a long time to materialise.

As curator in the Manuscript Department of the Bodleian Library from 1962 until 1989, de la Mare became so respected that King's College London Professor of Palaeography Julian Brown ‚Äúdecreed on his deathbed that Tilly de la Mare and no one else should succeed him‚Äù. In 1989, she was duly appointed to the latter institution‚Äôs Chair of Palaeography, where she soon garnered praise for her ‚Äúenthusiastic‚Äù, ‚Äúinspirational‚Äù lecturing stye. She retired from the post in 1997. From 1990 through 2000, de la Mare served as a counsellor to the Bureau of the prestigious Comit√© International de Pal√©ographie Latine (CIPL), a scholarly organisation of which she was a committed and active member. Elected a Fellow of the British Academy (FBA) in 1987, she was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in 1993.

His song \\"Lucid Dreams\\" has been played on music streaming platform Spotify over one billion times. \\"Lucid Dreams\\", along with his earlier hit single \\"All Girls Are the Same\\", helped him to secure a recording contract with Lil Bibby's Grade A Productions and Interscope Records. \\"All Girls Are the Same\\" and \\"Lucid Dreams\\" were two of five singles included on Higgins' debut studio album Goodbye & Good Riddance (2018), which went on to become certified Platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). The album enjoyed positive critical reception, and contained three other singles: \\"Lean wit Me\\", \\"Wasted\\", and \\"Armed and Dangerous\\", all of which charted on the Billboard Hot 100. After collaborating with Future on the mixtape Wrld on Drugs (2018), Higgins released his second studio album Death Race for Love (2019), which reached number one on the Billboard 200. It contains the singles \\"Robbery\\" and \\"Hear Me Calling\\". Higgins died eight months later following a drug-related seizure at Chicago's Midway International Airport. His death prompted an outpouring of grief across social media and from the music industry. His first posthumous album, Legends Never Die (2020), debuted at number one on the Billboard 200. The album was the most successful posthumous chart debut in over 20 years and matched a record for the most top-ten song entries on the Hot 100 at one time. The album's fourth of six singles, \\"Come & Go\\" with Marshmello, became Higgins' second song to reach number two on the Billboard Hot 100 after \\"Lucid Dreams\\". ==Early life== Jarad Anthony Higgins was born on December 2, 1998, in Chicago, Illinois. He grew up in the South Suburbs spending his childhood in Calumet Park and later moved to Homewood, where he attended Homewood-Flossmoor High School. His parents divorced when he was three years old, and his father left, leaving his mother to raise him as a single mother along with one older brother. Higgins' mother was very religious and conservative, and did not let him listen to hip hop. He was allowed to listen to rock and pop music, however, and he found this on video games such as Tony Hawk's Pro Skater and Guitar Hero, which introduced him to artists like Billy Idol, Blink-182, Black Sabbath, Fall Out Boy, Megadeth and Panic! at the Disco. Higgins was a heavy drug user during his childhood and teens. He began drinking lean in sixth grade and using percocets and xanax in 2013. Higgins also smoked cigarettes briefly before quitting in his last year of high school because of health issues. He learned to play the piano at four years old, having been inspired by his mother, Carmella Wallace, who later began paying for lessons. He then took up the guitar and drums. Higgins also played trumpet for band class. In his sophomore year of high school, he began posting songs to his SoundCloud which he recorded on his smartphone. Around this time, Higgins began to take rapping more seriously. ==CareerEarly career=== Higgins began to develop as an artist in his first year of high school. His first track, \\"Forever\\", was released on SoundCloud in 2015 under the name JuicetheKidd. Higgins recorded most of his first tracks on a cellphone, uploading them to SoundCloud in his sophomore year. He changed his name from JuicetheKidd, a name inspired by his affection for rapper Tupac Shakur and his part in the film Juice, to Juice Wrld because it \\"represents taking over the world\\". His first track produced by his main producer Nick Mira, \\"Too Much Cash\\", was released in 2017. While releasing projects and songs on SoundCloud, Higgins worked in a factory but was dissatisfied with the job; he was fired within two weeks. After joining the internet collective Internet Money, Higgins released his debut full-length EP, 9 9 9, on June 15, 2017, with the song \\"Lucid Dreams\\" breaking out and growing his following. In mid-2017, he began to receive attention from artists such as Waka Flocka Flame and Southside, and fellow Chicago artists G Herbo and Lil Bibby. He signed subsequently with Lil Bibby's co-owned record label, Grade A Productions. ===2017‚Äì2018: Goodbye & Good Riddance=== In December 2017, Higgins released the three-song EP Nothings Different. Many hip-hop blogs such as Lyrical Lemonade featured it, which helped Higgins's track \\"All Girls Are the Same\\" gain popularity. In February 2018, a music video directed by Cole Bennett was released. Following the video's release, Interscope Records signed Higgins for $3 million and a remix featuring Lil Yachty was previewed. \\"All Girls Are the Same\\" was critically praised, receiving a Best New Music designation from Pitchfork. It was released as a single in April. \\"All Girls Are the Same\\" and \\"Lucid Dreams\\" were Higgins's first entries on a Billboard chart, debuting at number 92 and 74 respectively on the Hot 100 chart. On May 4, 2018, \\"Lucid Dreams\\" was released officially as a single and given a video. It peaked at number two on the US Billboard Hot 100 and quickly became one of the most streamed songs of 2018; it remains his most-streamed song, reaching over one billion streams on Spotify by January 2020. \\"Lucid Dreams\\" was followed by \\"Lean Wit Me\\" on May 22, which peaked at number 68 on the Hot 100; Higgins' debut full-length Goodbye & Good Riddance, which included his three previous singles, was released the following day. On June 19, 2018, he released a two- song EP, Too Soon.. in remembrance of, and dedicated to, deceased rappers Lil Peep and XXXTentacion. Lil Peep died of an overdose in 2017 and XXXTentacion was shot and killed during a robbery attempt a day earlier. The song \\"Legends\\" from the EP debut at number 65. \\"Wasted\\" featuring Lil Uzi Vert was released on July 10, 2018; it was Higgins' first single featuring a collaboration and the only song on Goodbye & Good Riddance with a featured guest. It debuted at number 68 and peaked 67 next week on the Billboard Hot 100. The following day, Higgins announced he was working on his next album. Following a series of leaks, Higgins' producer Danny Wolf released the official version of \\"Motions\\" on SoundCloud on July 25. On July 20, 2018, Higgins announced his first tour, WRLD Domination, with additional acts YBN Cordae and Lil Mosey. ===2018‚Äì2019: Wrld on Drugs, Death Race for Love and death=== Higgins at the 2018 MTV Video Music Awards in August 2018 Travis Scott's song \\"No Bystanders\\", from his third studio album, Astroworld, featured Higgins and Sheck Wes. The song peaked at number 31 on the Billboard Hot 100. Higgins made his late night television debut performing the song \\"Lucid Dreams\\" on Jimmy Kimmel Live! on August 8, 2018. On October 15, 2018, the music video for the song \\"Armed and Dangerous\\" was released followed by the lead single, \\"Fine China\\", from the collaborative mixtape, Wrld on Drugs with Future. Epic Records released the mixtape on October 19, 2018. He also contributed to the soundtrack for Spider- Man: Into the Spider-Verse in December 2018, with a song titled \\"Hide\\" featuring American singer Seezyn. In December 2018, Ski Mask the Slump God confirmed that he would release a joint mixtape with Higgins called Evil Twins in 2019. The pair also announced a 2019 tour featuring 30 concerts across North America. Higgins' second studio album, Death Race for Love, was released on March 8, 2019, preceded by the singles \\"Robbery\\" and \\"Hear Me Calling\\". The album topped the Billboard 200 chart. He then embarked on The Nicki Wrld Tour, alongside Trinidadian-American rapper Nicki Minaj. Higgins released the music video for the song \\"Fast\\" from the album. Later that year, he released other singles: \\"All Night\\" with RM and Suga of BTS; \\"Hate Me\\" with Ellie Goulding; \\"Run\\"; \\"Graduation\\" with Benny Blanco; and \\"Bandit\\" with NBA YoungBoy, the last song to be released while he was alive. It peaked at number 10 on the Billboard Hot 100. On December 8, 2019, Higgins collapsed and died from a suspected drug-induced seizure at Midway International Airport in Chicago, after landing at Midway on a private jet from Van Nuys Airport in Los Angeles. His death provoked an outpouring of grief across social media and the music industry. Higgins' funeral was held in Harvey, Illinois, on December 13, 2019. ===2020‚Äìpresent: Legends Never Die, posthumous releases=== Higgins' first posthumous appearance was on Eminem's eleventh studio album Music to Be Murdered By on the track \\"Godzilla\\", released on January 17, 2020. \\"Godzilla\\" peaked at number three on the Billboard Hot 100 and number one on the UK Singles Chart. On January 22, an announcement was posted on Higgins' Instagram account by members of his family and the team at Grade A Productions which thanked fans for their adoration for Higgins and confirmed their intention to release music that he was working on at the time of his death: > From the bottom of our hearts, we want to thank each and every one of you > for your undivided adoration and love for Juice. You guys meant the entire > world to Juice and by listening to his music, watching his videos and > sharing your stories about him, you are keeping his memory alive forever.

There will be a public tribute in Chicago, > details will be shared soon. Love Juice's Family and the team at Grade A. Higgins was included on the title track of G Herbo's fourth studio album PTSD, released on February 28. The track features vocals by Lil Uzi Vert and Chance the Rapper. \\"PTSD\\" marked the first time that Higgins and Lil Uzi Vert had collaborated on a song since \\"Wasted\\". On March 13, a remix of the single \\"Suicidal\\", from YNW Melly's debut studio album Melly vs. Melvin, featuring vocals from Higgins, was released. The remix included a different verse and outro Higgins had recorded. The song reappeared on the Billboard Hot 100 and peaked at number 20 following the release of the remix. The single \\"No Me Ame\\", a multilingual collaboration among Higgins, Jamaican record producer Rvssian and Puerto Rican rapper Anuel AA, was released on April 17\\\\. A computer-generated image of Higgins as an angel appears in the background of its music video. On April 23, Higgins' estate announced on his Instagram account that his first posthumous single, \\"Righteous\\", would be released later that night. Released at midnight on April 24, an accompanying music video with footage of Higgins was uploaded to his YouTube channel. Higgins had recorded the song at his home studio in Los Angeles. On May 4, Higgins' girlfriend, Ally Lotti, announced the title of his upcoming third album and first posthumous album was The Outsiders. On May 29, the song \\"Tell Me U Luv Me\\" featuring Trippie Redd was released alongside a music video directed by Cole Bennett. \\"Go\\", Higgins' collaboration with Australian rapper, The Kid Laroi (whom Higgins mentored), was released on June 12. Higgins' estate publicly announced the title of the late rapper's first posthumous album had been changed to Legends Never Die on July 6. On the same day, Higgins' estate also released \\"Life's a Mess\\" featuring Halsey and \\"Come & Go\\" a few days later on July 9 featuring Marshmello. The album was released on July 10, with 21 songs and four singles that Higgins' estate claims \\"best represents the music Juice was in the process of creating\\". The album debuted at number one on the Billboard 200. Five of its songs reached the top 10 of the Billboard Hot 100 on the week ending July 25: \\"Come & Go\\", \\"Wishing Well\\", \\"Conversations\\", \\"Life's a Mess\\", and \\"Hate The Other Side\\" (a collaboration with Polo G and The Kid Laroi), which reached number two, five, seven, nine, and ten, respectively. Higgins is the third artist to accomplish this feat; the other artists were the Beatles and Drake. \\"Life's a Mess\\" notably jumped from number 74 to number nine that week. \\"Wishing Well\\", which had been critically lauded following the album's release, was sent to rhythmic contemporary radio as the album's fifth single on July 28. At midnight on August 6, \\"Smile\\" featuring The Weeknd was released as a single. \\"Smile\\" had previously been leaked on YouTube and SoundCloud with the title \\"Sad\\" over a year before, though with an open verse in place of The Weeknd's. ==ArtistryMusical style=== Higgins said his musical influences were genre-wide from rock to rap music, and that his biggest influences were rappers Travis Scott, Chief Keef, Kanye West and British rock singer Billy Idol. Higgins was among the ranks of openly vulnerable artists born from the emo rap scene inspired by West's influential fourth album, 808s & Heartbreak (2008). Billboard writer Michael Saponara claimed, \\"If West and his sparse 808s were a tree, it would have grown another branch with the blossoming art displayed by fellow Chicago native Juice WRLD in 2018.\\" During an interview with All Def Music, Higgins said, \\"I was singing 'Street Lights' like I had shit to be sad about. Kanye is a time traveler. That nigga went to damn near 2015 and came back with some sauce.\\" His other influences included: Wu-Tang Clan, Quietdrive, Fall Out Boy, Black Sabbath, The Starting Line, The Cranberries, The City Drive, 2Pac, Eminem, Kid Cudi and Escape the Fate. Higgins' music has been branded as \\"emo\\" and \\"rock\\" leaning, \\"genre-bending\\" with music focusing on \\"every broken heart, every wounded feeling\\". More specifically, he has been labeled as a hip hop, trap, emo rap, and SoundCloud rap artist. With a penchant for short, hook-heavy songs, Higgins seemed a leading figure for the current era of hip-hop. In 2018, the streaming platform Spotify named \\"emo rap\\" its fastest growing genre. Higgins achieved arguably the most mainstream success of any artist in the sub-genre. This was boosted by his collaboration with Panic! At the Disco frontman Brendon Urie. Higgins himself considered the emo label to be both negative and positive. He felt that music sometimes has to be a bit dark to reflect his belief that the world is not really a light or a happy place. Higgins said that \\"Lucid Dreams\\" was the only track from Goodbye & Good Riddance that he wrote, while the rest was done impromptu. Rather than write down his rhymes, Higgins crafted whole songs in a few minutes by way of off-the-cuff rhyming. Most of the time, his songwriting process involved freestyling lyrics instead of writing them down. When he did write a song, it usually began with hearing a beat and instantaneously conceiving an idea. Higgins sometimes found himself alone with an idea for a song and afraid that he would be unable to remember it hours later after arriving at the studio. For this reason, he sometimes took a voice memo or simply wrote the whole song. ===Lyrical themes=== Higgins saw the value in his position as one of very few contemporary SoundCloud artists who could compose soul-bearing ballads and odes but remain comfortable freestyle rapping over classic hip hop beats. Rather than eschewing it, his freestyles emphasize wordplay and feel indebted to the art form's tradition. When asked for his opinion on why freestyles are no longer considered the rite of passage in hip hop culture as they once were he replied, \\"Stuff is just changing, that's all. We're moving into a new era of music. I feel like it's not necessarily a good thing to forget where shit started, but shit is changing.\\" Though his songs do not always feature very technical lyricism, intricate flows or tongue-twisting wordplay, Higgins delivered inventive flows and memorable bars during his freestyles. His most successful singles express melodic, emo-inspired compositions that exhibit his songwriting skill. His songs harbor melodic flows to complement their melancholic subjects. Higgins claimed he talked about things others are thinking but are afraid to speak about, such as being vulnerable and hurt. Having built a following through emo rap, Higgins offered lyrics that touch on heartbreak and fragmented feelings. Though not entirely groundbreaking, his musical approach provided a sense of familiarity that heartbroken adolescents of the current generation could gravitate towards. Higgins maintained that he only wrote from personal experience, and found strength in his pain and vulnerability. While the lyrical content of his songs often centered on heartache and bitterness, there are occasionally more boastful lines and creative references. == Personal life == Higgins had a history of drug abuse that began at an early age, and he spoke openly about his experiences. His mother, Carmella Wallace, claimed that he was also dealing with anxiety and depression on top of his battle with drug addiction. He was living in Los Angeles with his girlfriend, Ally Lotti, at the time of his death. The pair revealed that they were dating via Instagram in November 2018. === Death === On December 8, 2019, Higgins was aboard a private Gulfstream jet flying from Van Nuys Airport in Los Angeles to Midway International Airport in Chicago. Law enforcement officers were waiting for the jet to arrive, having been notified by federal agents, while the flight was en route, that they suspected there were guns and drugs on the plane. Law enforcement officials later revealed they found three handguns and of marijuana on the aircraft. They also said several members of Higgins' management team aboard the flight told them that Higgins had taken \\"several unknown pills\\", including allegedly swallowing multiple Percocet pills to hide them while police were on board the plane searching the luggage. Higgins then began convulsing and seizing, after which two doses of the emergency medication Narcan were administered as an opioid overdose was suspected. Higgins was transported to the nearby Advocate Christ Medical Center in Oak Lawn, where he was pronounced dead. Higgins' funeral was held on December 13, 2019, at the Holy Temple Cathedral Church of God in Christ in Harvey, Illinois. Friends and family were in attendance, including collaborators Ski Mask the Slump God and Young Thug. On January 22, 2020, the Cook County Medical Examiner stated that Higgins died as a result of toxic levels of oxycodone and codeine present in his system. Reaction Fellow artist Boosie Badazz suggested that the pilot of the plane was ultimately responsible for Higgins' death, referring to him as a snitch. Rapper Ski Mask the Slump God, his close friend who had collaborated with Higgins on the hit song \\"Nuketown\\", said on Twitter \\"They keep taking my brothers from me\\", referring also to best friend and longtime collaborator XXXTentacion, who was shot and killed in June 2018. Lil Yachty, who remixed Higgins' song \\"All Girls Are the Same\\" mourned his death along with Lil Uzi Vert, Drake, The Weeknd and others. Higgins' mother, Carmella Wallace, expressed her hope that her son's legacy would help others in their battle with addictions saying, \\"Addiction knows no boundaries, and its impact goes beyond the person fighting it. We hope the conversations he started in his music and his legacy will help others win their battles, as that is what he wanted more than anything. We know that Jarad's legacy of love, joy and emotional honesty will live on.\\" Wallace later established the Live Free 999 Fund in honor of Higgins and the battle he fought against addiction, anxiety and depression. The fund's primary goal is to support programs that target young, underserved populations. With a focus on addiction, anxiety and depression, the organization hopes to normalize the conversation about the mental health challenges that Higgins faced, and provide an avenue for people to process those challenges in a healthy way. Higgins' production team and record label have committed to supporting the organization. In his song, \\"Legends\\"‚Äîwhich was dedicated to XXXTentacion, who was shot and killed in mid-2018 at age 20, and Lil Peep, who overdosed in late 2017 at age 21‚ÄîHiggins raps \\"What's the 27 Club? / We ain't making it past 21.\\" Fans and media outlets commented that he had predicted his own death, as he had died only days after his 21st birthday. He also died exactly 39 years after Beatles singer John Lennon, whom Higgins often mentioned in songs. ==Discography== * Goodbye & Good Riddance (2018) * Wrld on Drugs with Future (2018) * Death Race for Love (2019) * Legends Never Die (2020) * The Outsiders (TBA) ==Concert tours== * The Nicki Wrld Tour with Nicki Minaj (2019) *The Death Race for Love Tour with Ski Mask the Slump God and contribution from Lyrical Lemonade (2019) ==Awards and nominationsMTV Video Music Awards=== ! -  2018  \\"Lucid Dreams\\"  Song of Summer   } ===BET Hip-Hop Awards=== ! -  2018 Juice Wrld  Best New Hip Hop Artist   } ===Billboard Music Awards=== ! -  2019  Juice Wrld  Top New Artist   -  2020  Death Race for Love  Top Rap Album   style=\\"text-align:center;\\" ==References* Category:1998 births Category:2019 deaths Category:21st-century American rappers Category:African-American male rappers Category:African-American singer-songwriters Category:Drug-related deaths in Illinois Category:Accidental deaths in Illinois Category:Emo rap musicians Category:Interscope Records artists Category:People from Homewood, Illinois Category:Rappers from Chicago ","title":"Juice Wrld"},{"id":"56848581","text":"Death Before Dishonor XVI was a two night professional wrestling event produced by Ring of Honor (ROH), which took place on September 28 and 29, 2018 at Orleans Arena in Las Vegas, Nevada.

The initial construction on the pedestrian bridge was located in front of the campus of FIU in University Park, a suburb west of Miami, Florida, United States, and was in the process of post-tension rod adjustment when it suddenly failed. At the time of the collapse, the road beneath the bridge had been open to traffic. An examination carried out by the Federal Highway Administration discovered faults in the design of the bridge, which overestimated the strength of the bridge in the region that failed and underestimated the load it would be expected to carry. The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) issued a \\"News Release\\" which said, \\"load and capacity calculation errors made by FIGG Bridge Engineers, Inc., are the probable cause of the fatal ... bridge collapse in Miami ...\\" The same day the NTSB released a \\"synopsis\\"This is a synopsis ... and does not include the Board's rationale for the conclusions, probable cause, and safety recommendations. NTSB staff is currently making final revisions to the report ... which ... will be distributed ... as soon as possible. of its final report, which stated The New York Times concluded that \\"the chief probable cause\\" was \\"the design by FIGG Bridge Engineers\\", but that \\"every company, institution and agency involved in the project was partly to blame for the bridge collapse\\". == Background == The FIU Sweetwater UniversityCity pedestrian bridge, located just west of the intersection of Tamiami Trail (Southwest 8th Street) and Southwest 109th Avenue, was planned to connect the FIU campus to student housing neighborhoods in Sweetwater. It was intended to improve pedestrian safety, as the crosswalks at this wide, busy intersection had been identified as a safety hazard, and one student had already been struck and killed by a vehicle. The $14.2 million project was funded with a $19.4 million Transportation Investment Generating Economic Recovery (TIGER) grant from the United States Department of Transportation in 2013, along with state agencies. The bridge cost $9 million to construct, exclusive of the installation cost. The main companies behind the construction project were Munilla Construction Management (MCM), a Miami-based construction management firm, and FIGG Bridge Engineers, a Tallahassee-based firm. Unlike most bridges in Florida, the design for this project was overseen by the university, not the Florida Department of Transportation. Florida International University is known for its expertise in accelerated bridge construction (ABC) and has attracted international scholars as PhD students. It is home to the federally- funded Accelerated Bridge Construction University Transportation Center, which sponsors industry conferences and seminars. The National Transportation Safety Board, however, found that with respect to the bridge, \\"F.I.U. had no professional engineers on its staff and relied solely on the expertise of its hired contractors.\\" == Bridge layout == Elevation Engineering Drawing of Proposed FIU Sweetwater Pedestrian Bridge The full pedestrian bridge was to cross both a major roadway and a parallel water canal with two separate spans connected at a faux cable-stayed tower. The main roadway-crossing span was 175 ft long, and the shorter canal span was to be 99 ft long. An elevator and stairs at the south end added 31 ft, and at the north end, 15 feet, for a total bridge length of 320 feet. At the bridge site, the Tamiami Trail roadway has seven lanes of traffic plus one turn lane. The school was on spring break at the time of collapse. The canal span, access ramps, and faux cable-stayed tower had not yet been built. Pedestrian use was to begin when the entire project was complete.The section of the bridge that collapsed weighed and fell onto several vehicles on the roadway below. == Bridge design and construction == The new pedestrian bridge was designed to connect the campus to student housing in a dramatic sculptural way, and also to showcase the school's leadership in the ABC method of rapid bridge construction. The bridge was meant to last more than 100 years, and to withstand a Category 5 hurricane, according to a statement by the university. The full bridge project was styled to look like a cable-stayed bridge, with a pylon tower and high cables for dramatic effect, but functionally and structurally it was actually a truss bridge, with the spans being fully self-supporting. The bridge spans used a novel concrete truss design invented for this project, a \\"re-invented I-beam concept\\". Concrete truss bridges are rarely constructed, and few exist. The vertical web of the beam was a series of triangulated concrete diagonal struts along the centerline, and the diagonal angles of the struts varied across the bridge so they would align with pipes from the center pylon, in the eventual faux cable-stayed appearance. The concrete walkway deck was to act as the horizontal bottom flange of a wide I-beam, and the concrete roof canopy was to function as the horizontal top flange of the I-beam. The walkway was thus nearer to ground level than in a standard design where the walkway is placed on top of the structural support system. This reduced the number of steps to climb. The deck was to carry the entire weight of the bridge span, as a tension load. The canopy was to carry the structure's main compressive loads. The diagonal struts would carry either compression or tension forces, depending on their angle and position. The bridge was a post-tensioned concrete structure. Concrete structures are generally ten times heavier than equivalent steel designs. The bridge was made using a new formulation for concrete intended to stay cleaner than standard concrete formulations. In the main bridge span, the concrete floor deck, roof, and diagonal struts each contained post-tensioning cables whose compressive effect on the concrete could be adjusted after the concrete was cured. Adjustments were expected each time the span was moved onto a different foundation with different support points. A specification change from FDOT late in the planning phase required relocating central pier 11 feet (3 meters) north to allow for future widening of the highway, causing some changes in construction. Construction of the bridge began in March 2016 and was scheduled to be completed in December 2018. The bridge's main span was assembled adjacent to the highway using accelerated bridge construction. It was lifted into place on the morning of March 10, five days before the collapse, during a weekend closure of the roadway. == Collapse == Schematic of the bridge. Green: collapsed parts, Blue: not installed at the time of the collapse. The diagonal beam that was undergoing post-tension cable/rod adjustment at the time of the collapse is highlighted in red. === Reports of cracking === Two days before the collapse, on March 13, the third day after lifting of the main span, the project's lead engineer discovered cracks at the north end of the span (the end that later broke). He reported this by voicemail to a Florida Department of Transportation (FDOT) employee. He thought this was not an immediate safety issue, merely something that would need to be repaired later. The FDOT recipient was away for several days and did not hear this message until the day after the collapse. At 9 a.m. on March 15, a university employee heard a loud \\"whip cracking\\" sound while under the bridge span, waiting for a red traffic light. At the same time, the design- build team met for about two hours at the construction site to discuss the cracks discovered on March 13. Representatives from both FIU and FDOT were present. The FIGG lead engineer's conclusions were that the structural integrity of the bridge was not compromised and that there were no safety concerns raised by the presence of the crack. FIGG also insisted that no crack repairs should be carried out until the stabilizing of the node and pylon diaphragm with post-tensioning was completed. The mayor of Miami-Dade County, Carlos A. Gim√©nez, said that workers conducted a stress test on the morning of March 15. === Collapse === At 1:47 p.m. on March 15, the north end of the installed bridge span sagged deeply as the first diagonal fractured, folded, and immediately dropped the heavy full span onto the roadway below. A surveillance video shows the collapse sequence took only a few video frames. As the post-tensioning operation by the VSL company was being carried out on bridge diagonal member support #11, the bottom joint (which contained the anchor nut for the post-tensioning rod) apparently failed explosively, causing the bridge to collapse. United States Senator and FIU adjunct professor Marco Rubio tweeted that engineers were tightening loosened cables on March 15: Workers were adding more tension to the steel rod (tendon) inside a concrete diagonal strut at the north end. The National Transportation Safety Board, who investigated the collapse, stated that crews were applying \\"post-tensioning force\\" on the bridge before the collapse. === Aftermath === Six people were killed and eight others were injured. Five of the victims were killed immediately when the bridge fell; one died at the hospital. Navaro Brown, aged 37, worked for VSL, the company contracted to apply post-tensioning and died in the collapse. Two other employees of VSL were hospitalized. The other deceased victims of the tragedy were Alberto Arias, 53, Brandon Brownfield, 39, FIU student Alexa Duran, 18, Rolando Fraga, 60, and Oswaldo Gonzalez, 57. At the time of the collapse, the roadway was open, and multiple cars were stopped at a traffic light under the span. Eight cars were crushed. A driver who survived the collapse reported that small rocks fell onto her car just before the front of her car was crushed. A worker saved himself when he heard cracking and locked his safety harness just before the collapse. Southwest 8th Street between Southwest 107th and 117th Avenues was closed until March 24 while the debris was cleared. == Inquiry == Members of the NTSB's Go Team for the investigation boarding an FAA plane to travel to Miami. On March 15, 2018, the NTSB launched a Go-team of 15 people to investigate the bridge collapse. The accident number assigned is HWY18MH009. On March 16, 2018 the NTSB Investigators held their first press conference to discuss the inquiry into the bridge collapse. Noteworthy points from the meeting included a statement that the inquiry was in the very early stages, that cracks in the bridge superstructure did not necessarily make the bridge unsafe, that on-site investigations would take about a week, that preserving perishable evidence was crucial, and that bridge workers were applying a \\"post-tensioning force\\" on the bridge before the failure. Also on March 16, 2018, the FDOT released a letter to the public with information about the bridge collapse: On March 21, 2018, the NTSB sent out a press release detailing the items from the collapse that required further examination at the Turner Fairbank Highway Research Center, in McLean, Virginia. They also confirmed workers were adjusting rod tension when the collapse occurred. On May 23, 2018, the NTSB released a preliminary report titled \\"Highway: Collapse of Pedestrian Bridge Under Construction Miami, Florida (HWY18MH009)\\" which summarized the accident. They said they are evaluating the emergence of cracks in the region of diagonal members 2 (south end of the bridge) and 11 (north end of bridge), and the propagation of cracks in the region of diagonal member 11. Pictures of the cracks from February 24 (before the walkway had been moved into place) were also given. Consulting engineers Bolton-Perez and Associates, had taken several pictures of severe cracks in diagonal member 11 and adjacent to vertical member 12 which had appeared when the bridge was moved into place on March 10. The Turner-Fairbank Highway Research Center, at the request of the NTSB, tested samples of steel and concrete from the collapsed bridge, and found that the materials met the project requirements. The NTSB similarly asked the FHWA to examine the design of the bridge. The FHWA examination discovered that the bridge designers had overestimated the strength of one section of the bridge ‚Äî at the point where the diagonal member 11 and vertical member 12 met the bridge deck ‚Äî and underestimated the load that that same section would carry. In June 2019, OSHA released its final report on the FIU bridge collapse and concluded FIGG Bridge Engineers failed to recognize collapse was imminent when they inspected the bridge hours earlier. They also concluded the bridge had structural design deficiencies, severe cracks were wrongly ignored by the Engineer of Record and warranted street closure, and contract bridge design experts violated basic FDOT construction requirements. On October 8, 2019, the NTSB released over 6,000 pages relating to its investigation of the collapse, including letters submitted to the NTSB by the various companies associated with the bridge construction. A final NTSB public hearing on the bridge accident was held October 22, 2019, in Washington, D.C., and concluded \\"that load and capacity calculation errors made by FIGG Bridge Engineers, Inc., are the probable cause of the fatal, March 15, 2018, Florida International University pedestrian bridge collapse in Miami.\\" == Legal action == On March 19, 2018, the first civil lawsuit was filed against FIGG Bridge Engineers, MCM, Bolton Perez & Associates, the project's consulting engineer, Louis Berger, and Network Engineering Services for reckless negligence. On March 21, 2018, U.S. Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao asked the department's inspector general to probe whether the federally funded pedestrian bridge complied with all rules. A subsequent internal memorandum from the Inspector General of the U.S. Department of Transportation, dated March 22, 2018, expressed concerns the project complied with Federal specifications, and that the objective of an audit will be to assess whether the Florida International University pedestrian bridge met Federal and DOT requirements for the TIGER application, approval, and grant agreement processes On March 28, 2018, the Miami Herald reported they were denied access to FIU documents related to the bridge construction, citing federal regulations that prevent release of non-public information related to the bridge construction and design project when an NTSB investigation is in progress. A lawyer for Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press indicated more information should be released under the Florida Sunshine Law, citing intense public interest in the collapse. On May 2, 2018, the Miami Herald filed a lawsuit against FDOT in Florida's Leon County Circuit Court to compel the FDOT to release emails, meeting minutes and other records relating to the bridge's design and construction. On May 3, 2018, a lawyer for the NTSB wrote a letter to Judge Cooper of the 2nd Judicial Circuit of Florida in Tallahassee urging the court to deny a ruling that would favor the Miami Herald plaintiff, for the release of any bridge information generated after a February 19, 2018, cutoff date. On May 7, 2018, the Miami Herald reported they had received a copy of a memo with photographs from FIU dated February 28, 2018, that had been sent to the Munilla Construction Management company, the bridge project's builder. The memo, which has since been rescinded back from Public view, purportedly urged the bridge engineer to respond to their concerns about significant cracks in the concrete joint at connection between the No. 11 truss and the bridge deck. On August 21, 2018, Leon County Circuit Judge Kevin Carroll ruled the FDOT \\"shall produce to The Herald the requested records, but that production shall be limited to records from February 20th to March 15th (prior to the collapse)\\". However, two days later and just as the FDOT was about to release documents, the Florida State ruling was temporarily blocked by U.S. District Court Judge William Stafford on a request from the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Northern District of Florida (on behalf of the NTSB, who is seeking to move the case to a Federal Court). On October 5, Federal Judge Stafford made a final ruling to block the requested documents. On June 27, 2018, the Travelers Indemnity Company and The Phoenix Insurance Company submitted an 18-page complaint for declaratory relief in U.S. District Court for Florida Southern District, Miami Division. The lawsuit filing seeks to avoid financial liability to the claimants and included the following statement: \\"There is no coverage under Travelers' and Phoenix's policies issued to Figg for any damages caused by the joint venture and/or partnership between Figg and MCM, as such joint venture and/or partnership was never disclosed to Travelers and Phoenix and does not qualify as an insured under either of the Policies issued to Figg.\\" The following is from a September 18, 2018 OSHA News Release ‚Äî Region 4: The U.S. Department of Labor's Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) on Friday, September 14, cited multiple contractors for safety violations after one employee suffered fatal injuries and five other employees sustained serious injuries when a pedestrian bridge at the Florida International University campus in Miami collapsed. The five companies collectively received seven violations, totaling $86,658 in proposed penalties. OSHA cited Figg Bridge Engineers Inc., a civil and structural engineering company; Network Engineering Services Inc. (doing business as Bolton Perez & Assoc.), a construction engineering and inspection firm; Structural Technologies LLC (doing business as Structural Technologies/VSL), specializing in post-tensioning in bridges and buildings; Munilla Construction Management LLC, a bridge and building construction company; and The Structural Group of South Florida Inc., a contractor specializing in concrete formwork. A total of 18 civil lawsuits were filed against 25 businesses connected to the failed FIU bridge project. Miami-Dade Circuit Judge Jennifer Bailey is overseeing the on-going case. On March 1, 2019, Munilla Construction Management, the main Miami-based contractor behind the pedestrian bridge construction, announced a restructuring and recapitalization of the company through a Chapter 11 bankruptcy petition plan of reorganization. The company reached a settlement deal with the victims and their families on May 2, 2019, that would pay up to $42 million. == Replacement bridge == On May 6, 2020, FDOT announced plans to design and rebuild the bridge, with guidance from the NTSB. The design stage is scheduled to begin in 2021 and last for two years, with a further two years estimated to construct the bridge. == See also == *List of bridge failures *List of structural failures and collapses == Notes  References  External links == * , NTSB, OMarch 16, 2018 * Computer animation showing the assembly of the FIU pedestrian bridge, MCM ‚Äî Munilla Construction Management * , Munilla Construction Management, November 18, 2015 * , Florida International University, March 14, 2018 * An initial rendering of the bridge.

DFO is a simple optimiser which works by iteratively trying to improve a candidate solution with regard to a numerical measure that is calculated by a fitness function. Each member of the population, a fly or an agent, holds a candidate solution whose suitability can be evaluated by their fitness value. Optimisation problems are often formulated as either minimisation or maximisation problems. DFO was introduced with the intention of analysing a simplified swarm intelligence algorithm with the fewest tunable parameters and components. In the first work on DFO, this algorithm was compared against a few other existing swarm intelligence techniques using error, efficiency and diversity measures. It is shown that despite the simplicity of the algorithm, which only uses agents‚Äô position vectors at time t to generate the position vectors for time t + 1, it exhibits a competitive performance. Since its inception, DFO has been used in a variety of applications including medical imaging and image analysis as well as data mining and machine learning. == Algorithm == DFO bears many similarities with other existing continuous, population-based optimisers (e.g. particle swarm optimization and differential evolution). In that, the swarming behaviour of the individuals consists of two tightly connected mechanisms, one is the formation of the swarm and the other is its breaking or weakening. DFO works by facilitating the information exchange between the members of the population (the swarming flies). Each fly \\\\mathbf{x} represents a position in a d-dimensional search space: \\\\mathbf{x} = (x_1,x_2,\\\\ldots,x_d), and the fitness of each fly is calculated by the fitness function f(\\\\mathbf{x}), which takes into account the flies' d dimensions: f(\\\\mathbf{x}) = f(x_1,x_2,\\\\ldots,x_d) . The pseudocode below represents one iteration of the algorithm: for i = 1 : N flies \\\\mathbf{x_i}.\\\\text{fitness} = f(\\\\mathbf{x}_i) end for i \\\\mathbf{x}_s = arg min [f(\\\\mathbf{x}_i)], \\\\; i \\\\in \\\\\\\\{1,\\\\ldots,N\\\\\\\\} for i = 1 : N and i e s for d = 1 : D dimensions x_{id}^{t+1} = U(x_{\\\\min,d}, x_{\\\\max,d}) else x_{id}^{t+1} = x_{i_{nd}}^t + U(0,1)( x_{sd}^t - x_{id}^t ) end if end for d end for i In the algorithm above, x_{id}^{t+1} represents fly i at dimension d and time t+1 ; x_{i_{nd}}^t presents x_i 's best neighbouring fly in ring topology (left or right, using flies indexes), at dimension d and time t ; and x_{sd}^t is the swarm's best fly. Using this update equation, the swarm's population update depends on each fly's best neighbour (which is used as the focus \\\\mu , and the difference between the current fly and the best in swarm represents the spread of movement, \\\\sigma ). Other than the population size N , the only tunable parameter is the disturbance threshold \\\\Delta , which controls the dimension-wise restart in each fly vector. This mechanism is proposed to control the diversity of the swarm. Other notable minimalist swarm algorithm is Bare bones particle swarms (BB-PSO), which is based on particle swarm optimisation, along with bare bones differential evolution (BBDE) which is a hybrid of the bare bones particle swarm optimiser and differential evolution, aiming to reduce the number of parameters. Alhakbani in her PhD thesis covers many aspects of the algorithms including several DFO applications in feature selection as well as parameter tuning. == Applications == Some of the recent applications of DFO are listed below: * Optimising support vector machine kernel to classify imbalanced data * Quantifying symmetrical complexity in computational aesthetics * Analysing computational autopoiesis and computational creativity * Identifying calcifications in medical images * Building non-identical organic structures for game's space development * Deep Neuroevolution: Training Deep Neural Networks for False Alarm Detection in Intensive Care Units * Identification of animation key points from 2D-medialness maps == References == Category:Articles with example pseudocode Category:Nature-inspired metaheuristics Category:Mathematical optimization Category:Evolutionary algorithms ","title":"Dispersive flies optimisation"},{"id":"56848934","text":"The first Croatian telenovela is Villa Maria (2004‚Äì2005). == List == {  !

It opened on April 21, 2018, as the terminus of the new SL3 route. An adjacent MBTA Commuter Rail stop will open in 2021. ==HistoryB&M; station=== The Boston and Maine Railroad (B&M;) had its East Everett station at 2nd Street, serving residential areas to the southeast. The station was built by property owners and opened in 1880. Streetcars cut heavily into the profitability of local commuter rail service; the B&M; closed the station building in 1932, though some trains continued to stop. The building was demolished around 1933. By 1946, the station was served by only one weekday- only round trip. By the time the remaining local stops on the line south of Lynn were closed in 1958, East Everett was no longer being served. The residential neighborhood around 2nd Street, already planned for urban renewal, was destroyed by the Great Chelsea fire of 1973; it was replaced by industry and the Mystic Mall. ===MBTA Silver Line station=== The Silver Line station under construction in 2017 A commuter rail train passing the under- construction Silver Line station in 2017 Mystic Mall was a proposed stop on the Urban Ring Project. The Urban Ring was to be a circumferential bus rapid transit (BRT) line designed to connect the current radial MBTA rail lines, to reduce overcrowding in the downtown stations. Under draft plans released in 2008, buses would have left the dedicated busway (constructed next to existing commuter rail tracks) to access new surface-level BRT platforms on Everett Street and Spruce Street. Although the full project was shelved in 2010 due to the MBTA's financial difficulties, some corridor routes are receiving more limited work. In March 2013, the MBTA began studying an extension of the Silver Line to Chelsea via a newly constructed bypass road in East Boston. Three alternatives were discussed for the Chelsea section. One would run up the abandoned section of the Grand Junction Railroad right-of-way from Eastern Avenue to Chelsea station with stops at Eastern Avenue, Highland/Box District, Chelsea station, and Mystic Mall. The second alignment would follow the Grand Junction to just short of Bellingham Square, then diverge onto surface roads to Bellingham Square. The third alignment would run entirely on surface streets, serving two stops on Central Avenue and four stops along a loop serving the existing Chelsea station and the MGH Chelsea healthcare center. In September 2013, the MBTA indicated that it would pursue the first alternative despite potential issues with bridge clearances and rebuilding Chelsea station. On October 30, 2013, MassDOT announced $82.5 million in state funding for a modified version of the first alternative to be constructed. A new $20 million Chelsea commuter rail station would be constructed at the Mystic Mall busway terminus to replace the existing station. This new station would make the commuter rail station fully accessible, with longer platforms so that trains would not block grade crossings while stopped. The Silver Line would have a new Bellingham Square stop at the old commuter rail station location. Service was expected to begin in late 2015. A construction contract was approved in September 2014, and construction began in March 2015. By June 2017, opening had been pushed back to April 2018. Silver Line service on the SL3 branch began on April 21, 2018. ===Commuter rail station=== The MBTA opened bidding for the contract to construct the new commuter rail station (which also includes installation of several nearby traffic signals and demolition of the existing station) in February 2019, with an expected cost of $26.7 million. A $32.4 million contract was awarded in April 2019, with completion expected in late 2021. Construction of the project (which has a total cost of $37.7 million) began in August 2019. The supports for the outbound platform were completed by April 2020, and the platforms were installed that August. ==References *MBTA ‚Äì Chelsea *Station construction on Google Maps Street View Category:Chelsea, Massachusetts Category:2018 establishments in Massachusetts ","title":"Chelsea station (MBTA)"},{"id":"56848985","text":"Rick Butler is a prominent youth volleyball coach and the founder of Sports Performance Volleyball Club in Aurora, Illinois. Butler has been accused of having had sexual relationships with underage female players in his club in the 1980s. Butler has denied any wrongdoing and has never been charged with a crime. ==Background== Rick Butler was the head coach of the Chicago Breeze in Major League Volleyball. He started the Sports Performance Volleyball Club in 1981. The club has since won almost 100 national championships. ==Sexual abuse allegations== In 1995, Butler was accused of having had sexual relationships with three of his underage female players in the 1980s. The three accusers publicly came forward and detailed how Butler allegedly raped them when they were underage and he was their coach. An investigation by the Illinois Department of Children and Family Services found \\"credible evidence\\" that the accusations were true. Butler acknowledged having sexual relations with the three players, but alleges the relationships were consensual and only occurred after the players were 18 or older. The DuPage County sheriff's office did not press charges because the statute of limitations had already expired. Butler has never faced any criminal charges and has stated that these allegations are \\"an orchestrated campaign\\" to damage his reputation. ==2018 lawsuit== In March 2018, a class action lawsuit was filed against Butler and his wife by a mother of an athlete who trained at the Sports Performance Volleyball Club in 2012. The lawsuit alleges that the Butlers deceived parents and players into joining the club \\"based upon false information and material omissions\\" regarding the accusations of \\"sexual abuse of underage girls\\" by Rick Butler.. ==ReactionsUSA Volleyball=== Butler was initially banned by a USA Volleyball ethics panel from coaching girls in August 1995, but the ban was partially lifted in 2000 and Butler returned to coaching. Following a hearing by an ethics committee, Butler was banned for life by USA Volleyball in January 2018. Butler refused to participate in the hearing, calling it a \\"sham\\". ===Amateur Athletic Union=== In July 2015, following an Outside the Lines report on the previous allegations against him, Butler stepped down from his role as Illinois district director of the Amateur Athletic Union (AAU), and the AAU announced that it would conduct a review of its child-protection policies. In June 2016, the AAU was sued by one of Butler's accusers for allowing him to coach an under-18 team in the AAU Girls' Junior National Volleyball Championships. In February 2018, Butler was \\"permanently disqualified\\" from participating in AAU events. ===Others=== Nancy Reno, who played for Butler's club, said in 1999 that she believed Butler's initial three accusers because they had confided in her and other teammates at the time. Said Reno, \\"We were in denial about it because we were scared.\\" On May 15, 2018, a hearing was held by the State Senate Task Force on Sexual Discrimination and Harassment Awareness and Prevention to hear the testimony of two former volleyball players who have accused Butler of sexual assault. In an April 18, 2018 letter, ESPN Wide World of Sports announced that Butler was prohibited from participating in events held at their sport complex, including the AAU Girls' Junior National Volleyball Championships. ==References== Category:Sexual misconduct allegations Category:Sports scandals in the United States Category:Volleyball in Illinois Category:Women's volleyball in the United States ","title":"Rick Butler sexual abuse allegations"},{"id":"56848986","text":"Black Panther is a 2018 American superhero film based on the Marvel Comics character of the same name.

This plane is defined with respect to the anteroposterior and dorsoventral axes and is perpendicular to both. Because the left-right plane is not strictly an axis (as it is not established through a morphogen gradient), to create asymmetry, the left and right sides need to be patterned separately.Palmer, A. R. (2004). Symmetry breaking and the evolution of development. Science, 306(5697), 828-833 LR asymmetry is pervasive throughout metazoans and present throughout every major lineage. Notable examples include the large and small claws of the fiddler crab, the left offset of the vertebrate heart, asymmetrical gut coiling in Drosophila melanogaster, and dextral (clockwise) and sinistral (counterclockwise) coiling of gastropods. This asymmetry can be restricted to a specific organ or feature, as in the crab claws, or be expressed throughout the entire body as in snails. == Developmental basis == Components of the Nodal signaling pathway have been implicated in left-right determination in a diverse set of taxa.Levin et al. (1995). A molecular pathway determining left-right asymmetry in chick embryogenesis. Cell 82, 803-814.Coutelis, J. B., Gonz√°lez‚ÄêMorales, N., G√©minard, C., & Noselli, S. (2014). Diversity and convergence in the mechanisms establishing L/R asymmetry in metazoa. EMBO Reports, e201438972. While the mechanisms to set up the left-right sides appear to differ markedly among groups of organisms, Nodal is consistently deployed in most of the lineages that have been examined (except for ecdysozoans). In established model organisms such as mouse, chick, D. melanogaster, and Xenopus, ongoing research has begun to focus on cellular level symmetry-breaking mechanisms (e.g. cytoskeletal chirality, ciliary flow) that may lead to differential expression of molecules such as Nodal. === Vertebrates === Nodal was first described in the chick embryo, where genes activin receptor IIa, Sonic hedgehog (Shh), and chick nodal-related 1 (cNR-1) were found to be asymmetrically expressed across Hensen‚Äôs node with cnR-1 expressed on the left side. Misexpressing Shh or activin receptor IIa on the right side randomized heart asymmetry in the chick. This asymmetrical gene expression appears to be triggered by cell movements in the node. In mouse, the left side is distinguished from the right through Nodal flow. Originally described from inversus viscerum (iv) and inversion of embryonic turning (inv) mouse mutants, which are characterized by a randomization of left-right phenotypes, Nodal flow refers to the movement of nodal cilia to create a leftward flow of extraembryonic fluid. Carried in this leftward movement is Nodal, a signaling peptide from the TGF-Œ≤ family necessary to pattern left-right determination. In the lateral plate mesoderm, Nodal then activates a positive feedback loop promoting its expression and its downstream effector Pitx2. To prevent expansion to the rightward portion of the embryo, Nodal activates Lefty1 and Lefty2, which repress the Nodal signaling pathway by competing with Nodal binding sites. Because Nodal flow through ciliary movement is not present in all vertebrates (e.g. the chick), asymmetric gene expression must be established in another way. One such idea posits that ion channels and pumps (H+/K+ ATPase) generate differences in voltage and pH across the mediolateral plane, thus providing gradients to orient signaling molecules. === Non- vertebrate deuterostomes === Recently, work has shown that the Nodal-Pitx2 pathway is present and functional in the non-vertebrate deuterostomes (tunicates, sea urchins). In tunicate (ascidian) Ciona intestinalis and Halocynthia roretzi, Nodal is expressed on the left side of the developing embryo and leads to downstream expression of Pitx2. At earlier stages, similar H+/K+ ATPase ion channels are reported to be necessary for correct left-right patterning. While the role of cilia here is still unclear, one study observes that large-scale embryonic movements are required for left-right determination in H. roretzi, and that this movement is possibly achieved through ciliary movements. In the sea urchin, Nodal is expressed on the right side of the embryo, in contrast to the tunicate and vertebrate condition on the left side. Because protostomes appear to also express Nodal on their right side instead of the left (discussed below), some have suggested that this lends further evidence for the dorsoventral inversion hypothesis. === Protostomes ===  Ecdysozoa  While D. melanogaster and nematode Caenorhabditis elegans do show left-right asymmetry, the Nodal signaling pathway itself is absent in Ecdysozoa. Instead, cytoskeletal regulators such as Myo31DF, a type ID unconventional myosin, have been found to control left-right asymmetry in organ systems such as genitalia.  Lophotrochozoa  Unlike in Ecdysozoa, the Nodal-Pitx2 pathways have been identified in many lineages within the Lophotrochozoans. When found in brachiopods and molluscs, these genes are asymmetrically expressed on the right. Platyhelminthes, annelids, and nermeteans lack a Nodal orthologue and instead only express Pitx2, which was expressed in association to the nervous system. == Whole body left-right asymmetry in gastropods == Whole body inversion is observed as chiral (dextral, sinistral) coiling in gastropods. While dextral coiling is the most common as it appears in 90-99% of living species, sinistral species still have arisen many times. === Developmental basis of shell coiling === Gastropods undergo spiral cleavage, a feature commonly seen in lophotrochozoans. As the embryo divides, quartets of cells are oriented at angles to each other. In the snail Lymnaea stagnalis, the direction of rotation during the first cell division signals whether the adult will show dextral or sinistral coiling, At the third cleavage (8-cell stage), spindles in dextral snails are inclined clockwise whereas they are counterclockwise in sinistral snails. Furthermore, injecting L. peregra sinistral eggs with the cytoplasm of dextral eggs before the second polar body formation will reverse the polarity of the sinistral embryos. These data show that chirality is heritable and maternally deposited in Lymnaea. Several studies have begun to investigate the molecular basis of this inheritance. Nodal and Pitx2 are expressed on different sides of the L. stagnalis embryo depending on its chirality ‚Äì right for dextral, left for sinistral. Downstream of Nodal, decapentaplegic (dpp), shows the same expression pattern. In limpets (gastropods without coiled shells) dpp is expressed symmetrically in Patella vulgata and Nipponacmea fuscoviridis. Additionally, in N. fuscoviridis, dpp has been shown to drive cell proliferation Upstream of Nodal, Lsdia1/2 have been implicated in controlling L. stagnalis chirality. Davison et al. (2016) mapped the ‚Äúchirality locus‚Äù to a 0.4 Mb region and determined that Lsdia2 is the likely candidate for determining dextral or sinistral coiling. This is a diaphanous-related formin gene involved in cytoskeleton formation. Dextral embryos treated with drugs that inhibited formin activity phenocopied the sinistral condition. Concurrent work from Kuroda et al. (2016) identified the same Lsdia2 gene (called Lsdia1 in their study) but failed to reproduce the formin inhibition results in the Davison et al. study. Additionally, Kuroda et al. (2016) did not find asymmetrically expressed Lsdia2 as was seen in the Davison et al. (2016) study. == References == Category:Asymmetry Category:Animal anatomy ","title":"Left-right asymmetry (biology)"},{"id":"56849026","text":"The Arthur and Ellen Colgan House, at 407 Third Street in Edgemont, South Dakota, was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2017.

Nominations were announced on March 15, 2018. Jonah Ray hosted the event. Black Panther led the nominations for film with fourteen, becoming the third most nominated film in the awards' history behind Star Wars (1977) with seventeen and Star Wars: The Force Awakens (2015) with fifteen, as the film scored nominations in every eligible category (2019's Avengers: Endgame would also receive fourteen nominations the following year, sharing Black Panthers record as the third/fourth most nominated film in the awards' history); it was followed by Star Wars: The Last Jedi with thirteen, and Blade Runner 2049 and The Shape of Water with nine each. The Walking Dead led the nominations for television the fourth year in a row with seven, followed by newcomer Star Trek: Discovery with five. Seven individuals earned two nominations each, including two writing nominations for Michael Green, and nominations for both film and television for actress Danai Gurira. For film, Black Panther won the most awards with five, including Best Comic-to-Motion Picture Release and Best Director (Ryan Coogler), followed by Star Wars: The Last Jedi with three and Coco with two. For television, Better Call Saul and Twin Peaks: The Return won the most awards with three each (ending The Walking Deads four-year long streak as the top-winning series), followed by Star Trek: Discovery and The Walking Dead with two each. Notable wins include Mark Hamill's record-tying third Best Actor win for Star Wars: The Last Jedi (34 years after his second win for 1983's Return of the Jedi), making him the first person to have won three Saturn Awards for the same role in film (Robert Downey Jr. would tie this record the following year for Avengers: Endgame), and Tom Holland's second consecutive win for Best Performance by a Younger Actor for Spider-Man: Homecoming, making him the first person to win the award twice for the same role, or to win it in two consecutive years (Holland would go on to win a third the following year for 2019's Spider-Man: Far From Home, beating his own record). ==Winners and nomineesFilm=== { class= - !

By 2020, it was defunct College president Jimmy Jenkins was inspired to start WLJZ by his experience with helping start a station at Elizabeth City State University. Artists played on WLJZ include Marvin Gaye, Stevie Wonder and The Supremes. Students contribute a lot of the programming, but WLJZ will remain on the air during the summer. In the future, sponsors may help to fund the station. One plan is to have professors at the college explain music as they play it. Although the signal only covers Salisbury, a new tower is planned that will provide more coverage to Rowan County. ==References * LJZ Category:Radio stations established in 2017 Category:2017 establishments in North Carolina LJZ-LP Category:Defunct radio stations in the United States LJZ-LP ","title":"WLJZ-LP"},{"id":"56849289","text":"Small Great Things (2016) is the twenty-fifth novel by the American author, Jodi Picoult. The book focuses on race in America and revolves around the protagonist, a delivery nurse, named Ruth Jefferson. Small Great Things is being adapted into a film starring Viola Davis and Julia Roberts. This is Picoult's first novel with an African American protagonist. ==Synopsis== The story concentrates on an African-American labor/delivery (L&D;) nurse, Ruth Jefferson, in charge of newborns at a Connecticut hospital. Ruth is ordered not to touch or go near the baby of a white supremacist couple. After the baby dies in her care, Ruth is charged with murder, and taken to court. == Narrative Style == The story is told from the complex multiple racial perspectives of the principal characters, including the nurse, Ruth, Turk Bauer, the white supremacist father of the baby, and Kennedy McQuarrie, Ruth's attorney. Picoult frequently employs an alternating multi-perspective narrative style in her novels, including My Sister's Keeper, Songs of the Humpback Whale, Sing You Home, Handle With Care, Change of Heart, Lone Wolf, and The Storyteller. ==Characters== *Ruth Jefferson: A twenty-year employed nurse at Mercy-West Haven Hospital who is accused of murder when an infant dies in her care. *Edison: Ruth's son. *Adisa: Ruth's sister. *Turk Bauer: A white supremacist with swastika tattoos. *Brittany Bauer (\\"Brit\\"): Turk's wife. *Francis: Brit's father, who is a white supremacist. *Kennedy: Ruth's public defender. *Odette Lawton: The prosecutor for Ruth's case, an African- American woman. *Micah: Kennedy's husband. *Violet: Kennedy and Micah's daughter. *Wallace Mercy: A popular televangelist. ===Minor characters=== *Sam Hallowell: The man for whose family Ruth's mother works as a domestic servant. *Rachel: Adisa's birth name, which she changes as a young adult to Adisa. *Ms. Mina: The woman for whose family Ruth's mother works as a domestic servant. *Christina: Ms. Mina's daughter. She is around Ruth's age and they are friends. *Corrine: A nurse who works alongside Ruth. *Lucille: A nurse who works alongside Ruth. *Carla: A legal consultant for the hospital where Ruth works. *Jack DeNardi: An office clerk (\\"paper pusher\\") at the hospital, from whom Kennedy \\"fishes\\" information. *Judge \\"Thunder\\" Turner: The judge who presides over Ruth's court trials. *Howard: Kennedy's assistant, helps to form a legal defense for the murder trial of Ruth. *Marie: Ruth's boss at Mercy- West Haven Hospital. *Adele: Brit's mother. ==Critical reception== The novel has received positive and mixed reviews. Eleanor Brown of The Washington Post wrote that, \\"'Small Great Things' is the most important novel Jodi Picoult has ever written.

It is commonly known as the long-horned beach hopper. ==Distribution and habitat== M. californiana is native to the west coast of North America where its range extends from Vancouver Island in British Columbia to Laguna Beach, California. It is found on slightly sloping sandy beaches and retreats far up the beach, in contrast to the short-horned beach hopper (Megalorchestia corniculata) which is found on steeply sloping sandy shores and does not occur so high up the beach. ==Ecology== M. californiana tends to hide in a shallow burrow or under heaps of dead seaweed during the day, emerging at night or in dull weather to feed on decaying seaweed or organic debris left behind by beach-goers. Just before dawn the beach hoppers retreat under the sand and can sometimes be seen fighting each other for possession of an existing burrow in preference to digging a new one. ==References== Category:Gammaridea Category:Crustaceans described in 1851 ","title":"Megalorchestia californiana"},{"id":"56849333","text":"Eo Jae-sik (born 30 May 1948) is a South Korean alpine skier.

It is named after the French Minister of Foreign Affairs Maurice Schumann (not to be confused with Robert Schuman, one of the founders of the EU, the Council of Europe and NATO). == Background == In May 1967, the leaders of the six founding EC Member States ('the Six') convened at an EC summit in Rome, which was overshadowed by growing tensions in the Middle East. Even though several leaders felt that the events necessitated a common response, the Six failed to even reach agreement as to how to proceed with discussions on the matter. While Germany was in favor of debating the situation at the summit, France favoured a four-power summit consisting of the UK, the USA, the Soviet Union, and themselves. When the crisis escalated into the Six-Day War shortly after the summit, the national responses differed considerably. == Creation of the document == The EC's failure to deliver coordinated action in the midst of a major international crisis like the Six-Day War was an embarrassment to the Europeans. Economic integration had transformed the EC into a formidable economic power - yet its economic weight stood in sharp contrast to its political sway. The inability to speak with one voice in the days leading up to the Six-Day War and its aftermath together with the resignation of Charles de Gaulle in April 1969 led the EC to develop a new instrument for foreign policy coordination. The EPC was introduced in The Hague summit of December 1969 and placed the Middle East high on its agenda. This led to the drafting of the so-called Schumann document two years later. == Content == The document outlined six principles: * the establishment of demilitarized zones, in which international forces would be stationed; * an overall Israeli withdrawal from occupied territories with minor border adjustments; * the internationalization of Jerusalem; * the postponement of conclusive solution regarding the sovereignty of east Jerusalem; * the choice for the 'Arab refugees' of either returning to their home or being indemnified; * the approval of the Jarring Mission. == Reception == When its contents were leaked to the German press it was contested what the status of the document was. France claimed it represented the official policy of the Community while Germany and the Netherlands maintained it was no more than a working paper that had been prepared for discussion. == References == Category:Military history of the European Union Category:Israel‚ÄìEuropean Union relations Category:State of Palestine‚ÄìEuropean Union relations ","title":"Schumann document"},{"id":"56849382","text":"\\"The Old Refrain\\" was a Viennese popular song ostensibly written by Fritz Kreisler but was actually a transcription of an earlier work by Johann Brandl (\\"Du alter Stefansturm\\" from Der liebe Augustin) with words by Alice Mattullath. ==Covers== Over the years this very popular song has been covered over 90 times. ==References== Category:Austrian songs Category:Year of song missing Category:Jeanette MacDonald songs ","title":"The Old Refrain"},{"id":"56849383","text":"Bookouture is a British digital publishing company.

Haris Epaminonda's work incorporates collage, installation, film, and photography. Initially, Epaminonda sourced photographic images from French magazines and books from the 1940s to the 1960s. From 2005, she started focusing on black-and-white collages of illustrations of people and architecture. In 2007, she began concentrating on color images and paper. Epaminonda creates idiosyncratic image compositions, which are created by photographing found photo materials, such as in her Polaroid-Serie (2008‚Äì09). Epaminonda also makes films with a Super8 camera, which she then digitally cuts‚Äîthis, consequently, creates movie loops of different lengths. The focus of her work centers on expansive collages and multilayered installations, which result from a combination of images, films, photographs, sculptures, and found objects. The room installations have a certain orientation, but can also become a labyrinth, which sets viewers on a particular path.

Wilson was born in Nashville, Tennessee, on June 20, 1860. He was the eldest surviving son born to Richard Thornton Wilson Sr. and Melissa Clementine Johnston. His father was a multimillionaire investment banker originally from Loudon, Tennessee who served on the staff of Lucius B. Northrop, the Commissary- General of the Confederate States of America and invested in railways following the end of the War. His parents resided at 511 Fifth Avenue, the former home of Boss Tweed. Because of Wilson and his siblings' many advantageous marriages, the Wilsons were known in New York and Newport society as the \\"Marrying Wilsons.\\" His sister Grace Graham Wilson married Cornelius \\"Neily\\" Vanderbilt III of the Vanderbilt family. His brother, Richard Thornton Wilson Jr., was married to Marion Steedman Mason (1875‚Äì1947). Wilson's other two sisters, Belle Wilson, was married to the Honourable Sir Michael Henry Herbert, the British Ambassador to the United States during Theodore Roosevelt's administration and the brother of the Earl of Pembroke, and Mary Wilson, who was married to New York real estate heir, Ogden Goelet, and were the parents of Wilson's niece, Mary Goelet, who married the Duke of Roxburghe. ==Career== In 1882, Wilson graduated from Columbia University. Upon his graduation, he joined his father's firm, R. T. Wilson & Co. as a banker. Along with his wife, a daughter of New York Society leader Caroline Schermerhorn Astor, Wilson was considered a social leader in both New York and Newport, Rhode Island. He was a member of the Knickerbocker Club, the Church, and the Automobile of America. In 1894, Wilson was painted by L√©on Bonnat, in a work now owned by the Metropolitan Museum of Art. ==Personal life== 3 East 64th Street. In the early 1880s, Wilson met and fell in love with Caroline Schermerhorn \\"Carrie\\" Astor and they endeavored to be wed. As he was a son of a Southerner and Civil War profiteer, the Astors disapproved of the marriage. Reportedly, Carrie \\"starved herself into bulimia until her mother gave in and agreed to the marriage.\\" On November 18, 1884, Wilson was married Carrie Astor at the Astor mansion. Carrie, a great-granddaughter of John Jacob Astor, was the youngest daughter of William Backhouse Astor Jr. and Caroline Schermerhorn Astor, leader of the \\"Four Hundred\\". Among her siblings was brother Colonel John Jacob Astor IV, who died aboard the RMS Titanic. Together, Orme and Carrie had two sons; Marshall Orme Wilson Jr. in 1885‚Äîwho was appointed United States Ambassador to Haiti by President Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1944‚Äîand Richard Thornton Wilson III in 1886. Wilson died on April 1, 1926, in New York City. His funeral service was held at the Trinity Chapel on 25th Street and was officiated by Bishop William T. Manning where the choir of Trinity Church sang the hymns \\"Nearer, My God, to Thee.\\" He was buried at Woodlawn Cemetery in the Bronx. In his will, his wife received their residence and all of its belongings, and his sons inherited the residual estate, including the funds left by his father in trust for his sons, thereby avoiding Federal or State inheritance tax on the principal. ===Residences=== After his marriage to Carrie, the couple moved into a new home at 414 Fifth Avenue purchased by her father for them as a wedding present and furnished by his father. Following his mother-in-law and brother-in-law's feud with Carrie's cousin William Waldorf Astor, Wilson hired the architectural firm of Warren and Wetmore to design a residence on East 64th Street. The house, which began construction in 1900 was completed in 1903, was in close proximity of other Astor family residences, including Mrs. Astor's home designed by Richard Morris Hunt around the corner on the northeast corner of Fifth Avenue and 65th Street. The residence had a Beaux Arts facade of Indiana Limestone and a mansard roof of blue slate and is five stories tall, sixty-five feet wide consisting of five bays, and featured a circular atrium. ==NotesReferences * Category:1860 births Category:1926 deaths Category:American bankers Category:Columbia University alumni Category:Businesspeople from New York City Category:People from Nashville, Tennessee Category:People from Manhattan ","title":"Marshall Orme Wilson"},{"id":"56849414","text":"Mehdi Mouidi (born 24 October 1940) is a Moroccan alpine skier.

He is also known as Louis Bouwmeester Sr. for distinction from his son. He performed several times in Vienna, London and Paris, and became popular. From 1873 to 1879 he was director of the Salon des Vari√©t√©s in Amsterdam. In 1882 he received from Willem III the gold medal for Arts and Sciences. In 1902 he became director of the Haarlems Theater Company. He was strong actor in melodramas such as De twee wezen (The Two Orphans). Nico de Jong gave a short speech following the death of Louis Bouwmeester. He called Bouwmeester \\"the friend of the Dutch theater players, an artist by God's grace, whose name will be mentioned after centuries\\". After his speech he asked the attendees to stand up for a moment in reverence for the deceased and to agree with him in his wish: \\"Louis Bouwmeester, rest in peace\\". The actor's death was discussed in various theaters in the Netherlands. His career was described as \\"extraordinary for triumph and for variety\\". The stage award, the Louis d'Or, which has been awarded to the best male supporting role since 1955, was named after Bouwmeester. Louis Bouwmeester was buried at the Zorgvlied cemetery in Amsterdam. His tomb was damaged by the end of the 20th century, a new monument was erected in the image of the old. ==References== Category:1842 births Category:1925 deaths Category:20th-century Dutch male actors Category:19th- century Dutch male actors Category:Dutch male stage actors Category:People from Middelharnis ","title":"Louis Bouwmeester"},{"id":"56849569","text":"Hot Springs School District may refer to: *Hot Springs School District (Arkansas) *Hot Springs School District (South Dakota) ","title":"Hot Springs School District"},{"id":"56849580","text":"Mootwingee County.

She continued her education and graduated in 2013 from the three-year postgraduate art school at the Royal Academy of Arts, RA, in London, studying with artists Richard Kirwan, Brian Griffiths and Vanessa Jackson. While still at the RA Ramsden's first solo gallery show was held in 2012 at Pilar Corrias and a second was held there in January 2015. In 2016‚Äì2017, Ramsden's first museum solo exhibition, titled \\"Mary Ramsden: (In / It)\\" was held at the Aspen Art Museum. The title of the exhibition was inspired by a Marianne Moore poem \\"Poetry\\" and a line break that is found in the poem. Her abstract, painterly works combine gestural marks with amoeba- like shapes. Though seemingly simple and seamlessly assimilated, Ramsden's paintings are structured with a subtle thoughtfulness that allows for contemplative consideration. With slight, deliberate adjustments in color, mark-making, and scale, her works depict a progressive language that draws viewers in to examine each smudge and detail. Most of the artist's pieces are dominated by a single color, while other hues push towards the edges of the surface. In more recent pieces, Ramsden has begun generating multifaceted, meditative compositions by applying and then wiping away multiple layers of paint. == References == Category:1984 births Category:Living people Category:21st-century British painters Category:21st-century British women artists Category:Alumni of the Edinburgh College of Art Category:Alumni of the Royal Academy Schools Category:British women painters ","title":"Mary Ramsden"},{"id":"56849666","text":"Kathryn Croft is a British author of psychological thriller fiction.

Her mother is an artist and her father was a Jewish doctor in the United States Army and stationed in Germany during her youth. As a child, she took dance lessons and would attend dress rehearsals at the D√ºsseldorf Ballet where her aunt, Bernhild Thormaehlen, was a dancer. Dancers and performers feature frequently in Friedman's works, such as Dancer (2011), Play (Parts 1 & 2) (2013), Rite (2014), and Mother Drum (2015‚Äì16). She received her BA from Vassar College in 1990, and studied at the St√§delshule in Frankfurt from 1989‚Äì91. In 1994 she received an MFA, Motion Pictures from the School of Communication at the University of Miami. Friedman studied under Austrian artist and Structural film pioneer Peter Kubelka, and describes her work as a form of poetry that communicates visually without a reliance on verbal or traditional, narrative storytelling. In 1992, she moved to Miami where she continues to participate as an active member in the artistic community. == Work and career == \\"Bim Bam,\\" 1999, 16mm film installation with two slot-loading projectors, metal armature and non-sync sound Friedman's film and video work is regarded for its ability to reduce film to its most basic, material essences in ways that create emotionally compelling, visceral experiences. She often works in 16mm and Super 8 film formats, although also using standard and high-definition cameras. A rigorous planning and editing process creates a visceral visual experience that is complemented by the unpredictability of the human subjects she often works with. The artist establishes relationships with the people who perform directly for her camera, sometimes identified through a casting call, in order to create intimate filming environments that capture an element of natural spontaneity. Although these films do not have linear narratives, the calculated presentation of bodies in motion encourages the viewer to connect with the subjects and places on screen. Since the 1990s, Friedman has created film, videos, and installations that integrate these elements of structured and dynamic visuals. She is represented by Gavin Brown's enterprise, who has consistently featured Friedman's work since 1998. == Exhibitions == The artist's first mid-career survey was organized by the P√©rez Art Museum Miami by Ren√© Morales in 2017, and featured fifteen installations of her video works spanning the course of twenty years. === Solo exhibitions === Solo exhibitions of Friedman's work have also include: * 1998: Dara Friedman: Total, Museum of Contemporary Art, Chicago * 2001: Dara Friedman, SITE Santa Fe * 2002: Dara Friedman, Kunstmuseum Thun * 2005: Dara Friedman: Sunset Island, The Kitchen * 2007: Musical, Public Art Fund * 2009: Musical, The Museum of Modern Art * 2009: Shooting Gallery, Julia Stoschek Collection * 2012: Dara Friedman: Dancer, Contemporary Art Museum, Raleigh * 2012: Dara Friedman: Dancer, Miami Art Museum * 2013: Dara Friedman: Dancer, Centre for Contemporary Art Ujazdowski Castle * 2013: Hammer Projects: Dara Friedman, Hammer Museum * 2014: Dara Friedman: Projecting, Museum of Contemporary Art Detroit * 2014: Play (Parts 1 & 2), Hammer Museum * 2017: Mother Drum, Aspen Art Museum * 2018: Dara Friedman: Perfect Stranger Perez Modern Art Museum * 2019/20: Dara Friedman: Temple Door - Kunstverein Harburger Bahnhof, Hamburg, Germany == Collections == Among the public collections holding work by Friedman are the Austrian Film Museum, Vienna; Bard College, Annandale-on-Hudson, New York; Hammer Museum, Los Angeles; Institute of Contemporary Art, Miami; Museum of Modern Art, New York; P√©rez Art Museum Miami; Saint Louis Museum of Art; and the Whitney Museum of American Art, New York. == Awards == Friedman has been recognized with the following awards: * 2019: Guggenheim Fellowship * 2016: South Florida Cultural Consortium Fellowship * 2012: Hammer Museum Artist Residency * 2000: Rome Prize, American Academy in Rome * 1999: Louis Comfort Tiffany Foundation Grant * 1998: South Florida Cultural Consortium Fellowship * 1997: New Forms Miami, Miami-Dade Department of Cultural Affairs == Personal life == Friedman is married to artist Mark Handforth.

In 2016 and 2017, China was among the top 20 worldwide producers of coffee. Ninety-eight per cent of the coffee grown in China comes from Yunnan province. ==History== A French missionary brought coffee to Yunnan province in the late 19th century, marking the crop's introduction to China. However, the modern Chinese coffee cultivation industry began in 1988 when the Chinese government, World Bank and the United Nations Development Programme jointly initiated a program to introduce coffee growing in the region. Nestl√© also arrived early in Yunnan to encourage the cultivation of coffee. Hogood Coffee, the largest domestic instant coffee maker, was founded in 2007 and has been responsible for cultivating much of the coffee in the Dehong region. Hogood capitalizes on relaxed land use policies in Yunnan which have allowed farm land consolidation through contract farming schemes; seedlings are planted by Hogood and harvested by farmers of the beans that are in the end purchased by Hogood. In 2013, Yunnan Coffee Traders became the region's first dedicated specialty coffee exporter; they are now (2018) the largest exporter of Yunnan specialty coffee in China. Domestic coffee consumption in China rose in parallel with an increase in domestic coffee production; from 2006 to 2017, Chinese coffee consumption had grown by an annual average of 22%. White-collar workers are the main force of coffee consumption. In a survey, white-collar workers accounted for 30% of the total, which is the largest consumer group ‚Äî followed by the government official, school staff and people who work for the organizations, accounting for 15%. The proportion of freelancers and coffee practitioners is close to that of public institutions.Article in SOHU ==Planting and varieties== Coffee from Yunnan province, Menglian Region (Fuyan Farm) exported by Yunnan Coffee Traders and Roasted by Django. Almost all domestic coffee comes from Yunnan, accounting for 98% of production. The main regions within Yunnan for coffee production are Baoshan, Dehong, and Menglian in Pu'er. Pu'er alone accounts for 60% of the country's total production. Other provinces where coffee is grown include Fujian and Hainan. Fujian and Hainan mainly grow robusta, while Yunnan grows arabica, with catimor (a caturra-Timor hybrid) as the varietal of choice. ==Marketing and trade== In Yunnan about half of the crop went to export markets in 2016, generating $280 million in earnings. Most Chinese coffee beans are commercial grade and exports are primarily green beans sent to European markets. The United States is also an export market for Chinese beans, with Starbucks purchasing more than half of the coffee imported into the U.S. from China in January-September 2014. Major trading houses like Volcafe, the coffee arm of London-based commodities trader ED&F; Man with an office in Yunnan, and Miami-based commodities trader Coex, source from China to balance deficits in supply from traditional exporting countries during years of drought or crop rust. The emergence of dedicated specialty coffee farming commenced around 2009 under early adopters such as Hu Xixiang from Mangzhang Farms in Menglian (Pu‚Äôer), Yunnan alongside the support of industry professionals such as Timothy Heinze, Joshua Jagelman, and Saxon Wright. While specialty coffee production in China is still less than 2% of total volumes, China's recent selection (2018) as the portrait country at the world's largest Specialty Coffee trade show held by the Specialty Coffee Association emphasizes the growing recognition of China as producer of specialty grade coffees. Chongqing has emerged as the largest domestic trading hub for coffee. The Chongqing Coffee Exchange was established by the Chongqing Energy Group as a trading platform for both home grown and Southeast Asia sourced coffee. The exchange takes advantage of Chongqing's role as a transportation hub. The city is the starting point of the Chongqing- Xinjiang-Europe freight train, a corridor of the Belt and Road Initiative. Pu‚Äôer City also saw the establishment of a coffee trading hub when Yunnan Coffee Exchange started operations in January 2016. == See also == * Coffee wars in China == Notes == China Category:Agricultural production in China by commodity Category:Economy of Yunnan ","title":"Coffee production in China"},{"id":"56849814","text":"Emanuela Abbadessa (born Catania, August 4, 1964) is an Italian writer.

fins located on the ventral surface of fish. The paired pelvic fins are homologous to the hindlimbs of tetrapods. == Structure and function  Structure === In actinopterygians, the pelvic fin consists of two endochondrally-derived bony girdles attached to bony radials. Dermal fin rays (lepidotrichia) are positioned distally from the radials. There are three pairs of muscles each on the dorsal and ventral side of the pelvic fin girdle that abduct and adduct the fin from the body. Pelvic fin structures can be extremely specialized in actinopterygians. Gobiids and lumpsuckers modify their pelvic fins into a sucker disk that allow them to adhere to the substrate or climb structures, such as waterfalls. In priapiumfish, males have modified their pelvic structures into a spiny copulatory device that grasps the female during mating.Shibukawa, Koichi, Dinh Dac Tran, and Loi Xuan Tran. \\"Phallostethus cuulong, a new species of priapiumfish (Actinopterygii: Atheriniformes: Phallostethidae) from the Vietnamese Mekong.\\" Zootaxa 3363.1 (2012): 45-51. File:Pelvic fin skeleton.pngPelvic fin skeleton for Danio rerio, zebrafish. File:Zuignap waarmee de zwartbekgrondel zich vastzuigt.JPGGobiids have modified their pelvic fins into adhesive suckers. File:Spiny lumpsucker (Eumicrotremus orbis).jpgLumpsuckers use their modified pelvic fins to adhere to the substrate. === Function === In actinopterygian steady state swimming, the pelvic fins are actively controlled and used to provide powered corrective forces. Careful timing of the pelvic fin movement during whole-body movements allows the pelvic fins to generate forces that dampen the forces from the entire body, therefore stabilizing the fish. For maneuvers, electromyogram data shows that pelvic fin muscles are activated after the start of the maneuver, indicating that the fins are used more for stabilization instead of generating the maneuver. In rays and skates, pelvic fins can be used for \\"punting,\\" where they asynchronously or synchronously push off the substrate to propel the animal forwards. == Development == Unlike limb development in tetrapods, where the forelimb and hindlimb buds emerge at roughly the same timepoint, the pelvic fin bud emerges much later than the pectoral fin. While the pectoral fin bud is apparent at 36 hours post fertilization (hpf) in zebrafish, the pelvic fin bud is only clear at around 21 days post fertilization (dpf), roughly when the animal is 8 mm in length. The pelvic fin appears at roughly 21 days post fertilization in zebrafish In zebrafish, the pelvic fin bud starts as a mesenchymal condensation that forms an apical ectodermal thickening. A fin fold forms from this thickening, which is then invaded by migratory mesenchyme, separating the fin bud into the proximal mesenchyme (which will give rise to the endoskeletal girdle and radials) and the distal mesenchyme (which will give rise to dermal fin rays). == References == Category:Fish anatomy ","title":"Pelvic fin"},{"id":"56849864","text":"Polypedilum sordens is a species of midge in the family Chironomidae. ==ReferencesFurther reading== * * * ==External links== * * Category:Chironomidae Category:Articles created by Qbugbot Category:Insects described in 1874 ","title":"Polypedilum sordens"},{"id":"56849879","text":"Emmanuelle de Villepin (born 1959) is a French writer.

He showed high-class form as a juvenile in 1911 when he won the Triennial Stakes at Royal Ascot and the Richmond Stakes at Goodwood as well as finishing second in the Middle Park Plate and third in the July Stakes. In the following spring he recorded his biggest success on his seasonal reappearance when he took the 2000 Guineas. He failed when favourite for the Epsom Derby and never won again although he finished second in both the St James's Palace Stakes and the Sussex Stakes. After his retirement from racing he had some success as a breeding stallion. ==Background== Sweeper was a chestnut horse bred in France by his American owner Herman Duryea. Like several major American owners Duryea had moved most of his hoses to Europe following the passing of the Hart‚ÄìAgnew Law. The colt was sent to England and entered training Henry Seymour \\"Atty\\" Persse at Chattis Hill near Stockbridge in Hampshire. Physically, Sweeper was described as a \\"golden chestnut, rather dipped in his back, but with rare limbs and a lovely action\\". Sweeper was sired by Broomstick, an American horse who won the Travers Stakes in 1904 and later became a three-time champion sire. His dam Ravello was bred in England before being exported to the United States (where she was sold for 120 guineas) and producing Frank Gill,whose wins included the Travers and Withers Stakes. Ravello was a granddaughter of Genuine, a broodmare whose other descendants included Nijinsky and El Gran Senor. ==Racing career1911: two-year-old season=== In June 1911 Sweeper was sent to Royal Ascot for the 59th Triennial Stakes and looked to be \\"a real flyer\\" as he won easily from Jaeger. At Newmarket Racecourse he came home third in the July Stakes behind an unnamed colt (later given the name White Star) owned by Solomon Joel. In the following month the colt contested the Richmond Stakes at Goodwood Racecourse in which he was ridden by the French jockey Georges Stern and won at odds of 11/10. On 13 October in the Middle Park Plate over six furlongs at Newmarket Sweeper finished second to Absurd with White Star in third. At the end of the year he was rated the fourth best two-year-old colt in England behind Absurd, White Star and Lomond. ===1912: three-year-old season=== Herman B. Duryea, who owned and bred Sweeper On 1 May 1912 Sweeper started at odds of 6/1 in a fourteen-runner field for the 104th running of the 2000 Guineas over the Rowley Mile at Newmarket. Ridden by Danny Maher, he settled behind the leaders as Jaeger set the pace from the favourite White Star. He took the lead two furlongs from the finish and won by a length from Jaeger with Hall Cross half a length away in third. Sweeper started favourite for the Derby over one and a half miles at Epsom on 5 June, but never looked likely to win an finished seventh as the filly Tagalie won from Jaeger and Tracery. At Royal Ascot late in June Sweeper was dopped back in distance and started odds-on favourite for the St James's Palace Stakes over one mile but was beaten into second place by Tracery. At the same meeting he came home second behind Hector in the Triennial Stakes, with Jaeger in third place. In July he finished second by a neck to the King's colt Le Lac in the Dullingham Plate over one and a half miles at Newmarket and then finished runner-up yet again when chasing home Tracery in the Sussex Stakes at Goodwood. On 11 September Sweeper contested the St Leger Stakes over fourteen and a half furlongs at Doncaster Racecourse and rated at oddsof 12.5/1 in a fourteen-runner field. He raced just behind the leaders until half way, but then quickly dropped out of contention and finished unplaced behind Tracery. ==Assessment and honours== In their book, A Century of Champions, based on the Timeform rating system, John Randall and Tony Morris rated Sweeper an \\"inferior\\" winner of the 2000 Guineas. ==Stud record== After his retirement from racing Sweeper stood as a breeding stallion in France and the United States. The most successful of his offspring was the American gelding Osmand, who won two editions of the Carter Handicap. More influential however was Ondulation, a broodmare whose descendants included Dahlia and Rail Link. Sweeper died in 1923 and his last foals were born in 1924. ==PedigreeReferences== Category:1909 racehorse births Category:1923 racehorse deaths Category:Racehorses bred in France Category:Racehorses trained in the United Kingdom Category:Thoroughbred family 8-f Category:2000 Guineas winners ","title":"Sweeper (horse)"},{"id":"56849908","text":"Graphorn is a genus of shield bug found in Argentina.
