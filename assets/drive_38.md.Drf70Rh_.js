His theory of electrolysis is considered the first description of the so-called Grotthuss mechanism. ==Life and work== Protons are transferred across a series of hydrogen bonds between hydronium ions and water molecules. Grotthuss was born in 1785 in Leipzig, Germany, during an extended stay of his parents away from their home in northern Lithuania. He showed interest in natural sciences and went to study first in Leipzig and later in Paris at the École Polytechnique. Several renowned scientists taught at the École Polytechnique at that time, including Antoine François, comte de Fourcroy, Claude Louis Berthollet and Louis Nicolas Vauquelin. Because of some tensions in the relations between Russia and France, Grotthuss had to leave for Italy where he stayed at Naples for one year. The discovery of the first electric cell in 1800 by Alessandro Volta provided the scientists a source of electricity which was used in various laboratory experiments around Europe. The electrolysis of water, acids and salt solutions was reported, but a good explanation was missing. Grotthuss actively contributed to this area both in terms of electrolysis experiments and their interpretation. During his stay in Italy, he published his work on electrolysis in 1806. His idea that the charge is not transported by the movement of particles but by breaking and reformation of bonds was the first basically correct concept for the charge transport in electrolytes; it is still valid for the charge transport in water, and the current proton hopping mechanism is a modified version of the original Grotthuss mechanism. The following two years Grotthuss spent in Rome, some other Italian cities, and Paris, and then went back to Russia via Munich and Vienna. From 1808 on he lived at the estate of his mother in northern Lithuania. There he conducted research on electricity and light with the limited research equipment he could assemble. Grotthuss committed suicide in the spring of 1822 during a depression caused by health problems. ==See also== *Grotthuss–Draper law *List of photochemists ==References== ==Further reading== * * * - See pages 296 – 306 and 342 – 344 in volume 1 of the 1980 English translation (Amerind Publishing Company, New Delhi, N.

He founded the British and Foreign Anti- Slavery Society (now Anti-Slavery International). He worked throughout his life in Radical political actions supporting pacifism, working-class rights, and the universal emancipation of slaves. In the late 1830s, he published two books about the apprenticeship system in Jamaica, which helped persuade the British Parliament to adopt an earlier full emancipation date. In Jamaica, Sturge also helped found Free Villages with the Baptists, to provide living quarters for freed slaves; one was named \\"Sturge Town\\" in his memory. ==Early life== He was the fourth child in the family of 12 of Joseph Sturge, a farmer in Elberton, Gloucestershire, and his wife Mary Marshall, who belonged to the Religious Society of Friends (commonly known as Quakers). His brothers included John Sturge, who became a manufacturer in Birmingham, and Edmund Sturge. The abolitionist and pacifist Sophia Sturge (1795–1845) was his sister, and Charles Gilpin was a nephew. After a year at school in Thornbury, Sturge boarded for three years at the Quaker Sidcot School. He then farmed with his father, and on his own account. Of pacifist views, he refused in 1813 to serve in the militia. Failing at first to earn a living as a corn factor, at Bewdley from 1814, Sturge moved to Birmingham in 1822. There he became an importer of grain. Successful in business, with his brother Charles, he built up the company. The Sturges as a family became investors in railways and docks. Joseph from 1831 ceased to be an active partner, leaving operations to Charles, and concentrated on causes and public life. As an abolitionist, he was allied in 1831 with George Stephen in pressing Parliament for immediate legislation against slavery. The Reform Act 1832, in his view, failed to address poverty, and he worked for radical electoral reform. Sturge was appointed an alderman in 1835. He opposed the building of the Birmingham Town Hall, to be used for performances, because of a conscientious objection to religious oratorios. He became interested in the island of Jamaica and the conditions of its enslaved workers. He visited it several times and witnessed firsthand the horrors of slavery, as well as the abuses under an apprenticeship system designed to control the labour of all former slaves above the age of six for 12 years. He worked for emancipation and abolition with African-Caribbean and English Baptists. In 1838, after full emancipation was authorised, Sturge laid the foundation stone to the \\"Emancipation School Rooms\\" in Birmingham. Attending were United Baptist Sunday School and Baptist ministers of the city. In 1839 his work was honoured by a marble monument in a Baptist mission chapel in Falmouth, Jamaica. It was dedicated to \\"the Emancipated Sons of Africa\\". ==Campaign against indentured apprenticeship== After legislation for the abolition of slavery in the British dominions was enacted in 1833, slave-owning planters in the West Indies lobbied to postpone freedom for adults for twelve years in a form of indenture. Enslaved children under the age of six were emancipated by the new law on 1 August 1834, but older children and adults had to serve a period of bonded labour or \\"indentured apprenticeship\\". Sturge led a campaign against this delaying mechanism. He was supported by William Allen, Lord Brougham, and others. In a speech to the House of Lords, Brougham acknowledged Sturge's central role at that time in rousing British anti-slavery opinion. In 1834 Sturge sailed to the West Indies to study apprenticeship as defined by the British Emancipation Act of 1833. He intended to open it to criticism as an intermediate stage en route to emancipation. He traveled throughout the West Indies and talked directly to apprentices, proprietors (planters), and others directly involved. Upon his return to Great Britain, he published Narrative of Events since the First of August 1834; In it he cited an African-Caribbean witness, to whom he referred as \\"James Williams\\" to protect him from reprisals. The original statement was signed by two free African-Caribbeans and six apprentices, and was authenticated by an English Baptist minister Thomas Price of Hackney, who wrote the introduction. Following another trip and further study, Sturge published The West Indies in 1837. Both books highlighted the cruelty and injustice of the system of indentured apprenticeship. They reported on the abuse of apprentices, and the way the treadmill was used in prisons, and by 1840 changes had been made. Whilst in Jamaica, Sturge worked with the Baptist chapels to found Free Villages, to create homes for freed slaves when they achieved full emancipation. They planned the communities to be outside the control of planters. As a result of Sturge's single-minded campaign, in which he publicised details of the brutality of apprenticeship to shame the British Government, a major row broke out amongst abolitionists. The more radical element were pitted against the government. Although both had the same ends in sight, Sturge and the Baptists, with mainly Nonconformist support, led a successful popular movement for immediate and full emancipation. As a consequence, the British Government moved the date for full emancipation forward to 1 August 1838. They abolished the 12-year intermediary apprenticeship scheme. For many English Nonconformists and African-Caribbean people, 1 August 1838, became recognised as the true date of abolition of slavery in the British Empire. ==International anti-slavery campaign== Sturge in the painting The Anti-Slavery Society Convention, 1840 by Benjamin Robert Haydon. From left to right: Vice Admiral Constantine Richard Moorsom, Sturge, John Keep (American delegate), Joseph Eaton. Top left G.K.Prince and top right, James Dean (another American). In 1837, keen to act independently of the consensus in the Anti-Slavery Society, Sturge founded the Central Negro Emancipation Committee. More significantly, in 1839, one year after abolition in the British dominions, Sturge led a small group who founded the British and Foreign Anti-Slavery Society to put an end to slavery worldwide. It continues today as Anti-Slavery International. The Society's first major activity was to organise the World's Anti-Slavery Convention. It was held at the Freemasons' Hall, London, from 12 June 1840. Others were held in 1843 (Brussels) and 1849 (Paris).\\"The history of Anti-Slavery International\\" , Official Website, accessed 12 July 2008 It attracted delegates from Europe, North America, South Africa and Caribbean countries, as well as the British dominions of Australia and Ireland. It included African-Caribbean delegates from Haiti and Jamaica (then representing Britain), women activists from the United States, and many Nonconformists. In 1841 Sturge travelled in the United States with the poet John Greenleaf Whittier to examine the slavery question there. On his return he published A Visit to the United States in 1841 (1842). On the same visit (22 May), he saw William Jay who was interested in forwarding the peace agenda, by international arbitration. ==The 1843 London Peace Congress== The Peace Congress of June 1843 held in London resulted from proposal made by Sturge to the American Peace Society in 1841, intended to propagate the ideas of William Jay. A preliminary meeting was held in London in 1842, and the decision was taken that the Peace Congress should follow directly on from the second Anti-Slavery Convention. Sturge ended up organising both, after the death of Nun Morgan Harry (1800–1842). The Peace Congress took place 22–24 June 1843, and formally was the responsibility of the London Peace Society. The resolution of the Congress mentioned Jay's ideas positively, but laid more weight on those of William Ladd, who had died in 1841, proposing international institutions to keep the peace. ==Politics and Chartism== In parallel with his other activism, Sturge joined the Anti-Corn Law League early in its existence. During 1842 he began a campaign for \\"complete suffrage\\", and had the support of the Christian Chartist pastor Arthur George O'Neill in Birmingham. His movement was based squarely on the middle classes. He envisaged a platform that could unite the League and the Chartist movement. The League would have nothing to do with it. Sturge had a measure of further Chartist and nonconformist support, but by the end of the year the Chartist leaders William Lovett and Feargus O'Connor had swung against him. O'Connor had supported Sturge's Complete Suffrage Union earlier in the year, before the industrial conflicts of the Plug Riots had hardened Chartist attitudes. In the years 1842–7 Sturge ran three times for Parliament, on his \\"complete suffrage\\" platform, without success. In August 1842 he was parliamentary candidate for Nottingham, in a by-election. He was defeated by John Walter, the proprietor of The Times. In Nottingham he visited a Sunday School run by Samuel Fox. The idea of teaching not only scripture, but also basic skills such as reading and writing, was taken up by Sturge, who opened a similar school around 1845.First Day Schools, sturgefamily.com, accessed January 2010 In that year he started an Adult School movement, in Birmingham, and took steps in 1847 to spread Sunday (First-Day) Schools among Quakers. Sturge then contested Birmingham in 1844 as a Chartist candidate, in a by-election caused by the death of Joshua Scholefield. He was strongly supported at the election hustings, split the liberal vote, but ultimately came bottom of the poll: Richard Spooner [Cons] 2095, William Scholefield [Lib] 1735 and Sturge [Chartist] 346).http://www.britishnewspaperarchive.co.uk/viewer/bl/0000532/18440720/007/0002 In 1847 he stood once more, for , in the general election. There he was identified as \\"Bainesite\\" – a follower of Edward Baines – and was campaigning for schooling, with no state involvement, a divisive position in the British and Foreign School Society. ==Later life== Sturge took up the cause of peace and arbitration being pioneered by Henry Richard. He was instrumental in the founding of the Morning Star in 1855 as a newspaper through which to promote the Peace Society and his other social ideas. In 1854 Sturge and two other Quakers, Robert Charleton and Henry Pease, travelled to St Petersburg to see Tzar Nicholas I, trying to prevent the outbreak of the Crimean War. In 1856 Sturge and Thomas Harvey visited the Grand Duchy of Finland to investigate the damage caused by the Royal Navy and French Navy gunboats, in attacks during the Crimean War. On this trip Sturge bought Robert Wilhelm Ekman's painting Sunday Morning in a Farmhouse, which was shown in the exhibition of the Royal Academy of Arts in 1858. The painting was brought back to Finland in 1960.Ilvas, Juha (1989): Kansallistaidetta – Suomalaista taidetta Kansallis- Osake-Pankin kokoelmissa .

Sara also appeared in a Turner Network Television live-action feature film and TV series of the same name and she was portrayed by Yancy Butler. She is an NYPD homicide detective whose life changed when she came into contact with a powerful ancient weapon known as the Witchblade, which bestows its wielder with supernatural powers. ==Fictional biography== Sara Magdalene Pezzini was born November 18, 1970, and is of Italian descent. Her major enemies are Kenneth Irons and Ian Nottingham. As one of the current hosts of the Witchblade, Sara has been granted many unique abilities, including the power and ability to heal herself, to create (often very revealing) armor over her skin (as the Witchblade tends to rip away all of her clothes), to shoot energy blasts, to extend razor sharp tendrils and even winged flight. She has yet to explore the full limits of the Witchblade, and thus does not know what other mystical magical abilities it possesses. When not overly active, the Witchblade can assume the form of a bracelet, allowing her to wear the entity without drawing attention. The Witchblade is a male entity of both light and dark which represents both order and chaos. It is the offspring of the Angelus and the Darkness; as such, Sara does not have complete control over its actions and reactions. Sara first appeared in Cyblade/Shi: The Battle for Independents #1 (January 1995). She had wanted nothing more in her life than to be a good cop. As a homicide detective in New York City, life was challenging enough, but for Sara, those were simpler times. While on an undercover case at the Rialto Theater, both she and her partner, Michael Yee (named Danny Woo in the TV series), were mortally wounded. At this same theater was a man named Kenneth Irons, who had brought a gauntlet known as the Witchblade. Irons was in search of the secrets to unlocking his full power and ability. While Sara lay dying, the Witchblade made his choice to include her in the long line of women that he has shared his power with. The entity healed Sara's wounds and allowed her to survive the resulting confrontation. Since then, she has seen many things she never knew existed, fought creatures that have no place on Earth, and longed for the days of a typical NYPD detective. But she continues her struggle with the Witchblade, believing that she can do more good with the entity than without. So the battle for control continues, as Sara learns more about this entity and struggles to stem his violent nature. Some of Sara's allies include the Magdalena, Lara Croft, Vampirella, and Jackie Estacado. Two crossovers pitted her against Wolverine and the titular creatures from the Alien and Predator franchises. In the comics recently, Sara has been through a grueling ordeal fighting off a giant demon (a false \\"god\\" summoned by a group of priests), in the midst of which her partner, Jake McCarthy, was left wounded. Before losing consciousness, Jake professed his love for Sara and told her that he always knew about her double life. He now remains in a coma, and Sara has had to deal with a nosy new partner, Patrick Gleason, who has already discovered many of her secrets. Gleason saved her life and it had begun to look like they may become more than just partners, but their sexual date was interrupted when Ian Nottingham abruptly returned to Sara's life. After a minor crisis that led to the death of Sara's good friend and loyal partner; Jake, Sara discovered she was pregnant. Sara was completely confounded at how this occurred – due primarily to the fact she has not had sex in over a year. Sara, initially feeling she was not ready to be a mother, nevertheless decided to keep the baby, but decided as a result she could not keep the Witchblade as well. Sara relinquished it on to Danielle Baptiste, a young woman she had recently met who was its next chosen bearer. When she was due to give birth, the father of her child was revealed – it was Jackie Estacado, who, possessed by the Darkness itself, was driven to seek out and have sex with Sara's comatose body, and, with Jackie's body used for the necessary biology, leading to the conception of their baby – a child to upset the balance between the dark and light. Sara gives birth to a baby girl, but is on the verge of death. Danielle then ends up sharing part of the Witchblade with Sara, which saves Sara's life. Hope, Sara and Jackie's daughter, drives off the Angelus and in the end Sara, now wielding half the Witchblade, and her friends return to their lives. This pregnancy has caused an attraction between Jackie and Sara that has manifested itself as romantic and even sexual. Later, a major conflict erupts between Sara and Danielle, with Sara under the control of the Darkness portion of the Witchblade. During this time Sara became increasingly irrational, angry and would often mistreat the people around her, however she did display more increased control over the entity demonstrating abilities usually associated with the Darkness (summoning dark-based objects, creating Darklings etc.). Manipulated by an old enemy of the Curator, Sara re-took all of the Witchblade in a battle with Danielle. However Sara was saved when Danielle was chosen as the next Angelus host and cleansed her of the Darkness' influence, restoring Sara to her former self. While Sara attempts to redeem herself for her crimes under the Darkness-half of the Witchblade, an Internal Affairs agent named Phipps discovered the truth about the Witchblade through Jake McCarthy's diary. He confronted Sara, demanding that she either resign as a detective or give up the Witchblade if she doesn't want to be exposed. Sara chose the former. She then moves to Chicago, working as a private investigator. Top Cow has stated Witchblade will end in issue #185, which will mark the end of Sara's story as wielder of the Witchblade and she will attempt to find a suitable successor. Sara will appear in the relaunch of The Darkness in a supporting role. ==Powers and abilities== As a police detective, Sara has undergone basic training and remains in exceptional physical shape. She is likewise a skilled hand-to-hand combatant and markswoman, able to hold her own in a gunfight as well as against physical opponents noticeably larger and stronger than herself. Sara has also showcased considerable skill as an investigative detective. She's usually adept at spotting small details and piecing together evidence. Since coming into contact with the mystical, she's had to hone her detective skill to compensate with varying degrees of success. As the host of the Witchblade, she was granted a vast array of supernatural abilities, such as; forming various weapons (swords, other stabbing weapons, hooks, chains, shields), jump to heights higher than most humans could jump to, generate a full body armor in order to protect herself, increase her strength to abnormal levels that exceed 500 pounds (should the situation arise, she can also form wings allowing flight), shoot energy blasts from the gauntlet, fire projectile darts, and whip-like grapples to attack or to climb. The Witchblade is also an excellent lock pick, and can heal wounds, even near- fatal ones. The Witchblade can re-animate the dead, empathically show the host scenes of great trauma, and allow the host to relive experiences from past hosts as dreams. The Witchblade is also known to be able to damage incorporeal beings and is capable of slaying other-dimensional entities and immortal deities (such as Bastet). It also has the ability to control and manipulate the elements. The Witchblade can slow, stop, and even turn back time. ==Other Media== In the Witchblade television series, Sara is also able to use the Witchblade for both defence and offence: For defence, the Witchblade envelops Sara in armour, reminiscent of a Medieval Knight (as opposed to the very revealing armour from the graphic novels. For offence, the witchblade can assume the form of a gauntlet, with a wrist-mounted retractable blade, and, one-step forward, even as a Pata-esq weapon. It can also serve as a Brass knuckles-esq weapon for punching. In certain instances it seems to slow, stop, or even turn back time (or at least Sara's perception of time allowing her to see and dodge bullets, etc.); however, due to the time-turning ability, things said about the series are often only true for one season or the other. She also has the ability to see and speak with the ghost of Det. Danny Woo, her dead partner, and others dead before their time, murdered victims, etc. According to former wielder, Joan of Arc, during the Periculum, when Sara asks her what the Witchblade is, she answers that it is a branch from the Tree of good and evil; in another episode, it is described as the product of divine alchemy. Flashbacks also show it first falling to the earth as a meteor before ending-up in human hands. Over the course of human history/time immemorial, the Witchblade has crossed hands, crossed countries, continents and cultures; but has only ever been wielded by women. There is a specific female bloodline that the Witchblade favours for its wielders (which Sara Pezzini is a part of), who are both descendants and reincarnations of a previous wielder, as the Witchblade has directly influenced the course of this bloodline: Whenever the Witchblade passes into the hands of a worthy wielder, it will subject her to the Periculum, a test designed to find if one is worthy of carrying such an amazing weapon, she is brought to the brink of death, and is confronted by former wielders, who will question her. Once a potential user has passed this test, the Witchblade will bond with them at a cellular level and slow the aging process. It was also revealed in the last episode of the television series that the Witchblade will not and cannot bring death to anyone that has wielded it, able to only maim, disfigure and cause pain. The Witchblade's symbol is two circles overlapping one-another, representing the light and dark aspects of the Witchblade, as it is a proponent for balance between these two forces in the world. Former wielders of the Witchblade include Saren (a fictional Artemis-esq wood nymph goddess of Sumerian religion, and who was the uninterested object of Gilgamesh's unrequited lust, and was hunted by Enkidu), Cathain (based on Scáthach of Irish & Scottish legend, and lover of Conchobar), Joan of Arc, Florence Nightingale (although she was not of the wielder's bloodline), and Elizabeth Brontë (an American spy in WWII), along with unidentified Egyptian, Babylonian, Indian, Chinese, Japanese and Celtic woman (all with the same face as Sara Pezzini) throughout human history. It is revealed that Sara was not only adopted, but stolen from her birth mother when she was a baby she also had a sister that appeared in the series once, named Karen Bronte. It is hinted that her real last name is Bronte. Elizabeth's descendant Sara is in fact the same woman as all of the \\"true wielders\\" of the Witchblade, living in different times and places simultaneously (since time is an illusion) and sometimes even meeting the same people like Conchobar, who in another time and place was her lover. Sara's main romantic interest in the TV series is Conchobar, a musician who is a descendant or reincarnation of Conchobar mac Nessa. Sara finds herself trying to figure out the origins of the weapon she now carries, as well as the purpose that is destined for her. Her nemesis is businessman Kenneth Irons, whose bodyguard Ian Nottingham is implied to be his son. In the television series, it turns out that while Ian, via Kenneth's experiments, is also related to Sara; Ian was created from the stem cell of Elizabeth Brontë, a former wielder from Sara's bloodline (possibly her biological grandmother) and it is implied that they could be genetically related. Ian is obsessed with Sara, but his erratic behavior disturbs her. In the second season, he meets Aras, a woman genetically identical to Sara (a biological cousin of hers from about five generations back), and they share a kiss. Sara has a friend named Gabriel Bowman who has a website called Talismaniac and is knowledgeable about mythology and artifacts. ==See also== *List of female action heroes ==References== ==External links== * Top Cow Witchblade page * Category:Characters created by Marc Silvestri Category:Comics characters introduced in 1995 Category:Female characters in comics Category:Fictional characters from New York City Category:Fictional New York City Police Department detectives Category:Fictional women soldiers and warriors Category:Image Comics superheroes Category:Witchblade characters Category:Superhero television characters Category:Italian superheroes ","title":"Sara Pezzini"},{"id":"1278652","text":"The logo of The Wall Street Journal Asia Logo in 2004 The Wall Street Journal Asia, a version of The Wall Street Journal, provided news and analysis of global business developments for an Asian audience.

Kents Hill is located in Kents Hill, Maine, 12 miles west of the state capital of Augusta. It is the 30th oldest boarding school in the United States and one of the oldest continuously operating co-educational college preparatory schools. One of the three oldest Methodist academies in the United States (with Cazenovia Seminary and Wilbraham Academy), the school is now a member of the Association of Independent Schools in New England (AISNE) and accredited by the New England Association of Schools and Colleges (NEASC). ==History== ===Origins=== Kents Hill was founded in 1824 as the Maine Wesleyan SeminaryList of closed, combined, or renamed Maine schools , accessed 2009 by Luther Sampson, a Duxbury, Massachusetts native and a veteran of the American Revolution. According to an early publication of the Kents Hill Breeze, a defunct school periodical, Luther \\"was of the fifth generation in lineal descent from Henry Sampson, one of the Pilgrim band that landed on Plymouth Rock, December 22, 1620.\\"J. O. Newton and Oscar Young, Kents Hill and its Makers (1947) A carpenter18th-Century Woodworking Shop a Rare Find, accessed July 7, 2015 who had not had a formal education, Sampson wanted to use the wealth he had earned in his profession and the government-granted assignment of land he earned as a Colonial soldier to benefit society and to glorify God. Sampson, his wife Abigail Ford, and their children lived in Duxbury and, later, Marshfield, before relocating to over two hundred acres in Readfield, Maine, around the turn of the century. In 1821, Sampson incorporated there the \\"Readfield Religious and Charitable Society\\", whose original charter contained no mention of a school, but rather laid a plan to support area Methodist belief and practice. Sampson deeded the society over one hundred acres of land on Kents Hill. Original building of Maine Wesleyan Seminary with 1836 additionFailing financially and seeking a more efficacious means of performing his mission, by 1823 Sampson had begun to explore the possibility of changing the society's identity into one rooted in the education of youths. Together with Elihu Robinson, a carpenter-schoolmaster in the nearby city of Augusta, and his wife, they opened the Seminary in order to better society through education. Boys and girls appeared on the school's roster from the day the school opened in 1825. It was originally founded as a manual labor school, part of a school movement in which academocs were paired with mechanical and agricultural labor. ===Developments=== Later headmaster, Dr. Henry P. Torsey, oversaw the construction of Sampson Hall which was opened in 1860 and is still serving students today. Dr. Torsey also opened a female collegiate institute - the \\"Female College\\" - one of the first of its kind to offer degrees to women at the time. Dr. Torsey is also credited with introducing baseball to the school in 1861. Bearce Hall was completed in 1873. James G. Blaine, who later served as Secretary of State under President Benjamin Harrison, donated a bell for the bell tower, both of which become important school symbols. To this day, the bell is rung to celebrate school victories and important occasions. During the next fifty years, the school added a conservatory of music as well as a working farm. Early school seal depicting Luther Sampson's journey to Readfield and school motto, Deus viam indicavitDuring the Second World War, Headmaster Bill Dunn inaugurated a ski program next to nearby Torsey Lake.

Marsh had a Test career spanning from the 1970–71 to the 1983–84 Australian season. In 96 Tests, he set a world record of 355 wicketkeeping dismissals, the same number his pace bowling Western Australian teammate Dennis Lillee achieved with the ball. The pair were known for their bowler-wicketkeeper partnership, which yielded 95 Test wickets, a record for any such combination. They made their test debuts in the same series and retired from test cricket in the same match. Wisden stated that \\"Few partnerships between bowler and wicket-keeper have had so profound an impact on the game.\\"Cricinfo Marsh had a controversial start to his Test career, selected on account of his batting abilities. Sections of the media lampooned Marsh's glovework, dubbing him \\"Iron Gloves\\" after sloppy catching in his debut Test. His keeping improved over time and by the end of his career he was regarded as one of the finest in the history of the sport. He was widely regarded for his sense of team discipline, in particular after Bill Lawry controversially declared the Australian first innings closed in the Fifth Test of the 1970–71 series at the MCG with Marsh eight runs short of a century.Cricket Archive Scorecard: Australia v England, Melbourne Cricket Ground, (21–26 January 1971. In 2009, Marsh was inducted into the ICC Cricket Hall of Fame. == Early years == Marsh played backyard cricket with his older brother Graham, who became a professional golfer and won eleven times on the European Tour. Both brothers represented WA at cricket at schoolboy level. Marsh played his first competitive match at the age of eight for the Armadale under-16s. He kept wicket from the start, but batting was his strength. At thirteen he captained the state schoolboys' team, and joined the West Perth district club. When he debuted for West Perth's first XI he was a specialist batsman, as WA wicketkeeper Gordon Becker also represented the club. In order to further his keeping, Marsh joined the University club. Marsh made his first-class debut for WA, again as a specialist batsman, against the touring West Indies in 1968–69. He had an unusual match, scoring 0 and 104. == Test career == Marsh replaced the retired Becker for the 1969–70 season. At the time, Australia was touring India and South Africa with Brian Taber and Ray Jordon as the team's wicketkeepers. In the autumn of 1970, an Australian second team toured New Zealand with John MacLean as wicketkeeper. Therefore, Marsh was behind these players in the pecking order. However, he was a controversial selection for the first Test of the 1970–71 Ashes series, replacing Taber. His superior batting had won him the position. The media was quick to criticise Marsh's glovework in his early career, dubbing him \\"Iron Gloves\\" after he missed a number of catches. Even on his debut in the First Test in the 1970–71 Ashes series he took four catches in his first innings. His batting proved invaluable on a number of occasions and in the Fifth Test, he equalled the record for the highest Test innings by an Australian keeper, set by Don Tallon. The end of the innings was controversial; the captain Bill Lawry declared with Marsh eight runs short of a century so he could get an extra hour of bowling before stumps. When questioned by the press about his lost chance to make an historic century Marsh said he had gained forty runs instead of missing eight as he thought Lawry should have declared an hour earlier.Ian Chappell, Test Match Special, British Broadcasting Corporation, 11 July 2009 Marsh later admitted that he was underprepared as a wicketkeeper, but he learned from watching his English counterpart Alan Knott. He and Knott did, however, concede the same number of byes in the series: 44. Marsh became an integral part of the team as the side improved during the 1972 tour of England. He became the first Australian keeper to hit a century by scoring 118 in the first Test against Pakistan at Adelaide in 1972–73. He also hit 236 against the tourists for WA, the best score of his career. Playing a key role in Australia's series victories over England and the West Indies in the series of 1974–75 and 1975–76, Marsh made many acrobatic dives to catch balls delivered by Dennis Lillee and Jeff Thomson. He took 45 dismissals in those two series, including a world-record 26 catches in six Tests against the West Indies. Marsh scored an unbeaten 110 in the second innings of the Centenary Test against England in 1977, becoming the first Australian wicketkeeper to score a Test century against England. In the same match he passed Wally Grout's Australian wicket-keeping record of 187 Test dismissals. He scored a further 16 half centuries. In first class matches, he accumulated 11 centuries including a best of 236, aggregating more than 10000 runs in his career. When the breakaway World Series Cricket was formed, Marsh had no hesitation in signing for Kerry Packer. He claimed 54 dismissals in 16 Supertests. Upon his return to traditional international cricket in 1979–80, his age did not affect his keeping ability. On the 1981 tour of England, he took 23 dismissals to become the first wicketkeeper to take 100 dismissals in Ashes Tests, broke Knott's world record in 22 fewer Tests and passed 3000 runs in Test cricket. In 1982–83, his second last season, he took 28 dismissals against England, including nine and eight in the Second and Third Test respectively. His batting form fell away towards the end of his Test career, his last 22 Tests yielding only 589 runs at an average of 19.63. { border=\\"1\\" cellpadding=\\"5\\" cellspacing=\\"2\\" style=\\"margin: 1em 1em 1em 0; border: 1px #aaa solid; border- collapse: collapse; font-size: 95%;\\" +Most successful bowler & wicketkeeper/fielder combinations in Test cricket !

Statistics correct at 21 August 2015. Source:. == Style == Powerfully built, Marsh was regarded as an all rounder for the majority of his career. Coupled with his short stature, his power suited him to the task of keeping wicket. Despite his bulk, which forced him to work heavily on reducing his weight in his early career, he had fast feet movement, combined with fast anticipation and reflexes which allowed him to cover more ground. He raised the role of wicketkeeper to a more prominent status in a team with his acrobatic diving, raucous appeals and habit of throwing a ball high into the air upon completing a dismissal. As the wicketkeeper, he made himself the focal point in the field and attempted to extract higher standards of concentration from both himself and his teammates. Speaking of his understanding with Lillee, he said \\"I've played with him so much now that most of the time I know what he is going to do before he has bowled\\" Marsh said, \\"I know from the way he runs up; the angle, the speed, where he hits the crease, where the ball is going to be.\\" At state level, Marsh was a noted captain, leading the state to a Sheffield Shield and Gillette Cup double in both forms of the game in 1976–77. He had nine wins and seven losses in 20 Shield matches as captaincy, and seven from nine matches in the limited overs competition. Marsh was an effective player in ODI matches, contributing as a keeper and a lower order batsmen. His power and aggression was put to good use in the closing overs, when he could score at a rapid rate. In one match against New Zealand in 1980–81 against Lance Cairns at the Adelaide Oval, he struck 26 from the final over, with three sixes and two fours, before falling on the final ball. == Coaching and other non-playing duties == Marsh was a cricket commentator for Channel Nine's international matches between 1986–1990 and 1996–1998. He was a coach at the Australian Cricket Academy in Adelaide since its inception and was its director from 1990 to 2001. Some of his former proteges include Australian internationals wicket-keeper-batsman Adam Gilchrist and fast bowlers Jason Gillespie and Brett Lee Marsh was the Director of the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) national academy from October 2001 to September 2005. During this time, England went from being a mediocre team to challenging Australia as the best team in Test cricket and in 2005, they regained the Ashes after 16 years in Australian hands with a 2–1 win. Marsh later criticised the ECB for releasing Troy Cooley, who had trained England's four pronged pace battery, and attacked Duncan Fletcher's selection of Geraint Jones as the wicket keeper ahead of Chris Read.Cricinfo – Marsh slams ECB decision to let Cooley go He once declared his cricketing allegiance to England and was at one time a selector for the English team.Cricinfo – Marsh says he's '100% English' In August 2006 the South Australian Cricket Association announced Marsh had been appointed in a consultancy role to undertake a review of cricket throughout South Australia. Marsh had also worked with the Global Cricket Academy in Dubai.Cricinfo – Marsh signs on as high performance director Marsh was appointed chairman of selectors for Cricket Australia on 2 May 2014, replacing John Inverarity. He was previously Cricket Australia's manager of elite coaching development. On 16 November 2016 Marsh resigned as chairman of selectors, after a disastrous series defeat to South Africa. ==Honours== Marsh was made a Member of the Order of the British Empire in 1981 and inducted into the Sport Australia Hall of Fame in 1985.

In this model, the data and metadata are expressed through facts (small sentences), becoming directly understandable for humans. This makes it easier for resources to be discovered and combined automatically to create virtual organizations (VOs). The descriptions constitute metadata and are typically represented using the technologies of the Semantic Web, such as the Resource Description Framework (RDF). Like the Semantic Web, the semantic grid can be defined as \\"an extension of the current grid in which information and services are given well-defined meaning, better enabling computers and people to work in cooperation.\\" This notion of the semantic grid was first articulated in the context of e-Science, observing that such an approach is necessary to achieve a high degree of easy-to-use and seamless automation, enabling flexible collaborations and computations on a global scale. The use of semantic web and other knowledge technologies in grid applications are sometimes described as the knowledge grid. Semantic grid extends this by also applying these technologies within the grid middleware.

It is available in both E contrabass and B or C subcontrabass sizes. Its name is a portmanteau of the words \\"tuba\\" and \\"sax\\". The first size of tubax to be developed was the E contrabass. It has the same register as a regular contrabass saxophone but is much more compact due to its tubing being folded more times. While the timbre of the E tubax is more focused and compact than that of the full-sized contrabass saxophone, it still blends well with other sizes of saxophones and can be played with surprising agility compared to its size. The subcontrabass tubax uses a baritone saxophone or bass saxophone mouthpiece. While several B subcontrabasses are already in use, only one C model has been manufactured. It was sold to Thomas Mejer of Switzerland in July 2002; he has recorded on it with Peter A. Schmid as the \\"Two Tubax Duo.\\" The tubax has had debate over whether it is really in the saxophone family. Its bore is not as wide as other saxophones that size are, and the tubing is very thin compared to other saxes. Some authorities classify it as its own family of instruments, while others consider it in the saxophone family. Also, the tubax is similar to a double reed instrument family called a sarrusophone. The sarrusophone's range is the same as a saxophone, while some have a high G, though the tubax has a much wider bore compared to the latter instrument. Lastly, the tubax's sound is a little bit \\"honkier\\" than the average saxophone. ==Notable tubax performers== * Paul Cohen * Blaise Garza * Vinny Golia * Mats Gustafsson * Jarno Sarkula * Steffen Schorn * Jim Sheppard* * Marcus Weiss * Dror Feiler ==References== ==External links== * Benedikt Eppelsheim Website * Fred Bayer's Tubax Page * Article about CD featuring tubax * Jay C.

He was noted for both his scholarship and ascetic piety. ==History== According to Suidas, Lucian was born at Samosata, Kommagene, Syria, to Christian parents, and was educated in the neighbouring city of Edessa, Mesopotamia, at the school of Macarius. However, this tradition might be due to a conflation with his famous namesake, Lucian of Samosata, the pagan satirist of the second century. At Antioch, Lucian was ordained presbyter. Eusebius of Caesarea notes his theological learningChurch History IX, 6, 3. and Lucian's vita (composed after 327) reports that he founded a Didaskaleion, a school. Scholars following Adolf von Harnack see him as the first head of the School of Antioch, with links to later theologians Diodorus of Tarsus and Theodore of Mopsuestia, but that contention is unrecorded in the extant sources. After the deposition of Antioch's bishop Paul of Samosata, he fell under suspicion for heresy, and was excommunicated. According to Alexander of Alexandria, he remained in schism during the episcopates of three bishops, Domnus, Timaeus and Cyril, whose administration extended from 268 to 303. Lucian was reconciled with the Church either early in the episcopate of Cyril (perhaps about 285), which seems more likely, or under Cyril's successor Tyrannus. During the persecution of Maximinus Daia, Lucian was arrested at Antioch and sent to Nicomedia, where he endured many tortures over nine years of imprisonment. He was twice brought up for examination, and both times defended himself ably and refused to renounce his Christian faith. His death is uncertain. He might have been starved to death. Another, more likely, possibility is that he was beheaded. The traditional date ascribed to his execution is January 7, 312, in Nicomedia. There is a late tradition of uncertain origin that he had been drowned in the sea and that his body was returned to land by a dolphin.Attwater, Donald and Catherine Rachel John. The Penguin Dictionary of Saints. 3rd edition. New York: Penguin Books, 1993. . He was buried at Drepanum on the Gulf of Nicomedia, which was later renamed Helenopolis to honour Helena, mother of Constantine the Great. He is also commemorated as a saint, with a feast day of January 7 in the Roman Catholic Church and October 15 in the Orthodox Church. ==Theology== Lucian's theological position is a matter of contention. Attempts to reconstruct his theology from the extant sources have led to contradictory results. Because Arius in a letter addressed Eusebius of Nicomedia as \\"sylloukianistes\\" (\\"Fellow-Lucianist\\"), Lucian's theology came to be associated with the Arian controversy. Following Adolf von Harnack, many scholars have interpreted the word (which only appears in this instance) as denoting a theological school and have therefore seen not only Eusebius but also Arius and other Arian leaders (among them Maris, Theognis of Nicaea and Asterius) as pupils of Lucian and have transferred Arian views unto Lucian. The first writer to clearly attest such a discipleship for a number of Arian sympathisers—but not for Arius and his closer associates—was the Anomoean church historian Philostorgius. Others have interpreted the word as indicating not a theological link but the special veneration accorded to Lucian by Eusebius, who by that time headed the church of Nicomedia, the place of Lucian's martyrdom. Lucian's veneration increased during the latter half of Constantine's reign, in particular due to the patronage of the Empress Helena. Opponents of Arianism, such as Alexander of Alexandria, countered this veneration by noting Lucian's schismatic past. Marcus Victorinus identified the Eusebian party with Lucian. Epiphanius associates Lucian with heretical views about Christ's human soul held by Arians (but also by others) and relates that the Arians venerated Lucian as their martyr and that Lucian lived together with Eusebius at Nicomedia. Associated with Lucian's name is also the Creed of the Dedication passed at the Council of Antioch in 341. This association is unknown to Athanasius of Alexandria and Hilarius of Poitiers, but known and accepted by later writers. It was most likely brought up by the Homoiousian party. In their opposition against the Homoian party supported by Emperor Constantius II, the Homoiousians claimed the legacy of Lucian and adopted the definition of 341 as their creed. Other attempts to reconstruct Lucian's theology have started out with Paul of Samosata, whose rejection of the allegorizing tendencies of the Alexandrian School, and especially those of Origen, was transferred to Lucian. Because these identifications created a contradictory picture of Lucian, some scholars have proposed the existence of two Lucians, the first being a follower of Paul of Samosata, the second being Lucian the martyr, a theologian in the Origenist tradition and the teacher of Arius and Eusebius of Nicomedia. However, this proposal has now been largely rejected. Whatever his theology had been, his status as a martyr and a saint was not impacted by concerns of orthodoxy. In the words of Philip Schaff: \\"The contradictory reports are easily reconciled by the assumption that Lucian was a critical scholar with some peculiar views on the Trinity and Christology which were not in harmony with the later Nicene orthodoxy, but that he wiped out all stains by his heroic confession and martyrdom\\".Philipp Schaff, History of the Christian Church. ==Biblical text== Lucian is also commonly credited with a critical recension of the text of the Septuagint and the Greek New Testament, which was later used by Chrysostom and the later Greek fathers, and which lies at the basis of the textus receptus;Dr. Hort, Introd. and Append. to Westcott and Hort’s Greek Test. (Lond. and N. York, 1881), p. 138, says of Lucian: \\"Of known names his has a better claim than any other to be associated with the early Syrian revision; and the conjecture derives some little support from a passage of Jerome. Praetermitto eos codices quos a Luciano et Hesychio nuncupatos adscrit perversa contentio, \\" etc. Dr. Scrivener, who denies such a Syrian recension as an ignis fatuus, barely alludes to Lucian in his Introduction to the Criticism of the N. Test., 3rd ed., Cambr., 1883, pp. 515, 517. however, the theory of Lucian Recension has not been proven, nor has any historical or archeological evidence been uncovered. Rosalie Levy's book states, \\"He purged both the Old and New Testaments of errors that had crept in by the inaccuracy of transcribers or the malice of heretics.\\"Levy, Rosalie Marie. (1984). Heavenly Friends. Boston: St. Paul Editions. p. 32. Jerome mentions that copies of his work on the Greek Old Testament were known in his day as \\"exemplaria Lucianea\\" but in other places he speaks rather disparagingly of the texts of Lucian.De Viris Illustribus III. I, xxvii; Praef. ad Paralip.; Epistle, 106. Jerome also wrote: \\"This (Testament) certainly differs in our language, and is led in the way of different streams; it is necessary to seek the single fountainhead. I pass over those books which are called by the name of Lucian and Hesychius, for which a few men wrongly claim authority, who anyway were not allowed to revise either in the Old Instrument after the Seventy Translators, or to pour out revisions in the New; with the Scriptures previously translated into the languages of many nations, the additions may now be shown to be false.\\" In the absence of definite information it is impossible to decide the merits of Lucian's critical labors.On his labors in regard to the Sept., see Simeon Metaphrastes and Suidas, quoted in Routh IV. 3 sq.; Field’s ed. of the Hexapla of Origen; Nestle in the \\"Zeitschr. d. D. Morgenl. Gesellsch., \\" 1878, 465-508; and the prospectus to the proposed ed. of the Sept. by P. de Lagarde. He believed in the literal sense of the biblical text and thus laid stress on the need of textual accuracy. He undertook to revise the Septuagint based on the original Hebrew and the resulting manuscript was popular in Syria and Asia Minor. == Notes == ==References== ==Bibliography== * Gustave Bardy.

It became a national organization in 1921. Today FarmHouse has 34 active chapters and four associate chapters (formerly colonies) in the United States and Canada.FarmHouse Fraternity New Membership Education Manual, published by FarmHouse International Fraternity, Inc. ==History== FarmHouse was founded as a professional agriculture fraternity on April 15, 1905 by seven men at the University of Missouri, who had met at a YMCA bible study and had decided that they wanted to form a club. The seven founders were D. Howard Doane, Robert F. Howard, Claude B. Hutchison, H. H. Krusekopf, Earl W. Rusk, Henry P. Rusk, and Melvin E. Sherwin. D. Howard Doane conceived the basic ideas which led to FarmHouse, and is considered the father of the Fraternity. The name FarmHouse was chosen for the following reasons: > Given their agricultural background and rural upbringing, the house in which > they resided began to be referred to as the farmer’s house, by other > students in a derogatory or demeaning way. The men living in the house > however felt the name was appropriate as they knew the farm home to be a > welcoming place for people to gather, to enjoy each other’s fellowship, to > share a meal together, after a hard day’s work. This same welcoming > environment of a farm home could be offered on a college campus, for > studious men majoring in agriculture who possessed a strong work ethic. And > so the group proudly took on the name FARMHOUSE. A second chapter, founded independently of the Missouri chapter but sharing the same ideals, was founded at the University of Nebraska in 1911. After communication between the two groups, a third chapter was founded at the University of Illinois in 1918. FarmHouse became a national organization in 1921 by approval of each of the active chapters. On April 20, 1974, the FarmHouse Club at the University of Alberta in Edmonton, Alberta, Canada, was the first chapter established outside the United States. With the establishment of the Alberta chapter, FarmHouse became an international fraternity. FarmHouse joined the North American Interfraternity Conference as a junior member in 1944. Because of its size at the time, eight chapters, it was not considered eligible for full membership. With twelve chapters and three colonies, FarmHouse became a full-fledged member on March 25, 1953. FarmHouse dropped out of the NIC from 1971 to 1981, as did many other national and international fraternities. In 1974, the Fraternity re-affirmed its alcohol free housing stance by passing the stance in the bylaws at the Conclave of that year. in 1998, the NIC awarded FarmHouse the NIC Laurel Wreath for leading the path in alcohol free housing. ==Mission and ritual== The mission of FarmHouse Fraternity is primarily prescribed within what is known as \\"The Object\\" of the fraternity: > “The object of our Fraternity is to promote good fellowship, to encourage > studiousness, and to inspire its members in seeking the best in their chosen > lines of study, as well as in life. Progress shall mark our every step, the > spirit of congeniality shall reign at all times, and every member shall be > honest with himself, as with his brothers. Men elected to our membership are > considered to be of good moral character, to be high in scholarship, to have > the capacity for meeting and making friends, and to give promise of service > to their fellow men and to the world. To be and become such may at times > require a sacrifice of time, pleasures and comforts.” The object is recited members at all chapter rituals and regular chapter meetings. The motto of FarmHouse is \\"Builders of Men\\". The fraternity seeks to build men with \\"Fourfold Development\\", encouraging growth in the intellectual, physical, social/moral and spiritual aspects of their lives. The name FarmHouse is an acronym standing for Faith, Ambition, Reverence, Morality, Honesty, Obedience, Unity, Service, and Excellence. FarmHouse does not have greek letters and contrary to some rumors, does not have \\"secret\\" greek letters. The ritual of FarmHouse is open and non-secretive. Families of members are often encouraged to attend initiations. == Membership == To become a member of FarmHouse Fraternity, and undergraduate must be extended a bid, or offer of membership, by a chapter of the fraternity at their university. Chapters regularly host recruitment, or rush, events to get to know potential new members, in addition to inviting them over to dinner or a tour of the chapter facility. Every chapter has an officer in charge of recruitment in addition to the responsibility for all chapter members to identify and recruit new members who live by FarmHouse values. === New membership === New members are men who have accepted a bid extended to them by a chapter of the fraternity. New membership is officially conferred during the course of the Star Ceremony. During the Star Ceremony new members are officially recognized by the chapter as brothers and are given their new member pin. The Star Ceremony is also considered to be the beginning of new member education. New member education is the period before initiation as a chapter member where new members learn about the history and values of the fraternity. New member education is led by an elected officer of the chapter known as the Director of New Member Education and lasts a maximum of twelve weeks. Once a new member completes new member education, he is considered for initiation as a chapter member. === Chapter membership === Chapter members are men who have been initiated as a member of a chapter of the fraternity. Members are elected to membership by a vote of the chapter, commonly referred to as the initiation vote. This vote reflects the new member's completion of new member education and that they are \\"considered to be of good moral character, to be high in scholarship, to have the capacity for meeting and making friends, and to give promise of service to their fellow men and to the world,\\" as stated in the object. Membership is officially conferred during the Pearl Ceremony, where members are given the standard badge of the fraternity, pledge to uphold the principles and standards of the fraternity, and sign their name in the official chapter membership record, known as the Herd Book. === Alumni membership === Alumni members are men who have graduated college or who have requested to leave the chapter prior to graduation but wish to maintain their membership in the fraternity. If a man wishes to obtain early alumni status prior to graduation, he may be granted it upon approval of the chapter, by two-thirds vote, and the International Executive Director. Alumni membership is officially conferred in the Ruby Ceremony and is considered to be the end of a member's chapter membership. Upon becoming an alumni member, the man automatically becomes a member of the alumni association affiliated with his previous chapter, and if he moves to another state, will have dual-affiliation with the alumni association within that state. === Associate membership === Associate members are men who having demonstrated the qualities of a FarmHouse man, shown interest in the fraternity, and having not joined a social fraternity while in college or afterwards, are granted membership in the fraternity. Associate membership is granted by a local chapter, which the man automatically becomes an alumni member of. In cases where no chapter exists, an association may grant alumni membership with the approval of the international executive director. Associate members, just like chapter members, officially receive their membership through observing the Pearl Ceremony. === Honorary membership === Honorary membership is conferred to men of high character and great professional achievement who embody the ideals of a FarmHouse man. It is usually conferred during a Pearl Ceremony at a biennial conclave chaired by the International President. Honorary members may be nominated by unanimous vote of a chapter, association board, or a special committee on honorary membership appointed by the International President. Upon nomination, the candidate must be unanimously elected by the International Executive Board to receive honorary membership. Honorary members have the full rights of any alumni member of the fraternity. == Awards == FarmHouse recognizes the outstanding contributions of both members and non- members of the fraternity. === Master Builder of Men Award === The Master Builder of Men award is the highest honor that the international fraternity can bestow upon an alumni member. The award was created by the National Executive board in 1950. The award is given biennially at each regular conclave of the fraternity. ==== Qualifications ==== The Master Builder of Men Award is bestowed upon an alumni member who: > possesses a continued interest in improving both the chapters and > associations of the organization and is a leader in the Fraternity; > demonstrates interest in young people by providing help and encouragement, > allowing them to better themselves through further development and growth; > embodies the Fraternity’s principles in his daily actions; and, is a > gentleman and respected citizen of his own personal and/ or professional > community ==== Recipients ====  2018  Jack Anan (Colorado State '53) Louis J.

The award was created by the FarmHouse International Executive Board in 2012. It is not necessarily given to a member of FarmHouse but rather to those who have contributed to the larger sorority and fraternity community. ==== Recipients ==== Judson Horras - 2018 Ned Kirklin - 2017 Patrick Alderdice - 2016 Bobbi Larsen - 2015 Durward Owen - 2014http://farmhouse.org/foundation/documents/2014%20Pearls%20&%20Rubies%20-%20Fall.pdf Ben Pendry - 2013 Rick Barnes - 2012 ==Nebraska alcohol death== In 2014 the FarmHouse chapter at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln was suspended after the alcohol related death of an 18-year-old freshman. Four FarmHouse members, including the chapter vice president, were brought up on felony procurement charges. The chapter is now reinstated. The death prompted State Senator Adam Morfeld to introduce a Good Samaritan law providing limited immunity to underage students who call for help in alcohol-related emergencies. ==Notable alumni== ==List of chapters== ==See also== *List of social fraternities and sororities ==References== ==External links== * Category:Student organizations established in 1905 Category:International student societies Category:North American Interfraternity Conference Category:Student societies in the United States Category:Organizations based in Kansas City, Missouri Category:1905 establishments in Missouri ","title":"FarmHouse"},{"id":"1278764","text":"Penlee Point (, meaning stone-slab headland) is a promontory near the coastal fishing village of Mousehole in west Cornwall, England, UK.Ordnance Survey One-inch Map of Great Britain; Land's End, sheet 189. 1961 It was the launching point of the Penlee lifeboat, which was lost in the disaster of 1981.

In Ilion, King Ilus was blinded for touching the image to preserve it from a burning temple.Dercyllus, Foundations of Cities, Book i, noted by Pseudo-Plutarch Parallel Stories, \\"Ilus and Anytus\\". ===Theft=== Diomedes with the Palladium approaches an altar Odysseus and Diomedes steal the Palladium from Troy. (Apulian red-figure oinochoe of c. 360–350 BC from Reggio di Calabria.) During the Trojan War, the importance of the Palladium to Troy was said to have been revealed to the Greeks by Helenus, the prophetic son of Priam. After Paris' death, Helenus left the city but was captured by Odysseus. The Greeks somehow managed to persuade the warrior seer to reveal the weakness of Troy. The Greeks learned from Helenus, that Troy would not fall while the Palladium, image or statue of Athena, remained within Troy's walls. The difficult task of stealing this sacred statue again fell upon the shoulders of Odysseus and Diomedes. Since Troy could not be captured while it safeguarded this image, the Greeks Diomedes and Odysseus made their way to the citadel in Troy by a secret passage and carried it off. In this way the Greeks were then able to enter Troy and lay it waste using the deceit of the Trojan Horse. Odysseus, according to the epitome of the Little Iliad (one of the books of the _Epic Cycle_ ) preserved in Proclus's Chrestomathia, went by night to Troy in disguise and entered the city as a beggar. There he was recognized by Helen, who told him where the Palladium was. After killing some of the Trojans, he returned to the ships. He and Diomedes then re-entered the city and stole the Palladium. Diomedes is sometimes regarded as the person who physically removed the Palladium and carried it away to the ships. There are several statues and many ancient drawings of him with the Palladium. According to the Narratives of the Augustan period mythographer Conon as summarised by Photius,Photius, Bibliotheca 186. while the two heroes were on their way to the ships, Odysseus plotted to kill Diomedes and claim the Palladium (or perhaps the credit for gaining it) for himself. He raised his sword to stab Diomedes in the back. Diomedes was alerted to the danger by glimpsing the gleam of the sword in the moonlight. He disarmed Odysseus, tied his hands, and drove him along in front, beating his back with the flat of his sword. From this action was said to have arisen the Greek proverbial expression \\"Diomedes' necessity\\", applied to those who act under compulsion.This incident was commemorated in 1842 by the French sculptor Pierre-Jules Cavelier (1814–1894) in a muscle-bound plaster statue; it depicts Diomedes alone, his noble face peering apprehensively over his right shoulder, as he cradles the Palladium. Because Odysseus was essential for the destruction of Troy, Diomedes refrained from injuring him. Diomedes took the Palladium with him when he left Troy. According to some stories, he brought it to Italy; others say that it was stolen from him on the way. ===Arrival at Rome=== A 3rd-century Roman Pallas Athena mosaic from Tusculum, now in the Vatican Museums According to various versions of this legend the Trojan Palladium found its way to Athens, or Argos, or Sparta (all in Greece), or Rome in Italy. To this last city it was either brought by Aeneas the exiled Trojan (Diomedes, in this version, having only succeeded in stealing an imitation of the statue) or surrendered by Diomedes himself. An actual object regarded as the Palladium was undoubtedly kept in the Temple of Vesta in the Roman Forum for several centuries. It was regarded as one of the pignora imperii, sacred tokens or pledges of Roman rule (imperium). Pliny the ElderNatural History; VII, XLV said that Lucius Caecilius Metellus had been blinded by fire when he rescued the Palladium from the Temple of Vesta in 241 BC, an episode alluded to in OvidFast. B. vi. 1. 436, et seq. and Valerius Maximus.B. i. c. 4 When the controversial emperor Elagabalus (reigned 218–222 AD) transferred the most sacred relics of Roman religion from their respective shrines to the Elagabalium, the Palladium was among them.Augustan History, Life of Elagabalus 3 In Late Antiquity, it was rumored that the Palladium was transferred from Rome to Constantinople by Constantine the Great and buried under the Column of Constantine in his forum. Such a move would have undermined the primacy of Rome, and was naturally seen as a move by Constantine to legitimize his reign. ==The Athenian Palladium== The goddess Athena was worshipped on the Acropolis of Athens under many names and cults, the most illustrious of which was of the Athena Poliás, \\"protectress of the city\\". The cult image of the Poliás was a wooden effigy, often referred to as the \\"xóanon diipetés\\" (the \\"carving that fell from heaven\\"), made of olive wood and housed in the east-facing wing of the Erechtheum temple in the classical era. Considered not a man-made artefact but of divine provenance, it was the holiest image of the goddess and was accorded the highest respect. It was placed under a bronze likeness of a palm tree and a gold lamp burned in front of it. The centerpiece of the grand feast of the Panathenaea was the replacement of this statue's woolen peplos (a garment) with a newly woven one. It was also carried to the sea by the priestesses and ceremonially washed once a year, in the feast called the Plynteria (\\"washings\\"). Its presence was last mentioned by the Church Father Tertullian described it derisively as being nothing but \\"a rough stake, a shapeless piece of wood\\". Earlier descriptions of the statue have not survived. ==See also== *Tutelary deity ==Notes== ==References== * * * ==Further reading== *The Oxford Dictionary of Classical Myth and Religion. s.v. \\"Palladium\\". ==External links== *Diomedes with the Palladium Category:Roman mythology Category:Mythological objects Category:Sculptures of Athena Category:Aeneid Category:Greco-Roman relations in classical antiquity Category:Iliad Category:Religious objects ","title":"Palladium (classical antiquity)"},{"id":"1278773","text":"The Mannlicher M1894 was an early blow-forward semi-automatic pistol. ==General features== The earliest Ferdinand Mannlicher pistol, manufactured by Fabrique D'Armes de Neuhausen, Switzerland, was designed to be self-loading and to use a special rimmed cartridge in 6.5 mm caliber. The design represented an entirely new utilization of mechanical principles in automatic action called \\"blow-forward action\\". In the standard type of automatic action for low-powered cartridges, the recoil (or blow-back) is utilized to drive back a movable breech face or block, but Mannlicher utilized the principle of a rigid standing breech with the barrel blowing forward to extract, eject, and prepare for reloading. A special barrel housing which carries the sight covers the entire length of the barrel (6.49 in/165 mm) when the arm is closed. A heavy recoil spring is mounted concentrically around the barrel within this housing and is compressed between a shoulder at the forward end of the casing and a shoulder at the rear of the barrel. right An unusual element in this design is a three-armed \\"barrel-holding lever\\". It is pivoted above the trigger as shown in the drawing from page 188, Mannlicher Rifles and Pistols, Smith, 1947. Its bottom arm engages with the trigger. The forward arm holds the barrel forward for loading. The rear arm serves as a hammer catch. ==Firing mechanism== To load this weapon the hammer is cocked. As the hammer rotates on its axis pin, it acts upon the trigger, and the sear snaps into the cocking notch, holding the hammer. The hammer axis pin also supports the center arm of the barrel holding lever, which arm emerges and is raised high enough by its spring to press into a slot under the barrel. The rising thumbpiece on top of the barrel over the breech is then pushed forward. The barrel moves forward until its muzzle emerges from the barrel housing, compressing the recoil spring. The barrel holding lever is snapped into the locking notch in the underside of the barrel, thereby holding it in forward position for charging. The stripper clip (capacity five rounds) is inserted in the clip guide of the receiver and the cartridges are pressed into the magazine. The cartridges are stripped off the clip and pressed into the magazine-well in the body of the pistol, compressing the spiral magazine- spring. A lip at the top prevents the cartridges from emerging. The preferred direction for holding this pistol requires that the index finger be positioned around the frame above the trigger guard, with the middle finger through the trigger guard and pressed against the trigger. As the trigger is pulled, the sear is released of engagement to allow the mainspring to drive the hammer forward slightly, but the rear arm on the barrel holding lever catches in a notch in the hammer to hold the hammer in firing position. The lowering of the forward arm of the barrel holding lever frees the barrel, allowing the compressed recoil spring to drive the barrel back, stripping the top cartridge from the magazine, chambering the round, and pressing the cartridge head against the standing breech. The M1894 is a double action firearm; the hammer can either be cocked manually for each shot, with the trigger performing the single action of releasing the sear, or it can be fired double-action, in which the trigger pull both cocks the hammer and releases the sear, at the expense of a heavier trigger pull. As the propellant combusts and expands, the standing breech (a rigid, immovable object) acts to prohibit rearward movement of the cartridge and causes the expanding forces to move against the bullet (a somewhat more movable object), propelling the bullet toward the muzzle. The friction of forward motion of the bullet projectile against the inside of the barrel causes the bullet to act as a quasi-plug in the barrel. The barrel (a very movable object) is pushed forward by the motion and direction of the expanding gases against the friction of the traveling projectile, until the bullet exits the muzzle, after which forward motion of the barrel is due to inertia. Forward motion of the barrel is arrested by the progressively increasing tension of the recoil spring. The recoil of this pistol is somewhat higher than that of a conventional semi-automatic handgun, as there are no rearward moving parts to absorb recoil energy and spread the forces out over a longer period of time. It is no worse, however, than a revolver of equivalent power. right The extractor is mounted on the left side of the barrel extension. As the barrel moves forward the extractor draws the empty case from the face of the standing breech to eject it. The barrel holding lever arm moves up by action of the trigger, and catches the barrel in forward position. The magazine spring, pushing against the follower, forces the cartridges up to present the next cartridge for loading. As the trigger is released and moves forward it acts on the bottom arm of the barrel holding lever causing it to pivot and its forward upper arm to release the barrel. The barrel is then driven back by the recoil spring to load the next cartridge. ==Models== The 1894 was originally classed as a \\"half automatic or semi-automatic pistol\\". The overall length of the 6.5 mm model displayed in the photo illustrations on this page is 8.46 in (215 mm), dry weight is 30 oz (850 g). There were several modifications of this pistol during its production until 1897. In some, the barrel catch does not operate during firing movement, so that the pistol closes to become fully self-loading. In no models, however, does the automatic action extend to cocking the self-loading pistol. In all variations the hammer must be cocked by thumb to fire or must be cocked and dropped in double action mechanical fashion by a pull on the trigger. Experimental versions of this arm were also manufactured with a single action movement in which it was necessary to cock the hammer by thumb for each shot. Other types also used experimental forms of grip safeties. Late versions of these pistols were made to shoot a special 7.8 mm rimless cartridge with a straight sided case. == Historical references == The pistols were tested by the American Army at the Springfield Armory in June 1900. They did not recommend the use of the pistol, primarily because of the poor function during the test. Cartridges frequently jammed or misfired, and the barrel burst after the 281st round. > While this pistol is very simple in construction the operation of loading is > very tedious and slow, and would be almost impossible for a man to load it > while on horseback. The muscular exerts practically the same as for an > ordinary double-action revolver, while the rate of fire is much slower. The design similarly failed Austrian and Swiss military trials. Total production was approximately 150 by Steyr chambered for the 7.6 mm Mannlicher cartridge, and less than half as many by SIG in 7.5 mm caliber for Swiss military trials. ==See also== * * Hino Komuro M1908 Pistol * Infantry Weapons of WWI * Roth-Steyr M1907 * Steyr Mannlicher M1901 == Notes == ==References== ‡ Photographs of 1894 Mannlicher 6.5 mm serial #47 manufactured by FAB.D'ARMES of Neuhausen, Switzerland Category:Steyr semi-automatic pistols Category:Blow forward firearms Category:Semi-automatic pistols of Austria Category:World War I Austro-Hungarian infantry weapons Category:19th-century semi-automatic pistols Category:Firearms by Ferdinand Mannlicher ","title":"Mannlicher M1894"},{"id":"1278789","text":"Larry Young may refer to: * Larry Young (musician) (1940–1978), jazz organist * Larry Young (umpire) (born 1954), baseball umpire * Larry Young (racewalker) (born 1943), Olympic racewalker * Larry Young, one of the many alter egos of the Marvel Comics anti-hero Deathlok * Larry Young, former President and CEO of Dr Pepper Snapple Group * Larry Young (politician) (born 1949), former Maryland State Senator * Larry J.

It seems to have been made a separate earldom in the mid 12th century, when Malcolm MacHeth is found designated Earl of Ross. Malcolm had earlier been imprisoned at Roxburgh for rebelling against David I, but when Malcolm's brother-in-law Somerled invaded Scotland, David was forced to relent and grant the earldom unto Malcolm. The title was later granted by William the Lion to Floris III of Holland in 1161 upon Floris's marriage to William's sister Ada of Huntingdon. However, Floris held the title only in a nominal sense, as he took no active part in the governance of Ross. The title seems not to have been passed on, for in 1291 Floris's descendant is found complaining that the earldom had been deprived from him. The true founder was the famous Ferquhard, from the Irish Ó Beólláin (O'Beolain, Boland, Bolan) family. This Ferquhard was the son of the lay parson of the monastery of Applecross, and was hence known as MacIntagart, meaning \\"son of the priest\\". In 1215 the newly crowned Alexander II was forced to suppress a rebellion in Moray and Ross. Ferquhard sided with the king, and captured the rebel leaders, before beheading them and presenting their heads to Alexander. For this he was knighted. He was created Earl of Ross in the 1220s, probably in 1226. The line of Ferquhard continued until the death of William, 5th Earl of Ross, in 1372. William had two daughters, the eldest of which, Euphemia, married Sir Walter Leslie, who then became jure uxoris Earl of Ross. The Leslies continued to hold the earldom until the line ended in another heiress, also named Euphemia. This Euphemia was a sickly girl, who suffered from a hunchback. Though she was nominally Countess of Ross, Ross's governance was carried out by her grandfather Robert, Duke of Albany. Her uncle Donald, Lord of the Isles, perceived her weakness, and attempted to take Ross by force, but he was defeated by Robert at the Battle of Harlaw. In 1415 Euphemia was persuaded to resign the earldom in favour of Robert and his sons. However, the Albany Stewarts would meet their downfall when King James I returned to Scotland in 1424. Robert was strongly suspected of having murdered James's brother David, and in revenge James had the entire family forfeited and executed (with the exception of James the Fat who escaped to Ireland). The earldom therefore passed to the Lords of the Isles, who continued to hold it until John forfeited it in the 1470s for trying to conquer Scotland with the help of Edward IV of England. In 1481 James III granted the earldom unto his second son, also named James. James had already been made Marquis of Ormond at his baptism. In 1487 his earldom was raised to a dukedom, and he was granted the additional titles Earl of Ederdale and Lord of Ardmannoch, Brechin and Navarre. James entered the clergy, and thus never married or had issue. He died in 1503, and all his titles became extinct. The fourth creation was on 20 May 1565, for Henry, Lord Darnley, who was also created Lord Ardmannoch. Shortly thereafter he was created Duke of Albany. After his murder at Kirk o' Field, he was succeeded by his infant son James, whose accession as James VI a few months later returned the titles to the Crown. Upon the investiture of Charles Stuart as Duke of Albany on 2 December 1600, he was also granted the Marquisate of Ormonde, the Earldom of Ross, and the Lordship of Ardmannoch. Charles's elder brother Henry died unexpectedly in 1612, and he became Prince of Wales as heir apparent to the throne. He acceded as king in 1625, and the titles again reverted to the Crown. Ross currently has no earl, but it is possible the title will one day be revived for a member of the royal family. There was speculation that the title might be revived for Prince Harry; it was not. ==List of Earls of Ross== ===Early mormaers/earls of Ross=== Arms of the Earls of Ross (ancient):Gules, three lions rampant argent. *Malcolm MacHeth (died 1168) * With the crown *Ferquhar (died 1249) *William I (died 1274) *William II (died 1323) *Hugh, Earl of Ross (died 1333) (from whom descend the chiefs of Clan Ross). *William (died 1372) *Euphemia I (died ) ** Married Sir Walter Leslie *Alexander Leslie (died 1402) *Euphemia II (died ) (resigned c. 1415) *John Stewart, (died 1424) *Mariota (died ) (sister of Alexander Leslie, Earl of Ross) ** m.

In particular a common text-type has been proposed to be found: in the ninth/tenth century Codex Koridethi; in Codex Basilensis A. N. IV. 2 (a Greek manuscript of the Gospels used, sparingly, by Erasmus in his 1516 printed Koine New Testament); and in those Gospel quotations found in the third century works of Origen, which were written after he had settled in Caesarea.Kirsopp Lake, Codex 1 of the Gospels and its Allies (TS 7; Cambridge: UP, 1902); B. H. Streeter, The Four Gospels: A Study of Origins Treating of the Manuscript Tradition, Sources, Authorship, & Dates (1st ed., 1924; 2d ed., London: Macmillan, 1926). The early translations of the Gospels in Armenian and Georgian also appear to witness to many of the proposed characteristic Caesarean readings, as do the small group of minuscule manuscripts classed as Family 1 and Family 13. == Description == A particularly distinctive common reading of the proposed text- type is in Matthew 27:16-17, where the bandit released by Pontius Pilate instead of Jesus is named as \\"Jesus Barabbas\\" rather than — with all other surviving witnesses — just \\"Barabbas\\". Origen notes particularly that the form \\"Jesus Barabbas\\" was common in manuscripts in Caesarea, whereas he had not found this reading in his previous residence in Alexandria. Otherwise the Caesarean readings have a mildly paraphrastic tendency that seems to place them between the more concise Alexandrian, and the more expansive Western text-types. None of the surviving Caesarean manuscripts is claimed to witness a pure type of text, as all appear to have been to some degree assimilated with readings from the Byzantine text-type. Some writers have questioned the validity of this grouping, claiming that the classification is the result of poor research. Insofar as the Caesarean text-type does exist (in Matt, Luke and John is not well defined), then it does so only in the Gospels. The proposed Caesarean witnesses do not appear to have any common distinctive readings in the rest of the New Testament. Some of the Caesarean manuscripts have the so-called Jerusalem Colophon. The Caesarean text-type was discovered and named by Burnett Hillman Streeter in 1924.B.H. Streeter, The Four Gospels: A Study of Origins Treating of the Manuscript Tradition, Sources, Authorship, & Dates (1st ed., 1924; 2d ed., London: Macmillan, 1926). According to some scholars, it is only a hypothetical text-type (Aland).Kurt Aland, and Barbara Aland, \\"The Text of the New Testament: An Introduction to the Critical Editions and to the Theory and Practice of Modern Textual Criticism\\", transl. Erroll F. Rhodes, William B. Eerdmans Publishing Company, Grand Rapids, Michigan, 1995, p. 336. There are no pure Caesarean manuscripts. In many cases, it is difficult to decide the original reading of the group, for instance in Mark 1:16:Lake K., Codex 1 of the Gospels and its Allies, Texts and Studies, volume vii, Cambridge, 1902, p.

It developed from critical discourse analysis (CDA), a branch of sociolinguistics concentrating upon how power is articulated. Norman Fairclough, credited with developing the concept, calls it \\"a compensatory tendency to give the impression of treating each of the people 'handled' en masse as an individual. Examples would be air travel (have a nice day), [and] restaurants (welcome to Wimpy!)\\" (2001: 52). The use of second person pronouns contributes significantly to the process of synthetic personalisation within the mass media. It is extremely common to encounter constructions such as \\"See you after the break\\" on television shows prior to commercial breaks. (This example is also common in Paddy Scannell's concept of Broadcast Sociability.) Mary Talbot ([1995]/2003) used the concept in her work on a synthetic sisterhood in teenage girls' magazines, analysing the linguistic devices (pronouns, presuppositions) constructing a simulated friendship between reader and producer. Using a variety of sociolinguistic concepts, including positive politeness, she comments upon the ideological implications, such as patriarchy. == References == *Fairclough, N.

La petite fille qui aimait trop les allumettes was one of the novels chosen for inclusion in the French version of Canada Reads, broadcast on Radio-Canada in 2004, where it was championed by actor, film director, screenwriter, and musician Micheline Lanctôt. La petite fille qui aimait trop les allumettes caused a sensation in Quebec and was immediately translated into more than ten languages. It was translated into English as The Little Girl Who Was Too Fond of Matches by Sheila Fischman. == Plot == The novel is about two siblings who live in complete isolation with their father. They are both his \\"sons\\". One day the father kills himself by hanging and his sons decide one of them needs to go to the nearby village to get a coffin. While in the village it is unveiled that the one son is actually a female although she has no idea of that (she has no idea of sexuality and thinks she was castrated when she was very young and that is why she doesn't have testicles). It also become apparent she has been being used for sex by her brother and there are even more nefarious occurrences which have been happening on their property. However; she has such little understanding of the outside world, that she believes all of this to be completely normal and rejects the outsiders' views of her family situation. The main character's only source of knowledge is from the books found in her household library. Most of these books are medieval stories about chivalry, knighthood and saving princesses. She becomes somewhat infatuated with the mine inspector she meets In the village who questions her about her living situation. She impulsively tries to get him to have sex with her, although this is more of a carnal urge and something she is probably used to with her brother and father. He succumbs at first but ultimately denies her, making her upset. He goes on to tell her that others will come and try to change her way of life. She flees in anger, riding the family horse back to their mansion. Once there she encounters her brother about to dismember and burn their father's body. She informs him on what she has learned in the village and urges him not to do anything to their father's corpse. Her brother then goes through the house and arranges mannequins to appear as if they have fortified the household. She believes her brother is going mad and moves to an area of the property she calls \\"the vault,\\" somewhere her brother is afraid to go. She brings a book of spells which she continuously writes in. Her brother begins building a shooting post from two letters on the property and dons himself king with a dead raccoon cap. She remains in the vault chronicling her thoughts. A figure emerges from the forest on a machine they have never seen before. It's the mine inspector who the main character now believes is her prince. He finds her in the vault, making a horrific discovery. He has looked at the baptismal records and sees that there are supposed to be twin sisters recorded belonging on this property. The mine inspector ventures into the vault and sees a humanoid figure bandaged from head to toe, still alive and another figure, a skeleton, hidden behind a glass case. The narrator explains that she believes they have been there forever and her father used to attend to them and spend time with them but then stopped and she has been feeding and tending to them ever since. The living figure is referred to as the 'Fair Punishment'. She makes it further obvious the Fair Punishment is her twin and the decomposed body in the glass case is her mother, although she does not understand it. When the twins were four years old, the Fair Punishment had a habit of playing with matches that resulted in the fire killing their mother. The Fair Punishment survives but is severely burned, and the father believes being burned alive was her punishment for her misdeeds. The mine inspector then tells her he wants to take her to safety. He also points out that she is pregnant with her brother's child. They embark on his motorcycle. He is her prince and they are riding away on his steed. As they are riding into the pines, the inspector is shot in the back by the brother. He is killed instantly. She returns to the vault as more villagers begin to appear at the property. As her brother surrenders, she packs up belongings and escapes into the pines. The book ends with her giving birth. ==Film adaptation== A film adaptation by Simon Lavoie, The Little Girl Who Was Too Fond of Matches, was released in 2017,\\"La petite fille qui aimait trop les allumettes présenté en première mondiale au TIFF\\".

His life is known through his deposition, and the depositions of his friends and associates, to Bishop Jacques Fournier who was hunting for Cathar heretics. He plays a prominent role in Emmanuel Le Roy Ladurie's study Montaillou, village occitan de 1294 à 1324 and in some ways is that book's protagonist. ==Early life== Maury was born in the small town of Montaillou one of eight known children of Raymond Maury, a weaver. While most in the town of Montaillou did some weaving, Raymond Maury was the only one to sell his wool rather than use it in the home, and was only two artisans in the town at the time, the other being Arnaud Vital, a cobbler. Needing humidity for the weaving, his house had a special cave-like area where he worked. Raymond Maury's weaving could not sustain the family and like most villagers he kept some sheep. Pierre Maury became a shepherd caring for the sheep of a number of the villagers. During his youth he was converted from Catholicism to Albigensianism by his brother Guillaume, and neighbour Guillaume Belot. == Cathar links == At age 18 Maury left home for the Val d'Arques where he worked as a shepherd for his cousin Raymond Maulen. While living with and working for his cousin, Maury fell in love with Bernadette d'Esquinath, a girl from the village. This passionate relationship persisted for two years, but his fellow Cathars disapproved as she was a Catholic. Pierre abandoned Bernadette when he was hired as a shepherd by Raymond Pierre, and became involved with his employer's daughter, another Bernadette. The Pierres were dedicated Cathars and since Raymond was without sons, he hoped to make Maury his heir. Pierre became closely involved in the Cathar community, helping guide Perfects from village to village. Through this duty he developed a much envied collection: pieces of bread, each blessed by a different Cathar parfait. In 1305 however, Jacques Authié, a local Cathar leader was captured, and the villagers of Arques, fearing punishment, abandoned the open practice of Albigensianism and traveled en masse to Avignon to seek absolution from the Pope. Maury refused to renounce his Albigensianism and did not participate. He stayed in the village to look after the flocks of those who were away. When the now Catholic villagers returned, Maury went home to Montaillou. Since the villagers had revealed all to the authorities, Maury was now a known but unabsolved heretic; and he became a fugitive from the Inquisition. He spent Christmas of 1305 with his family in Montaillou before going into the employ of Barthélemy Borrel who sent him to Catalonia to look after sheep he owned there. Living amongst the nomadic groups of shepherds Maury no longer had many dealings with Cathars and was unknown to the local Inquisition. After two years of working for Borrel, Maury visited the fair in Laroques d'Olmes. There he stayed with his 18-year- old sister, Guillemette, and brother-in-law Bertrand Piquier. That night Piquier severely beat his wife. While a husband's power was considered absolute, Maury was greatly concerned about this brutality to his sister. A few days later he returned to the town and stole away with his sister, entrusting her to a pair of parfaits. For his absenteeism during this incident Borrel fired Maury, but he soon found another job working as a shepherd for Guillaume André. He spent three years working for André, travelling through Catalonia and Foix with the flocks of sheep and other shepherds. At some point in this period he was accused of fraternizing with a known heretic, but escaped the charge by pretending to having been miles away from the incident, a story backed up by his friends. He also successfully avoided the round-up of the heretics of Montaillou in 1308, being warned by Bernard Fort, who supplied flour to the shepherds. In 1309 Maury left the employ of André and worked for Pierre Constant of Rasiguières for a year before joining with his brother Arnaud in working for Raymond Boursier. In 1311 Pierre and Arnaud left this group, Arnaud going home to Montaillou and Pierre to Catalonia where he joined a team of shepherds working for Barthélemy Companho. ===Bélibaste affair=== In Catalonia he came in contact with the small group of Cathar exiles led by the parfait Guillaume Bélibaste. Over the next several years Maury traveled through Catalonia and the eastern Pyrenees. As a skilled shepherd his services were in demand and he could find work throughout the region. Maury became comparatively wealthy for a peasant due to his skill, hard work, and ability to find the best paying employers. Despite his many travels he frequently met up with Bélibaste, who pressured the nomadic shepherd to settle down. At one point, Belibaste prevailed on him to marry Raymonde Piquier, a blacksmith's daughter, who was Belibaste's lover and pregnant with his child. Pierre agreed and the pair were married. But the marriage lasted only a few days. Bélibaste then told Maury to have it annulled. Months later Raymonde gave birth to a child. Most of Maury's friends were convinced that the parfait had used Pierre to cover the breaking of his own vow of chastity. Maury however, continued to trust the parfait. ==Capture== Bélibaste's Cathar community was demolished when the Inquisition sent Arnaud Sicre to infiltrate and inform on the group. Soon afterwards, Bélibaste, then Maury, were captured. In 1324 Maury was imprisoned and there is no record of him past this date. ==References== *Le Roy Ladurie, Emmanuel.

It was translated into English by Tiina Nunnally (credited as \\"F. David\\" in the British edition). ==Title== During her Greenland childhood, Smilla developed an almost intuitive understanding of all types of snow and their characteristics. As an adult, she worked for a time as a scientist whose speciality was snow and ice. Her certainty about the manner of a child’s death is due to this visceral \\"feeling for snow\\". ==Background== The novel is ostensibly a work of detection and a thriller, although beneath the surface of the novel, Høeg is concerned with rather deeper cultural issues, particularly Denmark's curious post-colonial history, and also the nature of relationships that exist between individuals and the societies in which they are obliged to operate. The protagonist Smilla Qaaviqaaq Jaspersen is a sympathetic and useful vehicle in this respect, her deceased mother being Greenlandic Inuit and her father a rich Danish doctor. Having been brought in childhood from the poverty and freedom of Greenland to the affluent and highly ordered society of Denmark, Smilla's relationship with Denmark and Danish society is strained and ambivalent. Smilla investigates the death of a neighbour’s child whom she had befriended—a fellow Greenlander, with an alcoholic, neglectful mother and a mysteriously deceased father. The story begins in Copenhagen, where the child has fallen to his death from the snowy rooftop of an old warehouse. The police refuse to consider it anything but an accident—there is only one set of footprints (the child's) in the snow leading to the edge of the roof—but Smilla believes there is something about the footprints that shows that the boy was chased off the roof. Her investigations lead her to decades-old conspiracies in Copenhagen, and then to a voyage on an icebreaker ship to a remote island off the Greenlandic coast, where the truth is finally discovered. But the book ends unresolved, with no firm conclusion. == Plot == Smilla Qaaviqaaq Jaspersen, 37-year-old product of the stormy union of a female Inuit hunter and a rich urban Danish physician, is a loner who struggles to live with her fractured heritage. Living alone in a dreary apartment complex in Christianshavn, Copenhagen, she befriends Isaiah, the neglected son of her alcoholic neighbour, because he too is Greenlandic and not truly at home in Denmark. Smilla's friendship with Isaiah, recounted in the novel in flashback, gives some meaning to her otherwise lonely life. Isaiah’s sudden death is explained officially as a fall from the roof whilst playing, but Smilla’s understanding of the tracks the child left on the snowy roof convinces her that this is untrue. She complains to the police and quickly encounters obstruction and hostility from the authorities and other sources. Working with Peter, a mechanic neighbour who had also known and liked Isaiah, and with whom she begins an affair despite her fear of dependency, Smilla discovers that there is a conspiracy centred on Gela Alta (a possible reference to the Latin verb gelo, \\"to freeze\\", and the places called Alta in North Norway or Alta Lake in Canada or the feminine Latin adjective alta, \\"high, deep\\"), an isolated glaciated island off Greenland. Previous expeditions have found something there (Isaiah’s father was a diver who died on one of them, allegedly in an accident) and now plans are afoot to return for it. Isaiah’s death is linked to this conspiracy in some way. After a long journey of discovery in Copenhagen, during which she learns that the mechanic is not who he says he is, Smilla braves intimidation and threats and eventually gets on board the ship chartered for the mysterious expedition to Gela Alta, ostensibly as a stewardess. The final action takes place on the ship and the island. Smilla is held in deep suspicion by the ship's crew—who turn out to be all in some way compromised and in the pay of the mysterious Tørk Hviid, who is the expedition's real leader. Despite repeated attempts on her life by crew members, who assume she is from the authorities, Smilla doggedly pursues the truth, even when she discovers that Peter has deceived and betrayed her. The secret of the island is revealed to be a meteorite embedded in the glacier, certainly uniquely valuable—perhaps even alive in some way. However, the water surrounding it is infested with a lethal parasite related to the Guinea worm, which is what really killed Isaiah’s father. Isaiah was forced off the roof because he had accompanied his father on the previous expedition and had evidence of the meteorite’s location—and the parasite itself was actually dormant in his body. When Smilla learns that Tørk Hviid had chased Isaiah off the roof to his death, she pursues him out onto the frozen sea. He tries to reach the ship and force it to sail away, but Smilla chases him, using her intuitive ice-sense to head him off, out into isolation and danger. Here the novel ends. ==Film adaptation== The film, Smilla's Sense of Snow was released in the United Kingdom under the original novel title in 1997, starring Julia Ormond, Jim Broadbent, Gabriel Byrne, Richard Harris, Jürgen Vogel, Mario Adorf and Tom Wilkinson, directed by Bille August. There were some changes to the plot, especially having a more conclusive end in which the villain Tørk Hviid gets killed, instead of the book's deliberately ambiguous ending. ==Awards and nominations== * Winner of the Crime Writers' Association Silver Dagger Award in 1994. * Shortlisted for an Edgar Award in 1994. == See also == * ALH84001 - a meteorite which shows structures that some scientists think could be fossilised bacteria-like life forms when observed through an electron microscope. * Greenlandic people in Denmark * Scandinavian noir ==References== ==External links== * Miss Smilla's Feeling for Snow (UK translation - ) * Smilla's Sense of Snow (US translation - ) by Peter Hoeg * * \\"A Tale of Two Smillas\\" (Google doc) Kirsten Malmkjær, Centre for Research in Translation, Middlesex University * Poddar, Prem and Cheralyn Mealor (1999) 'Danish Imperial Fantasies: Smilla's Feeling for Snow' in Translating Nations, Aarhus University Press.

A prominent critic of the European Union, he is a vocal supporter of Brexit. ==Early life== Timothy Martin was born on 28 April 1955 in Norwich. His father served in the Royal Air Force and then worked for brewing multinational Guinness plc, where he became Malaysian marketing director; his mother is of Jewish descent. Martin was educated at eleven schools in New Zealand and Northern Ireland, including Campbell College, Belfast. He earned a bachelor's degree in law from the University of Nottingham, and qualified as a barrister in 1979, but has never practised. ==Career== His early jobs included working on a building site in Ware, and acting as a sales representative for The Times. Martin is the founder and chairman of Wetherspoon. He bought his first pub, in Muswell Hill, in 1979. His brother Gerry also ran a pub chain, Old Monk, which was listed in 1998, but went out of business in 2002. In 2005, Martin was voted the fifth most influential person in the UK pub industry. He is an admirer of Sam Walton's business philosophy. He visits at least 15 Wetherspoons outlets each week. As of July 2018, Martin owned 33.7m shares (31.9% of shares). ==Political views== ===Brexit=== Martin is a staunch supporter of Brexit, representing these views for journalists and on political TV programmes such as BBC Politics Live and Sky News, and BBC Radio 4 programs including Today, Question Time and Farming Today. In 2016, Martin donated £200,000 to the Vote Leave campaign. In January 2017, Wetherspoons published figures showing an increase in sales of more than 3%. Martin used this as evidence that there was no post-Brexit referendum slowdown as predicted by economists. In June 2018, Martin announced that Wetherspoons would be ceasing the sale of products from other European Union countries in a 24-month plan, with the immediate example of Prosecco and Champagne being replaced by Australian wines. He believes the prediction of food prices rising and food shortages leading to stockpiling of supplies in the UK post-Brexit is merely scaremongering tactics deployed by pro-EU journalists, and mentioned the fact there were no increased queues in his restaurants as a result; after he removed French brandy from sale in his restaurants as an example. Wetherspoons mass posted a pro-Brexit magazine to an unknown number of households in January 2019. The magazine claims to have a readership of two million. The employee campaign group Spoons Workers Against Brexit, described the publication as dangerous propaganda, and said that Martin was exploiting his position as CEO. Wetherspoon responded by defending the mass mailing, stating it contained \\"... pro and anti Brexit articles to stimulate debate\\"; the proportionately minor mentions of views critical to a no deal Brexit were preceded by statements by Tim Martin, deriding expert opinions and \\"the elite\\". In July 2019, Martin appeared on an episode BBC Question Time where model and political activist Amba Bali accused the businessman of being a “liar” and deceiving the public about the reasons he, and other businessmen were supporting Brexit. ===COVID-19 pandemic=== Martin criticised the shutdown of businesses during the COVID-19 pandemic, saying that it was \\"over the top\\" and that pubs should continue to operate but with social distancing measures in place. After criticism regarding the shutdown of all pubs due to the spread of Covid-19, Martin addressed his 40,000 employees by video message. He acknowledged the government would pay 80 per cent of the wages of staff at companies who have lost work during the crisis, but he said the money could take weeks to come through. Martin suggested that if some staff were offered jobs in supermarkets they should consider taking them and promised that he would give first preference to those who wanted to come back to Wetherspoon. Martin's widely criticised positions towards his staff and the pandemic have led to the \\"Neverspoons\\" boycott campaign. ==Personal life== Martin is married to Felicity, whom he met while at university; they have four children, and live in Exeter, Devon. ==References== Category:1955 births Category:Living people Category:People educated at Campbell College Category:Alumni of the University of Nottingham Category:British businesspeople Category:British Eurosceptics Category:People from Norwich ","title":"Tim Martin (businessman)"},{"id":"1278881","text":"Sandomierz Voivodeship (, ) was a unit of administration and local government in Poland from the 14th century to the partitions of Poland in 1772–1795. It was part of the Lesser Poland region. Originally Sandomierz Voivodeship also covered the area around Lublin, but in 1474 its three eastern counties were organized into Lublin Voivodeship. In the 16th century, it had 374 parishes, 100 towns and 2586 villages. The voivodeship was based on the Sandomerz ziemia, which earlier was the Duchy of Sandomierz. The Duchy of Sandomierz was created in 1138 by King Bolesław III Wrymouth, who in his testament divided Poland into five principalities. One of them, with the capital at Sandomierz, was assigned to Krzywousty's son, Henry of Sandomierz. Later on, with southern part of the Seniorate Province (which emerged into the Duchy of Krakow), the Duchy of Sandomierz created Lesser Poland, divided into Kraków and Sandomierz Voivodeships. Sandomierz Voivodeship was also one of the voivodeships of Congress Poland. Created in 1816 from the Radom Department, in 1837 it was transformed into the Sandomierz Governorate. ==14th century-1795== ===Boundaries=== Sandomierz Voivodeship in its original shape was one of the largest provinces of the Kingdom of Poland. After Lublin Voivodeship was created out of its eastern territories, the province stretched from Białobrzegi in the north, to the area north of Krosno in the south (the town of Krosno itself belonged to Red Ruthenia). It included such cities and towns of contemporary Poland, as Dębica, Dęblin, Iłża, Kielce, Kolbuszowa, Końskie, Kozienice, Lipsko, Mielec, Nisko, Opoczno, Ostrowiec Świętokrzyski, Pińczów, Pionki, Radom, Ropczyce, Ryki, Stalowa Wola, Starachowice, Staszów, Szydłowiec, Tarnów, Tarnobrzeg and Włoszczowa. The shape of the voivodeship remained unchanged from 1474 to the first partition of Poland (1772), when the Habsburg Monarchy annexed the area south of the Vistula, with Dębica, Kolbuszowa, Mielec, Nisko and Tarnów. Zygmunt Gloger in his monumental book Historical Geography of the Lands of Old Poland gives a detailed description of Sandomierz Voivodeship: “Duke Boleslaw Krzywousty, before his death in 1138, divided Poland between his four sons, giving Henryk the Land of Sandomierz together with the Land of Lublin. The Duchy of Sandomierz was thus created (...) During the reign of Wladyslaw Lokietek, the duchy was turned into a large voivodeship. In ca. 1471, the Land of Lublin was separated from it (...) The area of Sandomierz Voivodeship was 467 square miles, with 374 Roman Catholic parishes, 100 towns, and 2,586 villages. In 1397 left bank part of the province was divided into three counties – Sandomierz, Radom and Checiny. In the early 16th century the voivodeship had 9 counties: Sandomierz, Wislica, Checiny, Opoczno, Radom, Szydlow, Stezyca, Pilzno and Tarnów. By late 16th century, Tarnow county was annexed by Pilzno county, while Szydlow county was divided between Wislica and Sandomierz (...) Sandomierz Voivodeship had nine senators: the voivode and the castellan of Sandomierz, and castellans of Wislica, Radom, Zawichost, Żarnów, Malogoszcz, Polaniec and Czchow. The voivodeship had several starostas, who resided in such towns, as Sandomierz, Radom, Checiny, Opoczno, Nowy Korczyn, Stezyca, Wislica, Pilzno, Stopnica, Solec nad Wisla, Zawichost, Szydlow, Przedborz, Ropczyce, Ryczywol, Radoszyce, Ryki, Zwolen, Gołąb and others. Local sejmiks took place at Opatow, at which seven deputies to the Sejm were elected, as well as two deputies to the Lesser Poland Tribunal in Lublin (...) Soil in northern part of the voivodeship was sandy, while in its center and south it was very rich. In the area of Opatow, famous wheat was produced, called sandomierka or opatowka. There also were large forests, as well as deposits of marble, copper, iron and lime (...) Among oldest urban centers of Sandomierz Voivodeship were Sandomierz, Wislica, Nowy Korczyn, Zawichost, Radom. Main castles were at Chrobrze, Osiek, Ilza, Checiny, Janowiec nad Wisla. Most important monasteries were at Lysa Gora, Sieciechow, Opatow, Wachock and Koprzywnica\\". ===Municipal government=== Voivodeship Governor (Wojewoda) seat: * Sandomierz Regional council (sejmik generalny) seats: * Nowe Miasto Korczyn ==Administrative division== In 1397, part of the Sandomierz Voivodeship which was located on the western bank of the Vistula, was divided into three counties: * Sandomierz County (Powiat Sandomierski), Sandomierz * Radom County (Powiat Radomski), Radom, which was traditionally called Radom Land (Ziemia radomska) * Chęciny County (Powiat Chęciński), Chęciny.

The idea of creation of this unit was the brainchild of Minister of Industry and Trade Eugeniusz Kwiatkowski, and it was directly linked with creation of one of the biggest economic projects of interbellum Poland, Central Industrial Region. It was to cover south-central Poland, and most probably, it was to be created in late 1939. Its projected size was 24.500 square kilometers, and it was to incorporate 20 or 21 powiats. == References == *Zygmunt Gloger, Historical Geography of Lands of Ancient Poland, Sandomierz Voivodeship (in Polish) Category:Voivodeships of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth Category:1795 disestablishments in the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth Category:States and territories established in the 14th century Category:History of Lesser Poland Category:14th-century establishments in Poland ","title":"Sandomierz Voivodeship"},{"id":"1278928","text":"Ian Laperrière (born January 19, 1974) is a Canadian-American former professional ice hockey winger who played 16 seasons in the National Hockey League (NHL). Laperrière spent nine seasons of his NHL career with the Los Angeles Kings and also spent time with the St. Louis Blues, New York Rangers, Colorado Avalanche, and Philadelphia Flyers. He is currently an assistant coach for the Flyers. ==Playing career== As a youth, Laperrière played in the 1988 Quebec International Pee-Wee Hockey Tournament with a minor ice hockey team from Montreal. Laperrière played in the Quebec Major Junior Hockey League (QMJHL) from 1990 to 1993 and was drafted by the St. Louis Blues of the NHL in the seventh round and pick number 158 in the 1992 draft. He made his NHL debut with the Blues on March 3, 1994. On December 8, 1995, he was traded to the New York Rangers for Stéphane Matteau. On March 14, 1996, he was traded with Ray Ferraro, Mattias Norström, Nathan LaFayette, and a draft pick to the Los Angeles Kings in exchange for Jari Kurri, Marty McSorley and Shane Churla. Laperrière was a mainstay on the Kings roster from 1996 until 2004. On July 2, 2004, Laperrière signed a free agent contract with the Colorado Avalanche. Laperrière, affectionately known as 'Lappy' to his fans, was an immediate success with Colorado in the 2005–06 NHL season, posting the best points totals of his career. He scored 21 goals and 24 assists for 45 points, far ahead of his previous bests of 13 goals and 14 assists for 27 points in the lockout-shortened 1994–95 NHL season. He quickly became a favorite with the Avalanche fans. Laperrière scored the 100th goal of his career on October 29, 2006, against the Minnesota Wild. He also passed 800 career games on November 28, against the Calgary Flames in a 5–2 loss. On April 1, 2009, Laperrière fought with David Hale of the Phoenix Coyotes for his 52nd hockey fight in an Avalanche jersey, passing Scott Parker in all-time franchise fighting majors. He was announced as the Avalanches' Masterton Trophy nominee for the 2008–09 season on April 3, 2009. He played in his 1000th NHL game on April 11, 2009, against the Vancouver Canucks in a 0–1 home overtime loss. He led the team that year with 163 penalty minutes, just one more minute than Cody McLeod. Unable to agree to a new deal with the Avalanche, Laperrière signed a three- year contract with the Philadelphia Flyers on July 1, 2009. On November 27, 2009, Laperrière was hit with a slapshot in the mouth while killing a penalty at the end of the first period against the Buffalo Sabres. He sat out the second period receiving between 50 and 100 stitches but returned for the third period. He also played the following night against the Atlanta Thrashers. Laperrière lost seven teeth resulting from the incident (two fake and five real). A similar event occurred during the 2010 Stanley Cup playoffs on April 22. Laperrière was hit in the face near the end of a New Jersey power play, resulting in an orbital injury, and a mild concussion. Laperrière was listed as out indefinitely and his return to the playoffs was considered unlikely. However, after missing the Flyers second round series versus the Boston Bruins he returned for game 4 of the Eastern Conference Finals against the Montreal Canadiens. In the May 2010 edition of The Hockey News Laperrière was awarded THN's John Ferguson Award for \\"Toughest Player in the NHL\\" in the 2009–10 season. His postseason play, however, came at a cost; during training camp in September 2010, Laperrière experienced symptoms of post-concussion syndrome and nerve damage to his eyes from being hit in the face twice by pucks the previous season, and was announced as out for the entire 2010-11 season just before the season began. He was put on injured reserve before the season began, being placed on long-term injured reserve in mid-December to free up salary cap space, and doctors advised Laperrière to retire, although he did not do so at the time. The move was repeated again for the season to free up cap space, as Laperrière's symptoms have not subsided; his number 14 was reissued to rookie Sean Couturier. Despite never playing again after the 2010 Stanley Cup Finals, Laperrière continued to serve the Flyers off the ice as a mentor to younger players in the organization and in other capacities. For that, Laperrière was awarded the 2011 Bill Masterton Trophy for his perseverance in the sport of hockey. Laperrière officially retired June 12, 2012. He was named Director of Player Development for the Flyers on June 29, 2012. ==Personal life== Laperrière is married to Magali and has two sons: Tristan, born in March 2002, and Zachary, born in April 2004. He was sworn in as a naturalized US citizen on August 30, 2011, in a ceremony in Mount Laurel, New Jersey. He portrayed Montreal Canadiens Hall Of Famer Bernie \\"Boom Boom\\" Geoffrion in the 2005 Quebec film The Rocket (Maurice Richard) based on the life of the title individual. In 2012, Laperriere appeared in the movie This Is 40 alongside Scott Hartnell, James van Riemsdyk, and Matt Carle. Following his retirement from hockey, he turned his attention to triathlon completing the Ironman North American Championship at Mont-Tremblant (Quebec) in 12 hours, 11 minutes, 55 seconds on August 19, 2013. He also ran the Philadelphia Marathon in 2012. Laperrière and his family live in Haddonfield, New Jersey.Philadelphia Flyers 2014-15 Media Guide, p. 21.

Shoulders toured nationally and throughout Europe, and they were especially well known in France and other European countries. Their material, written almost entirely by lead singer Michael Slattery and guitarist Todd Kassens, has been called \\"drunken carnival music,\\" but it was wide-ranging, from hard rock to gentle ballads, from sea shanties to French cabaret music to Irish drinking songs. Slattery, an electrifying performer, is probably one of the greatest American rock poets; his songs tell stories, and they read wonderfully even without the music. They are simultaneously very dark and wildly joyous. He is also an accomplished writer of fiction, poetry, and drama. Shoulders' lineup included Slattery, who sang and played everything from a huge parade drum which he also used as a trampoline to the \\"harmonica, out-of-tune cornet, hideous trombone, bent tin whistle,\\" and \\"free-hanging river pipe\\"; Kassens on the guitars; Alan Gene Williams on the drums; and Chris Black on bass, piano, and organ. They were frequently accompanied by the well-known Austin cellist John Hagen, who plays in Lyle Lovett's large band. Shoulders' first album, Trashman Shoes, rose to the top of the rock charts in France. Their second was The Fun Never Stops, which did well in Europe but never attained the success of \\"Trashman Shoes\\". Shoulders frequently played at the \\"Hole in the Wall\\" at the top of the Drag on Guadalupe in Austin, and for several years they played regularly at Austin's famous acoustic club the Cactus Cafe. ==External links== *Official site * Category:Alternative rock groups from Texas ","title":"Shoulders (band)"},{"id":"1278957","text":"Mousehole (; ) is a village and fishing port in Cornwall, England, UK. It is approximately south of Penzance on the shore of Mount's Bay.Ordnance Survey: Landranger map sheet 203 Land's End The village is in the civil parish of Penzance. An islet called St Clement's Isle lies about offshore from the harbour entrance. Mousehole lies within the Cornwall Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty (AONB). Almost a third of Cornwall has AONB designation, with the same status and protection as a National Park. ==History== The first mention of the village of Mousehole is in 1283 and the first mention of Portheness is in 1267. Although usually thought of as the same place, a document from 1309 names Porthenys juxta Mousehole (i.e. next to Mousehole), implying two separate places. Compare with nearby Newlyn which is separated by a stream from Tolcarne and both were once considered individual places. There is also a 1339 document naming Porthengrous juxta Porthenes (harbour by the cross, next to the harbour by the island). If the amount of tax collected is indicative of how important a place was, in the 14th century, tax collected on the number of fishing boats from Mousehole was £5. Nearby Marazion paid £1 6s 8d, Newlyn £1, Penzance 12s and Porthgwarra and Penberth 12s. There were three medieval chapels, including the one on St Clement's island. In 1383 a chapel was dedicated to ″the Blessed Virgin Mary″ and was in ruins by 1414 due to storms. It was rebuilt around 1420 and finally destroyed during the Reformation. Another chapel was licensed in 1441 and dedicated to St Edmund the Confessor. Records show that pilchards were exported to France as early as 1302, and in the late 18th century there were five seines and 55 boats based in the harbour. In the 1880s there was still a drift pilchard fishery and in the autumn around sixty boats fished in the North Sea. Along with Marazion, it was until the 16th century one of the principal ports of Mount's Bay. Before its decline as a major commercial centre, Mousehole also had a number of fairs and markets, including the charter for a market on Tuesdays, with a fair for three days at the festival of St Barnabas, granted to Henry de Tyes in 1292. Mousehole, like many communities in Mount's Bay, fell within the authority of the Manor of Alverton; all early charters, fairs etc. associated with Mousehole are associated with this manorial estate. Mousehole, like Penzance, Newlyn and Paul, was attacked in the 1595 raid on Mount's Bay by Spaniard Carlos de Amésquita, the only surviving building being the 'Keigwin Arms', a local pub. Outside the Keigwin Arms (now a private residence) is a plaque with the wording \\"Squire Jenkyn Keigwin was killed here 23 July 1595 defending this house against the Spaniards\\". ===20th century=== Penlee Lifeboat Station Although a lifeboat had been available in Mount's Bay for many years, a new lifeboat station at Penlee Point, on the outskirts of the village, was opened in 1913. On 19 December 1981 the entire lifeboat crew of eight was lost during an attempted rescue in hurricane-force winds. The lifeboat was moved to Newlyn in 1983 but continues to be known as the 'Penlee Lifeboat'. The village's harbourside was once the location of the Lobster Pot guest house, in which Dylan Thomas and Caitlin Macnamara spent their honeymoon after marrying at Penzance register office. In 1936 the GPO Film Unit made The Saving of Bill Blewitt, a short film to promote the Post Office Savings Bank, featuring local postman Bill Blewitt. The Ship InnAn 18th-century building which was heightened in the 19th century and has whitewashed rubble walls with tarred plinth. One of the four windows is blocked the others have sashes without glazing bars. On the first floor is an oriel bay and th plain recessed door is under a bay window. The right hand part of the building is from the early 19th-century, of two storeys and has four windows which have sashes without glazing bars. The slurried roof has large slates and wide eaves. Mousehole hosts a vibrant variety of festivals and community activities. It is known for its Christmas illuminations. Since 1981, every 19 December the lights have been turned off in memory of the victims of the lifeboat disaster. Tom Bawcock's Eve is a unique celebration held on 23 December each year to celebrate the ending of a famine in the 16th century by local resident Tom Bawcock. This festival is the inspiration behind the book The Mousehole Cat by Antonia Barber and the associated television productions. This festival is also the origin of 'Star Gazey Pie', a mixed fish, egg and potato pie with fish heads protruding through the pastry. Mousehole also holds a small maritime festival every two years called 'Sea, Salt and Sail'. Parts of the 1995 feature film Blue Juice were filmed in the village. The local community radio station is Coast FM (formerly Penwith Radio), which broadcasts on 96.5 and 97.2 FM. === Local government === Mousehole was part of the ancient parish of Paul, and from 1866 part of the civil parish of Paul. In 1894 Mousehole became part of Paul Urban District. The urban district was abolished in 1934 and Mousehole was absorbed into the municipal borough of Penzance.Vision of Britain website: Paul UD Penzance Municipal Borough was itself abolished in 1974 under the Local Government Act 1972, and Mousehole became part of the new Penwith District. The former borough was unparished until 1980. The unparished area was formed into a civil parish in 1980, and the new Penzance parish council elected to call itself a town council. Penwith District was abolished in 2009, and Mousehole now falls under the unitary Cornwall Council. ==Notable residents== Dolly Pentreath Penwith is believed to be the last part of Cornwall where the Cornish language was spoken as the community language. Dolly Pentreath, popularly known as the last recorded speaker of Cornish, is often reported as being from Mousehole and as having a memorial in the village. In fact, she was from Paul (the parish of Paul historically included Mousehole). A year after Dolly Pentreath died in 1777, Daines Barrington received a letter, written in Cornish and accompanied by an English translation, from a fisherman in Mousehole named William Bodinar stating that he knew of five people who could speak Cornish in that village alone. Barrington also speaks of a John Nancarrow from Marazion who was a native speaker and survived into the 1790s.Ellis, P. Berresford (c. 1970) The Story of the Cornish Language. Penryn: Tor Mark Press John Keigwin (1641–1716), a scholar in the Cornish language, William Carvosso (1750–1834), the Methodist, and Joseph Trewavas VC CGM (14 December 1835 – 20 July 1905) were also born in Mousehole. Admiral of the fleet Sir Caspar John GCB (1903–1984) lived in Mousehole in retirement. The artist Jack Pender (1918–1998) was born in Mousehole and spent most of his career there.

The station opened in February 1990, and was formerly known as Star 106.9, which used to operate on the frequency now occupied by Nova 106.9. The station was previously owned by Rural Press & Bundaberg Broadcasters, forming part of the Star Broadcasting Network. ==History== ===As QFM=== From its launch until 1997, QFM broadcast contemporary hit music format. ===As Star 106.9=== In 1997, QFM rebranded as Star 106.9, dropping a CHR format for a classic hits format. Prior to the switch to 94.9, Star's callsign was changed from 4QFM to 4MIX, supposedly to block Australian Radio Network station 97.3fm from using the Mix positioner used by its sister stations. ===As River 94.9=== In 2001, Star FM upgraded their transmitter and moved to 94.9 MHz in order to better broadcast into Brisbane, avoiding interference of two other very strong signals - ABC Classic FM on 106.1 and triple j on 107.7. The move to 94.9 eliminated that problem, and, on the flipside, means the station has equal to better reach than the Brisbane radio stations towards the west and Toowoomba, with a large volume of advertisements for companies and stores in those regions. As part of the change, the station took on an adult variety format.'Wild Nights', a dance music format licensed from Central Station Records based on community radio station Wild FM was added to the late night programming from the end of January 2001. Despite broadcasting into part of the Brisbane area, the station is not officially counted in Brisbane ratings surveys, however 2017 saw the first ever Ipswich radio survey where River 94.9 dominated (26.4%) In 2008, River 94.9 was the official broadcaster for South-East Queensland, of the Macquarie Radio Network's Olympic Radio Coverage. It was sold in May of that year to Grant Broadcasters by owners Fairfax Media, due to diversity rules controlled by Australian Communications and Media Authority, which prevents more than 2 licences overlapping into a market owned by the same group.

Κολοκοτρώνη, Κεφ. Α' Βίος του Παπαφλέσσα, στο έργο Άπαντα για τον Παπαφλέσσα, Εκδ. Μέρμηγκας, σελ. 27 in the village of Poliani in Messinia. His father was Demetrios G. Flessas (), son of the klepht Georgios Dimitriou Flessas (), and his mother, the second wife of Demεtrios, was Constantina Andronaiou () from Dimitsana. He was the 28th child of the Demetriosfamily.Βασίλειος Σφυρόερας, «Παπαφλέσ(σ)ας», Παγκόσμιο Βιογραφικό Λεξικό, τομ. 8ος, Εκδοτική Αθηνών, Αθήνα 1988, σελ. 162In 1809, he attended school at the renowned school of Dimitsana, from whence many Greek national heroes graduated. While in school, he published a satire and pinned it on the door of Dimitsana Pasha (the Turkish local governor at the time) signing it \\"Gregorios PHOS Kalamios\\" (Φῶς Καλάμιος τό νομα Γρηγόριος). Realizing he was in danger from his action he was sent in 1815 to become a priest or monk, taking the ecclesiastical name of Gregorios Flessas or Papaflessas. For a short time, he served in this capacity in the monastery of Velanidia, situated outside of the city of Kalamata, Messinia. ==Clergy== Gregorios was argumentative and defiant by nature and frequently at odds with his ecclesiastical superiors. Further, he was angry toward the Ottoman Turks because of family members killed by them. He also blessed a marriage of Mr. Zervas with his niece who was engaged to another man. He was asked to leave the monastery of Velanidia. In April 1816, he moved to the monastery of Rekitsa (), located between Leontari and Mystras. He soon argued with his superiors and the monastery's administration. He also came into conflict with a local Turkish authority over the boundaries of the monastery property and even used armed men to protect his claims. This eventually was settled by court in Tripolitsa with the court finding in Papaflessas' and the monastery's favour. This angered the Turkish official who told the authorities that Papaflessas was a revolutionary and was arming the \\"ragiades\\" (slaves - the Turks used to call the Greeks that way) against the Turks. The Tripolitsa authorities sentenced Papaflessas to death and sent soldiers to the monastery to arrest and execute him. Armed Poliani fighters delayed the soldiers and Papaflessas were able to leave his homeland, saying as he did so that he would return either a Bishop or a Pasha and deal with them. Papaflessas went to the island of Zakynthos, a haven for Greeks from the mainland who were under death sentence by the Turks. He obtained a reference letter from the Archbishop of Christianoupolis (Arcadia Kyparissia). While traveling by sea to Constantinople, Papaflessas was shipwrecked on Mount Athos during which the seal on his letter of recommendation broke. Reading the letter he was surprised to find that it called him dishonest, immoral and untrustworthy, causing him to discard the letter. He arrived in Constantinople with the goal of studying Ancient Greek and theology and to become an Archbishop in the Patriarxeio of Agia Sofia. While studying Greek and the Periklis harangue, he also started meeting prominent \\"patriots\\". Because he was under death sentence by the Turks, and his reputation from Peloponnisos, he used the name \\"Dikaios\\". He soon joinedΙωάννης Μελετόπουλος, «Η Φιλική Εταιρεία. Αρχείον Παναγιώτου Δημ. Σέκερη», Δελτίον της Ιστορικής και Εθνολογικής Εταιρείας της Ελλάδος, τομ.18 (1967), σελ.286 the secret organization Filiki Eteria with the code name \\"Armodios\\" (A. M.), Ἁρμόδιος, and the number five (5). In 1819, Gregorios was ordained to the highest priesthood position, Archimandrites, a rank next to the Bishop, by Patriarch Gregorios V of Constantinople and he was given the ecclesiastical “officio of Dikaios” (the Ecumenical Patriarch's representative), in order to be able to move freely in the Moldovlachia area and not to be bothered by the Turks. Papaflessas was sent to the northern part of the Ottoman Empire to inspire and spread hope among his countrymen for the nation's independence from the Turks. ==Action in Resistance== Returning to Constantinople from his successful mission Papaflessas again came to the attention of the Turkish authorities and had to flee. At the end of 1820, he sailed to Aivali of Asia Minor and catechised all scholars of the Big School (as it was called there) while awaiting the arrival of war supplies from Smyrna. From Smyrna he received military supplies and the assurance of additional ammunition if needed. Papaflessas traveled to several areas seeking support for a revolution against the Ottoman Empire. At the Saint George monastery he called a meeting of Greek authorities Αλέξανδρος Δεσποτόπουλος,«Η απόφαση του Ισμαηλίου της 7ης Οκτωβρίου 1820 και οι ενέργειες του Υψηλάντη ως τον Φεβρουάριο του 1821», Ιστορία του Ελληνικού Έθνους, Εκδοτική Αθηνών, τομ.ΙΒ, (1975), σελ.17 and High Priests to discuss if the time was right to start the a revolution. After heated arguments the meeting was postponed for a later time in the monastery of Agia Lavra. In January 1821 meetings took place with Papaflessas recounting his supplies and assurances of support coming from Russia. Concerns about the practicalities of war and the uncertainty of the promises of military support lead the other participants to propose to secretly jail Flessas in the monastery of Agia Lavra in order to avoid problems for the nation. But Papaflessas had armed supporters and no one dared arrest him. The synod decided to get further information and the opinion of neighbouring countries before starting a revolution. Flessas' problem was with the upper class (landowners) in the villages and municipalities, including the top echelon of the clergy, who did not trust Papaflessas, and his mission was received with a great deal of scepticism and fear. He felt safer to approach first farmers and peasants and the poor class of people who were easily magnetized by his speeches looked upon him as the messiah of their freedom. After the meeting he went to Kalavryta and met with Nikolaos Souliotis and Asimakis Skaltsas in order for them to write a letter in the first 10 days of March 1821 to Oikonomos Eliopoulos. Then he retreated to Kalyvia Kalamata waiting for news from Souliotis and Skaltsas and the arrival in Almyros, a small port near Kalamata, of the boat with the war supplies. From Kalyvia he went secretly to Gardikion (now Amfeia) near his hometown Poliani and learned that the small boat of Mexis Poriotis arrived in Almyros. Papaflessas immediately called his brothers and Nikitas Flessa the oldest brother received the ammunitions. In March 1821, he received news the ship with military supplies had arrived. He gathered about 400 men with mules and donkeys from the Poliani area and went to Almyros Kalamata. In order to unload the boat they had to have the authorization of the area's harbourmaster, the famous Mavromichalis, who was in the pay of the Turks security force. The harbourmaster demanded a large bribe to cover up what the Greeks were unloading. Papaflessas sent 45,000 grosia to Mavromichalis who accepted it but still did not sign the proper papers. He wanted half of the supplies in the boat to have them as reserves to fight the Greeks when they start the revolution against the Turks. This was agreed to and the supplies were transported to the monastery of Velanidia, where Papaflessas served as a monk, summoning prominent \\"kleftes\\" chieftains from the area. By purpose or accident some of the gunpowder was dropped at a local well and the next day the stablemen of the local Pasha found and reported it. The Pasha summoned all the prominent Greeks and clergy from the Kalamata area and jailed them. Papaflessas arranged his men to cover various strategic positions in the area. When a Turkish sympathizer tried to leave the city he was killed, starting the war of Independence on March 21, 1821. In Mani a gathering of the captains of the rebels had decided to start the revolution on March 25, 1821, but received news on the 22nd that the fighting had already begun. The Greek War of Independence officially started on March 25, 1821, and brought a great change to the Church of the free kingdom. The clergy had taken a leading part in the revolution. ==Papaflessas during the Revolution (1821–1825)== Papaflessas by Adam Friedel In 1823, Papaflessas was named the Minister of Internal Affairs and the Chief of Police by the government of Prince Alexander Mavrocordato under the name Gregorios Dikaios, the name he had when he was in Filiki Etairia. He instituted many reforms, established the mail system and built schools in various towns. He created the title of Inspector General for schools and he was the first one to establish a \\"political convictions certificate\\" to be given to the friends of the Government. He took part in many battles against the Turks and he sided with the government when the civil war started in 1824. He took part in the campaign in Messinia and the rest of the Peloponnese to suppress the rebels against the Government. During the civil war, he was initially on Theodoros Kolokotronis' side, but later switched sides due to his personal ambitions. Bust of Papaflessas at Pedion tou Areos, Athens The fight against Ibrahim When Ibrahim Pasha invaded the Peloponnese in 1825 (with an army consisted mostly by Egyptians), Papaflessas was still Minister of Internal Affairs. Realizing the great danger the nation was facing with the Ibrahim's invasion, he demanded the government grant amnesty to Kolokotronis and other political prisoners. This demand was refused and he appeared before the Executive Branch and Parliament to tell them he would go to Messinia alone to organize a resistance against Ibrahim, determined to return victorious or die in the battlefield. George Finlay writes in his book“History of the Greek revolution Volume II” Elibron Classics page 74 “The arhimandrite Daikaios (Pappa Phlessas) was still Minister of the Interior. He was the most unprincipled man of the party of the Moreot chiefs. The universal indignation now expressed at his conducts convinced him that it would be dangerous for him to remain in Nauplia, where his licentious life and gross peculation pointed him out as the first object of popular vengeance, and the scapegoat for the sins of his colleagues. The arhimandrite was destitute of private virtue and political honesty, but he was a man of activity and courage. Perhaps too, at this decisive moment a sense of shame urged him to cancel his previous misdeeds by an act of patriotism. He asked permission of the government to march against the Egyptians, boasting that he would vanquish Ibrahim or perish in the copmbat”. Papaflessas gathered 3,000 poorly armed men and went to the province of Pylia, Messinia, searching for the best spot to face Ibrahim's army coming out of the city of Pylos. He selected the hills of Maniaki in order for him to have a better view of the enemy's movements and there Papaflessas established three lines of defence. On June 1, 1825, Ibrahim's forces led by well-trained French officers attacked Papaflessas' defence lines. Most of the Greek troops lost their nerve, abandoned their positions, and fled. Papaflessas continued to fight the Egyptians with a small force of 800-1000 men loyal to him and his cause. Papaflessas knew that in choosing to face Ibrahim he would die on the battlefield. Papaflessas's defenses were ultimately broken by the heavy bombardment of Ibrahim's artillery and the repeated attacks of his infantry and cavalry. Fierce hand- to-hand fighting ended with the death of the last defender. After Papaflessa's death from a bullet in the chest, Ibrahim ordered that his body be cleaned of blood and dirt and tied to a tree. After a few minutes of looking at his foe, Ibrahim walked up to the corpse and kissed it on the cheek as a sign of extreme respect. In speaking of Papaflessas after his death, it is said that Ibrahim told his officers: \\"If Greece had ten heroes like him, it would not have been possible for me to undertake the military campaign against the Peloponnese\\". ==Legacy== Papaflessas remains a key revolutionary figure in Greek history and places and events have been named in his honour. Such instances include an annual international athletics meeting in Kalamata called Papaflessia and a municipality in the Peloponnese called Papaflessas ==See also== * History of Greece ==Notes== ==References== *Νίκος Παναγιωτόπουλος, Το Μανιάκι, τα Ταμπούρια και ο Παπαφλέσσας, εφημερίδα Θάρρος, 19 May 2007, issue 32370 *Δημήτρης Καμπουράκης, \\"Μια σταγόνα ιστορία\\", Εκδόσεις Πατάκη, 2002 ==External links== *Μηνιαία έκδοση συλλὀγου: ιστορική οικογένεια των φλεσσαίων «ο Παπαφλεσσας», issue 26 *Historical appearance of the name Flessas Category:1788 births Category:1825 deaths Category:Members of the Filiki Eteria Category:Greek people of the Greek War of Independence Category:Greek military personnel killed in action Category:Eastern Orthodox monks Category:Greek Christian monks Category:19th-century Eastern Orthodox clergy Category:19th-century Christian monks Category:Ministers of the Interior of Greece Category:People from Thouria ","title":"Papaflessas"},{"id":"1279040","text":"Erik Johan Mattias \\"Notan\\" Norström (born 2 January 1972) is a Swedish retired professional ice hockey defenceman, currently working for the AIK organization. Norström began his National Hockey League career with the New York Rangers. However, he is most noted for his ten seasons as a member of the Los Angeles Kings for whom he served as team captain from 2001–2007; he was the team's first non-North American-born captain. Norström played the final season of his NHL career for the Dallas Stars. ==Playing career== As a youngster, he played for several years in the \\"talent factory\\" Huddinge IK although this original club was Mälarhöjden/Bredäng Hockey. In his teens he moved from Huddinge to AIK (Stockholm), where he started playing in the senior team from 1991. He was drafted in the second round, 48th overall, by the New York Rangers in the 1992 NHL Entry Draft and began his NHL career in 1993 with that team. Norström split his time in the Rangers organization between the parent club and their American Hockey League (AHL) affiliate, the Binghamton Rangers. On 14 March 1996, he was traded with Nathan LaFayette, Ian Laperrière, Ray Ferraro and a draft pick to the Los Angeles Kings for Marty McSorley, Jari Kurri and Shane Churla. In Los Angeles he developed into a solid stay-at-home defender and anchor of the Kings' blueline. On 1 October 2001, he was appointed team captain after Rob Blake had been traded to the Colorado Avalanche. Mattias Norström warms up on 2 January 2006, at the Staples Center. During the NHL lockout in 2004–05, Norström played with his previous Swedish team, AIK. The team was playing in the third-tier league, struggling to advance, when Norström arrived. He helped lead them through the playoffs, and to secure a spot in the second tier league the following year. Norström was originally appointed to the Swedish national team for the 2006 Olympic Games in Turin but had to withdraw due to injury. When Rob Blake returned to the Kings on 1 July 2006, Norström called him and offered the captaincy back. Blake refused at his presentation press conference and told the media that he regarded \\"Matty\\" as the obvious captain and the \\"core and soul\\" of the Kings. Norström was acquired by the Dallas Stars through a trade with the Kings on 27 February 2007, which sent defencemen Jaroslav Modrý and Johan Fransson, a 2008 first round draft pick, a 2007 second round draft pick, and a 2007 third round draft pick to Los Angeles in exchange for Norström, forward Konstantin Pushkarev, a 2007 third round pick, and a 2007 fourth round pick. On 30 April 2008, he scored the game-winning goal (and first NHL playoff goal of his career) in the first overtime against the San Jose Sharks, allowing the Stars to take a 3–0 series lead. On 10 June 2008, Norström announced his retirement from hockey. On 20 June 2011, Norström joined the AIK organization as a sports manager and sounding board for Anders Gozzi. ==Career achievements== * 1992 IIHF – Silver medal World Junior Ice Hockey Championships * 1997 IIHF – Silver medal Ice Hockey World Championship * 1998 Winter Olympics * 1998 IIHF – Gold medal World Championships *1999 NHL All- Star 1999 National Hockey League All-Star Game * 2002 Winter Olympics * 2003 IIHF – Silver medal Ice Hockey World Championship *2004 NHL All-Star 2004 National Hockey League All-Star Game ==Career statistics== ===Regular season and playoffs=== { border=\\"0\\" cellpadding=\\"1\\" cellspacing=\\"0\\" style=\\"text- align:center; width:60em\\" - bgcolor=\\"#e0e0e0\\" ! colspan=\\"3\\" bgcolor=\\"#ffffff\\"  ! rowspan=\\"99\\" bgcolor=\\"#ffffff\\"  ! colspan=\\"5\\"  Regular season ! rowspan=\\"99\\" bgcolor=\\"#ffffff\\"  ! colspan=\\"5\\"  Playoffs - bgcolor=\\"#e0e0e0\\" !

These guns were made by banding and rifling the 32-pounder smoothbore. This image is from the Library of Congress. 12-pounder on the bow Deck detail CSS Teaser had been the aging Georgetown, D.C. tugboat York River until the beginning of the American Civil War, when she was taken into the Confederate States Navy and took part in the famous Battle of Hampton Roads. Later, she was captured by the United States Navy and became the first USS Teaser. ==CSS Teaser== Teaser was built at Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Purchased at Richmond, Virginia by the State of Virginia in 1861, she was assigned to the naval forces in the James River with Lieutenant James Henry Rochelle, Virginia State Navy, in command. Upon the secession of Virginia, Teaser became a part of the Confederate States Navy and continued to operate in Virginia waters. With Lieutenant William A. Webb, CSN, in command, she took an active part in the Battle of Hampton Roads on March 8–March 9, 1862, acting as tender to CSS Virginia. She received the thanks of the Congress of the Confederate States for this action. Teaser was a pioneer \\"aircraft carrier\\", serving as a base for an observation gas filled balloon; she also became a pioneer minelayer when ordered on June 17, 1862, to assist General Robert E. Lee's Army of Northern Virginia. Under Lieutenant Hunter Davidson, CSN, she was used by the Confederate Naval Submarine Battery Service to plant and service \\"torpedoes\\" (mines) in the James River. While engaging at Haxall's on the James on July 4, 1862, a Union shell blew up Teaser's boiler and forced her crew to abandon ship. When seized by Maratanza, Teaser was carrying on board a balloon for aerial reconnaissance of Union positions at City Point and Harrison's Landing. ===Commanders=== The commanders of the CSS Teaser were:Coski (1996), John M.

Webb (February 1862-) * Lieutenant Hunter Davidson (June–July 1862) ==USS Teaser== Later that summer, Teaser was taken into the United States Navy and was assigned to the Potomac Flotilla. With the exception of three brief deployments elsewhere, USS Teaser plied the waters of the Potomac River from Alexandria, Virginia, south to Point Lookout, Maryland to enforce the blockade by interdicting a thriving trade in contraband between the Maryland and Virginia shores. On September 22, she captured schooner Southerner in the Coan River. On October 19, while operating in the vicinity of Piney Point in St. Mary's County, Maryland, she captured two smugglers and their boat as they were nearing the exit of Herring Creek and preparing to cross the river to Virginia. On November 2, near the mouth of the Rappahannock River, the tug surprised three men attempting to violate the blockade in a canoe. Teaser took them prisoner and turned their contraband over to pro-Union Virginians living on Gwynn's Island. Four days later in Chesapeake Bay, Teaser took the cargo- less sloop Grapeshot and captured her three-man crew. By December 1862, she had moved to the Rappahannock River with other units of the Potomac Flotilla to support General Ambrose Burnside's thrust toward Richmond. On December 10, she exchanged shots with a Confederate battery located on the southern shore of the river about three miles below Port Royal, Virginia. After Burnside's bloody rebuff at Fredericksburg, Virginia on December 13, Teaser and her colleagues returned to their anti-smuggling patrol along the Potomac. Teaser joined to make March 1863 an active month. On March 24, the two ships sent a boat expedition to reconnoiter Pope's Creek, Virginia. The landing party found two boats used for smuggling and collected information from Union sympathizers in the area. Almost a week later, on the night of March 30—March 31, they dispatched a three-boat party to Monroe's Creek, Virginia. The previous day, a Federal cavalry detachment had surprised a smuggler in the area; and, though the troops captured his goods, the man himself escaped. Boats from Teaser and Primrose succeeded where the Union horsemen had failed, and they gathered some intelligence on other contrabanders as well. In April 1863, Teaser left the Potomac for duty with Acting Rear Admiral Samuel Phillips Lee's North Atlantic Blockading Squadron at Hampton Roads. On April 17, she joined and in an expedition up the Nansemond River west of Norfolk, Virginia. However, she ran aground, damaged her machinery, and had to retire from the venture. By mid- summer, Teaser was back in action on the Potomac. On the night of July 27, she captured two smugglers with a boatload of tobacco in the mouth of the Mattawoman Creek just south of Indian Head, Maryland. She destroyed the boat and sent the prisoners and contraband north to the Washington Navy Yard. During the night of October 7, Teaser and another flotilla ship (extant records do not identify her companion) noticed signalling between Mathias Point, Virginia, and the Maryland shore. The two ships shelled the woods at Mathias Point, but took no action against the signallers on the Maryland shore other than to urge upon the United States Army's district provost marshal the necessity of constant vigilance. On January 5, 1864, Teaser and landed a force of men at Nomini, Virginia to investigate a rumor that the Southerners had hidden a large lighter and a skiff capable of boating 80 men there. The force, commanded by Teaser's commanding officer, Acting Ensign Sheridan, found both boats, destroyed the lighter, and captured the skiff. During the landing, Confederate soldiers appeared on the heights above Nomini, but the gunboats dampened their curiosity with some well-placed cannon shots. In April, Teaser, Yankee, , , and accompanied an Army expedition to Machodoc Creek, Virginia. At 5:00 A.M. on April 13, the five ships cleared the St. Mary's River in company with the Army's steamer USAT Long Branch with a battalion of soldiers under the command of General Edward W. Hinks. Long Branch landed her troops at about 8:00 A.M. while the five ships covered the operation. A contingent of Confederate cavalry appeared on the southern bank of the Machodoc, but retired when Teaser and Anacostia sent four armed boat crews ashore. The landing party netted a prisoner, probably a smuggler, and a large quantity of tobacco. By April 14, General Hinks' troops reembarked in Long Branch and headed for Point Lookout. Anacostia accompanied the Army steamer while the other four warships investigated Currioman Bay and Nomini. They returned to St. Mary's, Virginia that afternoon to resume patrols. During the summer of 1864, Teaser was called upon to leave the Potomac once more. On this occasion, the Union forces needed her guns to help defend strategic bridges across the rivers at the head of Chesapeake Bay near Baltimore, Maryland, against Lieutenant General Jubal A. Early's raiders. On July 10, she departed the lower Potomac, rounded Point Lookout, and headed up the Chesapeake Bay. That night, she had to put into the Patuxent River because of heavy winds and leaks in her hull. Before dawn the following morning, she continued up the bay. During the forenoon, the leaks became progressively worse and, by the time she arrived off Annapolis, Maryland, she had to remove her exhaust pipe for temporary repairs. Early that evening, Teaser reached Baltimore where she put in for additional repairs. The gunboat did not reach her destination, the bridge over the Gunpowder River, until late on July 12. She was too late; the bridge had already been burned. She returned to Baltimore immediately to report on the bridge and to pick up arms and provisions for the vessels stationed in the Gunpowder River. When she arrived back at the bridge, she found orders to return to the Potomac awaiting her. Teaser departed the northern reaches of the Chesapeake and reported back to the Potomac Flotilla at St. Inigoes, Virginia on the St. Mary's River in late afternoon on April 14. For the remainder of the war, Teaser and her flotilla-mates plied the Potomac and contributed to the gradual economic strangulation which brought the South to its knees by April 1865. Less than two months after General Robert E. Lee's surrender at Appomattox, Virginia, Teaser was decommissioned at the Washington Navy Yard on June 2. Sold at public auction at Washington to Mr. J. Bigler on June 25, the tug was re- documented as York River on July 2, 1865, and she served commercially until 1878. ==See also== *Ships captured in the American Civil War *Bibliography of American Civil War naval history *Union Navy *List of United States Navy ships ==References== Category:Gunboats of the Confederate States Navy Category:Ships of the Union Navy Category:Ships built in Philadelphia Category:Virginia in the American Civil War Category:Maryland in the American Civil War Category:Balloon tenders Category:1862 ships Category:Captured ships ","title":"CSS Teaser"},{"id":"1279071","text":"The World Tribunal on Iraq (WTI) was a people's court consisting of intellectuals, human rights campaigners and non-governmental organizations, and was active from 2003 to 2005.

Tíscar Castle, which barely retains a tower in good condition, is next to the Water Cave, a true natural monument that has an impressive waterfall inside (except during times of drought). The legend places in this cave the appearance of the Virgin of Tíscar, patron saint of Quesada, to the king of Tíscar, Mohamed Abdón, in the fourteenth century. At the foot of the castle, on a plateau, stands the sanctuary of the Virgin of Tíscar. It preserves the primitive door of the Gothic style of the 14th century. Its interior is extraordinarily beautiful, with an altar made in painted terracotta by the artists from Orea y Baños and from Neo-Romanesque style. We also find rich gates of Granada from the 17th century, as well as votive lamps from the 18th century. Keep good paintings from different eras of great masters. The verses of Antonio Machado dedicated to the Virgin of Tíscar and the Sierra de Quesada are sculpted in the sanctuary square and on a stone slab. In turn it was a tribute to the Sevillian poet that the town of Quesada honored him in 1957. From the sanctuary and in the direction of the mountains we can visit the birth of the Guadalquivir river in the heart of Quesada within its municipal term. There is a new building on Avenida de Almería where all the paintings by Rafael Zabaleta and his friends are available. Paintings from all periods of the painter are preserved, in a chronological way, which were donated by the heirs of Zabaleta to the town of Quesada. Currently and since March 28, 2015 it houses the Miguel Hernández Museum and his wife Josefina Manresa. == Economy == In agriculture the olive grove dominates, being part of its olive cooperative (La Bética Aceitera) of the designation of origin \\"Sierra de Cazorla\\". Cereal cultivation is now vestigial, as it has been replaced by olive groves. == Parties == The two most important parties are held in August and in May. Summer parties are from August 23 to 28. On the dawn of the 29th you climb the Virgin of Tíscar from the town to the sanctuary (located 14 kilometers away). Formerly the road was done on foot, now it goes in procession to the cross of the Humilladero that is at the exit of the town, where the quesadeños and people of the region give an emotional farewell to the Mother of God and her Most Holy Son. From there the transfer continues in a vehicle. On the other hand, on the first Saturday of May, a pilgrimage is made to bring the Virgin of Tíscar back to the town. It is known as the \\"brought of the Virgin\\" day. The Virgin crosses the town to the church where she will remain until the end of August. During the trip, the quesadeños throw loas and petals of roses and in the mantle of the virgin they pin with pins fifty or one hundred euros bills to their employer. From January 19 to 21, the festival of San Sebastián is celebrated, patron of Quesada with its typical flag bearers and drummers in addition to the lights for the most emblematic points of the town. In the annex of Belerda the Feast of the Charges or Feast of the God Boy is celebrated, 3 a tradition that goes back to the 16th century reminiscent of the festival of Moors and Christians and that currently the clothes that carry the charges are old uniforms of the nineteenth century. The party starts on December 25. The five \\"Charges\\", first and second captain, the flag bearer, the guinche and the small charge, accompanied by the drummer and an enthusiastic entourage, depart on the 26th towards the Sanctuary of Tíscar where the image of the Virgin. During the return, from cortijada to cortijada, the tasty products of the slaughter and the good wine receive the entourage. On the 27th, with the renewal of the \\"Charges\\" of the coming year, this peculiar party ends. == Gastronomy == It is a mountain kitchen and therefore blunt. The most unique dish is the talarines, a close relative of the Gazpacho manchego and the tatters, consisting of a stew of meat, vegetables and mushrooms in which dough wafers are cooked that are broken into pieces (hence the name of tatters). Pipirrana, crumbs, porridge, ajoharina, gachurreno, etc. are also prepared. Some typical quesadeños sweets are: fig bread, papajotes, sweet gachillas, florets, drunkards, bath donuts. == Quesada people == * Rafael Zabaleta (1907-1960), painter. * José Luis Verdes painter, although born in Madrid, was closely related to Quesada, where he sponsored a children's painting contest.

Tugnutt played several seasons in the National Hockey League (NHL) with the Quebec Nordiques, Edmonton Oilers, Mighty Ducks of Anaheim, Montreal Canadiens, Ottawa Senators, Pittsburgh Penguins, Columbus Blue Jackets, and Dallas Stars. While a member of the Nordiques on March 21, 1991, Tugnutt set a modern-day NHL record for most saves in a regular-season game when he stopped 70 of 73 shots in a 3-3 tie with the Boston Bruins. After retiring as a player, Tugnutt served as the president, governor, and coach of the Central Canada Hockey League's Kemptville 73's. ==Playing career== ===Early years=== Tugnutt was born in Scarborough, Ontario. As a youth, he played in the 1980 Quebec International Pee-Wee Hockey Tournament with a minor ice hockey team from Toronto. Tugnutt played three seasons with the Peterborough Petes in the Ontario Hockey League, and won the F. W. \\"Dinty\\" Moore Trophy for the rookie with the best goals against average, followed by the Dave Pinkney Trophy for Top Team Goaltending, and was named to the OHL All Star team in 1987. ===NHL beginnings=== He was drafted by the Quebec Nordiques in the fourth round (87th overall) of the 1986 NHL Entry Draft. He was primarily used as a backup during his first three pro seasons, bouncing up and down between the Halifax Citadels of the American Hockey League (AHL) and the parent club in Quebec City. During 1990–91 NHL season, Tugnutt played what would be a career-high 56 games for Quebec and established himself as a quality NHL starter despite playing for what was then the worst team in the league. On March 21, 1991, Tugnutt stopped 70 of 73 shots to earn his team a 3-3 tie against the Boston Bruins, the second-highest number of saves made in a regular season game in NHL history. His performance evoked such respect that after it was over, several Bruins players skated over to congratulate Tugnutt.New York Times, March 21, 1991 The hometown Bruins fans gave him a standing ovation after the game ended as well. In the midst of an inconsistent 1991–92 NHL season, and with the emergence of Stéphane Fiset as the Nordiques' number one goaltender, Tugnutt was demoted to the Nordiques' AHL affiliate. In exchange for Martin Ručínský, he was soon traded to the Edmonton Oilers to serve as Bill Ranford's backup. Tugnutt remained in this role until he was selected by the Mighty Ducks of Anaheim in the 1993 expansion draft. In Anaheim, he split goaltending duties with Guy Hebert. Anaheim quickly settled on Hebert as their future starter, and the Montreal Canadiens decided that André Racicot and Les Kuntar were not adequately serving as Patrick Roy's backup, so Tugnutt was acquired by the Canadiens in exchange for Stephan Lebeau. Tugnutt's performance suffered; for Anaheim he had posted a .908 save percentage in 28 games, but for Montreal, he posted an .860 save percentage in eight games during the 1993-94 season. During the 1994 Stanley Cup playoffs against the Bruins, Tugnutt started a game as Patrick Roy was recuperating from an appendectomy, but he did not return to the Canadiens for the 1995–96 season, and was replaced by Patrick Labrecque. These experiences caused Tugnutt to ponder retirement. ===Career breakthrough=== In 1995, Tugnutt signed a one-year deal with the Washington Capitals, and subsequently spent the entire 1995-96 season with their AHL affiliate, the Portland Pirates. He was productive in Portland, helping lead the Pirates to the Calder Cup Finals.The AHL.com, Portland rejuvanates Tugnutt's career This strong performance caught the attention of the Ottawa Senators. Goaltending coach Phil Myre helped Tugnutt work on fundamentals, and gained confidence and improved his game each season. While in Ottawa, he went from fighting for the backup position with Mike Bales to splitting duties with starter Damian Rhodes the next two seasons, and became the team's undisputed starting goaltender by 1999. On April 12, 1997, Tugnutt shutout the Buffalo Sabres in the final game of the regular season. Tugnutt's father had just died and immediately following the win Tugnutt pointed to the rafters to signify the win was for his father, in what became an iconic image of Tugnutt. This win propelled the Senators to their first playoff berth. In 1998–99, Tugnutt had the best season of his career, and one of the best by an NHL goaltender in the modern era. He posted a league-best goals against average of 1.79, placed second in the league in save percentage at .925, had a career high in wins, and tied a career high in shutouts. This outstanding play, and an injury to Curtis Joseph, gave Tugnutt the opportunity to play in the 1999 NHL All-Star Game. The next season, Rhodes was shipped to the expansion Atlanta Thrashers, giving Tugnutt sole possession of the starting job. However, he was unable to match his previous season and Ottawa traded him to the Pittsburgh Penguins for an experienced playoff goaltender, Tom Barrasso. After arriving in Pittsburgh, Tugnutt took over the starting job from Jean-Sébastien Aubin and helped lead Pittsburgh deep into the playoffs. Tugnutt was in goal for the May 4, 2000, playoff game against the Philadelphia Flyers in which he made 70 saves on 72 shots. The 72nd shot was a goal scored by Keith Primeau of the Flyers at 12:01 of the fifth overtime, winning the game for Philadelphia 2-1, the longest NHL game since the 1930s. Following his performance with Pittsburgh, Tugnutt became one of the most sought-after free agent goaltenders on the market. Both Ottawa and Pittsburgh attempted to re-sign Tugnutt but were unable to match the lucrative contract offered by the expansion Columbus Blue Jackets.Post- Gazette, Sens want Tugnutt Back, Tugnutt hot on free agent marketCanoe Sports Slam Hockey, Tugnutt Signs with Columbus During Columbus' inaugural season, Tugnutt was considered their backbone. Tugnutt's 22 wins broke another NHL record for most wins on an expansion team, and his .917 save percentage was among the best in the league.The Sports Network, Tugnutt was the backbone to Columbus The team's second season was not as impressive as the first. Tugnutt battled injuries and ended up sharing time with young netminder Marc Denis. General Manager Doug MacLean gave Denis the opportunity to be the sole starter on the club, and traded Tugnutt to the Dallas Stars.HockeyInformer.com, Denis had potential to be starter In 2002–03 Tugnutt was the backup to Marty Turco. In January 2003, Turco suffered an ankle injury that allowed Tugnutt to start almost 20 straight games, and he posted back to back shutouts during that stretch. For the season, he played 31 games and posted a 15-10-5 record including four shutouts. The 2003–04 season was possibly Tugnutt's toughest in the NHL, as by January he only received three starts. He was sent down to the minors for the first time in almost ten years to get some playing time with the Utah Grizzlies. Just five games in, Tugnutt pulled his groin and was out until after the All Star break.AllSports.com,Tugnutt pulls groin in minors Soon after, he was recalled to the Dallas Stars. After two solid starts, one of which was a shutout, Tugnutt received a break when Turco received a four- game suspension.ESPN, Turco Suspended 4 Games He retired following the 2003-04 season. ===Post-retirement=== After the lockout, Tugnutt joined CBC as a color commentator for Hockey Night in Canada.SLAM! Sports, Tugnutt Joins CBC as Commentator From 2008-09 to 2009-10, Tugnutt served as the goaltending coach for the OHL's Oshawa Generalsoshawagenerals.com, Oshawa Generals Hockey Staff and was a goaltending consultant for the 2010 Canadian World Junior team.Hockey Canada, FOURTEEN ELITE UNDER-20 AND UNDER-18 GOALTENDERS TO ATTEND FOURTH ANNUAL HOCKEY CANADA PROGRAM OF EXCELLENCE CAMP IN CALGARY, JUNE 11-14 Tugnutt's contract with the Generals was not renewed after a major front office shakeup in May 2010.Oshawa Express, Gens make big change Tugnutt joined the Peterborough Petes coaching staff for the 2010-11 season. Tugnutt was a consultant with Hockey Canada until 2013 when that relationship ended. Tugnutt then moved behind the bench of his sons' team the Kemptville 73's. ==Off the ice== Tugnutt is married to wife Lisa, and the couple have two sons, Jacob and Matthew. The family resides on Stoney Lake near Peterborough, Ontario. Tugnutt enjoys boating and traveling. In the summer of 1998, Tugnutt was involved in a severe boating accident, and it was suspected that he might miss out on training camp. Tugnutt healed and had the best season of his career, breaking the modern-day NHL record for lowest G.A.A. and coming second in the league in save percentage.Hockey Goalies, Tugnutt Profile, and boating accident Tugnutt previously owned the Kemptville 73's, a Junior \\"A\\" ice hockey team, where he served as head coach, president and governor. Tugnutt sold the team to an ownership group led by former teammate Jason York. ==Honours and records== * Modern-day record holder for most saves in a regular season game non-loss (stopped 70 of 73 shots in a 3-3 tie with the Boston Bruins; March 21, 1991). * Holds Mighty Ducks of Anaheim record for most saves in a regular season game with 46, set against the Edmonton Oilers on November 21, 1993). * Tied with Dominik Hašek for Ottawa Senators highest regular season save percentage. * Leader in save percentage for the 1999–2000 Playoffs. * Holds Pittsburgh Penguins record for highest save percentage in the playoffs. * Has Division named in his honour in the FCHL. ==International play== After a disappointing 4-game sweep in the NHL playoffs, Tugnutt was more than excited to play for Team Canada in the 1999 World Hockey Championship. The semi-final game was against the Czech Republic in which Canada lost after the game went undecided in overtime, ending in a shootout. This was Tugnutt's second appearance on Team Canada. He played for them in 1993 as well.Ottawa Sun, Shootout loss to Czechs ==Career statistics== ===Regular season and playoffs=== { border=\\"0\\" cellpadding=\\"1\\" cellspacing=\\"0\\" style=\\"width:90%; text-align:center;\\" - bgcolor=\\"#e0e0e0\\" ! colspan=\\"3\\" bgcolor=\\"#ffffff\\"  ! rowspan=\\"99\\" bgcolor=\\"#ffffff\\"  ! colspan=\\"9\\" bgcolor=\\"#e0e0e0\\"  Regular season ! rowspan=\\"99\\" bgcolor=\\"#ffffff\\"  ! colspan=\\"8\\" bgcolor=\\"#e0e0e0\\"  Playoffs - bgcolor=\\"#e0e0e0\\" !

Many items are now (L) - meaning they are limited and cannot be repaired causing the player to have to buy another when it is decayed to the extent it can no longer be used. This decay and expending of consumables encourages people to craft the items other players may need, promoting a thriving market in the items and ingredients needed to craft. However, currently it is difficult to craft items (XX% return in TT costs of the ingredients, but a much lower chance of successfully creating an item depending on skills and the Quality Rating of the blueprint). The three main activities (hunting, crafting and mining) have loot returns which appear random, but have been confirmed to be influenced by the equipment, skills and activity (mob, blueprint, area), of the avatar. The better matched the skills, equipment and area of the activity, the more likely the player will have a 'success' - determined as either a hit, an evade or dodge, a successful craft or the finding of an ore or enmatter. Skills are gained from either hitting, being hit, healing (using various healing equipment), crafting or mining. These skills are extractable and can be sold to other players. There is no account fee or connection charge. The in-game activities that do not require PED are: *sweating creatures (called mobs), *walking around looking for (and gathering up) fruit/stones/dung on the ground, *socializing. *Event organizing (particularly if you can get sponsors to donate prizes). Trading, or reselling requires some PED to start up and much of your time will be spent advertising and building a contact network of sellers and buyers. Players have the option of depositing large amounts of cash for investment in trading, as there are player controlled shops and market stalls they can purchase outright (or rent from other players), in various towns in the game, or starting small buying small amounts of ore, enmatter, sweat, fruit etc. from players and either manufacturing other items from them or consolidating the small amounts into larger piles and placing them on the auction house for sale. It has been reported that long term returns from hunting, mining or crafting are in the region of 95% of the costs of the activity. Short term, loots and successes can swing wildly. === Character creation === Before beginning the game, a player has to choose a name for his or her avatar, which must be a first name, a last name, and a nickname; all 3 names will be visible to all the players in the game. The name can not have any profanities in it and can never be changed, unless MindArk thinks the name is inappropriate. Next, the new player will need to create and customize their avatar. During the process of creating an avatar, the player is asked for some personal information. This does not show up in-game, and is only used by MindArk to verify a player's identity when they want to withdraw money from the game. After initial creation, further physical modifications can only be achieved through services offered by other users. Unlike most other MMOs, each person is only allowed one avatar, and having more than one could cause a player to be banned from the game, losing any funds they have invested in the game. This measure is implemented to disallow players from having the opportunity to cheat or farm, which could negatively influence the game and its players due to the real money that is involved. ===Planets=== Entropia Universe (then Project Entropia) was released in 2003 with only one planet, named Calypso. A second planet was opened on April 6, 2010, called ROCKtropia. It is owned and developed by Neverdie Studios (owned by long-time player Jon Jacobs). The theme of this planet is \\"music\\" and \\"pop culture\\", which is seen throughout the planet. The third planet to be released was Next Island on December 8, 2010. The theme of this planet is \\"paradise\\", with beaches and landscapes. The fourth planet launched was Arkadia, on May 25, 2011, with a theme of \\"treasure hunting\\", which takes place both in-game and outside the game. The fifth planet to be launched was Cyrene, opened May 1, 2012, by Digital Scryers and Creative Kingdom. This was a soft launch to allow existing players to beta- test it. The sixth planet is Toulan which was released in a beta stage on February 19, 2014. Developed by 'Beladcom' out of Jordan, Planet Toulan is inspired by rich Arabian mythology and culture. While not a planet, space is a separate area in the Entropia Universe, connecting all planets. Space is developed and managed by MindArk themselves and allows players to travel among planets via space ships. == Development == In 1995, development of Entropia Universe (formerly Project Entropia) was started by two different groups - one in Sweden headed by Jan Welter Timkrans and one in Switzerland, headed by Benny Iggland. Initially taking place on the fictional Planet Calypso, the 2001 version used the NetImmerse 4 game engine. On May 20, 2002, the Commercial Open Trial began, and the game was available to the public. With Version Update 4.2 on 28 January 2003, the game was considered \\"Gold\\". Some important additions to the game since have been: { - style=\\"width: 75px;\\"4.2style=\\"width: 150px;\\"28 January 2003style=\\"width: 400px;\\"Personal storage system - 5.324 November 2003Housing system, space travel - 5.65 April 2004Mentor & Disciple system - 5.71 June 2004Crystal Palace Space Station - 6.010 August 2004New graphics engine (GameBryo) - 6.16 October 2004Amethera continent, Landgrabs - 7.34 May 2005Land Area Management, Auction Procurement Orders - 7.51 July 2005New avatar creation process, Beauty Professions - 7.823 November 2005Animal Taming - 8.019 December 2005Asteroid Space Resort - 8.818 December 2006Shopping Malls } In August, 2009, Version 10.0 was released, using CryEngine 2 from Crytek. With the new engine, almost everything in the game required changes, including the overall land maps. This change was retconned into the storyline as attacking robots crashing their large spaceship into the planet, changing the land. There were some systems (like pets taming) that were disabled right after the implementation of the CryEngine; some of these were returned after a few weeks, whereas some took months or even years. There are still systems that were in place before CryEngine that have not yet returned as of August 2014. { - style=\\"width: 75px;\\"11.0.0style=\\"width: 150px;\\"6 April 2010style=\\"width: 400px;\\"New Planet (ROCKtropia) - 11.2.021 June 2010Vehicles - 11.3.028 September 2010Voice chat system - 11.5.1 8 December 2010New Planet (Next Island) - 11.10.2 25 May 2011New Planet (Planet Arkadia) - 12.0 21 June 2011Space - 12.6.01 May 2012 New Planet (Planet Cyrene) - 12.910 Dec 2012 VirtualTycoon mobile app released for Android devices - 15.015 Oct 2014 Taming & Pets (Reintroduced) } ==Awards and recognition== In February 2007, Entropia Universe won game of the month on MPOGD. In December 2008 Entropia Universe won game of the month on MPOGD for a second time. == Significant events and virtual property sales == *December 14, 2004 – Game creators MindArk announced the conclusion of the first \\"Treasure Island Sale\\", a virtual island put up for auction. The winning bidder, Zachurm \\"Deathifier\\" Emegen, paid 265,000 PED (US$26,500) for the island. At the time, this was the highest price ever paid for a virtual item. According to the press release, it is \\"a large island off a newly discovered continent surrounded by deep creature infested waters. The island boasts beautiful beaches ripe for developing beachfront property, an old volcano with rumors of fierce creatures within, the outback is overrun with mutants, and an area with a high concentration of robotic miners guarded by heavily armed assault robots indicates interesting mining opportunities.\\" *October 24, 2005 – A virtual \\"asteroid space resort\\" was bought by Jon \\"Neverdie\\" Jacobs for a sum of 1,000,000 PED (US$100,000), surpassing the sale of Treasure Island. Jon Jacobs is also the writer and producer of a song titled Gamer Chick, which is played within the Entropia Universe. The asteroid was named Club NEVERDIE after Jacobs's own in-game avatar and has made headlines around the world, for the price of the purchase, as well as Jacobs' ambitious plans to turn the resort into a venue for \\"Live Entertainment in Virtual Reality\\". *November 9, 2005 – The BBC reported that \\"Deathifier\\" had recouped his investment in under a year. He made money by selling virtual homes as well as taxing other gamers to hunt or mine on the island. \\"The money made to date is only a taste of what can be achieved with my virtual island purchase,\\" said Deathifier. *May 2, 2006 – MindArk announced the introduction of an ATM card enabling players to withdraw the real-world currency equivalent of their PED funds directly from any Versatel ATM. It was stated that $165 million had \\"passed through the game\\" in 2005 and that this figure was expected to double in 2006. *Mike Everest, a home-schooled high school senior from Durango, Colorado, along with his mother, earned $35,000 in 2006 by constructing and selling weapons in Entropia. Everest spent an average of three hours per day playing the game and intended to continue playing to fund his college education. *October 17, 2006 – MindArk announced that Entropia Universe had achieved a milestone, with over 500,000 registered users. \\"The growth of Entropia Universe is an enormous achievement for us and the members,\\" said Jan Welter, CEO of MindArk, developer of Entropia Universe. \\"Individuals are joining the Entropia Universe community to interact, meet new people, learn new ideas, reach entrepreneurial aspirations, create societies, and even foster new relationships in everyday reality.\\" *May 8, 2007 – MindArk announced the results of the world's first virtual banking license auction. These two-year exclusive licenses aimed to integrate real world banking systems into Entropia Universe, working similarly to real-world banks or pawn shops. Initially, they would be provided with secure systems enabling them to lend money and collect interest, design and name their own virtual bank building(s), and make their own personnel available through avatars. Each winner would be required to add a further US$100,000 as working capital. MindArk CIO Marco Behrmann said, \\"The five banks will have integrated services within the mechanics of Entropia Universe and will not just be virtual advertising spots.\\" After months of bidding, the six licenses sold for a total of US$404,000, to: ** Avatar \\"Janus JD D'Arcwire\\", representing Wirecard Bank AG, who paid US$59,060.Fox News ** Russian Internet payment provider Moneta.ru, with avatar \\"Yuri iNTellect\\" who paid US$99,900. ** Second Life virtual celebrity Jamill Copperfield, who paid US$42,000.Pcmag.com ** Entropia celebrity \\"Jon NEVERDIE Jacobs\\", who paid US$90,000. ** Second Life virtual celebrity and entrepreneur Anshe Chung, who paid US$60,000. ** Avatar \\"Jolana Kitty Brice\\", an Entropia Universe participant and entrepreneur who paid US$95,000. *December 8, 2009 – The sale of the Crystal Palace Space Station was announced. A public auction held from December 14, 2009 through December 28, 2009 determined the new owner. **It was won by Buzz Erik Lightyear, who paid 3.3 million PED (US$330,000) for it. *June 15, 2010 – Parent company MindArk AB released its 2009 annual report, showing a cash flow of -18.6 Million SEK (-$2.4M), and stating that the real- world bank is on hold, due to a lack of funds. MindArk also stated they had a signed letter of intent to sell their original virtual planet, Planet Calypso, for a price of US$6,000,000, to an unnamed company, later announced to be SEE Virtual Worlds, already a partner. SEE intended to release at least two planets in the Entropia Universe: (Planet Michael, a virtual world celebrating the life of Michael Jackson, and a second planet featuring monsters from Universal.) However, in June 2011, MindArk released a statement announcing the end of their partnership with SEE altogether. * November 16, 2011 – MindArk announced the sale of Calypso Land Deeds for $100 per deed. Each deed provides a weekly income to its owner, based on a percentage of the income that MindArk receives from running Planet Calypso and its other in-game areas (Crystal Palace and Space). Deed owners were promised the option of claiming a piece of land on Calypso, on which a home could be built. As of April 2015, the land claiming has not yet been implemented by MindArk. * March 26, 2014 – Planet Arkadia announced a similar scheme to the Calypso Land Deeds. Planet Arkadia Underground deeds were priced at just $5 and provide a daily income taken from part of the revenue of Planet Arkadia. == References == == External links== * * Planet Calypso – Official website * ROCKtropia – Official website * Planet Cyrene – Official website * Planet Arkadia – Official website * Planet Toulan – Official website Category:2003 video games Category:Massively multiplayer online role-playing games Category:First-person shooter multiplayer online games Category:Massively multiplayer online games Category:Science-fiction massively multiplayer online role-playing games Category:Video games developed in Sweden Category:Virtual economies Category:Virtual reality communities Category:Windows games Category:Windows-only games Category:CryEngine games Category:Space massively multiplayer online role-playing games ","title":"Entropia Universe"},{"id":"1279105","text":"John Gregory Huarte (born April 6, 1944) is a former American football quarterback. He played college football at the University of Notre Dame for the Notre Dame Fighting Irish football team and won the 1964 Heisman Trophy. He then played professionally with a number of teams in the American Football League (AFL), the National Football League (NFL), and in the World Football League (WFL) between 1965 and 1975. Huarte was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame in 2005. ==Early years and college career== Huarte was born and raised in Orange County, California; his father Joseph was a former minor league baseball player of Basque descent. The family ran an orange and avocado ranch and he graduated from Mater Dei High School in Santa Ana in 1961. Huarte played college football for the Notre Dame Fighting Irish. During his sophomore and junior seasons, he averaged only a few minutes per game due to injuries and the Irish went 5–5 and 2–7, respectively. As a senior, however, he became the starting quarterback as the Irish won all but one game during the 1964 season, in which he was selected as an All-American and won the Heisman Trophy. By the end of the season, Huarte threw for 2,062 yards with only 205 passes, an average of over ten yards per pass attempt, many to receiver Jack Snow. Huarte was a member of the College All-Star team in the annual pre-season game against the defending NFL champions at Chicago's Soldier Field. The 1965 game was in early August against the Cleveland Browns and Huarte was named the game's most valuable player. ==Professional career== Huarte was drafted in 1965 by both pro football leagues: he was the twelfth overall selection of the AFL draft and the 76th pick of the NFL draft. He signed with the AFL's New York Jets over the NFL Philadelphia Eagles, but was beaten out for the starting position by fellow-rookie Joe Namath, the first pick of the AFL draft. who had finished eleventh in the Heisman voting as a senior at Alabama. The AFL Jets thus signed both the Heisman Trophy winner and the Alabama star away from the NFL. Huarte was third on the depth chart behind co-starters Namath and Mike Taliaferro and was on the taxi squad. Following the 1965 season, Huarte was traded to the Boston Patriots for Jim Colclough and the draft rights to Wichita State linebacker/center Jim Waskiewicz. Subsequently, Huarte did see action as a back-up quarterback for several other professional teams from 1966 to 1972. Out of the NFL in 1973, he played his final two seasons of professional football as the starting quarterback of the Memphis Southmen of the World Football League, which folded before the completion of the 1975 season. ==After football== Huarte is a member of The Pigskin Club of Washington, D.C. National Intercollegiate All-American Football Players Honor Roll, and is also the founder and CEO of Arizona Tile Supply, Inc.Our History . Arizona Tile. Arizona Tile has become one of the leading tile and slab distributors in the U.S. Accessed July 24, 2011. In 2005, he was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame. Huarte is married to Eileen Devine from Woodside, LI; they have 5 children and 14 grandchildren. ==See also== * List of American Football League players ==References* Category:1944 births Category:Living people Category:All-American college football players Category:American Football League players Category:American football quarterbacks Category:American people of Basque descent Category:Boston Patriots players Category:College Football Hall of Fame inductees Category:Chicago Bears players Category:Heisman Trophy winners Category:Kansas City Chiefs players Category:Memphis Southmen players Category:Notre Dame Fighting Irish football players Category:Philadelphia Eagles players Category:Players of American football from California Category:Sportspeople from Anaheim, California Category:Sportspeople from Santa Ana, California ","title":"John Huarte"},{"id":"1279117","text":" The Heinkel He 343 was a quadjet bomber project developed by Ernst Heinkel Flugzeugwerke in Nazi Germany during the final two years of World War II. Plans recovered by the Soviet Union were studied and used in the development of the Ilyushin Il-22. ==Design and development== The Heinkel He 343 was designed for the Luftwaffe by the German Heinkel aircraft manufacturing company in the beginning of 1944. A total of 20 of these aircraft were ordered. For shortening the development time and for re-use of existing parts, its general design was envisioned along the lines of an enlarged Arado Ar 234. For a choice of engines, the Junkers Jumo 004 and the Heinkel HeS 011 were planned. The DFS was involved in the project and created the project known as P.1068. By the end of 1944, work was nearly finished by the Heinkel engineers, with parts for the He 343 prototype aircraft either under fabrication or in a finished state, when the order was cancelled due to the Emergency Fighter Program. Four versions were planned: the A-1 bomber, the A-2 reconnaissance aircraft, and the A-3 and B-1 Zerstörer (\\"Destroyer\\") heavy fighters. Postwar, the Soviet Union utilized the design as the basis for the development of the Ilyushin Il-22, changing some of the parameters such as size and crew numbers. One prototype was built and flown.Kühni, Robert. \\"Iljushin Il-22\\" (German). fliegerweb.com. Retrieved: 27 February 2012, via Wayback Machine.Lomme 2000, pp. 8ff.

Fury, Steve Canyon, and the Green Hornet. Captain Action was the Ideal Toy Company's answer to Hasbro's G.I. Joe—although the protagonist dolls of both toy lines were created and designed by the same toy-and-idea man, Stan Weston. ==Historical overview== Toy developer Stan Weston went to Hasbro's Don Levine with the idea of an articulated doll in the form of a soldier — a basic figure, and with limitless accessories. Levine and his Hasbro team took the concept, making it into G.I. Joe, the first modern action figure for boys — and the first to carry the action figure generic name, an attempt to remove the term \\"doll\\" from a toy for boys. Weston took his money from the G.I. Joe venture and founded his own licensing company, representing DC Comics, Marvel Comics, and King Features Syndicate. After the success of G.I. Joe, Stan Weston's company, Leisure Concepts, then brought the idea of a new, articulated, twelve-inch (305 mm) action figure to Ideal Toys Corporation, who were seeking an action figure of their own, to remain competitive in the toy market. Weston proposed Captain Magic, a many-in-one hero, who could adopt the guise of several heroes, all of whom Leisure Concepts represented. The name was changed to Captain Action, and first marketed by Ideal in 1966. The figure itself had a rather sad and worried expression, a strange shaped head (so the masks of the various heroes would better stay in place over it) and a more detailed musculature than G.I. Joe's. The original Ideal base for the line was Captain Action in his blue and black uniform, with lightning sword and ray gun included in the box. Separate Superman, Batman, Lone Ranger, The Phantom, Flash Gordon, Captain America, Sgt Fury, Steve Canyon and Aquaman costumes (with accessories) were available; the next wave (1967) added Spider-Man, Buck Rogers, the Green Hornet, and Tonto, with a Blue Lone Ranger variation (matching the still popular Clayton Moore series) and collectible flicker rings in each box. In 1967, Captain Action proved popular enough to expand the line, adding a partner, Action Boy, and an enemy, Dr. Evil, a blue skinned alien with large bug eyes and an exposed brain, wearing a modified Nehru suit and sandals. A line of female figures was also released called the \\"Super Queens Posin' Dolls\\", which featured Batgirl, Mera, Supergirl, and Wonder Woman figures. Unlike Captain Action and Action Boy, the Super Queens dolls were each individually based on a singular superheroine (instead of a base \\"Super Queen\\" doll with interchangeable outfits). Also, a vehicle called the \\"Silver Streak,\\" a amphibian car with missile launchers, was added, large enough for both the Captain and sidekick. Several sets meant to be used by Captain Action in his Captain Action identity were designed for the character as well: a four foot working parachute, a jet mortar, a jet pack, a weapons arsenal, and several other secret weapons to add to the Action Cave, which the special box for the Streak could convert into. Both the Captain and Dr. Evil received \\"secret lairs,\\" which doubled as carrying cases for the figures, but which are now quite rare. All of this was an attempt by Ideal to build the \\"Action\\" line and focus on Captain Action as a hero in his own right, rather than just a base figure for other heroes. After just a couple of years, the Captain Action line declined in sales. As a result, Ideal Toys discontinued it in 1968. Though Captain Action was produced for only two and a half years, the characters and accessories have become amongst the most fondly remembered, and expensive to obtain on the collector's market, action figures of the era. Throughout the 1970s, Captain Action leftover uniforms and boots were used on knock-off, blow-molded figures from China (where the original was cast and assembled) and Ideal itself reused the original body molds to rush a Star Wars-like toy to the market, the Knight of Darkness, in 1977. Captain Action collectors would buy the figure (cast in black plastic) often using the hands to replace the sometimes missing hands of the vintage figures. ===Captain Action returns=== After 30 years off the market, Captain Action was revived in 1998, by retro toy company Playing Mantis. In addition to Captain Action and Dr. Evil, costumes released boxed with Captain Action figure were The Lone Ranger (in red and black outfit), Tonto, Flash Gordon, his never-before-made nemesis Ming the Merciless (with a new flesh-tone Dr. Evil figure), The Green Hornet, and his never-before-made sidekick Kato. The line met with lackluster sales, and carded costumes-only were issued separately: Green Hornet, Kato, Lone Ranger (in blue outfit), Tonto, The Phantom, and his never-before-made enemy Kabai Singh. Also revived was Action Boy (now called Kid Action, due to Hasbro owning the rights to the name Action Man) and retro long box packaging for Captain Action and Dr. Evil. The changes made little difference in the general sales and the second coming of Captain Action ended in 2000. ===2000s–2010s=== Since 2005 Captain Action Enterprises holds the licensing rights and has been producing an array of new merchandise, including statues, toys, comics, trading cards, collectibles and apparel. In March 2011, Round 2 Corp. and Captain Action Enterprises announced plans for a redesigned 1/6 scale Captain Action figure. ==In other media== === Comic books === ==== DC Comics ==== National Periodical (DC Comics) licensed the character from Ideal and published five issues of Captain Action in 1968, illustrated at first by Wally Wood, then by Gil Kane. The scripts were by Jim Shooter and Gil Kane. A 2006 interview with Shooter reveals the unpromising setup of the comic: The comic book story line had little to do with the toy concept, as some of the heroes licensed for use as costumes for the Captain Action doll were not owned and published by DC (Spider-Man and Captain America for example, were Marvel Comics characters), therefore the ability to change into different characters was entirely dropped. Instead, Captain Action came to possess magical coins, each of which provided him with a spectacular power from a Greek, Roman, or Norse mythological god (in a similar way to the original Captain Marvel). Captain Action was given a real name of his own, Clive Arno, and was identified as a widowed archaeologist and museum curator, and was described as having located \\"the coins of power\\" in a buried city. Action Boy's comic-book alter-ego was Carl Arno, son of Clive. Dr. Evil was given a back-story too, having been Captain Action's father-in-law, then going mad in a mishap. The series lasted five issues, until July 1969. In the early 1980s, writer Mike Tiefenbacher wrote a story proposal that would have revived Captain Action and Action Boy as \\"Captain Triumph\\" and \\"Javelin\\" in the \\"Whatever Happened To...?\\" backup feature in DC Comics Presents. DC Comics rejected the idea due to copyright concerns regarding the characters. Issue #5 of the comic, retitled 'Thrills and Adventure', was used as a prop in the 'It's the Arts' episode of Monty Python's Flying Circus. ==== Moonstone Books ==== In 2008 Moonstone Books began a new series and created a new back-story for the character. Captain Action was now Miles Drake, a former Marine who discovers a cache of alien weaponry during the Vietnam War. The weapons are connected to a race of alien parasites called the Red Crawl, who have been taking over world leaders in a bid to dominate the earth. The Red Crawl's main representative on earth is Dr. Eville (based on Dr. Evil from the Ideal toy line). Drake becomes an agent of the A.C.T.I.O.N. Directorate, a secret agency operating outside the government and dedicated to defending earth from the alien menace. The name of the organization is an acronym for \\"Advanced Command for Telluric Interdiction Observation and Nullification.\\" Eventually, the A.C.T.I.O.N. directorate is able to use the alien technology to create superheroes and the Red Crawl is apparently defeated. The series also tell the story of a second Captain Action, Miles's rebellious son, Cole Drake, who inherits the heroic identity in the 21st Century. It is revealed that the Red Crawl was never actually defeated and that the superheroic Protectors are actually under their control. Cole must struggle against the renewed alien menace and the rogue superheroes. The stories of the original Captain Action are told in the 1960s where the character is a costumed super spy. The identity-changing aspect of the toy line shows up in Captain Action's ability to use a material called \\"plastiderm\\" to disguise himself as almost anyone. In the modern stories the younger Captain Action used the more advanced \\"plasmaderm\\" which allows him not only to assume someone's likeness, but any powers they possess. Thus Captain Action is finally able to change into other superheroes, though this only works for original characters like Savior rather than for licensed characters like Superman. The exception to this has been a crossover adventure with the Phantom whose adventures Moonstone was also publishing. Moonstone has featured a similarly revised Action Boy. In this version he is Sean Barrett, the son of a famous naturalist whose identity is assumed by Dr. Eville. His stories also take place in the 1960s. Moonstone has also created an original character, Lady Action, who works for the British branch of the A.C.T.I.O.N. Directorate. Both Action Boy and the newly introduced Lady Action ( AKA Nicola Sinclair), have been featured as back up stories in the Captain Action comic. Lady Action also debuted in a one shot comic of her own in 2010, and continues to play a pivotal role in the Captain Action ongoing Series. Moonstone Books published a new Captain Action comic book from 2008 to 2010, with the initial six-issue arc written by Fabian Nicieza. A Captain Action Special was also released in 2010 as well as a two-issue miniseries teaming up Captain Action with the Phantom, written by Mike Bullock. In July 2010, Captain Action Season 2, an ongoing series written by Steven Grant, debuted. Moonstone is also releasing Captain Action: Classified, which tells stories of Captain Action's earliest adventures in the 1960s. === Games === In 2016 Small Monsters Games developed and released the Captain Action card game. This is an all-ages casual game including art from classic comics artists Jerry Ordway, Kerry Callen, and Paul Gulacy. The game was designed by Meg Stivison. === Books and novels === In 2010, the coffee table book Captain Action: the Original Super Hero Action Figure, by Michael Eury, was published by TwoMorrows Publishing. In July 2012, an original Captain Action pulp novel was released by Airship 27 called Captain Action: Riddle of the Glowing Men, written by Jim Beard. A second novel by Jim Beard titled Hearts of the Rising Sun was released in 2014 by Airship 27. In 2015 a novel featuring Lady Action: The Sands of Forever by Ron Fortier was released by Airship 27 in 2015. A third Captain Action novel titled Cry of the Jungle Lord written by Jim Beard and Barry Reese was released by Airship 27 in 2017. ==References== ==External links== *Moonstone Books Nabs Captain Action at THE PULSE *Preview of Captain Action #0 from Moonstone Books *Captain Action at Don Markstein's Toonopedia.

It was built by Tacoma City Light (now Tacoma Power) in 1924–1926. Tacoma's demand for electricity grew rapidly after World War I. Tacoma City Light's Nisqually River Hydroelectric Project, built in 1912, could not meet the demand and the utility decided to build a new hydroelectric project on the North Fork Skokomish River. The dam and powerhouse first began to deliver electricity on February 12, 1926. It has a concrete arch design and includes 90,000 cubic yards (69,000 m³) of concrete, covering a whole 6,244 feet (1903 m) of water. Two 21,600 kilowatt generators provide 127 million kilowatt-hours annually to the Tacoma Power system. Construction began on July 7, 1924, under the commissioner Ira S. Davidsson (1918–1940). It has a top width of eight feet (2.4 m) and a base width of 50 feet (15 m), at 275 feet (84 m) high and 1,111 feet (339 m) long. The transmission of electricity to Tacoma, over lines crossing Tacoma Narrows, was activated, or \\"formally energized\\", on March 23, 1926, with the push of a button by President Calvin Coolidge in a ceremony at the White House.

It did run on \\"The Works\\" television network before it ceased operations February 28, 2017. A 52-episode monochrome anime series, it tells the story of a member of the Universal Peace Corps, originally from the planet Radion, coming to Earth on a mission to determine if this world meets standards for membership in the Galactic Union of Worlds and assist its inhabitants during his stay. While on his mission, Prince Planet adopts the identity of an Earth boy named Bobby and gains comrades who work together alongside him fighting forces of evil, both alien and terrestrial. ==Production overview and history== Prince Planet was originally produced by TCJ (Television Corporation of Japan, now Eiken) and aired on the Fuji Television network in June 1965. The show was one of the first heavily merchandised shows in Japan, with simple things like shoes getting the \\"Planet Boy Papi\\" logo. An English-dubbed version was released by American International Television Productions in September 1966, and produced by James Nicholson and Samuel Z. Arkoff. The dubbing was performed in Miami at Copri Films International and directed by Mark Harris, with dialog scripting by Reuben Guberman, who also reworked The Amazing 3 for Erika Productions in 1967 and developed the live-action tokusatsu-kaiju series Giant Robo for American television, later that same year, under the title Johnny Sokko And His Flying Robot. The American theme was composed by Guy Hemric and Jerry Styner, who had previously written songs for several of American International's \\"Beach Party\\" movies. Glico was a major sponsor for the series and made Papi \\"prizes\\" that came in certain candy products. Prizes included mini action figures and play jewelry. ==Main characters== ===Prince Planet, allies, and enemies=== The main characters appearing throughout most of the series are all introduced by the fourth episode. In episode 1, Prince Planet arrives on Earth and meets a girl, Riko or Diana Worthy in the English-dubbed version and her father, Pops Worthy, who live on a large ranch. In episode 2, a wrestler known as Dan Dynamo, billed as \\"The strongest man in the world,\\" joins the Prince Planet team. Episode 3 introduces Warlock, who is said to be the \\"Master of Martian Magic,\\" although his Martian origins seem to be more of a contrivance added to the English dub; whatever Warlock's origin, he is established as a student of some kind of magical school who runs away to Earth after being punished for getting drunk on prune juice. The last major team member is a magician named AjiBaba of Abbadon, from the desert of the eastern hemisphere who debuts in episode 4 as an arch-enemy of Warlock, who attacked his country. Many of the episodes involve battles with Warlock until episode 30, when Krag from the planet Kragmire banishes (throws) Warlock into the depths of space and becomes Prince Planet's major nemesis until the end of the series. Warlock finally returns in the second-to-last episode of the series. ===Human guise and transformation=== While on Earth, Prince Planet exists usually as Bobby, a normal boy, but when the need arises he will transform into Prince Planet to fight enemies or protect his friends. He transforms similarly to Shazam by holding his pendant with both hands and saying \\"Peeeeeee Pazow!!\\" with the \\"Pazow\\" being added to cover the Japanese \\"Papi.\\" When Bobby is transformed into Prince Planet, an appropriate suit of battle armor comes with the transformation, armor which resembles the apparel worn by the people of his native world. This includes a helmet, which all male members of Radion society seem to wear. ===The super-humanoid powers of Prince Planet=== Prince Planet's main powers are not altogether unlike those of Superman, and in the original Japanese, his home world is named \\"the .\\" His pendant-endowed powers include super strength, flight, and resistance to harsh environments like outer space, though he can be injured in his transformed state. Prince Planet can also use his superior intellect (in several episodes, he is said to have an IQ of 200) along with the energy of the pendant to transform material objects at will; this power is very useful to create needed weapons, transportation, or other devices. ====The power pendant of Prince Planet==== A recurring plot element of many episodes hinges on a limitation resembling that of the Green Lantern of DC Comics, in that his pendant needs to be recharged periodically. But unlike the Green Lantern, Prince Planet cannot perform this task himself. Instead, replenishment of the pendant's energy is handled from the planet Radion. As his energy supply diminishes, the \\"P\\" in his pendant goes from black to white like a thermometer in dropping temperatures. On Prince Planet's home planet of Radion, in the \\"power tower,\\" there is a person whose job is to monitor the pendant's energy level and ensure that it does not run too low. Not surprisingly in view of this plot element, the custodian of the Radion power tower often appears to be \\"asleep on the job\\" while Earth and Prince Planet are hanging in the balance, and he sends energy to the pendant at the last possible second before disaster. Even whenever he has been completely deprived of the pendant's power, however, Prince Planet can still, physically, put up a good fight, and his high intellect makes him a cunning and formidable opponent. ==Japanese Cast== Toshiko Fujita as Papi (Bobby) Eiko Masuyama as Rico Ichirō Murakoshi as Kiribito Jou Fujimoto as Chakoron Kazuo Nagayama as Strong Reizō Nomoto as Zenoroy Yoshihisa Kamo as Ajababa ==English dub voice talent== *Catherine \\"Bobbie\\" Byers (voice of Prince Planet, Bobby, various female voices) *Mark Harris (voice of Dan Dynamo, various voices) *Kurt Nagel (voice of AjiBaba, various voices) *Arnie Warren (voice of Warlock, various voices) *Frank Schuller (voice Of Krag, various voices) *Sandy Warshaw (voice of Diana Worthy, various female voices) *Jeff Gillen (voice of Pop Worthy, various voices) *Other voices performed by: Reuben Guberman, Lawrence Tobin, Jerry Berke ==Episode list== *1.

The series was well known in Australia. It last appeared on Australian television in 1974 on The Super Flying Fun Show, a weekday breakfast television series. In Brazil, Prince Planet aired between 1970 and 1975. The characters were known by the following names: *Diana Worthy - \\"Estrellita\\" *Dan Dynamo - \\"Bruno Retti\\" or \\"Strong\\" *Warlock - \\"Capirote\\" *Krag - \\"Kilitrone\\" ==Reception== Two factors contributed to the hasty demise of Prince Planet as a desirable property for domestic broadcast, one being the fact that monochrome programing was becoming less desirable to television stations with the ever-growing popularity of color television. The other was negative parental reaction to cartoons that contained what was perceived as excessive violence for children's television. Whilst he was fighting for right, Prince Planet's opponents were often killed when they faced off against him, and this was obvious even despite editing of the dubbed prints to remove violent scenes. Prince Planet kills Warlock and Krag in the last two episodes before returning home to Radion, and they were not the only villains he blasted away with his pendant. In addition to human violence, the Prince was not overly sensitive to Earth fauna either. For instance, in one episode, he transformed a whale into transportation for his friends, effectively killing the whale. Even so, Prince Planet is known to have been televised in the U.S.A until around 1976 in the Chicago area (WSNS-TV Channel 44) on stations hungry for afternoon TV for children to watch after school, and the program claimed many faithful adherents throughout the sixties and those later years. It was also televised on WUTV channel 29 Buffalo, New York, in the summer of 1975. ==Home video== TGG Direct released 47 episodes of the series on Region 1 DVD's (a 5-disc boxed set) on 15 July 2014.https://www.amazon.com/Prince-Planet-Yusei-Shonen- Papi/dp/B00JDB4ZWG/ It appears to be now out of print. ==ReferencesCategory:1965 anime television series Category:Eiken (studio) Category:Fuji TV original programming Category:Science fiction anime and manga Category:Television series by MGM Television ","title":"Prince Planet"},{"id":"1279157","text":"Bełz Voivodeship (, ) was a unit of administrative division and local government in Poland from 1462 to the Partitions of Poland in 1772–1795. Together with the Ruthenian Voivodeship it was part of Red Ruthenia, Lesser Poland Province of the Polish Crown. The voivodeship was created by King Kazimierz Jagiellonczyk, and had four senators in the Senate of the Commonwealth (the Voivode and the Castellan of Belz, as well as Castellans of Lubaczow and Busk). ==History== Bełz Voivodeship was formed in 1462 from the territories of the Duchy of Belz, after the Duchy was annexed by the Crown of the Kingdom of Poland. Zygmunt Gloger in his monumental book Historical Geography of the Lands of Old Poland gives a detailed description of the voivodeship: “Belz, on the Zaloka river, was one of the oldest gords of the Czerwien Land. In 981, the province was seized by Vladimir the Great. Recovered by Boleslaw Chrobry in 1018, it again became part of Rus’ after Chrobry’s death (...) In the early 14th century, the Land of Belz was inherited by Boleslaw Jerzy II of Mazovia, who in 1331 married Eufemia, the daughter of Grand Duke of Lithuania Gediminas and sister of Aldona of Lithuania, wife of Casimir III the Great. Boleslaw Jerzy died on April 7, 1340, and after his death, King Casimir seized Red Ruthenia together with Land of Belz (...) In 1387, King Wladyslaw Jagiello allowed his sister Alexandra of Lithuania to marry Siemowit IV, Duke of Masovia, giving her as dowry the Land of Belz. The province remained in the hands of sons and grandsons of Siemowit IV. The grandsons died childless in early 1462, and the Land of Belz became property of the Crown of the Kingdom of Poland, during the reign of King Kazimierz Jagiellonczyk. The newly created Belz Voivodeship was slightly smaller than Lublin Voivodeship at approximately the same size as the Land of Chelm. It was made of three counties: Lubaczow, Horodlo and Szewlock, and in 1767, it was divided into the counties of Belz, Grabowiec, Horodlo, Lubaczow, and the Land of Busk. At local sejmiks in Belz, five deputies to the Sejm were elected, and the voivodeship had four starostas: Belz, Busk, Grabowiec and Horodlo (...) In the 17th century, the voivodeship, which was the smaller of all Lesser Poland voivodeships, had 483 villages and 33 towns (...) After the first partition of Poland (1772), almost whole voivodeship was annexed by the Habsburg Empire, as part of Galicia. What remained in Poland were towns of Dubienka and Korytnica, together with some villages (...) In 1793 the voivodeship ceased to exist, as after the second partition of Poland, its remaining parts were annexed by the newly created Chelm Voivodeship and Volodymyr-Volynskyi Voivodeship\\". The area received an influx of szlachta from Mazovia, Lesser Poland and Greater Poland. In 1570–1580, 79% of the local noble families (among those of known provenance) was of Polish origin, while the percentage of Ruthenian and Wallachian noble families amounted to 15% and 4% respectively. Peasant strata of the population remained the least affected by migrations from the west. ==Municipal government== Voivodeship Governor (Wojewoda) seat: * Belz Regional council (sejmik generalny) for all Ruthenian lands: * Sudova Vyshnia Regional council (sejmik) seats: * Belz ==Administrative division== * Belz County, (Powiat Bełzski), Belz * Grabowiec County, (Powiat Grabowiecki), Grabowiec * Horodło County, (Powiat Horodelski), Horodło * Lubaczów County, (Powiat Lubaczowski), Lubaczów * Busk Land, (Ziemia Buska), Busk ==Voivodes== * Rafał Leszczyński (1579-1636) (1619–1636) * Jakub Sobieski (from 1638) * Adam Mikołaj Sieniawski (from 1692 to 1710) * Stanisław Mateusz Rzewuski (from 1726) ==Neighbouring Voivodeships and regions== * Ruthenian Voivodeship * Volhynian Voivodeship * Lublin Voivodeship ==References== ==External links== * Map of Belz Voivodeship Category:Voivodeships of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth Category:Geographic history of Ukraine Category:1462 establishments in Europe Category:15th-century establishments in Poland Category:1793 disestablishments in the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth Category:History of Red Ruthenia Category:Early Modern history of Ukraine ","title":"Belz Voivodeship"},{"id":"1279163","text":"The traditional music of the Federated States of Micronesia varies widely across the four states, and has, in recent times, evolved into popular music influenced by Europop, country music and reggae. ==Traditional dances== Traditional dances on the main islands includes \\"stick dancing\\" on Pohnpei, Chuuk and Yap, standing dances on Chuuk and sitting dances on Yap and Chuuk. The Yapese are particularly known for their skills in dancing. The Yapese stick dance is performed by men, women and children together, while standing dances are performed either by women or men and boys, but never both together. The men participate in various dancing competitions, which are segregated by caste; the lower castes have some distinct dances, such as a woman's standing dance, but can only dance when authorized by a person of a higher caste. Chuuk shares many of the similar dance styles with Yap because of similar cultural heritage with Chuuk and the outer islands of Yap. Chuuk's most mysterious and rarest dance is called the \\"Moonlight Dance\\", one of the few dances in which both men and women dance together. It can only happen during a full moon with permission of the village chief.

The name of the band is often said to be an abbreviation of the sentence \\"Paulan ja Miran Molemmat Puolet\\", which can be translated in English as \\"Both Sides of Paula and Mira\\". However, in an interview on the Finnish talk show Krisse Show, they stated that the name of the band comes, like ABBA, from the names of 4 of its members: so PMMP is Paula, Mira, Mira, Paula. PMMP's albums were produced by former Thergothon drummer Jori Sjöroos, who also wrote the music for all the songs. The lyrics are written by Paula and Mira. The band is an acclaimed live act. PMMP first became well known in Finland with the 2003 summer hit Rusketusraidat (\\"Tan Lines\\"). They then enjoyed great success with their second album Kovemmat kädet (\\"Rougher Hands\\"), which sold gold (double platinum year 2010). An extended version of the album was released in August 2005. Oo siellä jossain mun, a single from the aforementioned album, is PMMP's biggest hit so far in Finland. In November 2006 PMMP released their third album Leskiäidin tyttäret (\\"Daughters of a widow mother\\"), which sold platinum on the day it was released. They released an album labeled Puuhevonen (\\"Wooden Horse\\") with traditional children's songs in 2007, around the time their first children were born. In 2009 they released their fourth rock/pop album Veden varaan (\\"Overboard\\") and their fifth album Rakkaudesta (\\"Of Love\\"), released in 2012, is considered as their comeback album. PMMP played their final concert on October 27, 2013 in the sold-out Helsinki Ice Hall. ==\\"Matka jatkuu vaan\\" – The Journey Continues== In an article titled \\"Matka jatkuu vaan\\" in the biggest Finnish newspaper Helsingin Sanomat (17.2.2007), journalist Leena Virtanen attempts to explain how it is that PMMP appeal to both children and adults, concluding that while indeed an energetic pop band PMMP \\"live within the space between childhood and adulthood\\", referring to the lifeworlds of both children and adults, carried through with eternal optimism. Virtanen concludes with the words from one of PMMP's best known songs \\"Matkalaulu\\" (travel song), which is in fact a song about the band being on the road: \\"Tämä voi olla koko elämämme ihanin päivä. Ajetaan hiljempaa. Toivon, että matka jatkuu, jatkuu vaan\\" [This could be the most wonderful day of our whole life. Let's drive slower. I hope the journey goes on, goes on and on...\\"] ==Activism== PMMP has supported Amnesty International's work against the violence towards women. The song Joku raja from the album Leskiäidin tyttäret is named after Amnesty's campaign by the same name. On 25 May 2013 PMMP was supposed to perform together with two members of the Russian punk band Pussy Riot at the Maailma kylässä (World Village) festival in Helsinki.

Cemetery in Sa'dah. Islam in Yemen dates back to about 630AD, when it was introduced into the region by Ali when Muhammad was still alive. It was during this period that the mosques in Janad (near Ta'izz) and the Great Mosque of Sana'a were built. Yemenis are divided into two principal Islamic religious groups: 55% Sunni and 45%Yemen Embassy in Canada Shia. The denominations are as follows: 55% primarily of the Shafi'i and other orders of Sunni Islam. 43% of the Zaidi order of Shia Islam, 2% of the Ja'fari and Taiyabi Ismaili orders of Shia Islam. The Sunnis are predominantly in the south and southeast. The Zaidis are predominantly in the north and northwest whilst the Jafaris are in the main centres of the North such as Sana'a and Ma'rib. There are mixed communities in the larger cities. According to WIN/Gallup International polls, Yemen has the most religious population among Arab countries and it is one of the most religious population world-wide. ==Population== The Zaidis of the northern highlands dominated politics and cultural life in northern Yemen for centuries; with unification, and the addition of the south’s almost totally Shafi'i population, the numerical balance has shifted dramatically away from the Zaidis. Nevertheless, Zaidis are still over represented in the government and, in particular, in the former North Yemeni units within the armed forces. ==Society== Public schools provide instruction in Islam but not in other religions, although Muslim citizens are allowed to attend private schools that do not teach Islam. In an effort to curb ideological and religious extremism in schools, the government does not permit any courses outside the officially approved curriculum to be taught in private and national schools. Because the government is concerned that unlicensed religious schools deviate from formal educational requirements and promote militant ideology, it has closed more than 4,500 of these institutions and deported foreign students studying there.Country profile: Yemen.

Tacoma Power serves the cities of Tacoma, University Place, Fircrest, and Fife, and also provides service to parts of Steilacoom, Lakewood and unincorporated Pierce County. It is a division of the Tacoma Public Utilities and owns the Click! Network, developed by Steven Klein, Tacoma Power's former superintendent. ==History== In 1884, Charles B. Wright was granted the exclusive right to create Tacoma's first power and water company, incorporating the Tacoma Light and Water Company. Wright's system drew water from Tule and Spanaway Lakes and Clover Creek. The water was transported to the city through a 10-mile wooden flume that emptied into an in-town reservoir. The flume was mostly uncovered and attracted thirsty cows and children in search of a good wading pool.Bjork v. Tacoma (1913) 76 Wash. 225, 135 Pac. 1005 This led to the spread of disease. Tacoma City Light was created in 1893 when the citizens of Tacoma voted to buy the privately owned Tacoma Light & Water Company to ensure its safety and longevity. Its first independent power generation came with the construction of LaGrande Dam on the Nisqually River, 36 miles away from the city, producing hydroelectric power as of November, 1912. In 2011, Tacoma Power received the first-ever Award for Excellence in Energy Efficiency from the Bonneville Power Administration (BPA).

She was the first woman from the state to hold this office. At the age of 97, she was the oldest living former U.S. Senator for the last eight months of her life. == Early life and education == Burdick was born in Fargo, North Dakota, the daughter of Magdalena Towers (Carpenter) and Albert Birch. Her great-grandmother was suffragist and abolitionist Matilda Joslyn Gage. Burdick was the great-niece, by marriage, of L. Frank Baum, the author of The Wizard of Oz, who was married to her great- aunt, activist Maud Gage Baum.

Burdick was engaged in civics throughout her marriage to Quentin Burdick. She was part of the official U.S. delegation to Russia in 1978 and she was a trustee to the Lake Agassiz Arts Council. Burdick helped to found the Democratic Women Plus in the early 1980s. She also recorded public service announcements against drunk driving and drug use in 1989. ==U.S. Senate== Upon the death of her husband Senator Quentin N. Burdick in September 1992, Jocelyn Burdick was appointed by Governor George Sinner to fill the vacancy in his position until a special election was held. She did not run as a candidate for election to the rest of the term. During her brief tenure in office, Burdick supported legislation on pay equity and women's rights. After Kent Conrad took office in December 1992, Burdick retired to Fargo. Burdick was the first woman from North Dakota to serve in either house of the U.S. Congress. She lived in Fargo, where she remained active in politics. She was the oldest living former U.S. Senator on April 6, 2019, following the death of Fritz Hollings. ==Personal life== Burdick was a devout Christian Scientist.

It originally aired on March 2, 1962 on CBS. Based on Damon Knight's 1950 short story of the same title, the episode was written by Rod Serling and directed by Richard L. Bare. It remains one of the best known episodes from the series, particularly for its final twist. ==Opening narration== ==Plot== The episode begins with Michael Chambers locked alone in a spartan room with a cot. A voice offers him a meal, delivered through a small aperture in the wall, which he grimly refuses. The setting changes to several months earlier, on Earth. The Kanamits, a race of aliens, land on Earth as the planet is beset by international crises. As the Secretary-General announces the landing of aliens on Earth to the worldwide public at a United Nations news conference, one of the aliens arrives and addresses the assembled delegates and journalists via telepathy. He announces that his race's motive in coming to Earth is to provide humanitarian aid by sharing their advanced technology, including an atomic generator that can provide electric power for a few dollars, a nitrate fertilizer that can end famine, and a force field that can be deployed to prevent international warfare. After answering questions, the Kanamit departs without comment and leaves a book in the Kanamit language, which leads to Michael Chambers, a US government cryptographer, being pressed into service. Initially wary of an alien race who came \\"quite uninvited\\", international leaders begin to be persuaded of the Kanamits' benevolence when their advanced technology puts an end to hunger, energy shortages, and the arms race. Trust in the Kanamits seems to be justified when Patty, a member of the cryptography staff led by Chambers, decodes the title of the Kanamit book: To Serve Man. The Kanamits submit to interrogation and polygraph, at the request of the UN delegates. When declaring their benevolent intentions, the polygraph indicates that the Kanamit is speaking the truth. Soon, humans are volunteering for trips to the Kanamits' home planet, which they describe as a paradise. Kanamits now have embassies in every major city on Earth. With the U.S. Armed Forces having been disbanded and world peace having been achieved, the code-breaking staff has no real work to do, but Patty is still trying to work out the meaning of the text of To Serve Man. The day arrives for Chambers's excursion to the Kanamits' planet. Just as he mounts the spaceship's boarding stairs, Patty runs toward him in great agitation. While being held back by a Kanamit guard, Patty cries: \\"Mr. Chambers, don't get on that ship! The rest of the book To Serve Man, it's... it's a cookbook!\\" Chambers tries to run back down the stairs, but a Kanamit blocks him, the stairs retract, and the ship lifts off. Chambers is in the shipboard room now, and is again offered a meal. He throws it to the floor, but a Kanamit retrieves it and encourages him to eat, to keep Chambers from \\"losing weight\\". At last Chambers, in one of the few instances of the series where a character breaks the fourth wall, says to the audience: \\"How about you? You still on Earth, or on the ship with me? Really doesn't make very much difference, because sooner or later, all of us will be on the menu... all of us.\\" The episode closes as Chambers gives in and breaks his hunger strike. ==Closing narration== ==Cast== *Lloyd Bochner as Michael Chambers *Richard Kiel as the Kanamits (all of whom appear alike) *Susan Cummings as Patty *Joseph Ruskin as Kanamit voice *Hardie Albright as Secretary General *Theo Marcuse as Citizen Gregori (credited as Theodore Marcuse) *Bartlett Robinson as Colonel #1 *Carleton Young as Colonel #2 (credited as Carlton Young) *Nelson Olmsted as Scientist *Robert Tafur as Señor Valdes *Lomax Study as Leveque *Jerry Fujikawa as Japanese Delegate (credited as J.H. Fujikawa) ==Production== The arriving Kanamit ship is shown as scenes extracted from The Day the Earth Stood Still, but with different sound; the departing Kanamit ship is shown as a scene extracted from Earth vs. the Flying Saucers, also with different sound. ==Critical response== Marc Scott Zicree, writing in The Twilight Zone Companion, has criticized a cardinal plot point in \\"To Serve Man\\": \\"In the show ... a staff of cryptographers led by [Michael Chambers] Lloyd Bochner attempts to decipher the alien language as though it were some secret code, which is utterly ludicrous. Without some sort of interplanetary Rosetta stone, deciphering an unknown language would be impossible.\\" Zicree also points out that the chances of the word \\"serve\\" having the same dual meaning in both English and another language, especially an alien one, are almost nil. In 1997 TV Guide ranked the episode at No. 11 on its \\"100 Greatest Episodes of All Time\\" list and in 2013 ranked the ending as the \\"Greatest Twist of All Time.\\" In 2009, Time listed the episode among the \\"Top 10 Twilight Zone Episodes.\\" ==Cultural influence== The episode is occasionally referenced in popular culture, usually with the line \\"It's a cookbook!\\" or some variation thereof. References or parodies can be found in television series as Futurama and The Simpsons, movies such as The Naked Gun 2½: The Smell of Fear and Madagascar (the former featuring Lloyd Bochner, who played Michael Chambers in the episode); the comic strip Mark Trail; and musical works by artists Nuclear Assault, Cattle Decapitation, and El-P. A reference to the episode has even found its way into an unofficial emblem for a United States Air Force unit. ==Sequel== The 2019 Twilight Zone episode \\"You Might Also Like\\" serves as a sequel to the episode \\"To Serve Man\\" which features the Kanamits who are still learning about Earth's culture.https://tv.avclub.com/the-twilight-zone-s-stylish-to-serve-man-sequel- cauti-1844185643 ==References== ==Sources== * * * ==External links== * * * Category:1962 American television episodes Category:The Twilight Zone (1959 TV series season 3) episodes Category:Television episodes about alien visitations Category:Television episodes written by Rod Serling Category:Television shows based on short fiction ","title":"To Serve Man (The Twilight Zone)"},{"id":"1279231","text":"Step bells are a type of inclined metallophone, usually arranged in a C major scale, commonly used in music education.

Snyder bought the team, then known as the Redskins, from Jack Kent Cooke's estate in 1999. He was also the founder of Snyder Communications. ==Early life and education== Snyder was born on November 23, 1964Washington Jewish Week: \\"Five local Jews make Forbes richest list\\" October 7, 2009 in Maryland,Washingtonian: \\"The Dan Snyder You Don't Know – To disgruntled fans, the Redskins owner Is a spoiled rich kid who treats the team like a toy—and a money machine.

Jones October 13, 2013Jewish Virtual Library: \\"Daniel Snyder\\" retrieved October 24, 2013 His father was a freelance writer who wrote for United Press International and National Geographic. He attended Hillandale Elementary School in Silver Spring, Maryland. At age 12, he moved to Henley- on-Thames, a small town near London, where he attended private school. At age 14, he returned to the United States and lived with his grandmother in Queens, New York. A year later, his family moved back to Maryland and he graduated from Charles W. Woodward High School in Rockville, Maryland. His first job was at B. Dalton bookstore in the White Flint Mall. At 17, Snyder experienced his first business failure when he partnered with his father to sell bus-trip packages to Washington Capitals fans to see their hockey team play in Philadelphia. By age 20, he had dropped out of the University of Maryland, College ParkDan Patrick:Outtakes with Daniel Snyder and was running his own business, leasing jets to fly college students to spring break in Fort Lauderdale and the Caribbean. Snyder claims to have cleared US$1 million running the business out of his parents' bedroom with a friend and several telephone lines. Snyder courted real estate entrepreneur Mortimer Zuckerman, whose US News & World Report was also interested in the college market and who agreed to finance his push to publish Campus USA, a magazine for college students. Zuckerman and Fred Drasner, co-publisher of Zuckerman's New York Daily News, invested $3 million in Campus USA. The venture did not generate enough paid advertising and was forced to close after two years. ==Career== In 1989, Snyder and his sister Michele founded a wallboard advertising (the sale of advertisements placed on boards inside buildings) company with seed money from his father, who took a second mortgage on his property in England, and his sister, who maxed out her credit cards at $35,000. They concentrated on wallboards in doctors' offices (where there was a captive audience) and colleges. They married the advertisement with the distribution of product samples – such as soaps and packages of medicine – to differentiate themselves from their competitors. The company was named Snyder Communications LP. The business was a great success and Snyder and his sister grew the business organically and through acquisitions and expanded its activities to all aspects of outsourced marketing, including direct marketing, database marketing, proprietary product sampling, sponsored information display in prime locations, call centers, and field sales. They expanded their geography from colleges and doctors' offices to hospital maternity areas, private daycare centers, and Fixed Based Operations (FBO), or private aircraft lounges in major airports throughout the country. In 1992, the company expanded into telemarketing with a focus on the yet untapped immigrant market. Snyder Communications revenues rose from $2.7 million in 1991 to $4.1 million in 1992 and $9 million in 1993. Proprietary product sampling was introduced in 1992 through their network of private daycare centers. In an initial public offering for SNC in September 1996, Daniel Snyder became the youngest ever CEO of a New York Stock Exchange listed company at the age of 32. Snyder's top investors, including media mogul Barry Diller, New York investor Dan Lufkin, and Democratic Party icon Robert Strauss, earned significant returns on their initial investment. Mortimer Zuckerman and Fred Drasner, whom Snyder owed $3 million from the failure of his first business venture, were given company stock, which ended up being worth over $500 million. His parents sold their stock in the company for over $60 million. He continued to expand the company aggressively through a string of acquisitions, including Arnold Communications in 1997. By 1998, the company had over 12,000 employees and $1 billion in annual revenues. In April 2000, Snyder Communications was sold to the French advertising and marketing services group Havas in an all-stock transaction valued at in excess of US$2 billion, the largest transaction in the history of the advertising/market industry. Snyder's personal share of the proceeds was estimated to be US$300 million. ==Washington Football Team ownership== In May 1999, Snyder purchased the Washington Football Team, then known as the Redskins, along with Jack Kent Cooke Stadium (now FedExField) for $800 million following the death of previous owner Jack Kent Cooke. At the time, it was the most expensive transaction in sporting history. The deal was financed largely through borrowed money, including $340 million borrowed from Société Générale and $155 million debt assumed on the stadium. Annual loan servicing costs are an estimated $50 million. To pay down the team's debt, in 2003, he sold 15% of the team to real estate developer Dwight Schar for $200 million, 15% to Florida financier Robert Rothman for a like amount; and 5% to Frederick W. Smith, the founder of FedEx, leaving him with a 65% ownership interest. Since Snyder became owner, the team's annual revenue increased from more than $100 million a year when Snyder took over the team in 1999 to around $245 million by 2005. By the late 2010s, Snyder began serving on six National Football League committees, including appointments to the Broadcast Committee, the Business Ventures Committee, the Digital Media Committee (for which he serves as Co-Chair), the International Committee, the Stadium Committee and the Hall of Fame Committee (which oversees the Pro Football Hall of Fame in Canton, Ohio). Separately, he is also a member of the Board of Trustees of the Pro Football Hall of Fame. ==Criticism== Since Snyder bought the Washington Football Team, the team has had a losing record (142–193–1 through the end of the 2019 season). They have also gone through eight head coaches in 17 seasons. In October 2009, several articles in Washington area newspapers criticized Snyder, alleging that his managerial style was partly to blame for the Redskins' on-field struggles. A November 24, 2009, article in the Wall Street Journal also questioned whether Snyder's leadership style had alienated the Redskins fan base. The article quotes from a Harris Interactive poll showing that whereas the Redskins in 2003 were the 6th most popular NFL team nationally, by 2009 they had fallen to No. 17, but in 2014 had climbed to No. 10. Under Snyder, the team sued season ticket holders who were unable to pay during the 2008–2009 U.S. recession. Snyder did this despite his claim that there are over 200,000 people on the season ticket waiting list. Partway through the 2009 season, Snyder banned all signs from FedExField, leading to further fan discontentment. The ban was lifted shortly thereafter.Redskins reverse ban on fans bringing signs to FedExField. nfl.com. July 26, 2012 Writing in Forbes magazine, Monte Burke states that distaste for Snyder has made the team name controversy worse than it needed to be, but there are others who defend his position.Defending Dan Snyder. cbslocal.com. October 11, 2013 Redskins fans have also expressed discontentment about rising ticket and parking prices, and Snyder's policy of charging fans for tailgates in special areas of the stadium lot. The Redskins did not raise ticket prices from 2006 through 2012.Redskins raise ticket prices. foxsports.com. June 2, 2014 Fans have also complained about the game-day experience. While problems such as traffic and parking were inherited when Snyder bought the team, fans have expressed displeasure with Snyder-led initiatives that they feel distract from the enjoyment of attendance. In 2020, The Washington Post published a series of articles alleging that over 40 women who were former employees of the organization, including office workers and cheerleaders, had been sexually harassed and discriminated against by Snyder and other male executives, colleagues, and players of the team since at least 2006. ===Redskins name controversy=== Since his purchase of the Redskins in 1999, Snyder has been repeatedly pressured to change the team's name by numerous fans, politicians, and advocacy groups because redskin is a derogatory term for Native Americans. In May 2013, in response to a question regarding the teams' Federal Trademark, Snyder told USA Today \\"We'll never change the name. It's that simple. NEVER—you can use caps.\\"Brady, Erik (May 9, 2013) \\"Daniel Snyder says Redskins will never change name\\". USA Today Following his refusal to meet with Native American advocates for name change, Snyder was framed as an enemy of their cause. A pitched public relations battle in 2013 and 2014 led Snyder to employ crisis management and PR firms in an effort to defend the name. Snyder's creation of the Washington Redskins Original Americans Foundation in 2014 was seen as a \\"cheap effort to buy favor from Indian communities\\". Following renewed attention to questions of racial justice in wake of the George Floyd protests in 2020, a letter signed by 87 shareholders and investors was sent to team and league sponsors Nike, FedEx, and PepsiCo urging them to cut their ties unless the name was changed. Around the same time, several retail companies had begun removing Redskins merchandise from their stores. In response, the team underwent a review in July 2020 and announced they would be retiring the name, with a new name and logo to be chosen at a later date. As a team rebranding process usually takes over a year, the team will be temporarily playing as the Washington Football Team for the 2020 season. ===Defamation suit=== Threatening a lawsuit in January 2011, Snyder demanded dismissal of Washington City Papers sports writer Dave McKenna, who had penned a lengthy article for the alternative newspaper called \\"The Cranky Redskins Fan's Guide to Dan Snyder\\", creating a critical list of controversies involving Snyder. McKenna had been needling Snyder for years in his columns, and the front-page of the article had a defaced picture of Snyder with Devil's Horns and a scraggly beard, which incensed Snyder who felt the picture was antisemitic.https://www.nytimes.com/2011/02/07/business/media/07carr.html?pagewanted=all&_r=0 Other sportswriters have come out in support of McKenna.Petchesky, Barry (February 3, 2011) Dan Snyder Cries Antisemitism In Letter That Manages To Be Racist, Deadspin In a statement released by the Simon Wiesenthal Center, while acknowledging that public figures are fair game for criticism, said the artwork used by the City Paper was reminiscent of \\"virulent anti-Semitism going back to the Middle Ages\\" and urged the City Paper issue an apology. Mike Madden of the City Paper issued a statement saying they take accusations of antisemitism very seriously and said the artwork was meant to \\"resemble the type of scribbling that teenagers everywhere have been using to deface photos\\" and the cover art was not an antisemitic caricature.http://www.washingtoncitypaper.com/blogs/citydesk/2011/02/02/on- the-matter-of-dan-snyders-horns/ In February 2011, Snyder filed a lawsuit against the City Paper before dropping it in September 2011.Madden, Mike (September 10, 2011). \\"Dan Snyder Drops Lawsuit Against Washington City Paper, Dave McKenna.\\" washingtoncitypaper.com. ===Environmental=== In 2004, Snyder brokered a deal with the National Park Service to remove old growth trees from the of national parkland behind his home to grant him a better view of the Potomac River, on the condition that Snyder would replace the trees with 600 native saplings. Lenn Harley, a real estate broker who was not involved in Snyder's purchase of the estate but was familiar with the area, estimated that the relatively unobstructed view of the river and its surroundings that resulted from Snyder's clearing could add $500,000 to $1 million to his $10 million home's value. The clearcutting was started without approval from Montgomery County, Maryland, and without environmental assessments, as required by law. As a result, Snyder was fined $100 by the Maryland-National Capital Park and Planning Commission in December 2004. Snyder's neighbors also filed complaints regarding his clearcutting of scenic and historic easements behind his home. The NPS ranger that investigated the complaints of Snyder's neighbors and clearcutting along the Potomac was transferred multiple times due to his continued pursuit of the complaints and the Snyder property. Eventually, the NPS ranger filed a whistleblower complaint regarding the Snyder case. Later, the ranger's anonymity as a whistleblower was lost, potentially leading to extreme harassment and a trial of the park ranger, ultimately ending the ranger's career. Snyder has still not replanted the trees and has faced no other consequences aside from his fine. ==Other ventures== Snyder owned expansion rights to an Arena Football League team for the Washington, D.C. market before the 2009 demise of the original league. He purchased the rights to the team for $4 million in 1999. The team was going to be called the Washington Warriors and play their games at the Comcast Center in 2003 but the team never started. In 2005, he bought 12% of the stock of amusement park operator Six Flags through his private equity company RedZone Capital. He later gained control of the board placing his friend and ESPN executive Mark Shapiro as CEO and himself as chairman. In April 2009, the New York Stock Exchange delisted Six Flags' stock as it had fallen below the minimal required market capitalization.Atlanta Business Journal: \\"Six Flags delisted\\". bizjournals.com. April 9, 2009 In June 2009, Six Flags announced that they were delaying a $15 million debt payment and two weeks later, Six Flags filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection.J. de la Merced, Michael (June 13, 2009) \\"Six Flags Files for Bankruptcy\\".

The same month, Snyder and other investors signed a deal to provide financing to the production company run by Tom Cruise and his partner, Paula Wagner. This came one week after Paramount Pictures severed its ties with Cruise and Wagner. Snyder is credited as an executive producer for the 2008 movie Valkyrie, which stars Cruise.\\"Daniel M.

She was an aunt to novelist Truman Capote (his mother, Lillie Mae Faulk, was her elder sister). Rudisill helped to raise Capote, who lived with her at times during his childhood, both in Alabama and New York City. ==Biography== Rudisill was born Edna Marie Faulk in Monroeville, Alabama. Her first marriage, to a Japanese man in the 1930s, ended in divorce due to her family's disapproval. She later wrote, \\"I really loved that man. He was so talented and such a sweet wonderful person. And I would have been happier with him than I was with the man I married after that.\\"Marie Rudisell, Ask the Fruitcake Lady, Hyperion, 2006, p. 34. . She married James Rudisill in 1939. She wrote, \\"A man who drinks excessively, it's not a happy marriage. We loved each other, but we had our times.\\" The couple had one son, James, and Rudisill had three grandchildren. Rudisill authored eight books, including Fruitcake: Memories of Truman Capote & Sook. She was a resident of Florida. == The Tonight Show == Rudisill's book Fruitcake (published by Hill Street Press) led to her being invited to be a guest on The Tonight Show on December 14, 2000. During her first visit she showed Jay Leno and Mel Gibson how to make fruitcakes. This led to her being named the Fruitcake Lady and to several more appearances on The Tonight Show, in which she instructed host Jay Leno and other guests in the preparation of various baked desserts. In 2002, the \\"Ask the Fruitcake Lady\\" segments became a regular part of The Tonight Show. In these segments, viewers posed prerecorded questions to Rudisill (including questions of a graphic sexual nature), and her frank and often unpredictable responses were shown. She often lost patience with what she perceived as stupidity on the part of some questioners, and lapsed into profanity. == Death == Marie Rudisill died in Hudson, Florida, on November 3, 2006, at the age of 95, just before the publication date of her last book, Ask the Fruitcake Lady: Everything You Would Already Know If You Had Any Sense, on November 7. The November 8 broadcast of the Tonight Show included a tribute composed of highlights from her segments on the show, including one in which she cooked with (and was hugged and kissed on the cheek by) Tom Cruise.

A distinguished soldier known for his personal bravery, he became famous as \\"The Black Rider\\" during the Greco-Turkish War of 1919–1922, where he commanded the 5/42 Evzone Regiment. After the Greek defeat in the war, along with other Venizelist officers he launched the 11 September 1922 Revolution that deposed King Constantine I of Greece and his government. The military-led government ruled until January 1924, when power was handed over to an elected National Assembly, which later declared the Second Hellenic Republic. In the interwar period, Plastiras remained a devoted Venizelist and republican. Trying to avert the rise of the royalist People's Party and the restoration of the monarchy, he led two coup attempts in 1933 and 1935, both of which failed, forcing him to exile in France. During the Axis Occupation of Greece in the Second World War he was the nominal leader of the EDES resistance group, although he remained in exile in Marseilles. After the occupation, he returned to Greece and served as a centrist Prime Minister three times, often in coalition with the Liberal Party. In his last two governments, he tried to heal the rift caused in Greek society by the Greek Civil War, but was unsuccessful. == Early life == He was born in 1883, in Karditsa, Greece. Plastiras' parents were originally from Morfovouni (formerly Vounesi), a village in the Agrafa mountains of southwestern Thessaly. The municipality was renamed for General Plastiras and Morfovouni is the present capital of Plastiras Municipality. The family moved to Karditsa before Plastiras was born. == Military career == A statue in Karditsa After finishing school in Karditsa, he joined the 5th Infantry Regiment as a volunteer in 1904. He fought in the Macedonian Struggle, and participated in the military coup of 1909. He entered the NCO School in 1910 and, after being assigned to the rank 2nd lieutenant in 1912, he fought with distinction in the Balkan Wars, where he earned his nickname \\"The Black Rider\\". He first rose to wider prominence when, as a major, he supported the Movement of National Defence of Eleftherios Venizelos during the First World War. He fought with distinction with the Archipelago Division at the battle of Skra-di-Legen and was promoted to lieutenant colonel. In 1919, Colonel Plastiras commanded the 5/42 Evzone Regiment in the Ukraine, as part of an Allied force aiding the White Army in their ultimately unsuccessful fight against the Red Army. His force was then transferred to Smyrna in Asia Minor via Romania. After the change in power in Greece (November 1920) and the return of king Constantine, he was the only officer, who had participated in the National Defence movement, who was not dismissed from the army. The men of his Regiment warned that they wouldn't fight under another commander. During the Greco-Turkish War of 1919-1922, the Turks called Plastiras Kara Biber (\\"The Black Pepper\\"), while the 5/42 Regiment of Evzones became known as the Şeytanın Askerleri (\\"Satan's Army\\"). Soon after, at the battle of Sakarya, the Greeks were forced to begin their retreat. After the Turkish breakthrough in August 1922, his unit have been ordered to counterattack at Kamelar mountain to regain Greek's positions, he didn't tried on 13 August, next day actually did tried and failed. For these failure he was accused to be responsible for 4th Greek Infantry Division destruction, supposed to get accusations on a court marschall.Greek Army General Stuff, History Directorate, The Minor Asia Campaign, author Aristidis Skylitsis, Colonel of the Artillery 7th volume, page 107 His unit, 5/42 Evzones Regiment, was among others withdrawing orderly to the coast, fighting off superior Turkish forces and suffering heavy losses. The remnants of the Greek Army made their way to the islands of the Eastern Aegean. ===September 1922 Revolution=== The Army's resentment at the political leadership in Athens resulted in the outbreak of the 11 September 1922 Revolution, led by Plastiras, Colonel Stylianos Gonatas and Commander Phokas. In Athens after the 1922 revolution Having the support of the Army and much of the people, the revolutionary officers quickly entered Athens and assumed control of the country. He is reported by Penelope Delta, witness of the events, to have said to the crowd: \\"Why do you cheer? We lost, we came destroyed\\". Plastiras forced King Constantine to resign, called upon the exiled Venizelos to lead the negotiations with Turkey which culminated in the Treaty of Lausanne, and set about to reorganize the Army of Thrace against any Turkish advance (eastern Thrace was still in Greek hands). One of the most controversial acts of the revolutionary government was the trial and execution of five royalist politicians, including former PM Dimitrios Gounaris, such as the former Commander-in-Chief, General Georgios Hatzianestis, on November 28, 1922 as those mainly responsible for the Asia Minor Disaster, in the infamous \\"Trial of the Six\\". Plastiras faced multiple challenges in governing Greece. The 1.3 million refugees from the population exchange had to be catered for in a country with a ruined economy, internationally isolated and internally divided. The Corfu incident, and a botched Royalist coup in October 1923 were evidence of this. After the failed royalist coup, King George II was forced to leave the country. Nonetheless, he managed to restore some order to the state and to lay the groundwork for the Second Hellenic Republic. After the elections of December 1923 for the new National Assembly, he resigned from the army on January 2, 1924, retiring to private life. In recognition of his services to the country, the National Assembly declared him \\"worthy of the fatherland\\" and conferred to him the rank of lieutenant general in retirement. Plastiras was even admired by his greatest enemy, Mustafa Kemal (Atatürk). At the end of the war, during the negotiations that took place regarding the exchange of populations between Greece and the newly formed Republic of Turkey, Atatürk is quoted telling Plastiras, \\"I gave gold and you gave me copper.\\"Boinodiris, Stavros. \\"Google Books\\" Andros Odyssey: Liberation: (1900–1940). iUniverse, 2010, p. 146. == Political career == Plastiras c. 1924 The Republic that he had helped found proved an unstable one. Coups, counter- coups, the conflict between Venizelists/Republicans and Royalists, and constant economic problems plagued Greece. Plastiras, persecuted during the Pangalos dictatorship, attempted to lead a coup in March 1933, after the anti- Venizelists won the elections, but facing universal reaction (even from Venizelos himself), he was forced to flee abroad. Finally, after the failed Venizelist revolt of 1935, although still abroad, he was condemned in absentia to death. Nonetheless he maintained a high prestige as a war hero and because of his integrity and staunch Republicanism. Always an antimonarchist and flirting with the fascist ideal during his French exile, he watched the Germans overrun Greece. Later he played a role in the creation of the EDES resistance group, whose titular leadership he had despite his will, after discussions with Komninos Pyromaglou. He returned to Greece in 1945, after his selection as prime minister following the December events of 1944, primarily because he was a commonly accepted personality. Plastiras attempted to tread a middle path between the British, who were supporting the returned government- in-exile and the return of King George II, and the democratic-leftist guerilla of the EAM/ELAS. During his premiership, the Varkiza Agreement was signed. His moderate policies and republican sympathies earned the distrust of the British, and he was dismissed after only three months in office, when the Press published a letter of him during the war, proposing the German intervention to stop the Greco-Italian war. Nikolaos Plastiras with Georgios Papandreou and Gendarmerie officers, 1950 In 1949, after the end of the Greek Civil War, Plastiras founded a new party, the National Progressive Centre Union (Εθνική Προοδευτική Ένωση Κέντρου, EPEK), forming a following of disappointed Liberals and left-leaning democrats. He preached a message of national reconciliation, which put him in conflict with the conservative establishment which sought to punish those who had fought to establish a communist government. Together with Sofoklis Venizelos and George Papandreou, Plastiras formed a coalition government in 1950, which fell, however, when his partners retired. In the September 1951 elections, EPEK emerged as the strongest of the centrist parties. Plastiras formed a coalition government with Sofoklis Venizelos' Liberals, and attempted to address the great problems of the country. His government initiated the economic recovery and the reconstruction of Greece. A monument to this is the construction of the dam at the Tavropos (Megdovas) River to form a lake, a program that he initiated. The lake and dam, both formerly named Tavropos, now bear his name. His policy of conciliation, however, was bitterly assailed from the right, distrusted from the left, and undermined even by members of his own cabinet. A defining moment of his government was the conviction and execution of Nikos Belogiannis in March 1952 despite international protest. After losing the elections of November 1952, his political career, and with it the liberal 'Centrist Intermission', came to an end. He died in poverty in 1953 in Athens. == References == == External links == * Category:1883 births Category:1953 deaths Category:People from Karditsa Category:National Progressive Centre Union politicians Category:Prime Ministers of Greece Category:Greek MPs 1950–1951 Category:Greek MPs 1951–1952 Category:Hellenic Army generals Category:Greek revolutionaries Category:Republicanism in Greece Category:Greek military personnel of the Balkan Wars Category:Greek military personnel of World War I Category:Greek military personnel of the Russian Civil War Category:People of the Russian Civil War Category:Greek military personnel of the Greco-Turkish War (1919–1922) Category:Greek exiles Category:People sentenced to death in absentia Category:1950s in Greek politics Category:20th- century Greek people ","title":"Nikolaos Plastiras"},{"id":"1279280","text":"Meltek Sato Kilman Livtuvanu (born 30 December 1957) is a Vanuatuan politician. He had been Prime Minister of Vanuatu from June 2015 to February 2016. Kilman was previously Prime Minister from December 2010 to April 2011 and from May to June 2011, though his premiership was subsequently annulled by a court of law. He was elected Prime Minister again on 26 June 2011, thus beginning his first legally recognised term in the premiership; he served until 23 March 2013. He is also the current Leader of the People's Progress Party. He is an MP from Lakatoro on Malekula Island. ==Career== Kilman and Ham Lini led the opposition to the Serge Vohor government when it took office in July 2004. Soon, however, Lini joined a coalition government with Vohor. Kilman then became known as the leader of the opposition, and became a particularly strong critic of Vohor's attempts to establish relations with Taiwan. In December 2004, Kilman filed the no confidence motion which deposed Vohor and made Lini prime minister. In the new cabinet established on 13 December 2004, Kilman was rewarded by becoming Lini's deputy, as well as taking the position of foreign minister. Kilman was dismissed from the government in a cabinet reshuffle in late July 2007. According to the government, this was due to alleged fraud, involving money stolen from the government, in which Kilman's political secretary was said to be involved.\\"Vanuatu ministers fall over fraud allegation\\", ABC Radio Australia, 31 July 2007. Following the 2008 general election, the People's Progress Party was in Opposition, as part of the Alliance bloc. In March 2009, Kilman was named leader of the Opposition, because the Alliance bloc had the largest number of seats of any Opposition party or alliance. In November 2009, however, during a major Cabinet reshuffle, Kilman was brought into Natapei's government as deputy Prime Minister. On 2 December 2010 Kilman was appointed Prime Minister after Edward Natapei was ousted in a vote of no confidence. Kilman was himself narrowly ousted in a vote of no confidence on 24 April 2011 (Easter Sunday), by twenty-six votes to twenty-five; Serge Vohor succeeded him.\\"Vohor takes Vanuatu's top job but instability expected to continue\\", ABC Radio Australia, 25 April 2011 Vohor's election was declared invalid on 13 May 2011, as he only had a relative majority, and not an absolute one. On 16 June, however, Chief Justice Vincent Lunabek ruled in a separate case put forward by Edward Natapei, contesting the constitutionality of Kilman's initial election in December 2010. Lunabek ruled that Kilman's election to office had indeed been unconstitutional, as \\"[t]he speaker of Parliament Maxime Carlot Korman [had] appointed Mr Kilman prime minister without following article 41 of the constitution which required he be elected by secret ballot\\". Kilman's premiership was annulled, and Natapei was restored as interim Prime Minister, instructed to convene Parliament for the election of a new Prime Minister.\\"Supreme Declared Natapei, Acting Prime Minister \\", Government of Vanuatu, 16 June 2011 Ironically, as Natapei's ministers were restored as interim ministers, Kilman reverted to being Natapei's interim deputy prime minister - a position he was expected to hold only for a few days.\\"Natapei interim PM in Vanuatu government change\\", Radio Australia, 16 June 2011 On 26 June, Kilman stood for the premiership, and was elected by Parliament, with 29 votes to Serge Vohor's 23.

In October 2015, half of the MPs in Kilman's government, including Deputy Prime Minister Moana Carcasses and several other ministers, were imprisoned for bribery. Kilman refused to comment publicly during the case, and allowed convicted MPs to remain in their positions as government ministers right up until the point of their imprisonment. His perceived lack of leadership during the crisis, and refusal to take responsibility for corruption within his government, was widely criticised and led to calls for his resignation. ==References== ==External links== *Statement by Sato Kilman at the 61st session of the United Nations General Assembly, 26 September 2006 - - - Category:1957 births Category:Foreign Ministers of Vanuatu Category:Living people Category:Members of the Parliament of Vanuatu Category:People from Malampa Province Category:People's Progressive Party (Vanuatu) politicians Category:Prime Ministers of Vanuatu ","title":"Sato Kilman"},{"id":"1279282","text":"Belleplates is a brand name of a musical instrument of the percussion family and Handbell sub-family. Consisting of a handle attached to a trapezoidal aluminium plate, struck by an attached hammer, they are something of a combination of handbells and handchimes. They are played with the same basic methods as handbells by teams or by individual players. Belleplates are manufactured by Belleplates, Ltd. ==History== Belleplates were invented by Maurice Davies when he struck with his knuckles a piece of aluminium he had cut out to make something in his workshop, and was pleasantly surprised that it made a pleasant musical sound much like that of handbells. In March 2003 Belleplates Inc won Best Use of Innovation at the Best of Business Awards 2003. They subsequently went on to win the McNOOT Award at the Midlands Christian Resources Exhibition. McNOOT stands for 'My Church Needs One of Those' and was judged by a panel of clergymen and church elders as the item in the show they would most like to take back to their parishes. ==Characteristics== The instrument fills a gap in the market for a inexpensive, durable and lightweight handbell type instrument. Due to these qualities they have been used preferentially to handbells in schools and with elderly or disabled musicians. Belleplates are not used as a professional instrument, however they blend with handbells and related instruments, allowing them to be used in a concert setting to provide a contrasting melody. Belleplates are generally sold in sets of between 12 (1½ octaves diatonic) and 61 (5 chromatic octaves). Belleplates are made with coloured plastic handles; diatonic bellplates have white handles, and chromatic belleplates have black handles. This colour distinction, as used on Malmark handbells, makes it visually easier to pick up the correct note.

The dendromurines are currently restricted to Africa, as is the case for all extant members of the family Nesomyidae. The authorship of the subfamily has been attributed to both Alston, 1876, and (incorrectly) to G. M. Allen, 1939. Two genera, Dendromus and Steatomys, are relatively common throughout most of sub-Saharan Africa. The remaining genera are relatively rare and have restricted geographic distributions. The link rat, Deomys ferugineus, has been traditionally placed in this subfamily, but molecular phylogenetic studies have shown that it is more related to the spiny mice, genus Acomys. The link rat is now placed in the family Muridae and subfamily Deomyinae. Only two of the currently recognized dendromurine genera, Dendromus and Steatomys, have been studied in molecular analyses. Considering how distinct these genera are from one another, the placement of all other dendromurine genera should be considered tentative pending closer examination. Another rare genus of \\"dendromurines\\", Leimacomys, has recently been placed in a new subfamily (Leimacomyinae) in the family Muridae (Musser and Carleton, 2005). Fossils attributed to the Dendromurinae are known from Asia as early as 15 million years ago. It has been thought that dendromurines invaded Africa from there and became extinct in Asia due to competition with other muroids. The same may be holding true at present in Africa as the dendromurines have declined there since the invasion of murines and other muroids. The subfamily Dendromurinae contains 6 genera and 25 species. ==Classification== Subfamily Dendromurinae - Climbing mice *Genus Dendromus - Climbing mice **Remarkable climbing mouse, Dendromus insignis **Mount Kahuzi climbing mouse, Dendromus kahuziensis **Monard's African climbing mouse, Dendromus leucostomus **Lovat's climbing mouse, Dendromus lovati **Gray climbing mouse, Dendromus melanotis **Brant's climbing mouse, Dendromus mesomelas **Banana climbing mouse, Dendromus messorius **Chestnut climbing mouse, Dendromus mystacalis **Kivu climbing mouse, Dendromus nyasae (kivu) **Nyika climbing mouse, Dendromus nyikae **Cameroon climbing mouse, Dendromus oreas **Dendromus ruppi **Vernay's climbing mouse, Dendromus vernayi *Genus Megadendromus **Nikolaus's mouse, Megadendromus nikolausi *Genus Dendroprionomys **Velvet climbing mouse, Dendroprionomys rousseloti *Genus Prionomys **Dollman's climbing mouse, Prionomys batesi *Genus Malacothrix **Gerbil mouse, Malacothrix typica *Genus Steatomys - Fat mice **Bocage's African fat mouse, Steatomys bocagei **Northwestern fat mouse, Steatomys caurinus **Dainty fat mouse, Steatomys cuppedius **Jackson's fat mouse, Steatomys jacksoni **Kreb's fat mouse, Steatomys krebsii **Pousargues's African fat mouse, Steatomys opimus **Tiny fat mouse, Steatomys parvus **Fat mouse, Steatomys pratensis ==References== *Kingdon, J. 1997.

Developed by Lamborghini, for use in the Gallardo, and the first engine developed for Automobili Lamborghini S.p.A. after they were acquired by AUDI AG – part of the Volkswagen Group. This engine has its origins in two concept cars made by Lamborghini, the 1988 P140 and the 1995 Calà. Both were equipped with engines having a 3.9-litre displacement. In the early 2000s, Lamborghini resumed the project and the engine was redesigned by increasing its displacement. The crankcase and cylinder block are built at the Audi Hungaria Zrt. factory in Győr, Hungary, whilst final assembly is carried out at Sant'Agata Bolognese, Italy. The engine has a 90° vee angle and, unusually for a production engine, a dry sump lubrication system is utilised to keep the center of gravity of the engine low. There was also some speculation that the engine block of the original 5.0-litre Lamborghini V10 was closely based on the Audi 4.2 FSI V8, which Audi produces for its luxury cars. However, this was denied by Audi AG, in their official documentation for their 5.2 FSI V10 engine, as used in the Audi S6 and Audi S8 – the Lamborghini 5.0 V10 has a cylinder bore spacing of between centres, whereas the Audi 5.2 V10 cylinder bore spacing is , the same as the Audi 4.2 FSI V8. The cylinder heads use the four valves per cylinder layout favoured by the Italian firm, rather than the five valve per cylinder variation formerly favoured by the German members of Volkswagen Group – including Audi and Volkswagen Passenger Cars. It was later confirmed that the new 5.2-litre Lamborghini V10 is mechanically identical to the Audi 5.2 V10 engine,https://www.evo.co.uk/audi/r8/14165/audi-r8-v-lamborghini-gallardo- lp560-4 as is evident by Lamborghini's usage of Audi's Fuel Stratified Injection, and 90 mm cylinder spacing. ==Specifications== ;engine configuration: 90° V10 engine; dry sump lubrication system ;engine displacement etc. :5.0 -- ; bore x stroke: .

Parts of Belair have views of Adelaide (The CBD), the Adelaide Plains and the coast. Belair National Park is one of the major attractions of the suburb, and Windy Point (formerly known as Observation Point) provides a 230 degree panorama making it one of the best lookouts over the city, the plains and the coast. ==Recreational facilities== Belair National Park is a very popular location for feeding ducks, cycling, walking or horseriding through the bush, enjoying the native flora and fauna, having barbecues and playing social games of tennis, football, soccer and 'backyard' cricket. Belair Country Club hosts an 18-hole public golf course adjacent to the National Park. Belair is also a very popular area for mountain bikers. There are bike trails not just in the National Park but throughout Belair, and steep tracks down the hills face to railway stations on the Belair line, which terminates adjacent to the National Park. ==History== The origin of the name 'Belair' appears uncertain. Gustav Ludewigs, who subdivided the area, may have named the suburb after Bel Air, Martinique, being his wife Maria's birthplace. Another theory is that it was named in 1849 after Eugene Bellairs, a Government surveyor who lived in the area.Passenger train arriving at Belair train station A Belair Post Office opened on 3 April 1859; it was relocated in 1881 to near its present position and the original office renamed Blackwood. ==Accessibility== Belair is approximately a fifteen-minute drive from the Adelaide city centre. Belair railway station is the terminus of the suburban Belair railway line. ==Education== Belair Primary School opened in 1957School History, Belair Primary School web site or 1958.Glenalta Chronology, City of Mitcham It consisted of two campuses, a junior primary (originally known as \\"Belair Infant School\\", and later renamed to \\"Belair Junior Primary School\\", and a separate upper primary school.

Every two years, during May, a group of students and staff travel to Kyoto. In the alternate year, Momoyama students and staff visit Belair during August. These visits have become an integral part of the schools' Japanese language and cultural programme. St John's Grammar School also has a junior campus adjacent to the railway station and senior campus located towards the west of the suburb. Actors Ben Nicholas and Sarah Snook are some of its more famous graduates. ==Downhilling== There are numerous mountain biking tracks throughout Belair, and the City of Mitcham is expanded and formalised these tracks in the early 21st century. In November 2010 a two- metre-wide bitumen track opened between Caroline Avenue, Belair, and Beagle Terrace, Lynton, providing a trail for cyclists as an alternative to the dangerous curves of Belair Road.

These elites form a political-ideological aristocracy relative to the general group. ==Overview== In anthropological theory, one model of human social development rooted in ideas of cultural evolution describes a chiefdom as a form of social organization more complex than a tribe or a band society, and less complex than a state or a civilization. Within general theories of cultural evolution, chiefdoms are characterized by permanent and institutionalized forms of political leadership (the chief), centralized decision-making, economic interdependence, and social hierarchy. Chiefdoms are described as intermediate between tribes and states in the progressive scheme of sociopolitical development formulated by Elman Service: band - tribe - chiefdom - state. A chief’s status is based on kinship, so it is inherited or ascribed, in contrast to the achieved status of Big Man leaders of tribes. Another feature of chiefdoms is therefore pervasive social inequality. They are ranked societies, according to the scheme of progressive sociopolitical development formulated by Morton Fried: egalitarian - ranked - stratified - state. The most succinct definition of a chiefdom in anthropology is by Robert L. Carneiro: \\"An autonomous political unit comprising a number of villages or communities under the permanent control of a paramount chief\\" (Carneiro 1981: 45). === Chiefdoms in archaeological theory === In archaeological theory, Service's definition of chiefdoms as “redistribution societies with a permanent central agency of coordination” (Service 1962: 144) has been most influential. Many archaeologists, however, dispute Service's reliance upon redistribution as central to chiefdom societies, and point to differences in the basis of finance (staple finance v. wealth finance). Service argued that chief rose to assume a managerial status to redistribute agricultural surplus to ecologically specialized communities within this territory (staple finance). Yet in re-studying the Hawaiian chiefdoms used as his case study, Timothy Earle observed that communities were rather self-sufficient. What the chief redistributed was not staple goods, but prestige goods to his followers that helped him to maintain his authority (wealth finance). Some scholars contest the utility of the chiefdom model for archaeological inquiry. The most forceful critique comes from Timothy Pauketat, whose Chiefdom and Other Archaeological Delusions outlines how chiefdoms fail to account for the high variability of the archaeological evidence for middle-range societies. Pauketat argues that the evolutionary underpinnings of the chiefdom model are weighed down by racist and outdated theoretical baggage that can be traced back to Lewis Morgan's 19th-century cultural evolution. From this perspective, pre-state societies are treated as underdeveloped, the savage and barbaric phases that preceded civilization. Pauketat argues that the chiefdom type is a limiting category that should be abandoned, and takes as his main case study Cahokia, a central place for the Mississippian culture of North America. Pauketat's provocation, however, fails to offer a sound alternative to the chiefdom type. For while he claims that chiefdoms are a delusion, he describes Cahokia as a civilization. This upholds rather than challenges the evolutionary scheme he contests. ===Simple=== Chiefdoms are characterized by the centralization of authority and pervasive inequality. At least two inherited social classes (elite and commoner) are present. (The ancient Hawaiian chiefdoms had as many as four social classes.) An individual might change social class during a lifetime by extraordinary behavior. A single lineage/family of the elite class becomes the ruling elite of the chiefdom, with the greatest influence, power, and prestige. Kinship is typically an organizing principle, while marriage, age, and sex can affect one's social status and role. A single simple chiefdom is generally composed of a central community surrounded by or near a number of smaller subsidiary communities. All of the communities recognize the authority of a single kin group or individual with hereditary centralized power, dwelling in the primary community. Each community will have its own leaders, which are usually in a tributary and/or subservient relationship to the ruling elite of the primary community. ===Complex=== A complex chiefdom is a group of simple chiefdoms controlled by a single paramount center and ruled by a paramount chief. Complex chiefdoms have two or even three tiers of political hierarchy. Nobles are clearly distinct from commoners and do not usually engage in any form of agricultural production. The higher members of society consume most of the goods that are passed up the hierarchy as a tribute. Reciprocal obligations are fulfilled by the nobles carrying out rituals that only they can perform. They may also make token, symbolic redistributions of food and other goods. In two or three-tiered chiefdoms, higher-ranking chiefs have control over a number of lesser ranking individuals, each of whom controls specific territory or social units. Political control rests on the chief's ability to maintain access to a sufficiently large body of tribute, passed up the line by lesser chiefs. These lesser chiefs in turn collect from those below them, from communities close to their own center. At the apex of the status, hierarchy sits the paramount. Anthropologists and archaeologists have demonstrated through research that chiefdoms are a relatively unstable form of social organization. They are prone to cycles of collapse and renewal, in which tribal units band together, expand in power, fragment through some form of social stress, and band together again. An example of this kind of social organization were the Germanic Peoples who conquered the western Roman Empire in the 5th century CE. Although commonly referred to as tribes, anthropologists classified their society as chiefdoms. They had a complex social hierarchy consisting of kings, a warrior aristocracy, common freemen, serfs, and slaves. The American Indian tribes sometimes had ruling kings or satraps (governors) in some areas and regions. The Cherokee, for example, had an imperial-family ruling system over a long period of history. The early Spanish explorers in the Americas reported on the Indian kings and kept extensive notes during what is now called the conquest. Some of the native tribes in the Americas had princes, nobles, and various classes and castes. The \\"Great Sun\\" was somewhat like the Great Khans of Asia and eastern Europe. Much like an emperor, the Great Sun of North America is the best example of chiefdoms and imperial kings in North American Indian history. The Aztecs of Mexico had a similar culture. ==Chiefdoms on the Indian subcontinent== The Arthashastra, a work on politics written some time between the 4th century BC and 2nd century AD by Indian author Kautilya, similarly describes the Rajamandala (or \\"Raja-mandala,\\") as circles of friendly and enemy states surrounding the state of a king (raja). Also see Suhas Chatterjee, Mizo Chiefs and the Chiefdom (1995). ==Native Chieftain System in China== Tusi (), also known as Headmen or Chieftains, were tribal leaders recognized as imperial officials by the Yuan, Ming, and Qing-era Chinese governments, principally in Yunnan. The arrangement is generally known as the Native Chieftain System (, p Tǔsī Zhìdù). == Alternatives to chiefdoms == In prehistoric South-West Asia, alternatives to chiefdoms were the non-hierarchical systems of complex acephalous communities, with a pronounced autonomy of single-family households. These communities have been analyzed recently by Berezkin, who suggests the Apa Tanis as their ethnographic parallel (Berezkin 1995). Frantsouzoff (2000) finds a more developed example of such type of polities in ancient South Arabia in the Wadi Hadhramawt of the 1st millennium BCE. In Southeast Asian history up to the early 19th century, the metaphysical view of the cosmos called the mandala (i.e., circle) is used to describe a Southeast Asian political model, which in turn describes the diffuse patterns of political power distributed among Mueang (principalities) where circles of influence were more important than central power. The concept counteracts modern tendencies to look for unified political power like that of the large European kingdoms and nation states, which were an inadvertent byproduct of 15th-century advances in map-making technologies. Nikolay Kradin has demonstrated that an alternative to the state seems to be represented by the supercomplex chiefdoms created by some nomads of Eurasia. The number of structural levels within such chiefdoms appears to be equal, or even to exceed those within the average state, but they have a different type of political organization and political leadership. Such types of political entities do not appear to have been created by the agriculturists (e.g., Kradin 2000, 2002, 2003, 2004). ==See also== *Chief of the Name *Band society *Mandala (Southeast Asian political model) *Tanistry *Tribe ==Bibliography== *Berezkin, Yu.

The watershed of lies between the Humber River to the east and Etobicoke Creek to the west. The creek begins in Brampton, and flows through the community of Malton (now part of Mississauga); it continues southeast, past Toronto Pearson International Airport; and through a shallow valley surrounded by the urban neighbourhoods of Islington and Mimico. The creek is often encased in a concrete spillway to contain the fast flowing water that occurs during rainstorms. Mimico Creek crosses Bloor Street near the Islington Subway Station, and empties into Lake Ontario about west of the mouth of the Humber River. Originally the creek had dozens of small tributary streams, the largest of which was Bonar Creek, that joined Mimico Creek near its mouth. Most of the tributaries were less than one kilometre long. ==Recreation== In the late 1970s and early 1980s, Humber Bay Park was constructed at the mouth of Mimico Creek. The park consists of two headlands, built using landfill from local construction projects that flank the mouth.

Other notable clients include: * Winona Ryder – In December 2002, Geragos defended Academy Award-nominated actress Winona Ryder on charges of stealing more than $5,500 worth of merchandise from a Beverly Hills, California store in 2001. With the help from Geragos, she was only sentenced to three years' probation and ordered to undergo psychological and drug counseling. * Michael Jackson – In the early stages of the Michael Jackson molestation case, Geragos simultaneously handled this case and the Scott Peterson's case, two of the best-known U.S. trials at that time. Geragos's \\"crushingly busy calendar\\" in the courtroom earned him a rebuke by a judge in an embezzlement case Geragos was also representing.Judge Grills Geragos On Workload On April 26, 2004, Jackson removed Geragos as his attorney, replacing him with Thomas Mesereau. In a public statement provided by his spokesperson, Raymone Bain, Jackson stated, \\"It is imperative that I have the full attention of those who are representing me. My life is at stake...\\" suggesting that Geragos may not have had enough time to handle his case because of his workload. Geragos later said that he was dismayed to see Jackson climb atop an SUV to the cheers of his fans after leaving the Santa Barbara County, California courthouse in January 2004, when he was first arraigned on the initial complaint.Waxman, Sharon. \\"Jackson Says 'Full Attention' Of Legal Team Was Lacking.\\" The New York Times, April 27, 2004, p.

On July 5, 2006, Anderson was found in contempt of court by U.S. District Judge William Alsup, who jailed Anderson for refusing to testify before a federal grand jury investigating perjury accusations against Bonds. Geragos announced that he would file an appeal based on his assertion that the subpoena to testify violated Anderson's July 2005 plea bargain agreement in the Bay Area Laboratory Co-operative case. Anderson was to be held until he agreed to testify or until the grand jury's term expired. Geragos insisted that his client would not testify.news.yahoo.com The grand jury expired on July 20, 2006, and Anderson was released from prison two weeks later. On August 28, 2006, Anderson was again found in contempt of court for refusing to testify before a newly convened grand jury and sentenced to prison. Anderson was freed on October 5, 2006 after an order from the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals found that the trial judge had committed legal errors. Anderson was later sent back to jail on November 16, 2006. * Cameron Brown – He was the attorney for Brown, who was charged with murdering his four-year-old daughter by throwing her off a Rancho Palos Verdes cliff. The twelve-week trial ended in August 2006 without a verdict. The jury deliberated for over nine days but was hopelessly deadlocked and a mistrial was declared by Judge Mark Arnold of the Torrance Superior Court. The case was retried in the fall of 2009 by Pat Harris, an associate at Geragos's firm. The second trial also ended with a hung jury. A third trial saw him convicted. After the second trial resulted in a hung jury, Geragos and his firm turned the case over to attorney Herbert Barrish. While Geragos typically never leaves a client after a hung jury, him and his firm had to leave the case due to economic hardships. * Victor Willis – In September 2006, Geragos represented the Village People front man on charges of drug and weapons possession. Facing jail time, Geragos successfully negotiated a sentence of three years probation and treatment for drug addiction at the Betty Ford Clinic. * Amphit Dhaliwal and Kulbir Dhaliwal – In December 2007, the two survivors of the tiger attack at the San Francisco Zoo, hired Geragos to represent them against potential criminal charges, and also with the anticipation of filing a lawsuit against the zoo. Despite pressure from city officials, the local police inspector made it clear that there were no grounds for filing criminal charges against the Dhaliwal brothers related to the tiger attack. Geragos filed a federal suit against the Zoo and the City of San Francisco for violation of the Dhaliwal brothers' civil rights, including the Dhaliwals' being subject to search and seizure without probable cause, and for intentional infliction of emotional distress. Geragos settled the civil suit in the early phase of the court process for $900,000. * Kazuyoshi Miura – In 2008, he joined the defense of Japanese businessman Miura, who committed suicide before his trial. * Chris Brown – Geragos represented Brown, who pleaded guilty to the assault of his then-girlfriend, Rihanna. On February 8, 2009 Geragos brought Chris Brown to surrender to the LAPD. Later, Brown was arrested, and his court date was set to be on March 5, 2009. Geragos and Brown attended the court date, but did not plea and asked for arraignment until the next court date, April 6, 2009. On June 22, 2009, Brown pleaded guilty to one count of felony assault and was sentenced to 5 years' probation and 6 months' community service. However, Brown’s inability to adhere to the rules of his probation – ultimately led to his dismissal from rehab and the singer was thrown in jail from March 2014 to June of that year. Under counsel from Geragos, Brown was once again released under probation. Early in 2015, Brown's probation was revoked after he was present in two nightclubs where shootings took place. His probation officer had a problem with the singer traveling to San Jose, to perform at the nightclub where an incident occurred leaving five people shot and injured. Brown was aware his probation could end with the hearing, and before entering the courthouse, he tweeted: “Hopefully this is my last day in court…. Pray for me.” However, at Brown’s scheduled March 20th court date, with the help of Geragos, Brown’s probation officer reversed course, saying in a positive review that Brown had completed his community service sentence. Los Angeles Superior Court Judge James R. Brandlin concurred, ruling the singer would no longer be under the watchful eye of the judicial system. Geragos said this of his client, “He is in a spot right now and a place right now that I couldn’t be prouder of him,” adding that the end of Brown’s probation is “a monumental feat for him.” * Colin Kaepernick - Former 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick first filed a grievance against the NFL in October 2017, claiming that the NFL tried to keep him from playing after he chose to kneel during the national anthem. The quarterback opted out of his contract with the 49ers in March of the same year and was not picked up later in free agency. Kaepernick began kneeling during the 2016 season to protest racial inequality and police brutality. Safety Eric Reid and several other NFL players eventually joined him. Reid, a former teammate of Kaepernick's, was also a member of the grievance Kaepernick filed. After several months of ongoing dialogue with representatives of the NFL, both Kaepernick and Reid withdrew their collusion cases against the National Football League. On Feb. 15, both Geragos and co-counsel Ben Meiselas released a joint statement with the NFL, declaring the resolution of the matter was subject to a confidentiality agreement. * Jussie Smollett – Geragos represented Smollett in the 2019 alleged false police report. On March 12, 2019, it was reported that Chicago prosecutors had dropped all 16 criminal charges against EMPIRE star Jussie Smollett as part of a deferred prosecution agreement against him. As part of the conditions of the deal, Smollett did 16 hours of community service and forfeited his $10,000 bond to the city. Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel announced he wanted Jussie Smollett to cover the cost –amounting to $130,000– for the Chicago police department’s investigation. Smollett’s attorneys responded in a statement via NBC News that “Jussie has paid enough.” Geragos and his firm also filed a motion to seal the case, which was granted by a judge. On April 23, 2019, Geragos was sued, along with Tina Glandian (another member of Smollett's legal team), under claims of defamation and false light by the Osundairo brothers (originally arrested in connection with an alleged attack on the actor.) However, a defamatory quote the Osundairos attributed to Glandian and Geragos in their lawsuit was in fact, said by their own attorney, Gloria Schmidt. The Osundairo brothers also paraphrased statements they claimed Geragos said on the podcast REASONABLE DOUBT (which Mark co-hosts with comic Adam Carolla), alleging Geragos dragged their reps through the mud by indicating the brothers had attacked Jussie, committed perjury and conspired to make false statements to clear their names. Geragos submitted transcripts of his podcast during the time of the criminal legal proceedings, noting he never said the brothers' names, nor did he say or indicate what they attributed to him. The case was dismissed by the judge. * Partridge v. Benton - In March of 2018, Chief U.S. District Judge Brian Miller granted the city of Benton, Arkansas a motion to dismiss a lawsuit that Keagan Schweikle's parents, Piper Partridge and Dominic Schweikle, had filed against the city’s officer,Kyle Ellison, and its police chief at the time, Kirk Lane. However, on July 3, 2019, a federal appeals court reinstated a lawsuit filed in 2017 against Benton police by the parents of the suicidal 17-year-old boy (Keagan) who was shot and killed while complying with an officer's order (Kyle Ellison) to move a gun away from his head. Filed by Geragos, (and Little Rock attorney Rick Holiman), the lawsuit alleged that Ellison used excessive force when he fired three shots at Schweikle as he stood on a bank facing the river and holding a gun in his right hand after threatening to shoot himself. Miller said that after Ellison ordered Schweikle to drop the gun and the boy moved it away from his head, the intention behind his actions was ambiguous, leaving the officer little choice but to shoot. Miller noted, \\"Keagan could have quickly pointed the gun at Ellison and opened fire almost instantaneously. ... Ellison had a right to protect himself.\\" A three-judge panel of the 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in St. Louis said Miller ruled on the matter too early in the process. And Holiman and Geragos argued the case. When Schweikle's parents were told the lawsuit was moving forward again, the parents broke down in tears. Holiman added, \\"We think it's the right decision.\\" * Scottie Pippen - In February of 2014, Scottie Pippen hired Geragos to file a countersuit against a Malibu man who alleged the former NBA All-Star assaulted him at a restaurant last year. Camran Shafighi filed a $4-million lawsuit against Pippen, accusing him of a “brutal and unjustified physical attack\\" that allegedly occurred outside upscale Nobu restaurant after Shafighi had sought a picture with the former Chicago Bull. In the cross- complaint filed by Geragos earlier in February, alleged Shafighi cursed at Pippen using racial slurs, spat on him and his children and said, “I’m going to kill you.” The cross-complaint also alleged that Shafighi was “extremely aggressive and noticeably intoxicated” and calls for unspecified damages “according to proof.” * Keagan Schweikle - In 2019, an 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals reversed a lower court finding that a Benton police officer Kyle Ellison had acted reasonably when he fatally shot a suicidal teen, Keagan Schweikle, in October 2016. In March of 2018, Chief U.S. District Judge Brian Miller granted the city's motion to dismiss the lawsuit that Keagan Schweikle's parents, Piper Partridge and Dominic Schweikle, had filed against the city, officer Kyle Ellison and its police chief at the time, Kirk Lane. Filed by Little Rock attorney Rick Holiman and Los Angeles attorney Mark Geragos, the lawsuit alleged that Ellison used excessive force when he fired three shots at Schweikle as he stood on a bank facing the river and holding a gun in his right hand after threatening to shoot himself. A panel of federal judges has restored the lawsuit over the officer-involved shooting death of 17-year-old Keagan Schweikle of Benton. * Aron Petrosian - In 2014, Aron Petrosian, who was 17 years old at the time, was speeding in his Chevrolet Camaro at 103mph in Hacienda Heights, Ca. The car crashed into another vehicle resulting in the death of Alicia Rosales and severe injuries to her 10 and 13 year old sons. Despite him being 17, Petrosian was charged in adult criminal court. In August of 2020, a Los Angeles Superior Court Judge reversed and remanded his sentence. Represented by Mark Geragos, Cliff Gardner and Daniel Buffington, after winning the murder case in 2018, he will be re-sentenced for vehicular manslaughter and reckless driving. * Jorge Ramirez - Geragos took on this case in Bakersfield, California in 2014. Jorge Ramirez, a 34-year-old man, was working closely with the Bakersfield Police Department as an informant, when he was shot multiple times by officers Sept. 16 outside the Four Points Sheraton Hotel. Ramirez was unarmed. The fugitive Ramirez was with, Justin Bryan Harger, 32, was also killed after officers confronted them. According to police, Harger first began firing at officers, with one bullet grazing the head of Officer Daniel Brewer, who was hospitalized but released a few hours later. Ramirez’s family and Gergos filed a wrongful death lawsuit against the city of Bakersfield. * Travelers Insurance - Mark Geragos and his law firm — along with multiple clients — are suing Travelers Insurance for initially denying coverage of their pandemic-related claims. The firm says that while it's technically an essential business and not subject to a mandated shutdown, access to its downtown L.A. office has been \\"greatly limited\\" and the company has \\"been forced to deal with a substantial loss in business traffic and client/law-related business activities.\\" ==Media appearances== Geragos occasionally appears as both guest and legal commentator on TV.

The alga has a stem (rhizome) which spreads horizontally just above the seafloor. From this stem grow vertical fern-like pinnae, whose blades are flat like those of the yew (Taxus), hence the species name taxifolia. It is one of two algae on the list of the world's 100 worst invasive species compiled by the IUCN Invasive Species Specialist Group. ==Description== Two illustrations (Fig 1 . 4-5) of C. taxifolia displaying its \\"leaf\\" and rhizome structures (Fig 1 . 1-3 are illustrations of C. sertularioides) Unlike most aquarium macro algae, C. taxifolia (Killer Algae) has the appearance of a vascular plant with \\"leaves\\" arranged neatly up stalks, like a fern. Behind this appearance, the plant is a typical macro alga, without the vascular system to transmit nutrients and cells that plants originally evolved on land have. Caulerpa taxifolia is a single celled organism, but this is often overlooked because of its complexity and size. Caulerpa taxifolia has been described as storing in its \\"leaves\\" a single chemical, 'caulerpicin', that is noxious to fish and other would-be predators, though not toxic to the water around it. This is in contrast to plants which produce a variety of toxins, but in reduced amounts. On the other hand, studies have found that there is reduced pollution and toxicity in waters where it grows invasively, as around port cities in the Mediterranean. Original concerns about it decreasing biodiversity of fauna have also been allayed, as species counts have shown this remains about the same. ==Introduced species== In 1980, the staff at the Wilhelma Zoo in Stuttgart, Germany found that a specific strain of this alga thrived in cold aquarium environments. Selective breeding under exposure to both chemicals and ultra-violet light produced even hardier Caulerpa strains. When it eventually found its way into the Mediterranean, widespread concern developed that the algae threatened to alter the entire ecosystem by crowding out native seaweed while being inedible to animals. It is thought that the seaweed was accidentally released into coastal waters of the Mediterranean Sea just below Jacques Cousteau's Oceanographic Museum of Monaco in 1984. Ten years later, the claim was made that Caulerpa had grown to cover ,Bright, C. 1998. Life out of bounds: Bio-invasion in a borderless world. W. W. Norton & Company, New York. and was preventing native plants from growing. This concern earned the algae the dubious nickname \\"Killer Algae\\" after the title of a book written on the subject.Meinesz, A. 1999. Killer algae. University of Chicago Press, Chicago. Its author, Marine biologist Alexandre Meinesz first discovered the alga in the 1980s, and requested the help of the Monaco Oceanographic Museum, which sat right next to the first known C. taxifolia patch. The director of the museum argued that this invasion probably happened naturally, the result of ocean currents carrying a tropical species into the area. The parties bickered publicly for years over whether the species was natural or invasive, and whether the museum had released it or not, at the expense of sound scientific research on the species and its ecological significance. Beds of the algae typically inhabit polluted, nutrient-rich areas such as sewage outfalls,Frakes, T.A. 2001. Killer algae: Ecological disaster or media hysteria? Submitted during the hearing in California concerning the proposed bill # 1334 available at http://www.aquarium-design.com/reef/caulerpa.html explaining its spread among port cities in the Mediterranean Sea. This actually reduces the pollution in those areas, as the caulerpa consumes it: In an eight-year study of Caulerpa beds in the French Bay of Menton by the European Oceanographic Observatory of Monaco (based within the Museum of MonacoMeinesz, p. 206), it was found that the alga reduced pollution and aided in the recovery of native Posidonia seagrass.Jaubert, J.M., J.R.M. Chisholm, G. Passeron-Seitre, D. Ducrot, H.T. Ripley, and L. Roy. 1999. No deleterious alterations in Posidonia beds in the Bay of Menton (France) eight years after Caulerpa taxifolia colonization. Journal of Phycology 25:1113-1119. Despite claims that as many as half of fish species have disappeared from areas where Caulerpa grows, scientific studies have shown that fish diversity and biomass are equal or greater in Caulerpa meadows than in seagrass beds,Relini, G., M Relini, and G. Torchia. (1998) Fish biodiversity in a Caulerpa taxifolia meadow in the Ligurian Sea. Italian Journal of Zoology 65 Supplement:465-470. that Caulerpa had no effect on composition or richness of fish species,Francour, P., M. Harmelin-Vivien, J. G. Harmelin, and J. Duclerc. 1995. Impact of Caulerpa taxifolia colonization on the littoral ichthyofauna of north-western Mediterranean sea. Hydrobiologia 300-301:345-353. and that species richness and epiphytic plant diversity is greater in Caulerpa than in pure sea grass. Thus, in contrast to widely publicized reports to the contrary, the species appears to have many beneficial ecological effects on aquatic communities in the Mediterranean Sea. Aquarist Jean Jaubert, director of the aforementioned Oceanographic Museum of Monaco, has said that the affected areas in the nearby Bay of Menton have been exaggerated 100-fold. ===Reproduction mechanism=== The aquarium strain reproduces asexually, that is, vegetatively: the viscous, elastic white fluid inside the stem was found under the microscope to contain only male gametes. Rate of growth can be as fast as a centimeter per day. If any small part is severed from the rest of the alga, this small part will regrow into another alga. Anchors of ships and fishing nets can serve as carriers for Caulerpa. Thus, this alga has been found to jump from the coast of one port city to the coast of another port city. The natural strain has both male and female individuals and additionally reproduces sexually. Gametes are expelled from each sex and meet to form a zygote which then goes through two larval stages before becoming an adult. ===Other introductions=== In 2000, the strain was found on the coast of California (U.S.), near San Diego, and also on the coast of New South Wales, Australia. The California colonization was small enough to be considered controllable: it was covered with tarpaulin which was held down with sandbags at the edges of the infestation. Then chlorine was poured in through tubes which fed into certain openings in the tarpaulin: the interior of the tarpaulin filled up with chlorine and killed living organisms inside it, not only the unwanted alga but also fish, invertebrates and other seaweeds. The killing of such other organisms was not desirable but was deemed preferable to letting the algae grow unchecked. The appearance off the California coast was most probably caused by an aquarium owner improperly dumping the contents, allowing C. taxifolia to flow through a storm sewer into the lagoon where the invasion was discovered. California has since passed a law forbidding the possession, sale or transport of Caulerpa taxifolia within the state. There is also a federal law under the Noxious Weed Act forbidding interstate sale and transport of the aquarium strain Caulerpa. In July 2006, the alga had been declared eradicated from the two Southern California locations (Agua Hedionda Lagoon in Carlsbad and Seagate Lagoon in Huntington Beach). ===Possible natural control method=== Researchers at the University of Nice in France have been studying a tiny aquatic slug which is a natural predator of C. taxifolia.Thibaut, T. 2001. \\"Elysia subornata a potential control agent of the alga Caulerpa taxifolia in the Mediterranean Sea\\" , Journal of the Marine Biological Association of the United Kingdom Called Elysia subornata, it was found off the coast of Florida, in waters warmer than those in the Mediterranean. This slug is believed to feed exclusively on C. taxifolia, by sticking its proboscis into the stem and sucking out the white viscous liquid inside the stem: this causes the alga to become limp, discolored, and dead. As the slug does so, it absorbs the alga's poison. The slug has an enzyme which neutralizes the noxious effect of the poison, and at the same time, the poison protects the slug from being eaten by fish. However, this slug cannot survive in the cooler waters of the Mediterranean and, therefore, is unable to control the invasive alga there. ==Gallery== File:Caulerpa taxifolia - National Museum of Nature and Science, Tokyo - DSC07620.JPGC. taxifolia on display at the National Museum of Nature and Science in Tokyo, Japan.

KG is a German manufacturer of musical instruments, founded in 1857 by Matthias Hohner (1833–1902). The roots of the Hohner firm are in Trossingen, Baden-Württemberg. Since its foundation, and though known for its harmonicas, Hohner has manufactured a wide range of instruments, such as kazoos, accordions, recorder flutes, melodicas, banjos, electric, acoustic, resonator and classical guitars, basses, mandolins and ukuleles (under the brand name Lanikai) From the 1940s through 1990s, the company also manufactured various electric/electronic keyboards. Especially in the 1960s and 1990s, they manufactured a range of innovative and popular electromechanical keyboard instruments; the cembalet, pianet, basset, guitaret, and clavinet. In the 1980s, several Casio synths were sold under the Hohner brand - for example, the Casio HT-3000/Hohner KS61midi and the VZ-1/HS-2). Nowadays, Hohner produces harmonicas, melodicas, accordions and recorder flutes. ==History== Clock maker Matthias Hohner began crafting harmonicas in 1857, assisted by his wife and a single employee. 650 were made in the first year.How To Play The Hohner 10 Hole Diatonic Harmonica by David Harp Hohner harmonicas quickly became popular, and in his lifetime Matthias built the largest harmonica factory in the world. During the American Civil War, Matthias Hohner distributed harmonicas to family members in the United States who in turn gave them to the soldiers.The House of Blues Radio Hour episode Harmonica Documentary In the 1920s, Hohner began manufacturing chromatic harmonicas, which unlike the \\"standard\\" diatonic form can be played in any key. Famous harmonicist Borrah Minevitch claimed he sold his design for the chromatic harmonica to Hohner.Playing the Harmonica by Dave Oliver In the mid-1950s, Hohner began producing electric guitars. The company headquarters in Trossingen In 1964 Hohner released \\"The Beatles Harmonica Kit\\" which was sold in a blister package, much like most Hohner harmonicas nowadays, retailed for $2.95, and help what Hohner calls \\"bring about a new popularity upsurge of the Hohner harmonica on both sides of the Atlantic.\\". In the 1970s Hohner began manufacturing acoustic guitars, and re-producing electric guitars. Musician Prince almost always played a Hohner \\"Mad Cat\\" and it was said to have been his favourite guitar. This Electric Guitar was modelled on the ‘HS Anderson Mad Cat’ and was essentially a Telecaster. Matthias Karl Hohner, son of and a direct descendant in fourth generation and name bearer of the founder , was one of the last members of the Hohner dynasty involved in managing the family business, between 1968 and 1986. His son Matthias Francisco Hohner belonged to the first generation of direct descendants who did not enter into the family business. Many direct descendants of the founder are still active as members of the \\"Deutsches Harmonika Museum\\" and the \\"Hohner'sche Familienverein\\". ==Subdivisions== ===Marine Band=== \\"The Marine Band\\" is the base model of the line. Technically named the Marine Band 1896/20 for the year it was introduced and the twenty reeds it possesses, it has been the basis of a number of Hohner's harmonicas over the years. It also has some tuning variations like the 1896N (natural minor key) and the 1896H (harmonic minor key). The Marine Band has been Hohner's most popular model of harmonica for generations. Made in Germany on a wood comb, most blues and rock artists play a Marine Band. Several noted users are Bob Dylan, John Lennon, Bruce Springsteen, Little Walter and Neil Young. There are various subdivisions of the Marine Band. The Special 20 (#560) was introduced in the mid 1970s. It has the same reeds as a Marine Band, but it has a plastic comb instead of a wooden comb, and rounded edges. It was the first Hohner harmonica to have a plastic comb, which not only made the instrument more airtight, but also eliminated the swelling wood combs go through as they moisten from use. Made in Germany, this model quickly became the preferred choice of many rock and blues players. Now, most harmonicas being manufactured from all companies are based upon the Special 20. Its most noted user is John Popper, who appears on the blister. Like the 1896, the Special 20 also has tuning variations available, like the #560C in country styled tuning, and the #560N in natural minor. The Marine Band Deluxe has all the features of the original Marine Band with tighter construction and a new cover design which creates a greater volume. The Marine Band Crossover also features the same reeds, but is made on a bamboo comb that is water repellent. The Marine Band Thunderbird is a model of low and super- low pitched 10-hole diatonic harmonica that was introduced in 2011. It possesses a bamboo comb like the Crossover, and a conical shaped lower cover plate. Designed by noted harmonica player and customizer Joe Filisko, this plate helps reduce any rattle caused by the low frequency tone produced by the reeds. It is available in low major keys A through F, as well as low B-flat and E-flat, and double-low F. The Marine Band 364 has twelve holes and is available is the natural keys of C, G, and D only. The Marine Band 365 has fourteen holes and is available in keys C and G only. The Marine Band Soloist (364s) is the same as a twelve-hole chromatic harmonica without a button. Available in key of C. The Marine Band 365 Steve Baker Special (365/28 SBS) possesses the same construction as the original 365, but with low pitched tuning to their natural major keys, available in C, D, G, A, and F. It is named for, and was developed in part by noted harmonicist Steve Baker, who resides in Germany and has contributed to the design of several other Hohner harmonica models, including the Marine Bands Deluxe and Crossover. The Marine Band Octave has two rows of reeds tuned an octave apart. Available in the keys of C and G. == \\"Modular\\" harmonica system == In the mid-1990s, responding to the competing new Lee Oskar Harmonica System by Tombo, Hohner introduced an interchangeably parted series known as the Modular System, usually abbreviated MS. Over the years, several harps have been added to this system. The Blues Harp has been around since the early 1970s. Until the 1990s, it was functionally identical to the Marine Band, the only differences being the cover plates and the varnish on the front of the wood comb, and the Blues Harp's profile was thinner as well. At one point, Johnny Cash promoted the Blues Harp. In the 1990s, Hohner made the Blues Harp part of its Modular System (MS) line. This new Blues Harp lost its uniqueness, and is interchangeable with the other models in the MS line, but it currently remains the standby of many players who use MS harps. The Pro Harp features lacquer- coated cover plates with a glossy black finish and a plastic comb. Since its inception, it has become a very popular model among rock and roll players. The Pro Harp was another model that was in Hohner's handmade line of harmonicas, and was later adapted to the modular system. The Cross Harp was a nearly identical model to the Pro Harp with the exception of a wood comb and slightly thicker original reed plates. The black coverplate coating was greblon. It was discontinued in 2011. The Big River Harp was introduced as a less expensive alternative to the Blues Harp. It is favored among beginner harmonicists, although many experienced players also prefer the Big River for its higher natural volume. It features a plastic comb and bare metal cover plates. The Blue Midnight was released in 2011 with a limit to the key of C, also on the less expensive side of the market. It features stainless steel cover plates with a wider back gap for enhanced volume while playing. The unique feature of this harp is the comb, which is made out of translucent blue plastic. The comb allows for brighter tone than the black combed models. It also has a special just intonation (JI) \\"Chicago tuning\\". It is also now available in other keys.http://www.hohnerusa.com/index.php?1945 The 225 - Deuce and a Quarter was a limited edition harmonica on the modular system that was put out in 2007 and 2008. It was made on a black plastic comb, with chrome-plated reedplates, and black powder-coated coverplates with art resembling a vintage car's hood- emblem. It was available only in the key of A. The Meisterklasse is a high-end harmonica featuring chrome-plated cover plates, an anodized aluminium comb, and extra thick 1.05mm nickel-plated reeds. Originally issued as a more compact, unique model, the revised version (still carrying the same 580 model number) is now on the modular system, made in Germany. One other feature that sets the Meisterklasse apart from most other Hohner harmonicas are its full- length cover plates, which extend all the way to the ends of the harmonica's comb rather than sharply angling down before the ends to form an adjoining surface parallel to the reedplates and comb. The only other Hohner harmonica possessing this quality is the curve-framed Golden Melody. ==Other diatonic harmonica models== The Old Standby is another model beloved by generations of harmonica players. Up until the 1990s, this model was a quality instrument made in Germany on a wood comb. Where the Marine Band was the choice of blues players, many country music players such as Charlie McCoy preferred the Old Standby. In the 1990s, Hohner began manufacturing this model in China on a plastic comb with a significant decrease in quality. Among harmonica fans the downgrade remains unpopular. Golden Melody, designed by Frank and Cham-Ber Huang, has a curved shape. This German-made, plastic-comb model has a slightly different tuning (equal temperament) than other diatonic harmonicas, making the Golden Melody better suited for playing single-note melodies and solos. The XB-40, (short for Extreme bending-40 reeds), is unlike any other diatonic made. Released in 2003, it was specifically designed by harmonica specialist Rick Epping to simplify proficient bending of the notes. To make this possible, the XB-40 uses forty reeds as opposed to the usual twenty found in most ten-hole diatonics. With these bending capabilities, the XB-40 gives access to all the notes on the chromatic scale through bending the natural tones of each hole. This model was discontinued in 2013. Shortly before production officially ceased, Suzuki Music released a similar model the SUB-30. The American Ace has been a popular choice as a beginner's harmonica for decades. Originally made in Ireland on a wood comb, this model is currently being made in China on a plastic comb. The Pocket Pal is a recent addition to the Hohner standard line of harmonicas. It is somewhat unusual because it is slightly shorter in length than most harmonicas, leading to its namesake of being pocket handy. It is Chinese made, which is unfavorable to most harmonica players, but the Pocket Pal has caught on as an inexpensive, yet quality harp. Like the Old Standby, the Pocket Pal is designed for use in country music. 38C, also known as the Mini Harp, is Hohner's least expensive model. With four holes, the 38C plays a single octave in the key of C. Like other budget harmonicas, the 38C is manufactured in China with a plastic comb. The Little Lady is very similar to the 38C, but on a pearwood comb and with different cover plate art. It is technically a playable harmonica, but it is generally regarded as a knick-knack piece that can be used as personal jewelry. It is also available as a keychain. The Little Lady holds the distinction of being the first musical instrument to be played in outer space. ==Other harmonica types== In addition to diatonic harmonicas Hohner also produces other types such as chromatic and tremolo harmonicas. ===Chromatic=== Hohner \\"Super Chromonica\\"; case marked \\"No.260 1/2\\" (model); images top-to- bottom show the case top, harmonica top, case bottom, and harmonica bottom/obverse The Chromonica, no longer in production, contained forty reeds and played 2½ full chromatic octaves. This was the original Hohner chromatic model, available until recently in C or G. The Discovery 48 an entry level chromatic harmonica, aimed at beginners. Contains forty-eight reeds featuring full length cover plates, the same 1.2mm reeds found in the deluxe and a reversible mouth piece. There is also a Super Chromonica 270 which contains forty-eight reeds and spans three octaves. The Super Chromonica 270 Deluxe is an updated improvement on the Super Chromonica, featuring tighter reedplate fixtures, thicker reedplates, round holes in its chrome-plated mouthpiece, a smoother slide mechanism which can be remounted for left-handed use, and a round-edged comb for more comfortable holding. The Deluxe is also available with a gold-plated mouthpiece and coverplates, known as the Super Chromonica Gold. The Educator 10 is a 10-hole, 40-reed chromatic harmonica built on a plastic comb. It is designed without the valve or windsaver technology found in many other chromatics, and because of its ten holes, it is smaller than most chromatics. This makes it a simple and inexpensive chromatic, ideal both for novices and for experienced diatonic players making the transition from the smaller 10-hole harmonicas. Like the Chromonica, it plays full octaves. The Koch Chromatic and Slide Harp are both designed in the same fashion as chromatic harmonicas, but possess the Richter tuning found in typical 10-hole diatonic harmonicas. Like the Educator 10, both are also 10-hole and built on a pearwood comb. The Slide Harp has been discontinued. The 64 Chromonica is a four-full-octave harmonica in the key of C. With 64 reeds on a plastic comb, it boasts an extra octave below the middle-C note, giving it an accentuated versatility. The CX-12 is a 12-hole, 48-reed chromatic, uniquely designed with a one-piece plastic housing and a more ergonomic slide button. It is available in several keys including a tenor-C. The standard model is charcoal black in color, but a gold colored one is available in the key of C only. A variant of the CX-12, the CX-12 Jazz, has slightly different outer body features for better ergonomics, a red and gold colored housing, and higher reed offsets which aid in better tone for jazz harmonica players. The Meisterklasse chromatic is a very high-end model (7565). It’s Hohner’s premium 14-hole chromatic (56 notes). Like its diatonic sibling, it features an anodized aluminum comb, and chrome-plated brass cover plates and mouthpiece. https://www.hohner.de/fileadmin/documents/instruments/harmonicas/hohner- harmonicas-catalog.pdf The cover plates extend the length of the comb. Essentially, it looks like a bigger version of the original diatonic Meisterklasse introduced in the 1980s (but which was later revised for the MS series reed plates). ===Tremolo=== On tremolo harmonicas each channel has two reeds for each note, i.e. one pair for blown notes and another pair for drawn ones, each pair tuned slightly apart from one another to produce a tremolo sound. The most popular models are either single-sided or double-sided Echo harps, but the single-sided ones can be combined into quadruple or sextuple 'corncob' setups, with a different key on each row. ===Chord=== The Chord Harmonica consists of two harmonicas hinged together. Together, they are capable of playing 48 chords. They are 23 inches long, and each chord takes up 4 holes. The chord harmonica is used to provide chordal and rhythmic backing in an ensemble, much as rhythm guitar might do. Jerry Murad's Harmonicat's 1947 \\"Peg O' My Heart\\" was played on a Chord, with a cleverly arranged sequence of chords that produced the impression of a melody. Hohner's main Chord is known as the Hohner 48, because it plays 48 chords. Hohner from the 1930s to the late 1960s also produced the Polyphonia No. 8, which played 36 blow-only chords, in three rows. The concept failed and is often frowned upon by professional 48 chord players. ===Polyphonia and Chromatica=== Another form of harmonica is the Chromatica and Polyphonia harmonica. Basically identical in design, the Polyphonia (often shortened to \\"Poly\\") and Chromatica harmonicas have all notes in a row in chromatic scale, side by side. ===150th anniversary and beyond=== 150 Anniversary Gold 42 of 150 For Hohner's 150th anniversary in 2007, the company began manufacturing Limited Edition Diatonic harmonicas all tuned to the key of C major only. * Gold limited to 150 pieces. * Chrome limited to 1,857 pieces. * Standard Edition The \\"Gold Edition\\" harmonica is based upon the MS reed plates. It features a crystal glass comb and engraved gold-plated cover plates. The bottom cover plate has the serial numbers from 1 to 150. It is packaged in a leather case with an anniversary booklet. The \\"Chrome Edition\\" harmonica is also based upon the MS reed plates. Featuring a crystal glass comb and specially engraved chrome-plated anniversary cover plates. The bottom cover plate has the serial numbers from 1 to 1857. It is also packaged with an anniversary booklet. The \\"Standard Edition\\" model features a clear acrylic comb and the top cover plate is specially engraved. The \\"Standard Edition\\" model is presented in 12 piece wooden anniversary boxes. ==Artist series harmonicas== Hohner has several harmonicas designed by several famous harmonica players. ===Larry Adler=== Classical harmonica player Larry Adler had his own harmonica series, still produced by the company, which were chromatic with either 12 or 16 holes. ===Toots Thielemans=== Jazz player Toots Thielemans also has a chromatic harmonica line with two types being Mellow Tone (for classical material) and Hard Bopper (for contemporary material). ===Stevie Wonder=== Stevie Wonder, plays both Hohner the 64 Chromonica and Super 64 with four-octave range on all his records since the 1960s. Besides Toots he's the most copied player worldwide. ===Steven Tyler=== Aerosmith's front man Steven Tyler has two types of diatonic harmonica(s). An Artist Series and a Signature Series with the latter being more expensive. ===Bob Dylan=== folk musician Bob Dylan also has a Signature Series diatonic harmonica as well as a Collection which features seven harmonicas. ==Accordions== The Hohner Electravox is an electronic accordion made in the late 1960s and early 1970s, which has one channel (combined left hand and right hand) or two channel (separate left hand and right hand channels, which enables independent volume changes), 92 bass/chord buttons, keyboard percussion effect for the bass buttons and keyboard, a vibrato effect (with slow/fast options), and a separate power supply unit, which sits on the floor. The Electravox had 16', 8', 5 1/3', and 4' registers. The tuning for the Electravox could be changed to match another instrument, such as a piano or organ, but this required changing all 12 master tone generators with a special tool. == Notable Hohner players == A number of early blues harmonica players throughout the 20th century have been known for using Hohner Marine Band harmonicas because they were the most available at the time. However, as other harmonica companies began to expand and Hohner produced different types of harmonicas, harmonica players started to develop preferences. *Carlos del Junco – The blues harmonica player is noted for playing a Golden Melody like his mentor Howard Levy. *Howard Levy – The multigenre harmonica player is noted for playing several different brands but says the Golden Melody is his favorite. *Jerry Portnoy – The blues harmonica player is primarily a Hohner Marine Band Crossover player since it came out and has given it much praise. He has played with artists such as Bonnie Raitt, Eric Clapton, Muddy Waters, as well as others. *John Popper – The lead singer of the jam band Blues Traveler is noted for playing a Special 20. *Brandon Santini - The blues, roots-rock harmonica player and vocalist is endorsed by Hohner and plays Hohner Special 20 and Hohner Rocket harmonicas. *John Sebastian, Sr. – The late classical harmonica virtuoso was noted for playing a 64 Chromonica. He also worked on improvements to its lower register as a consultant for Hohner.Field, Kim. Harmonicas, Harps and Heavy Breathers: The Evolution of the People's Instrument. Cooper Square Press, 2000 (updated edition), p. 291. . *John Sebastian – The folk, rock and blues harmonica player has primarily played both Hohner Meisterklasse and Marine Band harmonicas, sometimes with customizations. *Neil Young – The rock, country and folk harmonica player is known to play a Hohner Marine Band in the key of G. ==References== ==External links== * Official website * NAMM Oral History Interview with Past President, Horst Mucha (2004) * The Harmonica Company - Worldwide Hohner Harmonicas Retailer * Category:Musical instrument manufacturing companies of Germany Category:Harmonica manufacturers Category:Guitar manufacturing companies Category:Companies based in Baden- Württemberg Category:Mandolin makers ","title":"Hohner"},{"id":"1279488","text":"Rue Sursock, Achrafieh Modern buildings in Achrafieh Sassine Square, the heart of Achrafieh Achrafieh () is one of the oldest districts of Beirut, Lebanon. ==Overview== Achrafieh is located in eastern Beirut. It is the name of a district and a sector, or neighbourhood, within that district. It is essentially a residential area characterized by narrow winding streets, coffee shops and prestigious large apartment and office buildings. It is a prime location for investment and tourism. Prominent locations and popular sights in the area include: Sassine Square, an important political, social and commercial focal points of the Lebanese capital; St Nicolas (where important buildings include the Sursock House, Sursock Museum, the Sofil Center and the Ivory building); and Tabaris Square/ Abdel Wahab (among its important buildings: 812 Tabaris, Achrafieh Tower, Yared buildings, Metropolis, L'Hermitage, Sight II, Achrafieh Heights, Fayad Buildings, Fal Towers, Gebeily Building, Asmar Buildings, Samaha Buildings, Jardins de Tabaris, Saab Buildings, Tilal Beirut). During Lebanon's 1975-1990 Civil War, a substantial portion of Achrafieh's architectural heritage was wiped out. Even now, and despite efforts by non-profit organisations, demolition teams continue to tear down old houses and bulldoze hundred-year-old gardens in Achrafieh and surrounding neighbourhoods in east as well as west Beirut to make way for new towers. Modern skyscrapers are replacing these old mansions, overshadowing the few heritage sites left. Sodeco Square in Achrafieh's Nasra (Nazareth) neighbourhood is home to Lebanon's tallest tower, Sama Beirut. A new bill however was passed in 2017 by the Lebanese government to protect heritage sites around the city, marking a historical turning point for activists who have pressed for legislative action since the end of the war. During the Lebanese Civil War Achrafieh became a major strategic base for Christian forces. Large numbers of Lebanese Forces militiamen were stationed there, led by former Lebanese president Bachir Gemayel, and as such formed part of Christian East Beirut.

It was composed of a series of urban settlements and satellite villages (suburbs) linked together by loose trading networks. The largest city was Cahokia, believed to be a major religious center. The Mississippian way of life began to develop in the Mississippi River Valley (for which it is named). Cultures in the tributary Tennessee River Valley may have also begun to develop Mississippian characteristics at this point. Almost all dated Mississippian sites predate 1539–1540 (when Hernando de Soto explored the area), with notable exceptions being Natchez communities that maintained Mississippian cultural practices into the 18th century.Barnett, Jim. \\"The Natchez Indians\\". Mississippi History Now. Retrieved 1 Oct 2013. ==Cultural traits== sacrificial head, based on a repoussé copper plate Mississippian copper plates Birdman burial at Cahokia. Mass grave burial at Cahokia of fifty-three sacrificed Native American women Rose Mound, Cross County, Arkansas, U.S., 1400-1600 CE, 8\\" (20 cm) high A number of cultural traits are recognized as being characteristic of the Mississippians. Although not all Mississippian peoples practiced all of the following activities, they were distinct from their ancestors in the adoption of some or all of these traits. #The construction of large, truncated earthwork pyramid mounds, or platform mounds. Such mounds were usually square, rectangular, or occasionally circular. Structures (domestic houses, temples, burial buildings, or other) were usually constructed atop such mounds. #Maize-based agriculture. In most places, the development of Mississippian culture coincided with the adoption of comparatively large-scale, intensive maize agriculture, which supported larger populations and craft specialization. #Shell-tempered pottery. The adoption and use of riverine (or more rarely marine) shells as tempering agents in ceramics. #Widespread trade networks extending as far west as the Rocky Mountains, north to the Great Lakes, south to the Gulf of Mexico, and east to the Atlantic Ocean. #The development of the chiefdom or complex chiefdom level of social complexity. #The development of institutionalized social inequality. #A centralization of control of combined political and religious power in the hands of few or one. #The beginnings of a settlement hierarchy, in which one major center (with mounds) has clear influence or control over a number of lesser communities, which may or may not possess a smaller number of mounds. #The adoption of the paraphernalia of the Southeastern Ceremonial Complex (SECC), also called the Southern Cult. This is the belief system of the Mississippians as we know it. SECC items are found in Mississippian-culture sites from Wisconsin (see Aztalan State Park) to the Gulf Coast, and from Florida to Arkansas and Oklahoma. The SECC was frequently tied into ritual game-playing, as with chunkey. The Mississippians had no writing system or stone architecture. They worked naturally occurring metal deposits, such as hammering and annealing copper for ritual objects such as Mississippian copper plates and other decorations, but did not smelt iron or practice bronze metallurgy. ==Chronology== The Mississippi stage is usually divided into three or more chronological periods. Each period is an arbitrary historical distinction varying regionally. At a particular site, each period may be considered to begin earlier or later, depending on the speed of adoption or development of given Mississippian traits. The \\"Mississippi period\\" should not be confused with the \\"Mississippian culture\\". The Mississippi period is the chronological stage, while Mississippian culture refers to the cultural similarities that characterize this society. *The Early Mississippi period (c. 1000–1200 CE) had just transitioned from the Late Woodland period way of life (500–1000). Different groups abandoned tribal lifeways for increasing complexity, sedentism, centralization, and agriculture. Production of surplus corn and attractions of the regional chiefdoms led to rapid population concentrations in major centers. *The Middle Mississippi period (c. 1200–1400) is the apex of the Mississippi era. The expansion of the great metropolis and ceremonial complex at Cahokia (in present-day Illinois), the formation of other complex chiefdoms, and the spread and development of SECC art and symbolism are characteristic changes of this period. The Mississippian traits listed above came to be widespread throughout the region. *The Late Mississippi period (c. 1400–1540) is characterized by increasing warfare, political turmoil, and population movement. The population of Cahokia dispersed early in this period (1350–1400), perhaps migrating to other rising political centers. More defensive structures are often seen at sites, and sometimes a decline in mound-building and large-scale, public ceremonialism. Although some areas continued an essentially Middle Mississippian culture until the first significant contact with Europeans, the population of most areas had dispersed or were experiencing severe social stress by 1500.Pauketat, Timothy R. (2003) \\"Resettled Farmers and the Making of a Mississippian Polity,\\" American Antiquity Vol. 68 No. 1.Pauketat, Timothy R. (1998) \\"Refiguring the Archaeology of Greater Cahokia,\\" Journal of Archaeological Research Vol. 6 No. 1Sullivan, Lynne P., Archaeology of the Appalachian Highlands, University of Tennessee Press, 2001 . Along with the contemporaneous Ancestral Pueblo peoples, these cultural collapses coincide with the global climate change of the Little Ice Age. Scholars theorize drought and the reduction of maize agriculture, together with possible deforestation and overhunting by the concentrated populations, forced them to move away from major sites. This period ended with European contact in the 16th century. ==Regional variations== ===Middle Mississippian=== Aztalan site of the Oneota region in an exhibit at the Wisconsin Historical Museum A mound diagram of the Mississippian cultural period showing the multiple layers of mound construction, mound structures such as temples or mortuaries, ramps with log stairs, and prior structures under later layers, multiple terraces, and intrusive burials. Cahokia, the largest Mississippian culture site Kincaid, showing its platform mounds and encircling palisade The term Middle Mississippian is also used to describe the core of the classic Mississippian culture area. This area covers the central Mississippi River Valley, the lower Ohio River Valley, and most of the Mid-South area, including western and central Kentucky, western Tennessee, and northern Alabama and Mississippi. Sites in this area often contain large ceremonial platform mounds, residential complexes and are often encircled by earthen ditches and ramparts or palisades. Middle Mississippian cultures, especially the Cahokia polity located near East St. Louis, Illinois, was very influential on neighboring societies. High-status artifacts, including stone statuary and elite pottery associated with Cahokia, have been found far outside of the Middle Mississippian area. These items, especially the pottery, were also copied by local artists. *Cahokia: The largest and most complex Mississippian site and the largest Pre-Columbian settlement north of Mexico, Cahokia is considered to have been the most influential of the Mississippian culture centers. Discoveries found at the massive site include evidence of copper working (Mound 34), astronomy (Cahokia Woodhenge and the symbolic maximum southern moon rise aligned Rattlesnake Causeway), and ritual retainer burials (Mound 72). *Angel Mounds: A chiefdom in southern Indiana near Evansville. It is thought by some archaeologists that the Late Mississippian Caborn-Welborn culture developed from the Angel Phase people around 1400 CE and lasted to around 1700 CE. *Kincaid Site: A major Mississippian mound center in southern Illinois across the Ohio River from Paducah, Kentucky. *Moundville: Ranked with Cahokia as one of the two most important sites at the core of the Mississippian culture, located near Tuscaloosa, Alabama. *The Parkin Site: The type site for the \\"Parkin phase\\", an expression of Late Mississippian culture, believed by many archaeologists to be the province of Casqui visited by Hernando de Soto in 1542. ===South Appalachian Mississippian=== Stone effigies found at the Etowah Site The term South Appalachian Province was originally used by W. H. Holmes in 1903 to describe a regional ceramic style in the southeast involving surface decorations applied with a carved wooden paddle. By the late 1960s, archaeological investigations had shown the similarity of the culture that produced the pottery and the midwestern Mississippian pattern defined in 1937 by the Midwestern Taxonomic System. In 1967 James B. Griffin coined 'South Appalachian Mississippian' to describe the evolving understanding of the peoples of the Southeast. South Appalachian Mississippian area sites are distributed across a contiguous area including Alabama, Georgia, northern Florida, South Carolina, central and western North Carolina, and Tennessee. Chronologically this area became influenced by Mississippian culture later than the Middle Mississippian area (about 1000 CE as compared to 800 CE) to its northwest. It is believed that the peoples of this area adopted Mississippian traits from their northwestern neighbors. Typical settlements were located on riverine floodplains and included villages with defensive palisades enclosing platform mounds and residential areas. Etowah and Ocmulgee are prominent examples of the South Appalachian Mississippian settlements. ===Caddoan Mississippian=== Map of the Caddoan Mississippian culture Spiro, in eastern Oklahoma The Caddoan Mississippian area, a regional variant of the Mississippian culture, covered a large territory, including what is now eastern Oklahoma, western Arkansas, northeastern Texas, and northwestern Louisiana. Archaeological evidence has led to a scholarly consensus that the cultural continuity is unbroken from prehistory to the present, and that the Caddo and related Caddo language speakers in prehistoric times and at first European contact are the direct ancestors of the modern Caddo Nation of Oklahoma. The climate in this area was drier than areas in the eastern woodlands, hindering maize production, and the lower population on the plains to the west may have meant fewer neighboring competing chiefdoms to contend with. Major sites such as Spiro and the Battle Mound Site are in the Arkansas River and Red River Valleys, the largest and most fertile of the waterways in the Caddoan region, where maize agriculture would have been the most productive. The sites generally lacked wooden palisade fortifications often found in the major Middle Mississippian towns. Living on the western edge of the Mississippian world, the Caddoans may have faced fewer military threats from their neighbors. Their societies may also have had a somewhat lower level of social stratification. The Caddoan people were speakers of one of the many Caddoan languages. The Caddoan languages once had a broad geographic distribution, but many are now extinct. The modern languages in the Caddoan family include Caddo and Pawnee, now spoken mainly by elderly people. Hernando de Soto led an expedition into the area in the early 1540s, he encountered several native groups now thought to have been Caddoan. Composed of many tribes, the Caddo were organized into three confederacies, the Hasinai, Kadohadacho, and Natchitoches, which were all linked by their similar languages. ===Plaquemine Mississippian=== Map showing the geographical extent of the Plaquemine culture and some of its major sites The Plaquemine culture was an archaeological culture in the lower Mississippi River Valley in western Mississippi and eastern Louisiana. Good examples of this culture are the Medora Site (the type site for the culture and period) in West Baton Rouge Parish, Louisiana, and the Anna, Emerald Mound, Winterville and Holly Bluff sites located in Mississippi. Plaquemine culture was contemporaneous with the Middle Mississippian culture at the Cahokia site near St. Louis, Missouri. It is considered ancestral to the Natchez and Taensa Peoples. *Emerald Mound: A Plaquemine Mississippian period archaeological site located on the Natchez Trace Parkway near Stanton, Mississippi. The site dates from the period between 1200 and 1730. The platform mound is the second-largest Pre-Columbian earthwork in the country, after Monks Mound at Cahokia. *Grand Village of the Natchez: The main village of the Natchez people, with three mounds. The only mound site to be used and maintained into historic times. ==Known Mississippian settlements== Although the Mississippian culture was heavily disrupted before a complete understanding of the political landscape was written down, many Mississippian political bodies were documented and others have been discovered by research. ==Related modern nations== Mississippian peoples were almost certainly ancestral to the majority of the American Indian nations living in this region in the historic era. The historic and modern day American Indian nations believed to have descended from the overarching Mississippian Culture include: the Alabama, Apalachee, Caddo, Chickasaw, Catawba, Choctaw, Muscogee Creek, Guale, Hitchiti, Ho-Chunk, Houma, Kansa, Missouria, Mobilian, Natchez, Osage, Quapaw, Seminole, Tunica-Biloxi, Yamasee, and Yuchi. ==Contact with Europeans== A map showing the de Soto route through the Southeast Scholars have studied the records of Hernando de Soto's expedition of 1539–1543 to learn of his contacts with Mississippians, as he traveled through their villages of the Southeast. He visited many villages, in some cases staying for a month or longer. The list of sites and peoples visited by the Hernando de Soto Expedition chronicles those villages. Some encounters were violent, while others were relatively peaceful. In some cases, de Soto seems to have been used as a tool or ally in long-standing native feuds. In one example, de Soto negotiated a truce between the Pacaha and the Casqui. De Soto's later encounters left about half of the Spaniards and perhaps many hundreds of Native Americans dead. The chronicles of de Soto are among the first documents written about Mississippian peoples and are an invaluable source of information on their cultural practices. The chronicles of the Narváez expedition were written before the de Soto expedition; the Narváez expedition informed the Court of de Soto about the New World. After the destruction and flight of the de Soto expedition, the Mississippian peoples continued their way of life with little direct European influence. Indirectly, however, European introductions dramatically changed these native societies. Because the natives lacked immunity to infectious diseases unknowingly carried by the Europeans, such as measles and smallpox, epidemics caused so many fatalities that they undermined the social order of many chiefdoms. Some groups adopted European horses and changed to nomadism.Bense pp. 256–257, 275–279 Political structures collapsed in many places. At Joara, near Morganton, North Carolina, Native Americans of the Mississippian culture interacted with Spanish colonizers of the Juan Pardo expedition, who built a base there in 1567 called Fort San Juan. Expedition documentation and archaeological evidence of the fort and Native American culture both exist. The soldiers were at the fort about 18 months (1567–1568) before the natives killed them and destroyed the fort. (They killed soldiers stationed at five other forts as well; only one man of 120 survived.) Sixteenth-century Spanish artifacts have been recovered from the site, marking the first European colonization in the interior of what became the United States.Constance E. Richards, \\"Contact and Conflict\\", American Archaeologist, Spring 2004, accessed 26 Jun 2008 By the time more documentary accounts were being written, the Mississippian way of life had changed irrevocably. Some groups maintained an oral tradition link to their mound-building past, such as the late 19th- century Cherokee.Hudson pp. 334 Other Native American groups, having migrated many hundreds of miles and lost their elders to diseases, did not know their ancestors had built the mounds dotting the landscape. This contributed to the myth of the Mound Builders as a people distinct from Native Americans, which was rigorously debunked by Cyrus Thomas in 1894. ==See also== * List of Mississippian sites * List of burial mounds in the United States * Ocmulgee Mounds National Historical Park * Southeastern Ceremonial Complex ==Notes== ==References== * Bense, Judith A.

During the Burundian Civil War, the CNDD–FDD was the most significant rebel group active and became a major political party in Burundi. In March 2012, Pascal Nyabenda was elected as President of CNDD–FDD. Then on 20 August 2016, General Évariste Ndayishimiye was, in the extraordinary congress that took place in Gitega, elected as the Secretary General of the Party. During the civil war, CNDD was the political wing of the organization, while the FDD was the military wing. It was founded in 1994, a year after the assassination of the first democratically elected President Melchior Ndadaye. The political wing was dominated by Hutu intellectuals from the southern region of Bururi led by Leonard Nyangoma, while the fighting wing was composed of troops drawn from throughout the country, which led to a split in the group in 2001. The rebel group was often referred to simply as Forces for the Defense of Democracy (FDD). In 2001, the CNDD- FDD consisted of about 25,000 rebels led by Jean- Bosco Ndayikengurukiye. However a schism in October 2001 led to the overthrow of Ndayikengurukiye by Pierre Nkurunziza. The Nkurunziza-led faction, consisting of 20,000 to 22,000 troops signed a ceasefire with the government in December 2002 but continued fighting. The faction led by Ndayikengurukiye became the lesser of the two with about 5,000 fighters. It also signed a ceasefire with the government in October 2002 to which it has roughly held. At an official ceremony on January 2005, the group registered as a legal political party. In largely peaceful parliamentary elections on 4 July 2005, the CNDD won an estimated 60 to 80 percent of the vote, making it likely that a CNDD representative would be chosen the president in August. Pierre Nkurunziza indeed was elected President of Burundi unopposed on August 19. At the legislative elections, the party won 57.8% and 64 out of 118 seats. CNDD–FDD's youth wing is led by Hon Sylvestre Ndayizeye. In June 2020, Nkurunziza died while still serving as President of Burundi and was succeeded by Ndayishimiye.

After batting .325 and .377 in two minor league seasons, he was called up to Cincinnati in 1947 and became the Reds' starting first baseman at the end of . ===Major League Baseball=== ====Cincinnati Reds / Cincinnati Redlegs (1954–1957)==== Soon after the , Kluszewski joined the Reds in 1947, he cut off the sleeves of his uniform, much to the chagrin of the Reds' front office, an action he took because the tight sleeves constricted his large biceps and shoulders and interfered with his swing. \\"They got pretty upset, but it was either that or change my swing—and I wasn't about to change my swing\\", said Kluszewski. Kluszewski became notorious for his strength; Hall of Fame manager Leo Durocher was asked to name five of the strongest players in baseball; he complied. When it was pointed out that he had left Ted Kluszewski off his list, Durocher said: \\"Kluszewski? I'm talking about human beings!\\" Kluszewski showing his famous short sleeves Kluszewski was named to the National League All-Star roster from 1953 through 1956, and was a career .298 hitter with 279 home runs and 1,028 RBI in 1,718 games. In ten of his fifteen major league seasons, Kluszewski walked (492) more often than he struck out (365). In 1955, he hit 47 homers while striking out 40 times. No player since has hit 40 homers and struck out 40 or fewer times in the same season (Barry Bonds missed duplicating this feat by one strikeout in 2004). Defensively, in 1,479 games at first base, he compiled a career .993 fielding percentage. \\"Big Klu\\" enjoyed his most productive years from through , tallying a total of 171 home runs in that span. He had more home runs than strikeouts each of those four years, the only player in major league history to hit 35 or more homers in four seasons in which he had fewer strikeouts than home runs. Only three other major league ballplayers have done this even twice: Lou Gehrig, Joe DiMaggio and Johnny Mize. He also drove in over 100 base runners each year in that four-year span, including a league-leading 141 RBIs in . Kluszewski hit over .300 seven times while with the Reds, finishing in the top ten in the league in batting average each of those years. Kluszewski also led National League first basemen in fielding percentage five straight years (1951–1955), a major league record. When he left the Reds after the 1957 season, he was considered to have been the greatest left-handed hitter and one of the best fielding first baseman in club history.Cincinnati Reds history si te http://cincinnati.reds.mlb.com/cin/history/retired_numbers.jsp Kluszewski's injuries had begun taking their toll; Kluszewski was limited to playing just four full seasons in his 15-year career and would eventually spend his last four major league seasons after he left the Reds as a part-time player. His Reds uniform number 18 was retired by the Reds in 1998. ====Pittsburgh Pirates (1958–1959)==== He was traded to the Pittsburgh Pirates before the season. In 1958, he played in 100 games for the Pirates and hit .292 with 88 hits and 37 RBIs. In , he played in 60 games for the Pirates before he was traded in August to the Chicago White Sox, who were in a close pennant race. ====Chicago White Sox (1959–1960)==== On August 25, 1959, his trade to the White Sox for two players gave manager Al López's first place White Sox team the much needed additional hitting power to help the Sox win the American League Pennant. The White Sox faced the Los Angeles Dodgers in the World Series. In the series first game at Chicago's Comiskey Park, Kluszewski, who had grown up in the Chicago area, hit two home runs and drove in five in an 11–0 rout of the Dodgers. However, the Dodgers would win four of the next five games to win the series with pitching that neutralized many of the Sox players. Kluszewski hit a high .391 with 3 HR and 10 RBI in the series. Automobile mogul Jim Moran offered a free car to any White Sox player who hit a home run in that World Series. As he recalled in an Oct. 21, 2005 interview with Mike Downey of the Chicago Tribune, Moran ended up giving Kluszewski three original 1960 Ford Falcons. During that '59 season, Sox owner Bill Veeck introduced, for the first time in the major leagues, a team uniform with the player's last name on the back of the jersey. During a road trip to New York, Ted Kluszewski became the first player to appear in a game with his name misspelled, with a backwards \\"z\\" and an \\"x\\" instead of the second \\"k\\". When Major League Baseball expanded in , Kluszewski was left unprotected in the expansion draft and was selected by the Los Angeles Angels. ====Los Angeles Angels (1961)==== In , Kluszewski played his final season hampered by back and leg problems. On April 11, the season's opening day and playing against the Baltimore Orioles at Memorial Stadium, he belted two home runs for the Angels off Milt Pappas as the Angels defeated the Orioles, 7–2. He finished the season hitting .243 with 15 home runs and 39 RBIs in 107 games. ==Post playing career and death== After retiring as a player, Kluszewski was a hitting coach under Sparky Anderson with the Cincinnati Reds and their outstanding teams in the 1970s. In , he became the Reds' minor league hitting instructor, a position he held until , when he suffered a massive heart attack and underwent emergency bypass surgery. He retired afterward. Kluszewski died from another heart attack on March 29, in Cincinnati at age 63. ==MLB highlights and records== ===Highlights=== * NL All-Star (1953, 1954, 1955, 1956) * NL leader in home runs (1954) * NL leader in RBIs (1954) * NL leader in hits (1955) * NL leader in putouts as first baseman (1951, 1955) * NL leader in fielding average as first baseman (1951, 1952, 1953, 1954, 1955) * AL pennant team (1959) ===Records=== * MLB: 3 home runs by 3 team members in single game, in a single season (1956): ** : Tommy Brown, Roy Campanella, and Duke Snider of the Brooklyn Dodgers ** : Gus Bell, Ted Kluszewski, and Bob Thurman of the Cincinnati Reds ** : Joe Carter, Brook Jacoby, and Cory Snyder of the Cleveland Indians * NL: 5-time leader in fielding average as first baseman (1951–1955) * NL: 17 consecutive games scoring runs () ==Other honors and recognitions== : Ted Kluszewski is inducted into the Cincinnati Reds Hall of Fame and Museum. 1974: Ted Kluszewski was inducted into the National Polish- American Sports Hall of Fame. 1976: Esquire magazine article by sportswriter Harry Stein featured an \\"ALL Time All-Star Argument Starter\\" consisting of five ethnic baseball teams.

The vast majority of citizens are Sunni Muslims belonging to Maliki school of jurisprudence, with a minority of Ibadi, most of whom live in the M'zab Valley region. Islam provides the society with its central social and cultural identity and gives most individuals their basic ethical and attitudinal orientation. Orthodox observance of the faith is much less widespread and steadfast than is identification with Islam. There are also Sufi philosophies which arose as a reaction to theoretical perspectives of some scholars. ==History== ===Arrival of Islam=== : See: Medieval Muslim Algeria Islam was first brought to Algeria by the Umayyad dynasty following the invasion of Uqba ibn Nafi, in a drawn-out process of conquest and conversion stretching from 670 to 711. The native Berbers were rapidly converted in large numbers, although some Christian and probably pagan communities would remain at least until Almoravid times. However, as in the Middle East itself, they sought to combine their new Islam with resistance to the Caliphate's foreign rule - a niche which the Kharijite and Shiite \\"heresies\\" filled perfectly. By the late 8th century, most of Algeria was ruled by the Rustamids, who professed the strictly puritanical but politically moderate Ibadhi sect and saw the Caliphs as immoral usurpers. They were destroyed by the Shia Fatimids in 909, but their doctrine was re- established further south by refugees whose descendants would ultimately found the towns of the M'zab valley in the Algerian Sahara, where Ibadhism still dominates. Though it convinced the Kutama of Kabylie, the Fatimids' Ismaili doctrine remained unpopular in most of North Africa, and the Fatimids themselves abandoned Algeria for Egypt as soon as they could, leaving North Africa to a dynasty only nominally subject to them, the Zirids. With the political threat of the Abbasid Caliphate gone, these soon reverted to Sunni Islam - specifically, the Maliki branch, whose popularity had spread widely in the Maghreb. The Fatimids took their revenge by sending the Bedouin Banu Hilal to wreak havoc on the region, but were incapable of controlling it; Shiism rapidly dwindled, and became virtually non-existent in the area. The Almohads were zealously orthodox, and under their rule Algeria gradually acquired its notable religious homogeneity. Sunni Islam and the Maliki madhhab became virtually universal, apart from the Ibadhis of the M'zab and small Jewish communities. Islam took longer to spread to the far south of Algeria, whose history is to a large extent separate: only in the 15th century were the Tuareg finally converted to Islam. During the Regency period, unlike the Maliki Algerian masses, the Ottoman-Algerians remained affiliated with the Hanifi school of Islamic jurisprudence. The judicial system was headed by one mufti for each of the Madhhabs represented in the Regency. Major towns had both Hanafi and Maliki mosques, while the Ibadi community had their own mosques and, especially, cemeteries. The dual Hanafi/Maliki system was maintained under French colonial regime. ===French colonization=== In 1830, the French conquered Algiers. Their attempts to rule the rest of the country met stiff opposition, often religiously inspired: the Sufi warrior Amir Abd al-Qadir was particularly notable for his campaign to keep the French out. Even after his defeat, rebellions continued to be mounted until at least 1870, notably that of Cheikh Mokrani; again, a religious motivation was notable in most, though not all, of these. Soon after arriving in Algeria, the French colonial regime set about undermining traditional Muslim Algerian culture. By French law Muslims could not hold public meetings, carry firearms, or leave their homes or villages without permission. Legally, they were French subjects, but to become French citizens, with full rights, they had to renounce Islamic law. Few did so. The land of Islamic charitable trusts (habus) was regarded as government property and confiscated. Much of the network of traditional Qur'anic schools and zaouias - regarded with suspicion as centers of potential resistance - collapsed, and the literacy rate fell. However, the emergence of the religious scholar and reformer Abdelhamid Ben Badis would go some way to reversing these trends. Beginning in the 1910s, he preached against the traditional marabouts and the saint cults, they believed in voodoo dolls, and urged the importance of Arabic and Islamic education; his disciples founded an extensive network of schools, and rapidly brought the saint cults into widespread disrepute, making Algerian Islam substantially more orthodox. While in Islam, a Muslim society subject to non-Muslim rulers is acceptable (see Qur'an)\\"\\"which verse\\"\\", the discrimination against Islam led it to be a strong element of the resistance movement to the French in the Algerian War of Independence. The independence fighters were termed moudjahidine - practicers of jihad - and its fallen are called chouhada, martyrs, despite the revolution's avowed socialism; even during the revolution, the FLN made symbolic efforts to impose Islamic principles, such as banning wine and prostitution. ===After independence=== After independence the Algerian government asserted state control over religious activities for purposes of national consolidation and political control. Islam became the religion of the state in the new constitution (Article 2), and was the religion of its leaders. The state monopolized the building of mosques, and the Ministry of Religious Affairs controlled an estimated 5,000 public mosques by the mid-1980s. Imams were trained, appointed, and paid by the state, and the Friday khutba, or sermon, was issued to them by the Ministry of Religious Affairs. That ministry also administered religious property (the habus), provided for religious education and training in schools, and created special institutes for Islamic learning. Islamic law (sharia) principles were introduced into family law in particular, while remaining absent from most of the legal code; thus, for example, while Muslim women were banned from marrying non-Muslims (by the Algerian Family Code of 1984), wine remained legal. Those measures, however, did not satisfy everyone. As early as 1964 a militant Islamic movement, called Al Qiyam (values), emerged and became the precursor of the Islamic Salvation Front (Islamist party) of the 1990s. Al Qiyam called for a more dominant role for Islam in Algeria's legal and political systems and opposed what it saw as Western practices in the social and cultural life of Algerians. This proved to be the most difficult challenge for the immediate post-independent regimes as they tried to incorporate an Islamic national identity alongside socialist policies. Whereas the new leaders of Algeria saw Islam and Socialism as both compatible and features of Algerian culture and society; radical Islamists saw Islam as the only defining characteristic and in fact incompatible.Dr Jonathan N.C. Hill (2006) Identity and instability in postcolonial Algeria, The Journal of North African Studies, 11:1, 1-16, DOI: 10.1080/13629380500409735 Houari Boumediene largely contained militant Islamism during his reign, although it remained throughout the 1970s under a different name and with a new organization. Following Boumediene's death, Chadli Bendjedid became president in 1979. Chadli's regime was much more tolerant with Islamists, and with Algeria in the midst of an socio- economic crisis including unemployment and inflation, social tensions were high. Policies of Arabization (increasing Arabic education and the use of Arabic in professional institutions) had failed to come to fruition: French remained the language of the political elite and French speaking students were prioritised for jobs.Dr Jonathan N.C. Hill (2006) Identity and instability in postcolonial Algeria, The Journal of North African Studies, 11:1, 1-16, DOI: 10.1080/13629380500409735 Thus, the movement began spreading to university campuses where it was encouraged by the state as a counterbalance to left-wing student movements. By the 1980s, the movement had become even stronger, and bloody clashes erupted at the Ben Aknoun campus of the University of Algiers in November 1982. The violence resulted in the state's cracking down on the movement, a confrontation that would intensify throughout the 1980s and early 1990s. The rise of Islamism had a significant impact on Algerian society. More women began wearing the veil, some because they had become more conservative religiously and others because the veil kept them from being harassed on the streets, on campuses, or at work. Islamists also prevented the enactment of a more liberal family code despite pressure from feminist groups and associations. After the Islamic Salvation Front (FIS) won the 1991 elections, and was then banned after the elections' cancellation by the military, the tensions between Islamists and the government erupted into open fighting, which lasted some 10 years in the course of which some 100,000 people were killed. However, some Islamist parties remained aboveground - notably the Movement of Society for Peace and Islamic Renaissance Movement - and were allowed by the government to contest later elections. In recent years, the Civil Harmony Act and Charter for Peace and National Reconciliation have been passed, providing an amnesty for most crimes committed in the course of the war. ==Practice== Sunni Islam is quasi universal, apart from the Mozabite region who are mainly Ibadhism. The dominant madhhab is Maliki. There are a few followers of the Hanafi rite among people of Turkish descent. Sufi brotherhoods have retreated considerably, but remain in some areas. Algerians have a Muslim tradition of patron saints, although it is viewed as shirk by Salafis. Sidi Abderrahmane, saint patron of Algiers, is perhaps the most notorious as numerous popular songs in Algeria mention him. ==In Politics== The popularity of Islamism fluctuates according to circumstance; in the 2002 elections, legal Islamist parties received some 20% of the seats in the National Assembly, way down from the FIS's 50% in 1991. Conversely, there is strong anti-Islamist sentiment from secular parties such as the RCD and the Algerian Workers Party. Support for Islamist parties is especially low in the Kabylie region, where the FIS obtained no seats in 1991, the majority being taken by the Front of Socialist Forces, another secular party. The recent rise of a number of radical religious movements involving Ahmadism, Salafism, Wahhabism and takfiri ideology have raised concerns among officials in the Algerian Ministry of Religious Affairs and Endowments, which has decided to take action by strengthening the monitoring and control of places targeted by the radical Islamists for recruits. ==See also== * Algerian Civil War in the 1990s * Islam by country * Religion in Algeria ==References== ==External links== * North African Islamism in the blinding light of 9-11, Hugh Roberts * The Significance of Sufism in Algeria in the aftermath of Independence Algeria Category:Religion in Algeria ","title":"Islam in Algeria"},{"id":"1279578","text":"Hayagriva, also spelt Hayagreeva (IAST: , literally 'Horse-neck'Monier- Williams Sanskrit-English Dictionary), is a horse-headed avatar of the Lord Vishnu in Hinduism. ==Hinduism== In Hinduism, Lord Hayagriva is an avatar of Lord Vishnu.

Symbolically, the story represents the triumph of pure knowledge, guided by the hand of God, over the demonic forces of passion and darkness.

Hayagriva's consort is Marichi, the goddess of the rising sun, more accurately the sun's light which is the life force of all things, and which is seen as the female aspect of Hayagriva. Marichi represents the essence of the power of creation of the cosmos. Whereas Hayagriva represents the other male aspect. In several other sources he is a white horse who pulls the sun into the sky every morning. In others such as the great epic Taraka-battle where the gods are fallen on and attacked by the Danava's [demons], Vishnu appears as a great ferocious warrior called Hayagriva when he comes to their aid. It says; “Hayagriva appears in his chariot, drawn by 1,000 powerful steeds, crushing the enemies of the gods beneath him!” Srimad Andavan and Sri Parakala Jeeyar in front of Sri Laxmi Hayagriva of Parakala Mutt There are many other references to Hayagriva throughout the Mahabharata. It is said that Vishnu comes from battle as a conqueror in the magnificent mystic form of the great and terrible Hayagriva; “The great Hayagriva having been praised in this way by the different saints and ascetics, assumes a great white horses head. The verda’s [mantras] made up his shape, his body built of all the great gods; in the middle of his head was Shiva, in his heart was Brahmā [god of heaven]; the rays of sun (Marichi) were his mane, the sun and moon his eyes; the Vasus and Sadhyas were his legs, in all his bones were the gods. Agni [Ka-ten; god of fire] was his tongue, the goddess Satya his speech, while his knees were formed by the Maruts and Varuna. Having assumed this form, an awesome wonder to behold to the gods, he vanquished the asura, and cast them down, with eyes that were red with anger.” Invariably, Hayagriva is depicted seated, most often with his right hand either blessing the supplicant or in the vyākhyā mudrā pose of teaching. The right hand also usually holds a akṣa-mālā (rosary), indicating his identification with meditative knowledge. His left holds a book, indicating his role as a teacher. His face is always serene and peaceful, if not smiling. Unlike his Buddhist counterpart, there is no hint of a fearsome side in the Hindu description of this deity. Indeed, the two deities seem to be totally unrelated to one another. Hayagriva is sometimes worshiped in a solitary pose of meditation, as in temple in Thiruvanthipuram. This form is known as Yoga- Hayagriva. However, he is most commonly worshipped along with his consort Lakshmi and is known as Lakshmi-Hayagriva. Hayagriva in this form is the presiding deity of Mysore's Parakala Mutt, a significant Sri Vaishnavism monastic institution. ===In Sakta history=== Hyagreeva restoring Vedas to Brahma which were taken to Rasatala A legend has it that during the creation, the demons Madhu-Kaitabha stole the Vedas from Brahma, and Vishnu then took the Hayagriva form to recover them. The two bodies of Madhu and Kaitabha disintegrated into twelve pieces (two heads, two, four arms and four legs). Yet another legend has it that during the creation, Vishnu compiled the Vedas in the Hayagrīva form. Some consider Hayagriva to be one of the Dashavataras of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. He along with Śrī Krishna, Shrī Rama and Shri Narasimha is considered to be an important avatar of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Lord Hayagriva is also amongst the deities present at the Ranganathaswamy Temple, Srirangam. Hayagreeva in Srirangam is very famous for children's education. The Sanctum Sanctorum of the inner temple. is very beautiful and all rituals are done according to Vedic principles very strictly. Mahabharata, book 12, chapter 348, says the following: Having compassed the destruction of the two Asuras and restored the Vedas to Brahma, the Supreme Being dispelled the grief of Brahma. Aided then by Hari and assisted by the Vedas, Brahma created all the worlds with their mobile and immobile creatures. After this, Hari, granting unto the Grandsire intelligence of the foremost order relating to the Creation, disappeared there and then for going to the place he had come from. It was thus that Narayana, having assumed the form equipped with the horse-head, slew the two Danavas Madhu and Kaitabha (and disappeared from the sight of Brahma). ==Hayagrīva Mahatmyam== A great devotee named ŚrīVadirajatirtha of Udupi Śrī Kṛṣṇa Mutt used to offer cooked horse gram (Kollu) to Lord Hayagreeva.Śrī Vadiraja's lifehistory He used to recite the Hayagrīva Śloka and keep the offerings on his head. Lord Hayagrīva would come as a beautiful white horse form and would eat the horse gram. As a very staunch devotee, Vadirajatirtha would recite the following sloka - Na HayagrivAth Param Asthi MangaLam Na HayagrivAth Param Asthi Paavanam Na HayagrivAth Param Asthi Dhaivatham Na Hayagrivam Pranipathya Seedhathi! There is no auspiciousness greater than Hayagrivan. Nothing is more sacred than Sri Hayagrivan to destroy our accumulated sins. No other God is superior to Hayagrivan. No one grieves after performing Śaraṇagati at the sacred feet of Hayagrivan. Hayagriva is listed as one of the ten incarnations of Vishnu in Canto 10 (skandh 10), chapter 40 of the Śrīmadbhagavatam, and Akrūra's prayer contains Hayagriva's name when he had a vision while bathing in Yamuna. There is a story that more than 500 years ago, a devotee from the Daivajña Brahmin community was casting an idol of Lord Gaṇapati, when it shaped itself in the image of Lord Hayagriva. Sarvabhauma Sri Vadiraja Guru Swamiji had a dream about this legend which inspired him to approach that devotee and take the idol from him in reverence. He then installed it in Shri Sode Vadiraja Mutt. Since then it has been worshipped there as the originating God of the Daivajnya Brahmin community. The members of the community who were originally Smartha Brahmins, were instructed in Dvaita philosophy and received into the fold as Mukhya Śiṣyas by the revered Sri Vadiraja Teertha. To this day, Daivajña Brahmins continue to make offerings to the Mutt and Lord Hayagriva. ==Temples of Hayagriva== Hayagreevar Temple, adjacent to Koodal Azhagar Temple ===Assam=== * Hayagriv Madhav Dol at Hajo, Assam ===Tamil Nadu=== Most of the major Vishnu temples in Tamil Nadu have a separate shrine for Lord Hayagriva. * Sri Lakshmi Hayagriva Temple, Thiruvaheendrapuram, Cuddalore, Tamil Nadu * Sri Hyagreevar Temple, adjacent to Sri Koodal Alagar Perumal Koil, Madurai * Sri Hyagreevar(ஸ்ரீ ஹயக்ரீவர்)swamy, Sri Chidambara Vinayagar Thirukoil, A.

Retrieved on 10 June 2015. \\"Agence pour l'enseignement français à l'étranger (AEFE) 23, place de Catalogne 75 014 PARIS\\" ==Curriculum== Schools are either directly managed (gestion directe), contracted (conventionné) or accredited (homologué). The schools provide an education based on the French national curriculum for pupils of various cultures from preschool through secondary school, and some receive substantial financial support from the French government. The schools provide an education leading to a baccalauréat, and students have access to all other French schools at their own educational level. In addition, the schools have a curriculum linked to the individual countries in which they are established. The Lycée Français La Pérouse and the International School of the Peninsula in San Francisco, for example, include American History and English Literature in its program, and the Lycée Français de Caracas in Venezuela includes History of Venezuela (ICV) from 6th to 9th grade. Schools are located throughout Europe, the Americas, Asia and Africa. Most of their pupils are children of French expatriates but they also include many regular pupils attracted by the quality of schooling provided. In any given academic year, around 160,000 students study in these schools. ==School Names== While there are no public guidelines for naming schools in the AEFE network, they tend to have some similarities. A school that follows the French curriculum through secondary school (high school in the United States and sixth form college in Great Britain) is often named a Lycée Français and prepares students for the French baccalauréat. Schools that combine the local and French curricula are often called French-American or Franco-Mexicain schools. Schools that offer the International Baccalaureate are often called International School or Lycée International. ==Schools operated by or receiving funding from AEFE== * Abu Dhabi, Lycée Louis-Massignon * Abu Dhabi, Lycée Français Théodore-Monod *Accra, Lycée Français Jacques Prevert d’Accra * Alicante, Lycée Français d'Alicante Pierre Deschamps * Amman, École Française d'Amman * Amsterdam, École Française Amsterdam * Andorra la Vella, Lycée Comte de Foix * Ankara, Lycée Français Charles de Gaulle, Ankara * Alexandria, Lycée Français d'Alexandrie * Asunción, Lycée Français International Marcel Pagnol * Athens, Lycée Franco-Hellénique Eugène Delacroix * Bangkok, Lycée Français International de Bangkok * Barcelona, Lycée Français de Barcelone * Beijing, Lycée Français International de Pekin * Beirut, Grand Lycée Franco-Libanais * Beirut, Lycée Franco-Libanais Verdun * Beirut, Lycée Abdel Kader * Berlin, Collège français-Lycée français * Berlin, Collège Voltaire * Berkeley, California École Bilingue de Berkeley * Bilbao, Lycee Francais de Bilbao * Bobo Dioulasso, École Française André Malraux * Bogotá, Lycée Français Louis Pasteur * Bonn, École Charles de Gaulle - Adenauer * Boston, International School of Boston * Brussels, Lycée Français Jean Monnet * Bucharest, Lycée Français Anna de Noailles Bucarest * Budapest, Gustave Eiffel French School of Budapest * Buenos Aires, Lycée Franco-Argentin Jean Mermoz * Cairo, Lycée Français du Caire * Calgary, Lycée Louis Pasteur * Cali, Colombia Lycée Français Paul Valéry de Cali * California, International School of the Peninsula * Cape Town, École François Le Vaillant * Caracas, Lycée Français de Caracas * Casablanca, Lycée Lyautey * Chicago, Lycée Français de Chicago * Concepción, Lycée français Charles de Gaulle * Conakry, Lycée français Albert Camus * Copenhagen, Lycée Français Prins Henrik * Curicó, Lycée français Jean Mermoz * Dallas, Dallas International School * Dhaka, École Française Internationale de Dacca * Doha, Lycée Français de Doha Lycée Voltaire * Douala, Lycée Français Dominique Savio * Dubai, Lycée Français Georges- Pompidou * Dubai, Lycée Français International * Dublin, Lycée Français d'Irlande * Düsseldorf, Lycée français de Düsseldorf * Guadalajara, Lycée Français de Guadalajara - Colegio Franco Mexicano * Guatemala, Lycée Jules Verne * Habbouch (Lebanon), Lycée Franco-Libanais Habbouche-Nabatieh * Frankfurt, Lycée Français Victor Hugo * Hamburg, Lycée Français Antoine de Saint-Exupéry de Hambourg * Hanoi, Lycée français Alexandre Yersin * Heidelberg, Ecole Pierre et Marie Curie Heidelberg * Hong Kong, Lycée Français International Victor Segalen * Houston, Awty International School * Islamabad, École Française Alfred Foucher * Istanbul, Lycée français Pierre Loti * Jeddah, École Française de Djeddah * Jerusalem, Lycée Français de Jérusalem * Johannesburg, Lycée français Jules Verne * Kabul, Lycée Esteqlal and Lycée Malalaï * Kiev, Lycée français Anne-de-Kiev * Košice, Lycée bilingue M.R.

It was made a technical school in 1963, and a technical college in 1975. In 1987 it became a full college with seven departments, but remained specifically a Fisheries College. The school became a university (Yosu National Fisheries University) in 1993, and changed its name to simply Yosu National University in 1998. The school began granting doctoral degrees in 1997. In March 2006, Yosu National University merged with Chonnam National University. ==See also== *List of colleges and universities in South Korea *List of Korea-related topics *Education in South Korea ==External links== *Official school website, in Korean and English Category:Defunct universities and colleges in South Korea Category:Yeosu Category:1917 establishments in Asia Category:Educational institutions established in 1917 ","title":"Yosu National University"},{"id":"1279621","text":"Providence County, Rhode Island schools ==High schools== (9th-12th grade unless otherwise noted) { border=\\"1\\" - ! width=\\"175\\"  School Name !

It was released on 2 November 1979 by Chiswick Records. == Background == The album was the group's first since reforming with a new lineup of Dave Vanian on vocals, Captain Sensible on lead guitar, Rat Scabies on drums and Algy Ward on bass guitar. On Machine Gun Etiquette, the band brought more variety to their usual punk rock to add wide-ranging pop rock. The voice at the album's start is Jack Howarth, taken from his 1971 album 'Ow Do, a recording of Lancastrian monologues. The mispronounced album name would later be used in fusion with Thee Headcoats name as the Japanese band name Thee Michelle Gun Elephant by their former bassist. == Reception == AllMusic's retrospective review reported that when it was released, Machine Gun Etiquette was \\"deservedly hailed as another classic from the band\\". The website praised the variety of styles explored and the group's typically strong wit. Scott Rowley of Classic Rock magazine, reviewing the 25th Anniversary Edition of the album, defined it as \\"a riotous, ballsy rush of an album [...] the sound of a band coming into its own\\", adding that \\"while the Clash looked to America for inspiration, the Damned remained resolutely British\\", perhaps ironically given that the front cover depicted the band in a New York street scene at 704 7th Avenue, New York City. == Track listing == == Personnel == Credits adapted from the 25th Anniversary Edition liner notes. ; The Damned * Dave Vanian – lead vocals * Captain Sensible – guitars, backing vocals, keyboards, bass (\\"I Just Can't Be Happy Today\\", \\"Smash It Up (Parts 1 & 2)\\"), bass solo (\\"Anti- Pope\\"), Mandolin (Turkey Song), lead vocals on \\"Turkey Song\\" * Rat Scabies – drums, backing vocals, lead vocals on \\"Burglar\\" * Algy Ward – bass, backing vocals, guitar (\\"Machine Gun Etiquette\\", \\"Liar\\") ; Additional personnel: * Joe Strummer – backing vocals (\\"Noise, Noise, Noise\\"), hand claps (\\"Machine Gun Etiquette\\") * Topper Headon – backing vocals (\\"Noise, Noise, Noise\\") * Henry Badowski – backing vocals (\\"Noise, Noise, Noise\\") * Paul Simonon – hand claps (\\"Machine Gun Etiquette\\") * Lemmy Kilmister – bass, backing vocals (\\"Ballroom Blitz\\") ; Production * The Damned – producer * Roger Armstrong – producer * Ed Hollis – producer (\\"Love Song (Ed Hollis Version)\\", \\"Noise, Noise, Noise (Ed Hollis Version)\\", \\"Suicide\\") * Alvin Clarke – engineer (Sound Suite) * Mike Shipley – engineer (Wessex) * Gary Edwards – engineer (Wessex) * Jeremy Green – engineer (Wessex) * Rik Watton – engineer (Workhouse) * Damian Korner – engineer (Utopia) * G.

Together with the Bracław Voivodeship it formed the region of Podolia, which in the Kingdom of Poland was part of Lesser Poland Province. Its capital was in Kamianets-Podilskyi, where local sejmiks took place and where the seat of the starosta was as well. The voivodeship was created 1434, out of former Duchy of Podolia, which had become part of the Kingdom of Poland in the second half of the 14th century. After the second partition of Poland (see: Partitions of Poland), it was seized by the Russian Empire, which in 1793 created the Podolia Governorate. Today the region belongs to Ukraine. Zygmunt Gloger in his monumental book Historical Geography of the Lands of Old Poland gives a detailed description of Podole Voivodeship: > In ancient times, Podole was a borderland of permanent Slavic settlements, > behind which were steppes, inhabited by nomadic tribes. Proximity of these > Barbaric tribes made it impossible for the Slavs to take full advantage of > Podole, which is the most beautiful and the richest of all Slavic lands > (...) For many years borders of Podole were not defined. The province was > captured by the Tatars in the 13th century. They in return were chased away > by the Lithuanians, who in the mid-14th century clashed here with Poland. > Podole was in 1352 captured by Algirdas, and in 1396 King Wladyslaw Jagiello > placed this land under Spytek of Melsztyn. Later on, Podole was ruled by > Svitrigaila, and finally in 1434 the Sejm created Podole Voivodeship, naming > Piotr Odrowaz the first voivode. Still, the Grand Duchy of Lithuania > continued to claim this land, and the conflict was ended by the 1569 Union > of Lublin (...) If it had not been for thousands of Polish szlachta > families, who since the 14th century settled here, Podole would remain a > deserted steppe (...) Boundaries of the new voivodeship were as follows: in > northwest it bordered Trembowla County of Ruthenian Voivodeship, in the > north it bordered Volhynian Voivodeship, while in the east it touched > Braclaw Voivodeship.

In its early years, Podole Voivodeship > had a number of small counties, which were located around royal castles. In > the 15th century, there were counties of Skala Podolska, Smotrycz, Bakota, > Latyczow, Miedzyboz, Chmielnik, Zinkow, and Bar. Finally, in 1542 only three > counties were established, at Czerwonogrod, Kamieniec and Latyczow (...) In > the 16th century, Podole Voivodeship had 37 towns, and according to the 1578 > census, there were 650 villages. By 1583, the number of villages was reduced > to only 434, due to constant Crimean Tatar raids. The voivodeship also had > 35 castles and forts (...) Podole Voivodeship had three senators: the > Bishop, the Voivode and the Castellan of Kamieniec.

Created in 1566 as part of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, it was passed to the Crown of Poland in 1569 following the Union of Lublin. After partitions of Poland in 1793 the voivodeship was taken by the Russian Empire and replaced with the Bratslav Viceroyalty. In 1648-57 the territory of voivodeship was a part of Cossack Hetmanate following the Khmelnytsky Uprising and Truce of Andrusovo, while in 1672-99 it became part of Ottoman Ukraine which was a vassal Ottoman Empire (see: Treaty of Buchach and Treaty of Karlowitz). ==Overview== Together with the Podole Voivodeship it formed the historical province of Podolia and part of a bigger Lesser Poland Province of the Polish Crown. Officially, the capital of the voivodeship was in Braclaw (today Bratslav), but local voivodes also resided in Winnica (Vinnytsia). It was divided into County of Braclaw and County of Winnica. The County of Braclaw itself was divided into two districts—Braclaw and Zwinogrodek (some sources claim there was a separate County of Zwinogrodek). In 1791, the Great Sejm also created Boh County (Polish: powiat nadbohski), but it was never created due to the Polish–Russian War of 1792. Braclaw Voivodeship had two senators—the Voivode and the Castellan of Braclaw. It also had six deputies to the Sejm—two from Braclaw County, two from Winnica County, and two from District of Zwinogrodek. Local sejmiks took place in Winnica. Today the region belongs to Ukraine and Transnistria in Moldova. Zygmunt Gloger in his monumental book Historical Geography of the Lands of Old Poland gives a detailed description of Braclaw Voivodeship: > After the Union of Lublin, the province of Podolia was annexed by the > Kingdom of Poland. Soon afterwards, Ukrainian Podolia, located lower than > Podole Voivodeship, between the Dniestr and the Boh rivers, was turned into > Braclaw Voivodeship. It had three castles at Braclaw, Winnica and Zwinogrod > (...) In 1570, a special royal commission was created to mark the borders of > the voivodeship. Its western boundary was marked by the Murachwa river, and > in the southeast, it was separated from Wallachia by the Dniestr. The > commission marked northern border of the voivodeship along the Black Tatar > Trail, and to settle arguments between Braclaw and Kijow Voivodeships, King > Stefan Batory in 1584 stated that boundary line was to be marked by the > Uhorski Tykicz river (...) > In the late 16th century, most of Braclaw Voivodeship was a depopulated wild > field. Political and social life existed only in the agricultural belt, > located in the immediate vicinity of royal castles. Settlers however began > to move into the desert, even along southern border of the province, in the > area called Pobereze (...) After the Union of Lublin, when Ukrainian lands > were annexed by the Crown of the Kingdom of Poland, life became more > organized, with Polish-style starostas, voivodes, nobility, sejmiks, and > courts (...) > The County of Winnica was smaller, but more populated. It had the area of > 200 sq. miles, in northwestern corner of the voivodeship, along the Boh > river. The County of Braclaw had the area of 420 sq. miles, and consisted of > two districts - Braclaw and Zwinogrod. The district of Zwinogrod covered the > desert of the Blue Waters (see also Battle of Blue Waters), but due to > destruction of the Zwinogrod Castle, it did not emerge as a separate county > (...) In 1584, Stefan Batory divided this area between Braclaw and Kijow > Voivodeship, along the Uhorski Tykicz river (...) > In 1569, first voivode of Braclaw was Prince Roman Sanguszko, while first > castellan was Knyaz Jedrzej Kapusta. In 1589 Polish Sejm ordered that all > official documents in Braclaw Voivodeship should be written in Old East > Slavic language (...) The voivodeship had two senators (the voivode and the > castellan of Braclaw), six deputies to the Sejm, and two deputies to the > Lesser Poland Tribunal at Lublin. Furthermore, like in neighbouring Podole > Voivodeship, Braclaw had its own border judges, who cooperated with > officials of the Ottoman Porte and the Crimean Khanate, solving conflicts > between citizens of the two countries (...) > In 1598 the Sejm ordered that all courts and sejmiks be moved from Braclaw > to Winnica. As a result, Winnica came to be regarded the capital of the > voivodeship. Since in the 18th century the population of the region grew, in > 1791 the Sejm created another county, called Boh County, increasing number > of deputies from the voivodeship from six to eight.

Out of all Asian Francophone nations, Cambodia is where French has declined the most. In 2014, French was spoken by people as a foreign language, which is 3% of the country's population La langue française dans le monde, 2014, Éditions Nathan, . and by only 873 people as a mother tongue according to the country's 2008 census. ==History== The French language began its presence in Cambodia in the late 20th century after French explorers and merchants made their way from Vietnam into Cambodia. In 1863, Cambodia became a protectorate of France and was incorporated into French Indochina in 1887. The French did not exert much influence on Cambodia as they did in Vietnam and Khmer still remained widely taught and spoken in Cambodia as French was only limited to politicians. It was not until the 1890s that French began to be introduced in Cambodian education, but that was only limited to elite classes and it was only until the 1910s that the masses began learning French nationwide. With the growth of revolutionary movements in Vietnam, the French did not promote education in Cambodia and literacy rates remained low. The French language's growth in Cambodia only slightly increased until the Japanese invasion of Cambodia in World War II. Under the Japanese, Khmer was also made a government language alongside French and the two were taught alongside in schools. After the war, French again became the sole official language. When Cambodia became independent in 1953, the French language continued to be widely taught and used in the government. Despite its strong presence in the government and education, French declined earlier and heavier in Cambodia than in Vietnam and Laos. Lower rates of influence and education in Cambodia meant that by the 1960s, French began to decline in Cambodia in contrast to being a government language in South Vietnam and Laos. In the mid-1970s, the Khmer Rouge came into power in Cambodia and began killing thousands of educated Cambodians, most of whom were French-educated. By the end of their reign in 1979, French had almost been completely wiped out in Cambodia. A Vietnamese invasion of Cambodia that established the People's Republic of Kampuchea reintroduced French into the nation, though ironically, French began its decline in Vietnam around this time. French continued to gain ground in Cambodia until 1993, when the present government of Cambodia took power and Khmer became the sole language of government and primary language of education. Beginning in the late 1990s, the English language became more widely taught in Cambodia and French continued its decline as English was seen as a more useful international language. Revival of the French language has gained ground much later in Cambodia than in Vietnam and Laos. In 1997, a French-language center opened in Phnom Penh and French-language education began to revive in Cambodia and dozens of Cambodian students study abroad each year in France. French is also once again, a diplomatic language of Cambodia. Communities of returned refugees from France and Quebec as well as students who have studied in Francophone nations have also added to the French-speaking population of Cambodia. ==Dialect characteristics== Cambodian French vocabulary has been influenced by Cambodian, Cantonese Chinese, and Teochew Chinese. Cambodian French is based on standard Parisian French but contains more differences from standard French than the dialects of Vietnam and Laos. ==Media== French- language media is present in Cambodia, though less so than in Vietnam and Laos. The nation boasts a French-language newspaper, Cambodge Nouveau (and had another, Cambodge Soir, until 2010), as well as French-language television channels. ==Education== The following higher education institutions are members of the Agence Universitaire de la Francophonie: *Institut de Technologie du Cambodge *National Institute of Education *Royal University of Agriculture *Royal University of Fine Arts *Royal University of Law and Economics *Royal University of Phnom Penh ==See also== *French language in Vietnam *French language in Laos *Francophonie ==References== Cambodia Category:Languages of Cambodia Category:French dialects Category:Languages attested from the 19th century ","title":"French language in Cambodia"},{"id":"1279732","text":"In linguistics, an impersonal verb is one that has no determinate subject. For example, in the sentence \\"It rains\\", rain is an impersonal verb and the pronoun it does not refer to anything. In many languages the verb takes a third person singular inflection and often appears with an expletive subject. In the active voice, impersonal verbs can be used to express operation of nature, mental distress, and acts with no reference to the do-er.Loureiro- Porto, L. (2010). A Review of Early English Impersonals: Evidence from Necessity Verbs. English Studies, 91(6), 674-699. Impersonal verbs are also called weather verbs because they frequently appear in the context of weather description.tex's French grammar. Retrieved on 12 March 2012. Also, indefinite pronouns may be called \\"impersonal\\", as they refer to an unknown person, like one or someone, and there is overlap between the use of the two. ==Valency== Impersonal verbs appear only as infinitives or with third-person inflection(s).Blevins, J. P. (2003). Passives and impersonals. Journal of Linguistics, 39(3), 473-520. In the third person, the subject is either implied or a dummy referring to people in general. The term \\"impersonal\\" simply means that the verb does not change according to grammatical person. In terms of valency, impersonal verbs are often avalent, as they often lack semantic arguments. In the sentence It rains, the pronoun it is a dummy subject; it is merely a syntactic placeholder—it has no concrete referent. In many other languages, there would be no subject at all. In Spanish, for example, It is raining could be expressed as simply llueve. ==Use in meteorological expressions== Temperature expressions (\\"it is hot\\"), weather expressions (\\"it is snowing\\"), and daylight expressions (\\"it is dark\\") tend to lack independent participants with distinct semantic roles. While snow participates in snowing, very few other types of participants can participate, and the participant is indistinguishable from the event itself; this is similar to the phenomenon of cognate objects. In addition, the participating snow is non-specific, and lacks a clear semantic role. Therefore, assigning the participating snow the role of 'referent' in the default English expression \\"it is snowing\\" would seem inappropriate. Instead, linguistics classify the \\"is snowing\\" in \\"it is snowing\\" as an impersonal verb. Meteorological expressions are often constructed with impersonal verbs in English. However, meteorological expressions are obviously not restricted solely to impersonal verbs, even in English; furthermore, different languages use different strategies for their default meteorological expressions and common idioms. In Palestinian Arabic, \\"Id-dunya ti-shti\\" translates to \\"It (the world) is raining\\" and uses a non-impersonal verb. \\"Vreme je sunčano\\", which means \\"the weather is sunny\\", is a common Serbian construction that uses a (non-impersonal) adverb rather than a verb. ==Forms== ===Invisible arguments=== When an agent is unspecified, impersonal verbs are also known as zero person construction, or impersonal construction. An implicit argument (an argument that is put forth without stating it directly) is present on a semantic level for both Estonian and Finnish. The Finnic impersonal construction enables an event or state to be described without specifying the identity of the agent (actor). Despite this, the interpretation of the impersonal includes a referent of some sort (dummy). The zero person is not entirely the same as an impersonal. Finnish :Sunnuntaina voi nukkua pitkään. : Sunday-on can.PRS.3sg sleep.INF long. Estonian :Pühapäeviti saab sisse magada. : Sundays-on can.PRS.3sg in.ILL sleep.INF : On Sundays you/one can sleep in. There is a lack of an overt nominative subject in these constructions. ===By- phrase=== Some languages require their counterpart to the English by-phrase be present (like Palauan and Indonesian, Austronesian languages). Other languages disallow the presence of a by-phrase. For example, Polish does not allow the use of a by-phrase in its passive. :Zapukano w drzwi (*przez sąsiada) : was- knocked at door (*by neighbor) : It was knocked at the door. : There was a knock at the door. The content in the parenthesis causes the Polish sentence to be ungrammatical as who did the knocking cannot be overtly stated. As such, it might seem like it would be more grammatical to use impersonal verbs in such cases. ==In various languages== In some languages such as English, French, German, Dutch and Swedish, an impersonal verb always takes an impersonal pronoun (it in English, il in French, es in German, het in Dutch, det in Swedish) as its syntactical subject: :It snowed yesterday. (English) :Il a neigé hier. (French) :Es schneite gestern. (German) :Het sneeuwde gisteren. (Dutch) :Det snöade igår. (Swedish) Occasionally an impersonal verb will allow an object to appear in apposition to the impersonal subject pronoun: :It is raining diamonds. Or as an instrumental adjunct: :It was pouring with rain. (British English) In some other languages (necessarily null subject languages and typically pro-drop languages), such as Portuguese, Spanish, Occitan, Catalan, Italian, Romanian, in Hungarian and all the Slavic languages, an impersonal verb takes no subject at all, but it is conjugated in the third-person singular, which is much as though it had a third-person, singular subject. :Nevó ayer. (Spanish) :Nevou ontem. (Portuguese) :Ha nevicato ieri. (Italian) :A nins ieri. (Romanian) :Sniježilo je jučer. (Croatian) :Havazott tegnap. (Hungarian) :Вчера вееше снег. / Včera veeše sneg. (Macedonian) Other languages, those which require a subject, may permit an adjunct to assume that role. :Unfortunately the next day poured with rain. ===Indo-European=== ====In English==== The following sentences illustrate impersonal verbs: :(1) It rains. :(2) It is cold. :(3) It is growing dark. :(4) It seems _that there is no end to this_. :(5) It is unclear _why he cut the rope_. The expletive pronoun it in these sentences does not denote a clear entity, yet the meaning is clear. In other words, the pronoun it has no clear antecedent. Impersonal Verbs. Retrieved on 12 March 2012. English is so strict about requiring a subject that it supplies them for verbs that do not really require them. In sentences (4) and (5), it is in the subject position, while the real subject has been moved to the end of the sentence. A simple test can be done to see if the sentence contains an impersonal verb. One checks to see if a given subject pronoun takes an antecedent in the previous clause or sentence, e.g. ::Bukit Timah is 163.63 metres tall. It is the highest point in Singapore. ::Bukit Timah is 163.63 metres tall. It rains frequently there. The two examples may seem similar, but only the pronoun it in the first example links with the previous subject. The pronoun it in the second example, on the other hand, has no referent. The hill (Bukit Timah) does not rain, it rains. This demonstrates that rain is an impersonal verb.What is an impersonal verb. Retrieved on 12 March 2012. ====In Spanish==== There is no equivalent of the dummy subject it in Spanish. In Spanish, there are a few true impersonal avalent verbs. Most of them are \\"atmospheric verbs\\": :llueve :It's raining :ha helado :It froze Most impersonal constructions in Spanish involve using a special verb in third-person defective verb with a direct object as its only argument or use of impersonal se (not to be confused with other uses of se). There are two main impersonal verbs in Spanish: haber (to have) and hacer (to do). Haber is an irregular verb. When used as an impersonal verb in the present tense, it has a special conjugation for the third person singular (hay). Clauses with the verb haber do not have an explicit subject; its only argument is a direct object noun phrase that does not agree with the verb. Haber has its 'natural meaning' of tener 'to have'.Kany, Charles. 1945. American-Spanish syntax. Chicago: The University of Chicago Press. :Hay un libro (aquí). :There is a book (here) :Hay muchos libros. :There are many books :Hubo muchos libros (que no se vendieron). :There were many books (that were left unsold). Less frequently, and only in some expressions with a limited number of nouns in singular, the verb \\"hacer\\" in the 3rd singular is used as impersonal (Hacer is a very common verb meaning 'to do'). :hace frío :It's cold :hizo frío ayer : yesterday it was cold :hace viento :It's windy Spanish will add the pronoun se in front of verbs to form general sentences. Impersonal voice using se will use a singular verb since se can be replaced by uno. :¿Cómo se escribe \\"Apple\\"? :How do you spell \\"Apple\\"? The passive voice in Spanish has similar characteristics following that of the impersonal se. It is normally formed by using se + the third person singular or plural conjugation of a verb, similar to the impersonal se. This use of se is easily confused with the medial se.Deborah R. Lemon.(1994). The Impersonal and Passive se in Spanish. Retrieved on 12 March 2012 :Active voice: :Mis amigos comieron torta (European and American Spanish) :My friends ate cake (i.e. some of the cake) :Mis amigos comieron la torta (American Spanish, less frequent in European Spanish) :My friends ate the cake :Medial meaning: :Mis amigos se comieron la torta :My friends ate all the cake :Passive voice: :Esta torta se come tradicionalmente en Navidad. :This cake is normally eaten during Christmas :Se vende esta casa. :This house is for sale ====In French==== The verbs are impersonal in French because they do not take a real personal subject as they do not represent any action, occurrence or state-of-being that can be attributed to a person, place or a thing.Transparent Language. (2008). Impersonal Verbs. Retrieved on 12 March 2012. In French, as in English, these impersonal verbs take on the impersonal pronoun - il in French. :Il faut que tu fasses tes devoirs. :It is necessary that you do your homework. The il is a dummy subject and does not refer to anything in particular in this phrase. The most common impersonal form is il y a, meaning there is, there are. Note its other tenses (il y avait, il y a eu, il y aura, etc.).Impersonal verbs. Retrieved on 12 March 2012. French makes a distinction between a dummy subject and an actual subject in clauses with infinitives by the use of a different preposition. The preposition de is used with dummy subjects and the preposition à is used with real subjects. Compare: :It's important to learn. (= Learning is important.) - dummy subject :Il est important d'apprendre. :It's important to learn. (= This is important to learn.) - real subject :Il est important à apprendre. ====In others==== The Celtic languages also possess impersonal verbal forms though their use is usually translated into English by forms such as 'one sees' (Welsh: gwelir), 'one did' (Welsh: gwnaethpwyd), 'one is' (Irish: táthar) etc., in which he 'one' is taken to be an empty subject. For weather, personal verbs are used in Celtic languages, e.g. Welsh Mae hi'n bwrw eira 'it is snowing'. Verbs meaning existence may also be impersonal. :Há livros. / Há um livro. (Portuguese) :Hay libros. / Hay un libro. (Spanish) :There are (some) books. / There is a book. However, sometimes there are intransitive verbs with more or less the same meaning: :Existem livros. / Existe um livro. (Portuguese) :Existen libros. / Existe un libro. (Spanish) :(Some) books exist. / A book exists. Latin has several impersonal verbs, most often seen in the third person singular. The real subject of the sentence will not be in the nominative case but is most often in the dative or accusative case. These verbs include: * Decet – it becomes/suits; it is right/proper * Libet – it pleases * Licet – it is permitted/allowed * Oportet – it is proper/fitting * Placet – it is agreed/resolved ===Tai-Kadai=== ====In Thai==== Impersonal verbs in Thai do not allow for an overt grammatical subject. The impersonal verbs occur only with transitive verbs. : kəət3 phɛɛndinwaày thîï4 yîïpùn : happen earthquake at Japan : There is an earthquake in Japan. : *man kəət3 phɛɛndinwaày thîï4 yîïpùn : *it happen earthquake in Japan : *There is an earthquake in Japan. There is no allowance for the presence of a non-referential subject man 'it' in the case frame. In general, it is not allowed in formal speech, such as news reports. However,the presence of non-referential subject man can occur in the colloquial form. : man mii phîï nay bâan nii dûay rəə : it exist ghost in house this also Ques : Is there also a ghost in this house? Subdivision into non-inception and inception subclasses can occur depending on whether the verb may occur with the path adverb khin 'up'. ===In constructed languages=== In the auxiliary language Interlingua, verbs are not conjugated by person. Impersonal verbs take the pronoun il: :Il ha nivate heri. (Interlingua) In the planned auxiliary language Esperanto, where verbs also are not conjugated for person, impersonal verbs are simply stated with no subject given or implied, even though Esperanto is otherwise not a null subject language: :Neĝis hieraŭ. (Esperanto)A Complete Grammar of Esperanto In the planned logical language Lojban, impersonal verbs simply have no first argument filled and might not have any arguments filled at all: :carvi ca lo prulamdei (Lojban) where carvi is a verb meaning x1 rains/showers/[precipitates] to x2 from x3 where x1, x2, x3 are numbered core arguments. ==Comparison to other linguistic classifications== ===Weather verb=== Some linguists consider the impersonal subject of a weather verb to be a \\"dummy pronoun\\", while others interpret it differently. Adjectives of zero valence are mainly the adjectives referring to weather such as \\"winding\\" and \\"raining\\" and so on. In some languages such as Mandarin Chinese, weather verbs like snow(s) take no subject or object.Huang Jinzhu & Mianzhu Yi (2010), The design and implementation of VDEA Universal Communication Symposium (IUCS), 2010 4th International, 325-331 ===Impersonal pronoun=== An impersonal pronoun, or dummy pronoun, lacks a reference; in English, the usual example is \\"it\\" when used with an impersonal verb. Some sources classify certain uses of \\"one\\" (ex. \\"what should one say?\\") or \\"you\\" (ex. \\"you only live once\\") as \\"human impersonal pronouns\\". An impersonal pronoun, when used, serves as an empty placeholder, or \\"dummy subject\\", for the sentence. Examples: : You would think the inner dome of heaven had fallen. : The young comedian was awful; one felt embarrassed for him. : If one fails, then one must try harder next time. When the pronoun one is used in the numerical sense (rather than as a dummy pronoun), a different pronoun can be used subsequently to referring to the same entity. : We watched as one [of the ospreys] dried its feathers in the sun. : One [driver] pulled her car over to the side. Generally, it is not ideal to mix the impersonal pronoun one with another pronoun in the same sentence.On the Uses of One. Retrieved on 20 March 2012. : If one fails, then he/you must simply try harder. ===Null objects=== While the concept of impersonal verbs is closely related to phenomenon of null subjects, null objects have to do with the lack of the obligatory projection of an object position.Cummins S., Roberge, Y., (2004). Null objects in French and English. In: Auger, J., Clements, J.C., Vance, B. (Eds.), Contemporary Approaches to Romance Linguistics: Selected papers from the 33rd Linguistic Symposium on Romance Languages (LSRL). John Benjamins, Amsterdam, 121–138. In French :C'est pas lui qui l'a écrit, son livre, le pape, c'est quelqu'un qui lui écrit __. :The Pope didn't write his book himself, someone writes __ for him. In English :Why then do the psychic gifts often seem to tease __, confuse __ and obstruct __? Null objects can be understood as implicit anaphoric direct objects, that is, those whose referents can be understood from the prior or ongoing discourse context as well as sufficiently salient in that context not only to be encoded pronominally, but even to be entirely omitted. However, it is not imperative that the referent of the direct object has been referred to explicitly previously in the discourse; it could instead be accessible extra-linguistically due to its salience to the interlocutors.Schwenter, Scott A (2006). Null Objects across South America. Selected Proceedings of the 8th Hispanic Linguistics Symposium, ed. Timothy L. Face and Carol A. Klee, 23-36. Somerville, MA: Cascadilla Proceedings Project. ===Defective verb=== An impersonal verb is different from a defective verb in that with an impersonal verb, only one possible syntactical subject is meaningful (either expressed or not), whereas with a defective verb, certain choices of subject might not be grammatically possible, because the verb does not have a complete conjugation. ==In universal grammar theory== Impersonal verbs can be considered null subject data. They involve a general concern in generative grammar: determining the nature and distribution of phonetically null but syntactically present entities (empty categories). Since, by definition, these entities are absent from the speech signal, it is of interest that language learners still can come to have information about them. As this phenomenon could not have resulted from sufficient prior experience, it suggests the role of universal grammar. ==See also== * Gender-specific and gender-neutral third-person pronouns * Generic you * Impersonal passive voice * Impersonal pronoun \\"one\\" * Null-subject language * Transitive verb * Transitivity (grammar) ==References== Category:Transitivity and valency ","title":"Impersonal verb"},{"id":"1279733","text":"The Ghosts Of London is a book written by Henry Vollam Morton (\\"H.V.\\"), published in 1939 by Methuen & Co Limited in London.

His most notable and successful book was Anatomy of Britain, which was published in 1962 and was followed by five more \\"Anatomies\\", updating the original book under various titles. He was the grandson of the linguist John Sampson, of whom he wrote a biography, The Scholar Gypsy: The Quest For A Family Secret (1997). He also gave Nelson Mandela advice on Mandela's famous 1964 defence speech at the trial which led to his conviction for life. ==Biography== Sampson was born in Billingham, County Durham, and was educated at Westminster School. In 1944 he joined the Royal Navy, and by the time he left, in 1947, he was a sub-lieutenant in the RN Volunteer Reserve. He then studied English at Christ Church, Oxford. He married Sally on his return from South Africa. She was a Justice of the Peace and was a bench chairman of the Youth Court at Camberwell. ==Career== In 1951 Sampson went to Johannesburg, South Africa, to become editor of the magazine Drum, remaining there for four years. After his return to the United Kingdom he joined the editorial staff of The Observer, where he worked from 1955 to 1966. He was the author of a series of books, starting with Anatomy of Britain (1962), in which he explored the workings of the British state and other major social institutions, in particular the large corporation. He took an interest in broad political and economic power structures, but he also saw power as personal. He occasionally offered psychoanalytical interpretations of power players, as in this passages from The Money Lenders: > \\"[Bankers] seem specially conscious of time, always aware that time is > money. There is always a sense of restraint and tension. (Is it part of the > connection which Freud observed between compulsive neatness, anal eroticism > and interest in money?)\\" Sampson was a personal friend of Nelson Mandela before Mandela became politically active. In 1964 Sampson attended the Rivonia Trial in support of Mandela and other ANC leaders, and in 1999 he published the authorised biography of Mandela. Sampson was also a founding member of the now defunct Social Democratic Party (SDP). Sampson's personal archive, catalogued by the Bodleian Library, was made public for the first time in 2012. ==Bibliography== ===Books=== * *Drum: the Making of a Magazine.

His first name is sometimes spelled \\"Melancthon\\"; it derives from Philip Melanchthon, the leader in the Reformation. He was born in Jamaica, Long Island, New York and was homeschooled by his parents. When his family moved to Poughkeepsie, New York, he became involved in the mercantile business. In 1769 he helped organize the Washington Hollow Presbyterian Church. He became a delegate to the first New York Provincial Congress in New York on May 22, 1775. He served in the Continental Line Regiment on June 30, 1775, which he organized as the Dutchess County Rangers. On Feb. 11, 1777, he became one of three members of a Dutchess County commission for \\"inquiring into, detecting and defeating all conspiracies ... against the liberties of America;\\" he served for the next six months administering oaths of allegiance, arresting suspects, informing upon and examining Loyalists. While wielding this powerful civil and military authority, he was also serving as sheriff of Dutchess County. He extended his land holdings by purchasing some of the forfeited Loyalist estates. Smith moved to New York City in 1785 where he was a prominent merchant. He helped found the New York Manumission Society in opposition to slavery and served in the Continental Congress from 1785 to 1787. He was the most important Anti- federalist member of the State ratification convention at Poughkeepsie in 1788, where he made many of the same arguments as the Federal Farmer. Following the ratification of the Constitution by New Hampshire and Virginia, and a letter he received from Nathan Dane, Smith became convinced that New York had no choice but to accept the ratification of the Constitution and could not afford to wait until it had been amended. His vote for the Constitution, with the recommendation of amendments, broke Anti-Federalist ranks and brought down Governor George Clinton's wrath. He was one of the few important landowners and merchants among the Anti-Federalists, and Smith continued in the Clintonian party. He was elected to the Assembly in 1791 and canvassed the state for Clinton in 1792 against John Jay. He died during the yellow fever epidemic in New York City in 1798 and is buried in Jamaica Cemetery, Jamaica, Queens, New York. ==Antifederalist Papers== Smith has been cited as the likely author of some of the more prominent Antifederalist essays written to encourage voters to reject ratification of the Constitution: the essays of Brutus and The Federal Farmer. While many believed Robert Yates to have been the author of the Brutus essays and Richard Henry Lee to have written the Federal Farmer, scholars have recently cast doubt on those attributions. In a computational analysis of the known writings of Smith, Yates, Lee, and other prominent Antifederalists, John Burrows concluded that Smith was the most likely author of both sets of essays. He found that \\"Brutus is consistently unlike... Yates's other writings.\\" However, \\"the resemblance to Smith is strong and unfaltering.\\" Furthermore, \\"[a]ll of the tests employed upheld Smith's authorship of Federal Farmer's papers, while the claim for Richard Henry Lee found no support at all.\\"Zuckert and Webb. The Anti- Federalist Writings of the Melancton Smith Circle p. 418-419 Michael Zuckert and Derek Webb, noting that it would be odd for one person to write two separate sets of essays covering similar topics and publishing at the same time, suggest that Smith instead collaborated closely with other Antifederalists. They find it more probable that he wrote one of the sets of essays, while another person or persons close to him wrote the other.Zuckert and Webb.

The bond number itself is the number of electron pairs (bonds) between a pair of atoms. For example, in diatomic nitrogen N≡N the bond number is 3, in ethyne the bond number between the two carbon atoms is also 3, and the bond order is 1. Bond number gives an indication of the stability of a bond. Isoelectronic species have same bond number. In molecules which have resonance or nonclassical bonding, bond number may not be an integer. In benzene, the delocalized molecular orbitals contain 6 pi electrons over six carbons essentially yielding half a pi bond together with the sigma bond for each pair of carbon atoms, giving a calculated bond number of 1.5. Furthermore, bond numbers of 1.1, for example, can arise under complex scenarios and essentially refer to bond strength relative to bonds with order 1. ==Bond order in molecular orbital theory== In molecular orbital theory, bond order is defined as half the difference between the number of bonding electrons and the number of antibonding electrons as per the equation below. This often but not always yields similar results for bonds near their equilibrium lengths, but it does not work for stretched bonds. Bond order is also an index of bond strength and is also used extensively in valence bond theory. :\\\\text{B.O.} = \\\\frac{\\\\text{number of bonding electrons} - \\\\text{number of antibonding electrons}}{2}\\\\ Generally, the higher the bond order, the stronger the bond. Bond orders of one-half may be stable, as shown by the stability of (bond length 106 pm, bond energy 269 kJ/mol) and (bond length 108 pm, bond energy 251 kJ/mol).Bruce Averill and Patricia Eldredge, Chemistry: Principles, Patterns, and Applications (Pearson/Prentice Hall, 2007), 409. ==Other definitions== The bond order concept used in molecular dynamics and bond order potentials. The magnitude of the bond order is associated with the bond length. According to Linus Pauling in 1947, the bond order is experimentally described as : s_{ij} = \\\\exp{\\\\left[ \\\\frac{d_{1} - d_{ij}}{b} \\\\right]} where d_{1} is the single bond length, d_{ij} is the bond length experimentally measured, and b is a constant, depending on the atoms. Pauling suggested a value of 0.353 Å for b, for carbon-carbon bonds in the original equation: : d_{1} - d_{ij} = 0.353 ~ \\\\text{ln} s_{ij} The value of the constant b depends on the atoms. The above definition of bond order is somewhat ad hoc and only easy to apply for diatomic molecules. Hückel MO theory offers another approach for defining bond orders based on MO coefficients. Since the theory divides bonding into a sigma framework and a pi system, the Hückel definition is only applicable to planar molecules with delocalized π bonding. Assuming a bond order contribution of 1 from the sigma component it gives a total bond order (σ + π) of 1.67 for benzene rather than the commonly cited 1.5, showing some degree of ambiguity in how the concept of bond order is defined. A standard quantum mechanical definition for bond order has been debated for a long time.IUPAC Gold Book bond order A comprehensive method to compute bond orders from quantum chemistry calculations was published in 2017. ==References== Order ","title":"Bond order"},{"id":"1279768","text":"The , which is Japanese for \\"falcon-people\\",William George Aston says this in his note, see Nihongi: Chronicles of Japan from the Earliest Times to A.D. 697, translated from the original Chinese and Japanese by William George Aston.

First edition published 1972. were a people of ancient Japan who lived in the Satsuma and Ōsumi regions of southern Kyushu during the Nara period. They frequently resisted Yamato rule. After their subjugation they became subjects of the government under Ritsuryō, and the Ministry of the Military had an office known as the in charge of their governance. The name also came into use by samurai as a title, . In modern times, Hayato is a Japanese male given name. == History and culture == The Hayato might have been the same as the Kumaso group of around the same time,One theory holds that the Hayato were descendants of the Kumaso. In recent years, though, the theory has taken root that because the \\"kuma\\" and \\"so\\" in \\"Kumaso\\" and the names of the Ata Hayato and Ōsumi Hayato all refer to regions of southern Kyushu, these may have been general names applied to several distinct cultural groups of rebellious local people by the Yamato court. but while the Kumaso are mentioned in the more legendary portions of the Nihon Shoki, the Hayato are recorded in various historical texts until the beginning of the Heian period. Though the Kumaso are generally portrayed as rebellious, the Hayato are listed among the attendants of emperors and princes from as early as Emperor Nintoku's reign.After the death of Emperor Nintoku one individual, named Sobakari in the Kojiki and Sashihire in the Nihon Shoki, assassinated the prince he served on the orders of another prince. However, he was then given sake and assassinated by the prince he had betrayed his master for. The story illustrates the use of Hayato as unofficial military forces. This, along with a mention of Hayato crying before the grave of Emperor Yūryaku after his death, suggests that the Hayato were naturalized as personal servants by the late 7th century. Even after pledging allegiance to the Japanese court, the Hayato continued to resist its rule. After the establishment of Ōsumi Province in 713, the Ōsumi Hayato fought back in 720 with the Hayato Rebellion, but were defeated in 721 by an army led by Ōtomo no Tabito. The Handen-Shūju system was implemented in their lands in 800. The population of Yamato immigrants in Kagoshima prefecture in the early 8th century has been estimated at around 9,000 people and one-seventh of the total population. By this estimate, the Hayato population of the time can be calculated as consisting of around 54,000 people (not including Hayato emigrants to Honshū).Koyama Shūzō of the National Museum of Ethnology has mathematically estimated that the population of the Japanese islands during the Kofun period was approximately 5,400,000 people. Since the population even in the Nara period remained less than 6,000,000, the Hayato population may be assumed to be around one-hundredth of the total population of the islands. The Hayato were made to emigrate to the Kinai region, and were active in the protection of the court, the arts, sumo, and bamboo work.The Nihon Shoki records that in the court of Emperor Tenmu, in the late 7th century, the Hayato performed sumo in the court, but it is not described as different from the sumo of the Yamato themselves. In 682, the Ōsumi Hayato and Ata Hayato competed in sumo and the Ōsumi side won, and in 695 a bout of sumo between Hayato on the grounds of Asuka-dera drew a crowd of spectators. Many lived in Yamashiro Province, in the south of modern Kyoto. There remains an area called in Kyōtanabe, Kyoto, where many Ōsumi Hayato lived. These were the Hayato governed by the Hayato-shi. The language spoken by the Hayato is not known, except for two words and several personal names documented in contemporary sources. Based on this material, it has been proposed that the Hayato may have been of Austronesian origin.Kakubayashi, Fumio. 1998. 隼人 : オーストロネシア系の古代日本部族' Hayato : An Austronesian speaking tribe in southern Japan.'. The bulletin of the Institute for Japanese Culture, Kyoto Sangyo University, 3, pp.15-31 . Their culture is also believed to be unique from those of other regions of Japan. In particular, their folk song and dance became famous in the Kinai region as the .The Hayato dance appears repeatedly in the Kojiki, Nihon Shoki, and Shoku Nihongi, performed on the occasion of paying tribute to the court and for the benefit of foreign visitors. An excavation of Heijō Palace discovered wooden shields with a distinctive reverse-S-shaped marking. These shields match those described in the Engishiki, which the Hayato used in court ceremonial functions. The Hayato had roles in various state ceremonies, including those for the new year, imperial enthronement, and visiting foreign officials. According to the ancient records of Hizen province, the Gotō Islands were also inhabited by a people resembling the Hayato. The New Book of Tang describes a minor king of , and this Haya has also been interpreted as referring to the Hayato. There are three types of graves archaeologically associated with the Hayato: the widely distributed around the border of Kagoshima and Miyazaki prefectures,These tunnel tombs are focused around Hyūga, Ōsumi, and Satsuma, but the underground stone-slab graves are found mainly in the Satsuma region. Therefore, it is theoried that the former were widely used by various Hayato, while the latter were used specifically by the Ata Hayato. the of the southern Satsuma peninsula, and the found north of the Satsuma peninsula. Another large group of tunnel tombs is located near the Ōsumi area of Kyotanabe. Because of the proximity and because the gravelly soil of the area is not suited to such tombs, these may also be associated with the Hayato. In Japanese mythology, the deity Umisachihiko is considered the ancestor of the ruler of the Ata Hayato. The Hayato Dance may be intended to portray Umisachihiko's pain at being outdone by his younger brother Yamasachihiko. == Regional distribution == ;, or Satsuma Hayato :A Hayato tribe who lived on the Satsuma Peninsula. Before the establishment of Satsuma Province, the area was known as Ata. The Nihon Shoki's section on 682 calls them the Ata Hayato, while the section of the Shoku Nihongi on the year 709 refers to them as the Satsuma Hayato. ; :A Hayato tribe who lived in the northern Ōsumi Peninsula, or by another theory the Kimotsuki plain region.The latter theory is seen in volume 1 of the 1967 They are mentioned in Nihon Shoki article on 682. ; :A Hayato tribe who lived in Tane Province. In 702, the court dispatched an army and conquered the region. ; :A Hayato tribe who lived on the Koshikijima Islands. They are mentioned in the Shoku Nihongi's section on 769. ; :A Hayato tribe who lived in Hyūga Province. The Shoku Nihongi records that in 710, their leader submitted to the court and was awarded the rank of . However, this was before the separation of Ōsumi province from Hyūga Province in 713. The history of Usa Shrine records that later, in 719, the Ōsumi and Hyūga Hayato attacked Japan, perhaps a precursor to the rebellion of 720. == Skeletal findings == Anthropological research on human skeletons of the Kofun period on southern Kyushu has shown that male skeletons found inland differ from those on the Miyazaki plain. Inland skeletons resembled those of Jōmon people and northwestern Kyushu Yayoi people,The Yayoi people of northwestern Kyushu are thought to be the descendants of the Jōmon people of the region, who adopted and naturalized into the Yayoi culture. The mention in the Hizen ancient records of Hayato- like people in the Gotō islands can also be explained if we consider that they too were descended from northwestern Kyushuan Yayoi people. and some groups on the plain also resembled northern Kyushu Yayoi people. Additionally, skeletons excavated from late Yayoi-period ruins on Tanegashima are smaller than those found on Kyushu, and show signs of artificial cranial deformation. == Notes == == References == * Category:Nara period Category:Tribes of ancient Japan ","title":"Hayato people"},{"id":"1279776","text":"Akane (, ) is the Japanese word for 'deep red' (, Akane, Rubia cordifolia) and is associated with red (from the red dye made from its roots) and brilliant red.

In the plateau, the highway serves several cities of Greater São Paulo, such as São Bernardo do Campo, São Caetano do Sul, Santo André and Riacho Grande and traverses a picturesque region of dams and rain forests. Rodovia Anchieta is a major pride of the Brazilian engineering, because it was built with a great number of bridges and tunnels along the steep cliffs of Serra do Mar; and the first modern, concrete-paved road built in São Paulo in the 1930s. The highway is one of the busiest of the country, because of the movement of goods to and from Santos's seaport. Traffic problems are common, mainly if there is bad weather or in long weekends when many families living in São Paulo go to Santos or Guarujá beaches. Rodovia Anchieta is approximately 60 km long. It is named after the Jesuit priest, Father José de Anchieta,who often called the trail \\"the worst trail in the world\\" it was given this nickname because it badly hurt his feet when he would walk the trail. It connected to the city of São Vicente by the sea with the village he helped to found in the high plateau, São Paulo dos Campos de Piratininga, in 1554.

Each type of baijiu uses a distinct type of Qū for fermentation unique to the distillery for the distinct and characteristic flavour profile. Baijiu is a clear liquid usually distilled from fermented sorghum, although other grains may be used; some southeastern Chinese styles may employ rice or glutinous rice, while other Chinese varieties may use wheat, barley, millet, or Job's tears (Chinese: 薏苡 yìyǐ) in their mash bills. The qū starter culture used in the production of baijiu is usually made from pulverized wheat grain or steamed rice.Rong and Fa, Grandiose Survey of Chinese Alcoholic Drinks and Beverages, 2013, Xiaoqing Mu et al. Solid-State Fermented Alcoholic Beverages, in Chen, Jian, and Yang Zhu, eds. Solid State Fermentation for Foods and Beverages.

Because of its clarity, baijiu can appear similar to several other East Asian liquors, e.g. Japanese shōchū (25%) or Korean soju (20–45%), but it often has a significantly higher alcohol content (35-60%). As innocent as it looks, its flavour can vary from simple, light and subtle-tasting to savoury-saucy rich- tasting, depending on the type. Baijiu is comparable to whisky in terms of variation, complexity of flavour and sensation. ==History== A Guojiao distillery, featuring appartus for traditional baijiu distillation. Shuijing Fang () distillery remains in Chengdu, Sichuan. Each baijiu distillery has its own qu which contains a specific microbiome that would develop their branded flavour profile. The troughs in which qu is cultured are traditionally an inseparable part of the distillery. No exact dates are known for the invention of the modern form baijiu as it likely emegered gradually with the development of distillery technology over a long period of time through history. The history of Baijiu intertwined with the history of China. * Prototypical alcohol making in China dates back to as early as the Neolithic Age with archaeological discoveries of alcoholic beverage containers belonging to that period. * A systematic distillery process was likely developed during the Han Dynasty (202 BC-220 AD) with archeological finds of brick arts depicting distilling scenes. * The first proto-baijiu was likely made during the Tang Dynasty (618-907) as the drink was described by poets Bai Juyi (白居易) and Yong Tao (雍陶) at the time. * The flourishing of commerce and urbanisation during Song Dynasty (960-1279) likely had popularised alcohol consumption with a boom of Jiuguan (酒馆, 'pub, bar') in major cities. * By this time the proto-baijiu was likely to be only about 15% ABV as literature from the time recorded \\"bowls of alcohol consumed\\" suggesting that it must have been weaker than the modern form baijiu. * During the Yuan Dynasty (1271-1368),Huang, H. T. \\"Science and civilisation in China. Volume 6. Biology and biological technology. Part V: fermentations and food science.\\" (2000).Huang et al. Chinese Wines: Jiu, in Hui, Yiu H., ed. Handbook of food science, technology, and engineering. Vol. 149. CRC press, 2006. Middle Eastern distillery technology spread to China, which probably improved the existing distillery techniques, allowing for higher-degree distilled alcohol to be possible. * The distillation technology matured as baijiu began to resemble its modern form around the Ming Dynasty (1368-1644). Detailed description of Baijiu was recorded in Bencao Gangmu (本草纲目, Compendium of Materia Medica) by Li Shizhen. * Baijiu continued to evolve with the refinements of baijiu making techniques over the centuries until today. Baijiu is characterized by solid-state fermentation and distillation using a grain culture called qū, which allows for simultaneous saccharification and fermentation. This is a typical feature of liquors produced in East Asia. Chinese baijiu is always distilled from grain, produced in batches and blended. ==Serving== === Traditional etiquette === The Chinese traditionally serve baijiu neat at room temperature, in small cups or glasses, though drinkware varies by region. It is traditional to drink baijiu with food rather than on its own, though it is often infused with fruit or medicinal herbs and spices. The ceremonial includes the following steps: # Execute the Baili (拜礼) greeting to show respect to the host. # Spill a moderate amount of baijiu in the cup onto the ground to show gratitude to nature. # Take a sip and taste the baijiu, and tell the host your opinion. # Finish the baijiu in the small glass in one go after the Ganbei (干杯, 'Cheers') and clinking of glasses. Note that the host should initate and invite for a cup, and the guest should reply with a cup. === Modern etiquette === In modern days, ceremonial parts of the etiquettes are ignored. Commonly with a group of friends or family, the host would initiate with \\"Cheers for...!\\" (为...干杯!), and then guests would finish their cups after clinking the glasses. Tasting is also appreciated. Modern bar culture has grown in popularity in China, so has a craving for a twist on the traditional baijiu. In 2007, a report in Time magazine mentioned integrating baijiu into cocktails, and in the years since several bars around the world have added baijiu to their cocktail programs. === Baijiu and Chinese business culture === Chinese business culture is known to be intense. It is believed that one's true colour is shown when intoxicated. Therefore when negotiating a business partnership, there is a tradition of serving high-degree baijiu on dinner table, in order to judge one's trustworthiness. There are also harmful folk beliefs, especially in rural China, that consuming alcohol excessively equates to manliness and that one should not reject a serving offered by an elderly or higher-up. Many inexperienced Chinese drinkers are persuaded to overdrink on such occasions. These experiences are commonly referred to as the reason for baijiu's unpopularity among some. This negative association of baijiu with extreme drinking culture can sometimes led to fear of baijiu in the younger generation or people who have yet to try the drink. *Note that the situation described above may be present only in certain regions, not representative for all of China. ==Pricing and the baijiu market== A bottle of Maotai (Moutai) produced in 1998 has an estimated price range of HK$195,000-293,000 (US$25,000-37,600) in an auction in Hong Kong in 2017. Although most baijiu are priced similarly to other liquors with similar alcohol percentage, some high-end baijiu can be highly collectible due to the intricate skills and traditional artisanship involved in the making of baijiu, the age of the baijiu, or the rarity of the bottle etc. With the gifting tradition in some areas of China, sometimes expensive baijiu could also be gifted instead of being consumed. There is a sizable market for high-end baijiu collection for the above reasons. For example, the highest grade of Wuliangye retails for (US$3,375). Top-tier baijiu are likely to be from traditional baijiu distillery such as Kweichow Maotai, Wuliangye, Luzhou Laojiao, Shuijing Fang etc. On the opposite side of the spectrum. Low-end baijiu can be as inexpensive as a can of beer per volume. For example, Erguotou and Jiang Xiaobai. Although some despise the low ends for their taste, they are more casually consumed with meals, or just when drinkers want to simply get drunk. === Global baijiu market === Baijiu is the world's bestselling liquor, with five billion litres sold in 2016, and 10.8 billion liters sold in 2018, more than whisky, vodka, gin, rum and tequila combined. As well as the most consumed liquor, with 1.2 billion nine-liter cases consumed in 2018, mostly in China - three times the global consumption of vodka.Barron's accessed November 9, 2018 Outside of China it is gaining popularity, as seen with the sale of Ming River Baijiu in US and EU markets from late 2010s, a Jiangxiang type baijiu sourced from the Luzhou Laojiao distillery. Baijiu-inspired cocktails are also gaining popularity among the younger generation in metropolises such as Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Shenzhen, Hong Kong, Taipei and Singapore. ==Classification== === Categorisation by aroma profile === Throughout the evolutionary history of baijiu, numerous regional variations in alcohol production technique across the country have been incorporated into baijiu making. The practice of infusing alcohol with herbs, spices, fruits and other ingredients has its roots in traditional Chinese medicine, but is also done purely for flavor. The practice of infusing spirits is a common practice. Baijiu has a distinctive smell and taste that is highly valued in Chinese culinary culture, and connoisseurs focus especially on its fragrance. This classification system began in 1952 and was updated in August 1979 at the third nationwide baijiu competition held in Dalian. Even so, during the competition, experts rated various baijiu based on their taste rather than aroma. There are 4 major categories of baijiu based on aroma profile: # Qingxiang (清香, qīngxiāng; light aroma, \\"Q-\\" s pronounced akin to \\"Ch-\\"): #* Delicate, dry, and light, with a smooth and light mouthfeel. #* The flavours of this distilled liquor is contributed primarily by ethyl acetate and ethyl lactate, and give the spirit a taste of dried fruit with floral notes. #* It is made from sorghum fermented in a stone vessel with qu made from wheat, barley and peas. #* The two primary styles of this liquor are Fenjiu (汾酒, fénjiǔ) from Shanxi and Erguotou (二锅头, èrguōtóu) from Beijing, the latter of which is known as Kaoliang (高粱, gāoliáng, lit. 'sorghum') in Taiwan. Formerly this style was called Fenxiang \\"Fen-aroma\\" (汾香, fēnxiāng) after the Xinghuacun-Fenjiu () Distillery. # Mixiang (米香, mǐxiāng; rice aroma): #* This class of liquor is exemplified by baijiu distilled from rice, such as Sanhuajiu (三花酒) from Guilin, Guangxi province. #* This fragrance has long history and is made using rice-based Rhizopus spp.-type Qu starters (小曲, xiǎoqū, lit. 'little qu). I #* t has a clean sensation and a slight aroma, dominated by ethyl lactate with lesser flavour contributions by ethyl acetate. # Nongxiang (浓香, nóngxiāng; strong aroma): #* A class of distilled liquor that is sweet tasting and mellow, with a gentle lasting fragrance contributed by the high levels of esters, primarily ethyl hexanoate, which give the spirit a strong taste of pineapple, banana and anise. #* Most alcohols of this aroma are distilled from sorghum, sometimes in combination with other grains, continuously fermented in mud pits. #* This style is formerly known as Luxiang \\"Lu aroma\\" (泸香, lúxiāng), as it is thought to be invented in the Luzhou Laojiao Distillery in Luzhou, Sichuan province. Other notable examples of this type of liquor are Wuliangye from Yibin, Sichuan; Jiannanchun from Mianzhu, Sichuan; and Yanghe from Suqian, Jiangsu province. # Jiangxiang (酱香, jiàngxiāng; savoury aroma): #* A fragrant distilled sorghum liquor of bold character, named for its similarity in flavor to fermented bean pastes and soy sauces. #* It is made from sorghum repeatedly fermented in stone brick pits. It has large amounts of ester compounds, which impart a layered savoury umami flavor. #* A highly controversal profile - like it or hate it. Not recommended for beginners but highly recommende for experienced drinkers. Some consider it as funky. It is an acquired taste, like peaty whiskey. #* To the initiated, it is considered a complement for preserved and pickled foods (酱菜, jìangcài). This class was formerly known as Maoxiang \\"Mao-aroma\\" (茅香), after the best known spirit of this class, Maotai. The Ming River Baijiu for the western market is also this category. Various other niche aroma profiles: *\\"Chi\\" xiang (豉香, chǐxiāng; douchi /douban flavour), or \\"Zhi\\" xiang (脂香, zhīxiāng; fat aroma): ** Named after douchi, the popular Chinese condiment made from fermented bean, this is a savory rice- based baijiu from Guangdong notable for the addition of pork fat during the aging process. *Fuyu xiang (馥郁香, fùyùxiāng; extra-strong aroma): ** This category refers to the liquor produced by the Jiugui (酒鬼) Distillery in Hunan. Distilled from sorghum, rice, glutinous rice, wheat, and corn that has been fermented with big qu and medicinal small qu. *\\"Laobaigan\\" xiang (老白干香, lǎobáigānxiāng; laobaigan aroma): ** Similar to light-aroma baijiu, but fermented with wheat-based big qu and bottled at extremely high proof. Most often associated with the Hengshui Ruitian (衡水瑞天) Distillery in Hebei. *Yao xiang (药香, yàoxiāng; medicinal aroma): ** A pungent liquor that originates at the Dongjiu (董酒) Distillery in Guizhou. Medicine aroma is distilled from the combination of two separate pit-fermented sorghum mashes, one fermented with wheat qu in a large pit and one fermented with medicinal rice qu in a small pit. *Jian xiang (兼香, jiānxiāng; mixed aroma): ** A class of distilled liquors that is a blend of two or more varieties of baijiu. As such, liquors of this class vary widely in their aroma, mouth-feel, and dryness. *Feng xiang(凤香, fèngxiāng; Xifeng style aroma): **A class of distilled liquor fermented in mud pits and aged in rattan containers. Liquors of this class have a fruity taste similar to strong-aroma baijiu, but also an earthier quality and an expanding finish. An example of this type of liquor is Xifengjiu from Fengxiang County in Shaanxi. *Zhima xiang (芝麻香, zhīmaxiāng; sesame aroma): ** A class of liquor distilled from sorghum, millet, or barley in stone pits with mud floors. Invented by the Jingzhi Distillery in the 1950s, sesame aroma employs similar production techniques to sauce-aroma baijiu, and has a charred, nutty flavor. *Xiaoqu Qingxiang (小曲清香, xiǎoqū qīngxiāng; qingxiang with small-batched qu): ** A style of baijiu distilled from sorghum that has been fermented with rice- based small qu. *Te xiang (特香, tèxiāng; Si'te distillery special aroma): ** A rice-based baijiu fermented in brick pits with big qu, it originates from the Si'te (四特) Distillery in Jiangxi, where the iconic Si'tejiu originated. ===Regional varieties === A glass and bottle of Zhuyeqing jiu () from Shanxi province Other than by aroma, Baijiu can also differ by styles, production methods, ingredients etc. Regional varieties of Baijiu are often somwhat unique in flavour profile and production method. Some examples of regional varieties include: * Daqujiu (大曲酒/大麴酒, Dàqūjiǔ): Originally from Sichuan. This liquor is made with sorghum and wheat qu and is fermented for two to three months in mud pits. Nongxiang type baijiu. * Erguotou (二锅头, èrguōtóu, lit. \\"head of the second pot\\") is a variant of Qingxiang type baijiu. It is often inexpensive and thus particularly popular amongst blue-collar workers across northern and northeastern China. It is probably the most commonly-drunk baijiu in Beijing and is frequently associated with that city. Red Star (, Hóngxīng) is a popular brand. * Fenjiu (汾酒, fénjiǔ): Grain alcohol in Fenyang, Shanxi dates back to the Northern and Southern Dynasties (AD 550). Most commonly associated with the Xinghuacun Distillery, Fenjiu is a Qingxiang type sorghum baijiu fermented with qu made from barley and peas. *Gaoliangjiu (高粱酒, gāoliángjiǔ): Kaoliang is an old Romanized spelling for the Chinese word for sorghum, gaoliang (高粱). The liquor originates from Dazhigu (, east of Tianjin), first appearing in the Ming Dynasty. Taiwan is the leading producer of Kaoliang liquor. It is a Qingxiang baijiu. * Sanhuajiu (三花酒, Sānhuājiǔ, lit. \\"Three Flowers Liquor\\"):photo a Mixiang type rice baijiu made in Guilin that borrows techniques from local rice wine tradition. It is famous for the fragrant herbal addition, and the use of spring water from Mount Xiang in the region. * Shuangzhengjiu (双蒸酒/雙蒸酒, shuāngzhēngjiǔ, lit. \\"double-distilled liquor\\") and Sanzhengjiu (三蒸酒, sānzhēngjiǔ, lit. \\"triple-distilled liquor\\", formerly known as \\"samshu\\"): Two varieties of Mixiang baijiu from the area of Jiujiang in Jiangxi and in Guangdong, made by distilling twice and three times respectively. Alcohol content by volume: 32% and 38–39% respectively. \\"Samshu\\" was the name by which most foreign travelers knew baijiu during the Qing Dynasty. ==== Popular infusions ==== Throughout the evolutionary history of baijiu, numerous regional variations in alcohol production technique across the country have been incorporated into baijiu making. The practice of infusing alcohol with herbs, spices, fruits and other ingredients has its roots in traditional Chinese medicine and herbology, but is also done purely for flavor. Infusing spirits is a common practice. Floral infusions: *Meiguilu jiu (玫瑰露酒, méiguīlujiǔ, lit. \\"nectar of the rose\\"): A variety of baijiu distilled with a special species of rose and crystal sugar. Alcohol content by volume: 54–55%. *Guihuajiu () is a distilled liquor flavored with Guihua (a type of osanthamus) flowers.

It was first produced for the Chinese royal family in 1790. ==Baijiu brands== The remains of a historical Jiannanchun (剑南春) distillery. Baijiu are often characterised by their distillery. The distinct aroma and taste profile is likely to be the speciality of that region. Therefore, often the name of the brand is the same as the name of the baijiu and the distillery. However, bigger brands tend to have a series of different types of baijiu as well as their signature baijiu. Beginner is recommended to try the signature baijiu of the brand first, to learn about their style of baijiu making. Due to its long history, almost every province in China has at least one regional speciality baijiu. However, Guizhou and Sichuan are the two biggest, particularly famous baijiu-making provinces, where numerous distilleries can be found. Below is a non-exhaustive list of relatively well- known Baijiu brands, grouped by place of origin, in descending order of popularity (semi-arbitrary and subjective). *Many other brands exist, but usually only produced, sold and consumed locally and therefore lesser-known and not included in the list. Guizhou: *Guizhou Moutai (贵州, Guìzhōu Máotái，Kweichow Moutai): This liquor has a production history of over 200 years, and originally coming from the town of Maotai in Guizhou.

Guangdong: *Yuk Bing Siu Zau (玉冰烧酒, Yùbīng Shāojiǔ) or roulaoshao (肉醪烧, ròuláoshāo): a Cantonese rice liquor with over 100 years of history, made with steamed rice. After distillation, pork fat is stored with the liquor but removed before bottling. Its name probably derives from the brewing process: in Cantonese, \\"jade\\" (yuk) is a homophone of \\"meat\\", and bing means 'ice', which describes the appearance of the pork fat floating in the liquor. Cantonese rice wine breweries prospered in the Northern Song Dynasty, when the Foshan area was exempted from alcohol tax.

This Region is right in the heart of Brazil, representing 18.86% of the national territory. With the move of the country's federal capital from Rio de Janeiro to Brasília in the 1960s, the construction of roads and railways to the interior of the country made access to the region easier, speeding up population growth and contributing significantly to the region's development. Mato Grosso do Sul was created in 1979, materializing the decision of the government to divide the then called state of Mato Grosso in two states to facilitate to the administration and the development of the region. Today, Center-West is attracting much investment for agriculture, livestock, and industries, and people from Southeast and Southern Brazil. Brasília International Airport, Marechal Rondon International Airport, Campo Grande International Airport and Santa Genoveva Airport connects the Center- West region with many Brazilian cities and also operates some international flights. The Center-West is home to the University of Brasília, University Center of Brasília, Federal University of Goiás, Federal University of Mato Grosso do Sul, Federal University of Mato Grosso and Federal University of Rondonópolis. The Center-West region is the second-least populated in Brazil. ==Geography== National Congress and Flag in Brasília, Federal District Climate classification for Brazil, according to the Köppen criteria Chapada dos Guimarães National Park in Mato Grosso Forest in Goiás ===Mato Grosso=== Mato Grosso is a state with a flat landscape that alternates between vast chapadas and plain areas. Mato Grosso contains three main ecosystems: the Cerrado, the Pantanal and the Amazon rainforest. Open pasture vegetation covers 40% of the state. The Chapada dos Guimarães National Park, with caves, grottoes, tracks, and waterfalls, is one of its tourist attractions. In the north is the biodiverse Amazonian forest, which covers nearly half of the state. The Xingu Indigenous Park and the Araguaia River are in Mato Grosso. Further south, the Pantanal, the world's largest wetland, is the habitat for nearly one thousand species of animals and many aquatic birds. ===Mato Grosso do Sul=== The Pantanal covers 12 municipalities of Mato Grosso do Sul and presents an enormous variety of flora and fauna, with forests, natural sand banks, savannahs, open pasture, fields and bushes. The area near Bonito has prehistoric caverns, natural rivers, waterfalls, swimming pools and the Blue Lake Cave. Mato Grosso do Sul has a humid subtropical and tropical climate. The annual rainfall is 1,500 mm. January is the warmest month, with mean maxima of 34 °C (93.2 °F) and minima of 24 °C (75.2 °F) and more rain; July experiences the coldest temperatures, with mean maxima of 25 °C (77 °F) and minima of 15 °C (59 °F) and sun. The cerrado landscape is characterized by extensive savanna formations crossed by gallery forests and stream valleys. Cerrado includes various types of vegetation. ===Goiás=== The most populous state of the region, Goiás presents a landscape of plateaus and chapadões. At the height of the drought, from June to September, the lack of rain makes the level of the River Araguaia go down and brings up almost 2 km of beaches. At the Emas National Park in the municipality of Chapadão do Céu, it is possible to observe the typical fauna and the flora from the region. At the Chapada dos Veadeiros the attractions include canyons, valleys, rapids and waterfalls. Other attractions are the historical city of Goiás (or Old Goiás), at 132 km from Goiânia, established at the beginning of the 18th century, and Caldas Novas, known for its hot springs. ===Federal District=== Located in the state of Goiás in a region called Planalto Central, the Federal District is divided in 31 administrative regions. Brasília - where the three branches of the federal government are located - is the main attraction of this dry area with only two seasons. The rainy season is from October to March. During the dry season, the humidity can reach critical levels, mainly in the peak hours of the hottest days. The artificial lake of Paranoá, with almost 40 km² and 500 million m³ of water, was built to minimize the severe climatic conditions of the winter. The region also attracts mystics, and in its surroundings one can find many temples of different religions and sectarian groups. ==Demographics== The Central-West Region has 237 cities.

Brazil's largest manganese reserve is found in the Central-West Region in Urucum Woods and 'political business' and tourism are also very important to the region. *Vehicles: 3,944,768 (March/2007); *Telephones: 3,168,026 (April/2007); ==Education== Federal University of Mato Grosso in Cuiabá Portuguese is the official national language, and thus the primary language taught in schools. But English and Spanish are part of the official high school curriculum. ===Educational institutions=== * University of Brasília (UnB) * Universidade Federal de Mato Grosso (UFMT) * Universidade Federal de Goiás (UFG) * Universidade Federal de Mato Grosso do Sul (UFMS) ==Tourism and recreation== Waterfall in Chapada do Guimarães, Mato Grosso Tourism has grown at impressive speed in the last decades there, attracting visitors from several parts of Brazil and the world; who all enjoy the Region's flora and fauna riches, as well as its numerous marvelous views. Located in the middle of the vast Central Upland, the Central-West Region reveals how attractive the tours in the interior of the country can be. Starting in the west part of Mato Grosso do Sul State and the southeast part of Mato Grosso State, we have Pantanal Mato-grossense; the largest swampy plain area in the world, cut by the Paraguai River. Its fauna and flora riches draw the attention of the world. In the same state, it's possible to take tours through pleasant places, such as Alta Floresta, where ecotourism is the greatest attraction; Bonito, one of the places with the most crystalline waters in the country; and Chapada dos Guimarães National Park, full of mountains and beautiful landscapes offered by the meadow vegetation. Dividing the States of Mato Grosso, Mato Grosso do Sul and Goiás, the Araguaia River attracts numerous fishermen from all parts of Brazil and the world. And in the State of Goiás, historical attractions, such as Pirenópolis draw many visitors all year long, with its steep stone-paved streets and its colonial houses. Other attractions in the same state include Chapada dos Veadeiros and the National Park of Emas, where the contact with nature is the essence of the tours. In the Federal District, the National Park of Brasília is one of the greatest local attractions. ==Infrastructure== ===International airports=== *Brasília Brasília International Airport - President Juscelino Kubitschek (BSB/SBBR) serves the metropolitan area with major domestic and international flights. Brasília International Airport is the third largest in Brazil in terms of passenger movement. Because of its strategic location it is considered a civil aviation hub for the rest of the country. This makes for a large number of takeoffs and landings and it is not unusual flights to have to wait in the holding pattern to land. Following the airport's master plan, Infraero built a second runway, which was finished in 2006. Marechal Rondon International Airport *Cuiabá The runway at Marechal Rondon International Airport was opened to traffic in 1956. In February 1975, Infraero took over the airport's administration and began various upgrades to meet the needs of the airport complex. As of 1996, Marechal Rondon Airport, located 10 km (6.21 mi) from the city center, started receiving international flights. Currently it serves more than 900 thousand passengers a year. *Campo Grande The operation of Campo Grande International Airport is shared with the Campo Grande Air Base. The airport has two runways. Construction of the main runway, made of concrete, began in 1950 and was finished in 1953. The passenger terminal was concluded in 1964, and in 1967 concrete aprons were built for both military and civilian aircraft. As commercial aviation demand grew, it became necessary to widen the civil aircraft apron, which was completed 12 years after its construction. The airport has been administered by Inferaero since 1975. ===National Airport=== *Goiânia Santa Genoveva Airport is the main airport of Goiânia, providing flights to major cities in Brazil.

The film stars Alain Delon in his first major film, along with Maurice Ronet (as Philippe Greenleaf) and Marie Laforêt (as Marge); Billy Kearns (an expatriate American actor well-liked in France)\\"Obituary: Bill Kearns, 69, Actor Seen in French Films\\", The New York Times, 4 December 1992 plays Greenleaf's friend Freddy Miles, and Romy Schneider appears briefly in an uncredited role as Freddie Miles' companion. The film, principally in French, contains brief sequences in Italian. Screenwriter Paul Gégauff wrote a variation on the same story in 1968 when he worked on Les biches for Claude Chabrol. Highsmith's source novel was adapted again in 1999 under the original title, The Talented Mr. Ripley. ==Plot== The American Tom Ripley (Alain Delon) has been sent to Italy to persuade the wealthy Philippe Greenleaf (Maurice Ronet) to return to San Francisco and take over his father's business. Philippe intends to do no such thing and the impoverished Tom enjoys living a life of luxury, so the two men essentially spend money all day and carouse all night. Tom is fixated on Philippe and his girlfriend, Marge (Marie Laforêt), and covets the other man's life. Philippe eventually grows bored with Ripley's fawning and becomes cruel and abusive to him. The final straw is when, during a yachting trip, Philippe strands Tom in the dinghy and leaves him to lie in the sun for hours. Back on board, Tom hatches a plan to kill Philippe and steal his identity. First, he leaves evidence of Philippe's philandering for an outraged Marge to find. After Marge goes ashore, Philippe confronts Tom, who admits his plan quite casually. Philippe, believing it to be a joke, plays along and asks Tom for the plan's details. Suddenly frightened, Philippe offers Tom a substantial sum to leave him and Marge alone, but Tom states that he can obtain this sum anyway and far more. At last, pretending to accept his offer, Tom stabs Philippe as the latter screams Marge's name. He casts the body overboard and returns to port. Upon returning to shore, Tom informs Marge that Philippe has decided to stay behind. He then goes travelling around Italy using Philippe's name and bank account, flawlessly mimicking his voice and mannerisms; in effect, Tom has become Philippe, even affixing his own photo, with seal, in Philippe's passport. He rents a large suite in a Rome hotel. When Philippe's friend, Freddie Miles (Billy Kearns), comes to the hotel to see Philippe and begins to suspect the truth, Tom murders him as well. Freddie's body is soon found and the Italian police become involved. Tom continues his charade, switching between his identity and Philippe's, depending on what the situation demands. After carrying out an elaborate scheme to implicate Philippe in Freddie's murder, Tom forges a suicide note and a will, leaving the Greenleaf fortune to Marge. Tom survives a long string of close shaves, throwing the Italian police off his trail and seemingly having outwitted everyone. He even succeeds in seducing Marge, with whom he begins openly cohabiting. When Philippe's yacht is being pulled out of the water for inspection by a buyer, his canvas-wrapped body is found attached to the boat because the anchor cable it was wrapped in had become tangled around the propellor. The film ends with Tom being unknowingly called toward the police. == Cast == * Alain Delon as Tom Ripley * Maurice Ronet as Philippe Greenleaf * Marie Laforêt as Marge Duval * Erno Crisa as Inspector Riccordi * Billy Kearns as Freddy Miles * Frank Latimore as O'Brien * Elvire Popesco as Madame Popova * Nicolas Petrov as Boris the dancer * Ave Ninchi as Signora Gianna, landlady in Rome * Lily Romanelli as Greenleaf's Housekeeper in Mongibello * Nerio Bernardi as the Ship's Agency Director * as The Belgian Lady * Paul Muller as The Blind Man (uncredited) * René Clément as a servant (uncredited cameo appearance) * Romy Schneider as Freddy's companion (uncredited cameo appearance; Schneider was Delon's girlfriend at that time) ==Production== Delon was cast after the director saw him in Women Are Weak (1959).\\"New Dream for Alain Delon\\", Thomas, Kevin.

The result, while arguably truer to the events of Highsmith's book, is vastly inferior. To say it suffers by comparison to Purple Noon is an understatement. Almost every aspect of Rene Clement's 1960 motion picture is superior to that of Minghella's 1999 version, from the cinematography to the acting to the screenplay.

Watt Pugh, a bank treasurer,1930 United States Federal Census and Louise Huff.Indiana, Birth Certificates, 1907-1940 She had two older sisters, Audrey and Rosalind. Pugh became interested in writing while serving as Friday editor of the Shortridge High School daily newspaper in Indianapolis, Indiana with classmate Kurt Vonnegut. At Shortridge she also served as vice president of her senior class. She graduated from the Indiana University School of Journalism in 1942. Her first professional writing job was writing short radio spots for WIRE, an Indianapolis radio station. When her family moved to California, she got work as a radio writer, first for NBC and then CBS, where she met Bob Carroll. Pugh credits some of her breakthrough as \\"the girl writer\\" to the war effort, which limited the pool of qualified male writers. Early in her career, she was frequently the only female writer on staff. Early in her career, as a staff writer for CBS Radio in Hollywood, Pugh forged a partnership with Bob Carroll, Jr. which lasted more than 50 years. Together they wrote some 400 television programs and roughly 500 radio shows. While the team was writing for The Steve Allen Show, they became interested in writing for Lucille Ball's new radio show, My Favorite Husband. They paid Allen to write his own show one week so they could focus on creating a script submission for My Favorite Husband. Under the supervision of head writer Jess Oppenheimer, the pair wrote Ball's radio program for its 2½ years. Pugh and Carroll helped create a vaudeville act for Lucille Ball and her husband Desi Arnaz, which became the basis for the pilot episode of I Love Lucy. Together with Oppenheimer and/or Bob Schiller and Bob Weiskopf, who joined the show at the beginning of the fifth year, the team tackled 39 episodes per season for the run of the series. Although they never won, Pugh and Carroll were nominated for three Emmy Awards for their work on the series. Pugh and Carroll are credited with helping create the 'Lucy' character, which Ball played in one form or another for over 40 years. The pair also wrote episodes for The Lucy Show, Here's Lucy, The Lucille Ball-Desi Arnaz Show (aka The Lucy-Desi Comedy Hour) and Ball's final series, the unsuccessful Life with Lucy (1986). The pair's other writing credits include work on the television series The Paul Lynde Show, Dorothy, Those Whiting Girls, Kocham Klane (an I Love Lucy series remake in Poland) and The Tom Ewell Show. They also worked on the films Forever, Darling and Yours, Mine and Ours, starring Ball. They created and wrote the Desi Arnaz Productions series The Mothers-in-Law (filmed at Desilu), which starred actresses Kaye Ballard and Eve Arden. The two served for seven years as executive producers of the long-running television series Alice and occasionally contributed scripts, one of which was awarded a Golden Globe Award. In September 2005, Madelyn Pugh Davis, who lived in California, released her memoirs, titled Laughing with Lucy, written with Bob Carroll, Jr. ==Private life== Pugh was married twice.

It was created by major railroad and oil interests, and was widely seen as part of John D. Rockefeller's early efforts to organize and control the oil industry in the United States under Standard Oil. The company's purpose was to end a rate war with the rail trunk lines by dividing oil traffic more evenly between the Pennsylvania Railroad, the Erie Railroad, and the New York Central railroads. The second purpose of the company was to limit production of refined oil - the country had a daily refining capacity of 40,000 barrels and a market for only 16,000. Although the company never shipped any oil, the South Improvement Company scheme caused widespread attention to be focused on the relationships between big railroads and big businesses which wanted and demanded favorable treatment. In what would become known as the Cleveland Massacre, John D. Rockefeller and Henry Flagler bought eighteen refineries, only one of which wasn't located in Cleveland over a month's time between mid-February and mid-March 1872. ==Formation== Thomas A. Scott, president of the Pennsylvania Railroad set up the South Improvement Company in the fall of 1871. A group representing the trunk railroad interests and oil refinery interests met in New York in late November, 1871, to discuss the creation of the company. Included in this meeting were William Henry Vanderbilt and John D. Rockefeller. The scheme was intended to benefit both the railroads and major refiners, notably those controlled by Rockefeller through secret rebates. Rockefeller had earlier merged several of the Cleveland area refineries and issued 2,000 shares of stock, of which 900 were controlled by Rockefeller and his partners. Rockefeller then started negotiations to collude with the three major railroads running through Cleveland: the Erie Railroad, the Pennsylvania Railroad, and the New York Central Railroad. The result of these secret negotiations were as follows: (1) The official rate per barrel from Cleveland to New York would be $2.56, but South Improvement would receive a $1.06 rebate; (2) The railroads would also pay South Improvement $1.06 per barrel of oil shipped that was not produced by South; (3) The railroads would also give reports of the shipping destinations, costs, and dates of all of South's competitors; (4) The commerce would be divided evenly among the railroads, with a double share going to Pennsylvania Railroad; and (5) South would provide tank cars and loading facilities. The secret concessions would have helped lessen the \\"vicious\\" competition among the railroad lines by giving a steady, standardized flow of commerce. Shares of the South Improvement Company were allocated to interests in the oil refining cities as follows: Pittsburgh received 485, Philadelphia received 505, Cleveland received 720, and New York received 180 (represented by Jabez A. Bostwick). Peter H. Watson, as president of the South Improvement Company, received 100 shares. Since both Bostwick and Watson were secretly allied with Standard Oil, Rockefeller kept control of the company from the Pennsylvania oil refiners and Pennsylvania Railroad interests. Charles Pratt of New York and John Dustin Archbold and Jacob Vandergrift of the oil regions had refused to join and so did not receive shares. John D. Rockefeller used the company as a tool to force Cleveland refiners to further consolidate. Between mid-February and mid-March 1872, John D. Rockefeller and Henry Flagler bought twenty-three companies, eighteen of which were oil refineries, and all but one of them were located in Cleveland. Historians would come to call this the \\"Cleveland Massacre.\\" An independent refiner who thought he could survive found that when he went to borrow money, all the Cleveland banks were in Standard Oil's pocket. Rockefeller had offered every important Cleveland banker a chance to buy Standard Oil stock, ensuring the welfare of the Standard Oil company. ==Dissolution== Word leaked out of the South Improvement Scheme, and the proposed 100% increase in rail shipping rates inflamed the independent producers and many smaller refineries. Following a summit and vocal protest by the independent oil producers and refiners led by Henry Huttleston Rogers and the Charles Pratt and Company refining interests of Brooklyn, New York, which came close to physical warfare in western Pennsylvania in March 1872 (and came to be known as the \\"Oil War\\"), the railroads agreed to back down. Crude oil suppliers formed their own organization called the Petroleum Producers' Union which levied a boycott on all members of the South Improvement Company on March 1, 1872. The producers' union also agreed to stop drilling wells for 30 days. On March 2, 1872, the Pennsylvania Railroad sent a message to the oil regions indicating that their lines would not harm the mutually beneficial relationship between the railroads and the producers. By March 9th, newspapers were generally attacking the South Improvement Company as an assault on free enterprise. On March 11, 1872, New York refiners sent a delegation to the oil regions to back the suppliers' opposition to the South Improvement Company. On March 23, John D. Rockefeller met with producers, refiners, and railroad leaders. On March 25, 1872, railroad leaders ended their contracts with the Southern Improvement Company and publicly announced that thereafter no rebates would be made or allowed. The state of Pennsylvania suspended its charter on April 2, 1872. On April 10, the suppliers' oil embargo was officially lifted. Two weeks after the railroad contracts with the South Improvement Company were ended, the Pennsylvania Railroad gave rebates to refiners on its lines. ==Aftermath== Following the end of the South Improvement Company, refiners were once again in a position where they competed with each other on a regional basis - now largely Rockefeller in Cleveland, Charles Lockhart in Pittsburgh, William G. Warden in Philadelphia, Charles Pratt in New York, and John Dustin Archbold in the oil regions. In April 1872, these leaders tried to coordinate with each other to obtain better rates from the railroads by creating the National Refiners' Association. This group would be administered by a central board of their own choosing, would operate in the open, would buy and allot crude oil to members via quota, and would negotiate with railroads on behalf of members. The oil producers did not object to the organization because the organizers made clear they were not seeking to reduce the price of crude oil. John D. Rockefeller was chosen to head the organization because refiners did not fear his takeover of this organization. The association collapsed at the beginning of the Panic of 1873. Standard Oil would buy up the interests of these four oil leaders by 1875 and they would in turn administer these regions for the company. ==See also== *Jay Gould *Ida M.

His father made his living buying and selling real estate in Florida's 1920s land rush. The family also moved to California for a time in conjunction with Carroll Sr.'s work, but eventually settled back in St. Petersburg, Florida. Bob Carroll Jr. attended St. Petersburg Junior College (now St. Petersburg College), where he studied French. He became a writer by happenstance. In 1940, he broke his hip in an accident. While he was recovering from his injury, he heard about a script writing contest being sponsored by local radio station WSUN. With plenty of time on his hands, the 21-year-old decided to try writing a radio script, which ended up winning the station's $10 prize. === Hollywood years === Concerned that he might never work, due to his injury, Carroll felt very fortunate when his brother-in-law helped him get a job as the front desk clerk for CBS Radio in Hollywood, California. There, Carroll got a kick out of making celebrities sign in. He eventually worked his way up into the publicity department and moved from there to assignments as a junior and eventually senior writer. There Carroll was teamed with fellow staffer Madelyn Pugh. The two created a partnership that lasted more than 50 years, and together wrote approximately 400 television episodes and 500 radio episodes. Though they briefly dated, they married other people. While writing for Steve Allen's early local radio program on CBS Radio station KNX in Los Angeles the duo became interested in writing for Lucille Ball's new radio series My Favorite Husband. In an effort to seize that opportunity, they paid Allen to write his own show one week so that they could focus their energies on creating a script submission for My Favorite Husband. Successful, the pair wrote for Ball's popular program for its 2½-year duration.LucyLibrary.com: Profile of Carroll and Pugh Carroll and Pugh helped develop and create a vaudeville act for Lucille Ball and her husband, Desi Arnaz, which became the basis for the pilot episode of the I Love Lucy series. Together the team tackled 39 episodes per season for the run of the show. Pugh and Carroll were nominated for three Emmys for their work on it; that total would likely have been considerably higher, but the Academy did not award Emmys to writers until 1954. The pair also wrote episodes of Ball's subsequent series, The Lucy Desi Comedy Hour, The Lucy Show, Here's Lucy, and, in 1986, her final sitcom, Life With Lucy. ===Later career=== The duo's non- Lucy credits include work on the television series The Paul Lynde Show, Dorothy, Those Whiting Girls and Kocham Klane. They created and wrote the successful Desilu series The Mothers-in-Law, which starred Lucille Ball's longtime MGM pals Eve Arden and Kaye Ballard. Carroll and Pugh served as executive producers and did some writing for the hit television series Alice, starring Linda Lavin, for which the duo won a Golden Globe Award. They also wrote the story basis for the film Yours, Mine and Ours (1968). In a 2005 interview with the St. Petersburg Times, Carroll discussed the fact that he and his writing partner Pugh did not receive any compensation for the I Love Lucy re-runs, as would be standard for writers today. He did, however, keep his sense of humor over the situation telling a reporter: \\"Do you think I'd be sitting here if I'd had residuals? I'd have flown you down to Cuba for this interview if I had.\\" He co-authored Madelyn Pugh Davis' memoir, Laughing with Lucy, released September 2005. Carroll died in Los Angeles after a brief illness. Divorced twice, he was survived by a daughter, Christina Carroll, of Los Angeles. ==Bibliography== * ==Awards== * Golden Globe for Alice * Writers' Guild of America Paddy Chayefsky Laurel Award for Television Achievement (1992) * Distinguished Alumni Award, St. Petersburg College (2005) ==Footnotes== ==References== * * TelevisionWeek obituary * Archive of American Television Interview Category:American male screenwriters Category:People from McKeesport, Pennsylvania Category:American television writers Category:1918 births Category:2007 deaths Category:American male television writers Category:Screenwriters from Pennsylvania Category:20th-century American male writers Category:20th-century American screenwriters ","title":"Bob Carroll Jr."},{"id":"1279825","text":"Käymäjärvi Inscriptions as drawn by Pierre Louis Maupertuis in 1737. The Käymäjärvi Inscriptions are two inscription-like mark rows on a stone approximately 52.5 cm high and 105 cm wide, engraved with characters similar to those in runic alphabets. The Käymäjärvi Inscriptions are near Lake Käymäjärvi, about 26 km northwest of Pajala in northern Sweden. The inscriptions were first reported in 1689 and were thought to be man made. According to a 2018 report by arthaeologist, geologists and historians, however, the inscriptions were found not to be man made but instead results of natural processes. ==First report== The Käymäjärvi Inscriptions were first reported by Olof Rudbeck, Sr. (1630–1702) in the second volume of Atlantica (1689). The local inhabitants, especially the Saami, considered the stone to carry a very important message from their ancestors. ==Second report== The second author to report the inscriptions was Eric Brunnius (1706–83) of Uppsala University in a discussion about the town of Tornio (De urbe Torna; 1731). Brunnius states that the stone has rune characters and the engraving of a triple crown which was degraded and is absent. The physicist Anders Celsius (1701–44), also an early runologist, concluded that the inscriptions were not of runic character. ==Third report== Celsius and Pierre Louis Maupertuis (1698–1759) visited the stone around 11 April 1737, during their Earth meridian measurement expedition. Celsius and Maupertuis both sketched the inscriptions in their diaries of the journey. The tale of this travel and stone, at that time considered to be very exotic in nature, was presented in his application to the Académie des Sciences and may have influenced the decision to elect him to the Academy. ==Report 2018== According to a study made by archaeologists, geologists and historians published in the Cambridge Archaeological Journal in 2018, the inscriptions were not man-made but instead a result of natural processess.https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/cambridge-archaeological- journal/article/alternative-pasts-and-colonial-engagements-in-the-north-the- materiality-and-meanings-of-the-pajala-runestone-vinsavaara-stone-northern- sweden/6F7DD1E99FC394CF92C6AA15B2CC85B4 Alternative Pasts and Colonial Engagements in the North: The Materiality and Meanings of the Pajala 'Runestone' (Vinsavaraa Stone), Northern Sweden ==Sources== *Tobé, Erik, \\"Maupertius' \\"Berättelse om en färd till det inre av Lappland för att finna ett gammalt minnesmärke\\"\\", Oknytt No. 1-4, 1999, Vol. 20 ===References=== Category:Inscriptions in undeciphered writing systems Category:Archaeological sites in Sweden Category:Geology of Sweden Category:Lapland (Sweden) ","title":"Käymäjärvi inscriptions"},{"id":"1279832","text":"Trashed is the second album by the punk rock group Lagwagon, released on January 4, 1994. ==Production and marketing== Like its predecessor, Duh, Trashed was recorded at Westbeach Recorders in 1993 with producer Fat Mike.

On 7 December 1901 the members of the Keio Rugby Club, selected by Tanaka and Clarke, took part in the first rugby game with foreigners at Yokohama. Clarke that day played as full-back and Tanaka as stand-off. Clarke continued to coach rugby at Keio until 1907, after which an injury to his right leg complicated by rheumatism, led to its amputation. In 1913, Clarke moved to a teaching post in Kyoto at the Third High School, and he became a professor of the literature department of Kyoto Imperial University in 1916. Clarke was an excellent academic and a prolific contributor to the Encyclopædia Britannica, under the initials \\"EB\\", and was in correspondence with Lafcadio Hearn.

The highway connects the city of São Paulo to the Atlantic coast and with the seaside cities of São Vicente and Praia Grande. It follows the route of Rodovia Anchieta and is also one of Brazil's busiest highways, especially on weekends. Rodovia dos Imigrantes has 44 viaducts, 7 bridges, and 11 tunnels, along its 58.5 km stretch. The highway has recently been expanded, in one of the most audacious feats of Brazilian highway engineering, with extremely long tunnels and high strutting six-lane bridges constructed over the tropical rain forest, which covers the steep faces of the Serra do Mar, the cliff range that separates the São Paulo plateau from the seaside lowlands. During sunny weekends, more than 1 million automobiles commonly cross its near 60 km run, separating the city of São Paulo from the sea. Rodovia dos Imigrantes was inaugurated in 1974, due to traffic saturation on Rodovia Anchieta. Although longer than Anchieta, Rodovia dos Imigrantes is nowadays busier due to its building standards, which permit higher speed limits, and its more direct path to the cities of Santos and Guarujá, the northern coast (with Bertioga), as well as the southern coast (with cities Praia Grande, Mongaguá, and Itanhaém). Meaning \\"immigrants' highway\\" in Portuguese, Rodovia dos Imigrantes was so named as a way to remember the contribution of immigrants to the cultural, economic, and social development of Brazil. It is managed by a state concession to the private company, Ecovias, which also maintains Rodovia Anchieta; it is, therefore, a toll road. The two carriageways of Rodovia dos Imigrantes are both fully reversible and traffic is managed to flow either bidirectionally (uphill on one carriageway and downhill on the other) or unidirectionally (uphill or downhill on both carriageways), depending on demand. In the unidirectional mode, the opposing traffic is diverted to Rodovia Anchieta. == Directions == The path of the Immigrant Road crosses the following municipalities, all in the state of São Paulo:São Paulo, Diadema, São Bernardo do Campo, Cubatão, São Vicente and Praia Grande. == Tolls == The Rodovia dos Imigrantes has been tolled since its inauguration. As in all the highways that suffered concessions, the tolls of the Imigrantes suffered strong readjustments, even after discounting inflation, considered excessive by significant users. Currently, the toll of Imigrantes is the most expensive in the state, at R $26.20, valid for a round trip by car. In the stretch of plateau, the Imigrantes presents three tolls of blockade to the access to the bordering localities. ==See also== * Brazilian Highway System * Highway system of São Paulo * Rodovia Anchieta ==References== ==External links== * Secretary of Transportation of the State Government of São Paulo * Ecovias Category:Highways in São Paulo (state) ","title":"Rodovia dos Imigrantes"},{"id":"1279907","text":"The Australian Gas Light Company (AGL) was an Australian gas and electricity retailer.

The company gradually diversified into electricity and into a number of different locations. After a combination of a merger and demerger with Alinta in 2006, it was replaced by AGL Energy. ==History== In 1837, AGL was given a royal charter charged with the responsibility of lighting Sydney's streets. The lights were lit on 24 May 1841 to celebrate the birthday of Queen Victoria. Town gas was first stored in holder tanks hewn out of solid sandstone at Darling Harbour.Australian gas Light Company. Sydney Plaques, accessed 28 February 2011. Later, a large gas works at Mortlake supplied gas which was used over an area of 600 square kilometres and piped up to 25 kilometres away. The Mortlake Ferry was constructed with the express purpose of delivering workers who lived on the north side of the harbour to their workplace.Cable Ferry Crossing, Mortlake. RTA NSW, accessed 28 February 2011. By 1925, the company was the seventh largest gas undertaking in the British Empire.Subterranean Sydney. Sydney Architecture, accessed 28 February 2011. In 1976, AGL converted from town gas to natural gas following the opening of the Moomba to Sydney Pipeline. In the later part of the 20th century, the company diversified into electricity generation, buying a stake in the Loy Yang Power Station and ownership of the Kiewa Hydroelectric Scheme, the Wattle Point Wind Farm, and a peak load gas- powered power station near Hallett in South Australia. The company also had significant ownership of gas pipelines plus electricity and gas distribution networks in Australia. In late 2006, AGL merged with Alinta and then demerged to create separate retail and infrastructure companies. The transactions were executed on 25 October 2006 via two schemes of arrangement, resulting in a revised Alinta holding both companies’ combined infrastructure and asset management businesses, and AGL Energy, which holds AGL’s energy business as well as approximately one third of Alinta’s West Australian retail and cogeneration business (AlintaAGL). ==References== == External links == * Australian Gas Light Company Category:Electric power companies of Australia Category:Defunct utility companies of Australia Category:Companies formerly listed on the Australian Securities Exchange Category:Food and drink companies established in 1837 Category:Energy companies established in 1837 Category:Australian companies established in 1837 ","title":"Australian Gas Light Company"},{"id":"1279910","text":"John Northampton (also known as John Comberton) (died 1398) was a reformist Lord Mayor of London in 1381 and 1382, during dissension in favour of reform of its Common Council in the early years of Richard II's reign. When the oligarchic leaders of London were able to engineer the overthrow of his faction, even the book of records of reform legislation was burned, known as the Jubilee book. The mob politics of such radical movements increased the uneasiness of the great about allowing popular participation in government. He had also served as Sheriff of London in 1376-77. ==Family== Northampton was raised in London, son of Thomas and Mariota Northampton. He is known to have had two brothers, William and Robert, and two sisters, Petronilla and Agnes. He was twice married. His first wife, living in 1371, was named Johanna, his second, to whom he was married by 1375, Petronilla, daughter of John Preston and Margaret Constantine (also spelt Constantyn). By one of those marriages he left a son named James. Northampton became alternatively known as John Comberton in the writings of chroniclers playing on the word comber (trouble) in reflection of the trouble that opponents thought his policies caused London. ==Career to 1383== Northampton came early into business in the city, being named as one of four 'upholders' of the Drapers' Guild in 1361. Outside his work he may have gained a turbulent reputation for he was bound over the keep the peace and refrain from affrays in the streets in 1365, 1369 and 1371. He entered city politics in the Common Council as Alderman for the Cordwainer Street Ward from 1375 to 1377, and became Sheriff of the city in 1376. He became leader of the faction in the city that supported John of Gaunt and John Wycliffe, in contrast to the other party led by William Walworth and John Philipot who supported the opposition to Gaunt. Following the Good Parliament of 1376, he was one of a cohort of Londoners who ousted Richard Lyons and others from city offices and introduced the rule that Common Council members be chosen according to craft guild affiliations rather than by city ward. In 1378 he was elected as Member of Parliament for the City in that year's parliament. He served two terms as Lord Mayor from 1381 to 1383, characterized by measures to help London's less prosperous citizens. He was opposed to the monopoly of the fishmongers, and broke this by enacting ordinances to open the markets to non-resident tradesmen and forbidding the wholesale purchase of fish for profit. He later applied such measures to trade in bread, ale, wine and poultry. He increased the circulation of farthings by reminting £80 into 76,000 coins, ordered bakers to make farthing measures of bread for sale, and ordered that traders, mass priests and others accept payments in the coin or give their services free. There were also moralistic ordinances made against prostitution, misrepresentation and false practices in business. A servant of Northampton's during his mayoralty was Thomas Usk who, after being arrested in 1384 by Northampton's rival Nicholas Brembre, gained release by informing on his former master through a legal appeal. ==Arrest, imprisonment, pardon== At the election in 1383 Northampton was ousted by Brembre, who packed the Guildhall with armed support and got himself elected. Brembre had Northampton arrested on charges of sedition on 7 February 1384, and provoking an 'insurrection' in the city on the 11th, involving shop closures by supporters. His kinsman, John Constantine, was executed for his part in leading this. Northampton and two associates, John More and Richard Norbury, were sentenced to death in trial before the King at Reading, Berkshire but this was commuted to 10 years' imprisonment, each man to be held in a separate prison at least 100 leagues outside London. Northampton, possibly through the influence of Cornish judge Sir Robert Tresilian, was confined at Tintagel. In 1386 the King pardoned Northampton but he remained banished from the city. Following the Merciless Parliament, as a result of which Brembre and Usk were executed in 1388, his situation improved with a full pardon granted in December 1390 and a full restoration of his citizenship in 1395. ==Last years== Northampton died in 1398 and was buried in the church of the Hospital of St Mary de Elsyngspital, Cripplegate. He had prospered to the extent of leaving property valued about £5,000, enabling him to be a benefactor to the Charterhouse monastery, to whose monks he made gifts of dates, figs and raisins during Lent. ==See also== *Thomas Usk ==References== ==External links== *Florilegium Urbanum: Party politics lead to civil disorder Category:Year of birth missing Category:14th-century lord mayors of London Category:Sheriffs of the City of London Category:English MPs 1378 Category:1398 deaths Category:Members of the Parliament of England for the City of London ","title":"John Northampton"},{"id":"1279914","text":"Wa'el Hamza Julaidan (, kunya: Abu al-Hasan (born 22 February 1958 in Medina, Saudi Arabia) is one of the original founders of al-Qaeda in August 1988.

From 2008 to 2016, he was the head coach of Stanford. He was a two-time All-American and national player of the year as a senior in 1986 while at Duke from 1982 to 1986. Dawkins subsequently played nine seasons in the National Basketball Association (NBA) with the San Antonio Spurs (1986–1989), Philadelphia 76ers (1989–1994), and Detroit Pistons (1994–1995). From 1998 to 2008, he served as an assistant basketball coach at his alma mater, Duke. ==Playing career== ===College=== Dawkins in the 1986 NCAA championship game Dawkins was born and raised in Washington, D.C. He played basketball at Mackin Catholic High School in Washington, D.C. before enrolling at Duke University. At Duke, he became the team's all-time leading scorer with 2,556 points, which stood until 2006 when J. J. Redick surpassed it. In Dawkins' senior year at Duke, the 1985–86 season, the Duke Blue Devils attained a win-loss record of 37–3, which was an NCAA record for both games played and games won in a single season. They reached the 1986 NCAA championship game, where they lost to Louisville, 72–69. In his senior season, Dawkins averaged 20.2 points per game and won the Naismith College Player of the Year Award, presented to the nation's top Collegiate Basketball Player. He also served as alternate on the 1984 United States Olympic basketball team. He graduated with a degree in political science. His jersey number 24 was later retired. Dawkins has received a number of honors, including selection to the ACC 50th Anniversary men's basketball team honoring the 50 greatest players in Atlantic Coast Conference history and being named the 78th greatest player in college basketball history by The Sporting News's book, Legends of College Basketball, in 2002. ===NBA=== In the 1986 NBA Draft, Dawkins was selected by the San Antonio Spurs as the 10th pick overall. He appeared in the 1987 NBA Slam Dunk Contest, where he finished sixth out of eight. He ended up playing in the NBA for nine seasons, also appearing for the Philadelphia 76ers and the Detroit Pistons. In his NBA career, he averaged 11.1 points, 5.5 assists and 2.5 rebounds. ==Coaching career== Following his NBA career, Dawkins went back to Duke University in 1996, where he worked as an administrative intern in the athletic department and was on the air as an analyst for Duke's home basketball games. He joined the Duke coaching staff in 1998, working alongside head coach Mike Krzyzewski. He was promoted to associate head coach in charge of player development in 1999. In April 2008, he was named head coach at Stanford University, succeeding Trent Johnson.

But Dawkins could not get over the hump in the NCAA tournament, with only one appearance (2014) in 8 seasons. On March 14, 2016, at the conclusion of his eighth season, and after a disappointing one NCAA appearance in eight seasons as head coach, Dawkins was relieved of his duties as head coach. On March 23, 2016, Dawkins was hired as head coach by the University of Central Florida. Shortly thereafter, his son, Aubrey Dawkins, transferred from Michigan to play for his father.

Power Loss: The Origins of Deregulation and Restructuring in the American Electric Utility System. MIT Press, 1999. Utility companies are traditionally a very conservative business with relatively little change or innovation since the beginning of the century. Tacoma Power's management team had the foresight to look into the future and predict some of the results that would come from deregulation of power companies. Deregulation would mean that power companies would no longer have their protected monopolies and they would be forced into more of a delivery business since they would still own the wires.Harry M. Trebing (2000). \\"Electricity: Changes and Issues\\" Review of Industrial Organization, 17: 61-74.

It has been largely covered over and filled in, but geographical traces of the creek can still be found. The natural amphitheatre known as Christie Pits is one such remnant; the off- leash dog \\"bowl\\" of Trinity Bellwoods Park is another. The name \\"Garrison Creek\\" was used because Fort York was built near the creek mouth. Volunteers lead popular tours of the course of the old watershed. ==History== Garrison Creek was one of a number of small natural watercourses on the site of the current city of Toronto. Starting in the 1870s, the stream was diverted into underground sewers under city streets and the original course was filled in with soil. By 1920, the stream was entirely diverted into the sewer system. There are many artifacts of the Creek's existence, including buried bridges along Harbord Street and Crawford Street south of Dundas Street. The unusual courses of Niagara Street (north of Fort York) and Vaughan Road (St. Clair and Bathurst area) indicate that they were once trails following the banks of the creek. Locations over the buried watercourse flooded during strong rainstorms in 2013. In 2013 particularly strong rainstorms caused the storm sewers that replaced Garrison Creek to flood, at Christie Pits, Trinity Bellwoods Park, and a railway underpass at King Street and Atlantic Avenue. Both Christie Pits and Trinity Bellwoods Park are over the original Garrison Creek Ravine, while the King and Atlantic intersection is over the course of Asylum Stream, a tributary that ran from just northwest of Fort York to Lisgar Street and Queen Street West near the former Provincial Asylum. ==Course== The stream had two sources, one north of St. Clair Avenue, near Humewood Public School, and the other northwest of the present-day Dufferin Street and St. Clair Avenue intersection.

It was occupied by pagan Old Prussian tribes in 1216, who struggled against their Christianization instigated by Bishop Christian of Oliva. After several unsuccessful attempts to reconquer Chełmno, Duke Konrad I of Masovia in 1226 called for support by the Teutonic Knights, who indeed approached and started a Prussian campaign, after the duke promised them the unshared possession of the Chełmno territory as part of the Order's State. In the course of the Order's decline after the 1410 Battle of Grunwald, the citizens of Chełmno, Toruń (Thorn) and Lubawa (Löbau) joined the uprising of the Prussian Confederation, which sparked the Thirteen Years' War between the Knights and the Kingdom of Poland.

It contains photographs of Marilyn Monroe taken by Carroll in 1952, on the set of the film Niagara, which had originally accompanied a 1952 article by Carroll in Weekend magazine. ==Publications== ===Non-fiction=== *1996 Falling For Marilyn: The Lost Niagara Collection (Stoddart) *1995 Glenn Gould: Some Portraits of The Artist as a Young Man (Stoddart) *1984 The Farm (Photographs by Reuben Sallows and John De Visser, text by Jock Carroll; Methuen) *1981 The Life and Times of Gregory Clark, Canada's Favorite Storyteller (Doubleday) *1974 Down The Road (Pocket Books) *1972 The Summer Olympic Games (Simon & Schuster) *1971 The Death of the Toronto Telegram and Other Newspaper Stories (Pocket Books) *1955 Korean Boy (with Pak Jong Yong; Macmillan) ===Fiction=== *1964 The Shy Photographer (Stein and Day; reprint of Bottoms Up) *1961 Bottoms Up (Olympia Press) ==References== Category:1919 births Category:1995 deaths Category:Canadian male journalists Category:Canadian male non-fiction writers Category:Canadian photojournalists Category:Journalists from Toronto Category:Writers from Toronto ","title":"Jock Carroll"},{"id":"1279974","text":"The Constitution of Austria () is the body of all constitutional law of the Republic of Austria on the federal level. It is split up over many different acts. Its centerpiece is the Federal Constitutional Law (Bundes- Verfassungsgesetz) (B-VG), which includes the most important federal constitutional provisions. Apart from the B-VG, there are many other constitutional acts (called Bundesverfassungsgesetze, singular Bundesverfassungsgesetz, abbrev. BVG, i.e. without the hyphen) and individual provisions in statutes and treaties which are designated as constitutional (Verfassungsbestimmung). For example, the B-VG does not include a bill of rights, but provisions on civil liberties are split up over various constitutional pieces of legislation. Over time, both the B-VG and the numerous pieces of constitutional law supplementing it have undergone hundreds of minor and major amendments and revisions. ==History== Austria has been governed by multiple constitutions, including the Pillersdorf Constitution in 1848, the \\"irrevocable\\" Stadion Constitution from 1848 to 1851, the October Diploma in 1860, the February Patent from 1861 until 1865. The B-VG was based on drafts whose principal author was Hans Kelsen and was first enacted on October 1, 1920. Since political agreement over a bill of rights could not be reached, the Basic Law on the General Rights of Citizens (Staatsgrundgesetz über die allgemeinen Rechte der Staatsbürger) of 1867 was left in place and designated as constitutional law. Originally, the B-VG was very parliamentarian in character. The prerogative to enact law was to lie with a comparatively strong parliament, the Federal Assembly composed of two houses, the National Council and the Federal Council. The responsibility for implementing law was to reside with a cabinet headed by a chancellor, who was nominated by the National Council on a motion by its principal committee. A relatively weak president, who was elected by both houses, was to serve as head of state. In 1929, the constitution underwent a revision significantly broadening the prerogatives of the president. In particular, the president from then on was to be elected directly by the people rather than by the members of the legislature. The president was also to be vested with the authority to dissolve the parliament, a power typically not held by heads of executive branches of parliamentary republics. He also had the authority to formally appoint the chancellor and the cabinet. Although the president was vested with powers comparable to those of the President of the United States, in practice he acted on the advice of the chancellor. This move away from a government steered predominantly by a fairly large and (by definition) fractioned deliberative body towards a system concentrating power in the hands of a single autonomous leader was made in an attempt to appease the para- fascist movements (such as the Heimwehr, or later the Ostmärkische Sturmscharen and the Social Democratic Republikanischer Schutzbund) thriving in Austria at that time. In 1934, following years of increasingly violent political strife and gradual erosion of the rule of law, the ruling Christian Social Party, which by then had turned to full-scale Austrofascism, formally replaced the constitution by a new basic law defining Austria as an authoritarian corporate state. The Austrofascist constitution was in force until Austria was annexed by Nazi Germany in 1938, ceasing to exist as a sovereign state. The Constitution of Austria was eventually reinstated on May 1, 1945, Austria having reestablished itself as an independent republic shortly before Nazi Germany's definitive collapse. The modifications enacted in 1929 were not then rescinded, and essentially remain in effect until this day, although the constitution has been heavily modified and amended since then. ==Structure== In area, the Republic of Austria is slightly smaller than Maine, Scotland, or Hokkaidō and home to an ethnically and culturally homogeneous population of eight and a half million people. Given that more than one fifth of its inhabitants are concentrated in the city of Vienna and its suburbs, the nation is also naturally unipolar in terms of both economic and cultural activity. Austria's constitutional framework nevertheless characterizes the republic as a federation consisting of nine autonomous federal states:B-VG, article 2, section (2). { style=\\"margin-left: 2em\\"   style=\\"padding-left: 1em\\"  English  style=\\"padding-left: 1em\\"  German  rowspan=\\"10\\"  States of Austria -  style=\\"padding-left: 1em\\"  1.  style=\\"padding-left: 1em\\"  Burgenland  style=\\"padding-left: 1em\\"  Burgenland -  style=\\"padding-left: 1em\\"  2.  style=\\"padding-left: 1em\\"  Carinthia  style=\\"padding-left: 1em\\"  Kärnten -  style=\\"padding-left: 1em\\"  3.  style=\\"padding-left: 1em\\"  Lower Austria  style=\\"padding-left: 1em\\"  Niederösterreich -  style=\\"padding-left: 1em\\"  4.  style=\\"padding-left: 1em\\"  Upper Austria  style=\\"padding-left: 1em\\"  Oberösterreich -  style=\\"padding-left: 1em\\"  5.  style=\\"padding-left: 1em\\"  Salzburg  style=\\"padding-left: 1em\\"  Salzburg -  style=\\"padding-left: 1em\\"  6.  style=\\"padding-left: 1em\\"  Styria  style=\\"padding-left: 1em\\"  Steiermark -  style=\\"padding-left: 1em\\"  7.  style=\\"padding-left: 1em\\"  Tyrol  style=\\"padding-left: 1em\\"  Tirol -  style=\\"padding-left: 1em\\"  8.  style=\\"padding-left: 1em\\"  Vorarlberg  style=\\"padding-left: 1em\\"  Vorarlberg -  style=\\"padding-left: 1em\\"  9.  style=\\"padding-left: 1em\\"  Vienna  style=\\"padding-left: 1em\\"  Wien } Just like the federation, the nine states of Austria all have written state constitutions defining them to be republican entities governed according to the principles of representative democracy. The state constitutions congruently define the states to be unicameral parliamentary democracies; each state has a legislature elected by popular vote and a cabinet appointed by its legislature. The federal constitution defines Austria itself as a bicameral parliamentary democracy with near-complete separation of powers. Austria's government structure is thus highly similar to that of incomparably larger federal republics such as Germany or the United States. The main practical difference between Austria on the one hand and Germany or the United States on the other hand is that Austria's states have comparatively little autonomy: almost all matters of practical importance, including but not limited to defense, foreign politics, criminal law, corporate law, most other aspects of economic law, education, academia, welfare, telecommunications, and the health care system, lie with the federation. This is also true for the judiciary system, which is exclusively federal in Austria, meaning that there are no state courts. ==Federal legislature== Federal legislative powers are vested in a body the constitution refers to as a parliament. Ever since the somewhat paradoxical 1929 revision of the constitution, which strengthened the formal separation of powers in Austria at the instigation of sympathizers of fascism, Austria's legislature technically bears more resemblance to a congress than to a parliament. As a practical matter, however, it continues to function as a parliament anyway. Austria's parliament consists of two houses, the National Council and the Federal Council. The 183 members of the National Council are elected by nationwide popular vote under statutes aiming at party-list proportional representation. The currently 64 members of the Federal Council are elected by Austria's nine state legislatures under a statute allocating seats roughly proportional to state population size (The largest Bundesland being entitled to twelve members, the others accordingly, but no state to less than three.) In theory, the National Council and the Federal Council are peers. As a practical matter, the National Council is decidedly more powerful; the predominance of the National Council is such that Austrians frequently use the term \\"parliament\\" to refer to just the National Council instead of to the parliament as a whole. While bicameral legislatures such as the Congress of the United States allow bills to originate in both chambers, Austrian federal legislation always originates in the National Council, never in the Federal Council. In theory, bills can be sponsored by National Council members, by the federal cabinet, by popular initiative, or through a motion supported by at least one-third of the members of the Federal Council. In practice, most bills are proposed by the cabinet and passed after mere token debate. Bills passed by the National Council are sent to the Federal Council for affirmation. If the Federal Council approves of the bill or simply does nothing for a period of eight weeks, the bill has succeeded. Bills passed by both houses (or passed by the National Council and ignored by the Federal Council) are ultimately signed into law by the federal president. The president does not have the power to veto bills, his or her signature is a technical formality notarizing that the bill has been introduced and resolved upon in accordance to the procedure stipulated by the constitution. The president does not even have the authority to refuse signing a bill he or she deems unconstitutional as such; a bill may be vetoed only on the grounds that its genesis, not its substance, is in violation of basic law. Adjudicating upon the constitutionality of the bill itself is the exclusive prerogative of the Constitutional Court. Provided that the bill in question neither amends the constitution such that states' rights are curtailed nor in some other way pertains to the organization of the legislature itself, the National Council can force the bill into law even if the Federal Council rejects it; a National Council resolution overruling a Federal Council objection merely has to meet a higher quorum than a regular resolution. For this reason, the Federal Council has hardly any real power to prevent the adoption of legislation, the National Council being able to override it easily. The Federal Council is sometimes compared to the British House of Lords, another deliberative body able to stall but usually not to strike down proposed law. While the House of Lords occasionally exercises its stalling power, however, the Federal Council hardly ever does. Since the parties controlling the National Council consistently also hold a majority in the Federal Council, the latter gives its blessing to essentially everything the former has adopted. ==Federal executive== Federal executive authority is shared by the federal president and federal cabinet. The president is elected by popular vote for a term of six years and limited to two consecutive terms of office. The president is the head of state and appoints the cabinet, a body consisting of the federal chancellor and a number of ministers. The president also appoints the members of the Constitutional Court and numerous other public officials, represents the republic in international relations, accredits foreign ambassadors, and acts as the nominal commander in chief of Austria's armed forces. While Austria's federal cabinet is technically not answerable to the legislature (except for a motion of censure), it would be almost totally paralyzed without the active support of the National Council. Since constitutional convention prevents the president from using his power to dissolve the National Council on his own authority, the president is unable to hector the legislature into doing his or her bidding, and the cabinet is for all intents and purposes subject to National Council approval. The cabinet's composition therefore reflects National Council election results rather than presidential election outcomes. After elections, it is customary for the President to ask the leader of the strongest party to become chancellor and form a cabinet. Since this party leader, for all intents and purposes, needs a majority in the National Council, he will usually seek to form a coalition with another political party or parties. The coalition then agrees on a list of ministers, customarily including the coalition parties' leaders. Obviously, if a party holds a majority in the National Council all by itself, no such coalition is needed. This has happened in the past, but, owing to the growing number of political parties in Austria and the system of proportional representation will not likely again any time soon. The list is then submitted to the president by the chancellor-to-be; the president usually adopts it without much argument, although there has been at least one case in recent history where the president did refuse to install a minister. The president retains the right to dismiss the whole cabinet at will, or certain ministers of it at the request of the chancellor. Although elected for a five-year term, the National Council can dissolve itself at any time, bringing about new elections. The federal chancellor's dual role as executive officeholder and heavyweight party official well-connected to the legislature makes him or her far more powerful than the formally senior federal president. Actual executive authority thus lies with the chancellor and his or her ministers, while the federal president is a figurehead rather than an actual head of government. Austria's presidents are largely content with their ceremonial role, striving for the role of impartial mediator and dignified elder statesman, and more or less consistently steer clear of the murky waters of hands-on politics. In recent times, however, former president Heinz Fischer was known to comment on current political issues from time to time. ==Judicial and administrative review== Federal and state judicial authority, in particular responsibility for judicial review of administrative acts, lies with the Administrative and Constitutional Court System, a structure essentially consisting of the Constitutional Court and the Administrative Court. The Constitutional Court examines the constitutionality of laws passed by Parliament, the legality of regulations by Federal ministers and other administrative authorities and finally alleged infringements of constitutional rights of individuals through decisions of the lower administrative courts. It also tries disputes between the federation and its member states, demarcation disputes between other courts and impeachments of the federal president (serving as State Court in that matter.) The Administrative Court tries all kinds of cases which involve ex officio decisions by public officials or bodies and which are not dealt with by the Constitutional Court. Note that only the Constitutional Court has the authority to strike down laws. In recent years, an increasing number of tribunals of a judicial nature (article 133 point 4 B-VG) hade been introduced in a number of areas to improve the review of the conduct of administrative authorities. The most important among them were the Länder independent administrative chambers (Unabhängige Verwaltungssenate - UVS), who decided, amongst other things, on second authority in proceedings relating to administrative contraventions as well as recourses against acts of direct exercise of command and constraint power from administrative authorities. Other such chambers were competent in the area of tax law (Unabhängiger Finanzsenat- UFS), in terms of asylum (Unabhängiger Bundesasylsenat - UBAS), in relation to environmental matters (Unabhängiger Umweltsenat) or in the field of telecommunications (Unabhängiger Bundeskommunikationssenat). Although all these tribunals were formally part of the administrative organization, their members hade guarantees of independence and irremovability and may thus be compared to jurisdictions. Their rulings may have been challenged before the Administrative or the Constitutional Court. In 2014 these administrative tribunals have been abolished in favour of eleven administrative courts, one of each in every state (Landesverwaltungsgerichte) and two on federal level (Bundesverwaltungsgericht, Bundesfinanzgericht). The Austrian constitution was the first in the world (nearly contemporaneous with Czechoslovakia) to enact judicial review. It had been established in 1919 and gained the right to revise the laws of the federal states that year. After the new constitution had been adopted in 1920 it was also entitled to revise national laws according to the constitution. This scheme of a separate constitutional court reviews legislative acts for their constitutionality came to be known as the \\"Austrian system\\". After the U.S. and the British Dominions (such as Canada and Australia), where the regular court system is in charge of judicial review, Austria was one of the earliest countries to have judicial review at all (although the Czechoslovak Constitution came into force earlier, the establishment of the Court's new rights itself predated the Czechoslovak Court by a couple of months). Many European countries adopted the Austrian system of review after World War II. == Judiciary == Judicial powers not committed to the Administrative and Constitutional Court System are vested with the Civil and Criminal Court System, a structure consisting of civil courts on the one hand and criminal courts on the other hand. Civil courts try all cases in which both the claimant and the respondent are private citizens or corporations, including but not limited to contract and torts disputes: Austria's legal system, having evolved from that of the Roman Empire, implements civil law and therefore lacks the distinction between courts of law and courts of equity sometimes found in common law jurisdictions. Civil courts do not try suits against the federation or its states in their capacity as administrative units, but only when acting in the form of private law. Most cases are tried before District Courts (Bezirksgerichte, abbrev.: BG, singular: Bezirksgericht), with Regional Courts (Landesgerichte, abbrev.: LG, singular: Landesgericht) serving as courts of appeal and the Supreme Court (Oberster Gerichtshof, abbrev.: OGH) serving as the court of last resort. In cases considered particularly grave or technically involved, the Regional Courts serve as courts of first instance and specialized Regional Courts of Appeal (Oberlandesgerichte, abbrev.: OLG, singular: Oberlandesgericht) serve as courts of appeal, the Supreme Court still being the court of last resort. Unlike with court systems such as that of the United States federal judiciary, parties have a statutory right to appeal. Although access to the Supreme Court has been successively restricted to matters of some importance in recent years, higher courts can generally not simply refuse to review a decision reached by subordinate courts. Note that the Supreme Court (Oberster Gerichtshof - OGH), the Constitutional Court (Verfassungsgerichtshof - VfGH) and the Administrative Court (Verwaltungsgerichtshof - VwGH) are three separate high courts, none being senior to the other two. ==Civil and human rights== Most closely resembling a bill of rights in Austria is the Basic Law on the General Rights of Nationals of the Kingdoms and Länder represented in the Council of the Realm, a decree issued by Emperor Franz Josef on December 21, 1867 in response to pressure by liberal insurgents. A very important part of Austria's canon of constitutional civil liberties thus originated as an imperatorial edict predating the current Constitution of Austria by roughly fifty years, the reason being that the framers of the Constitution in 1920 could not agree on a set of civil liberties to include in the constitution proper: as a lowest common denominator, they resorted to this Basic Law of 1867. Since then, other civil liberties have been set out in other constitutional laws, and Austria is party to the European Convention of Human Rights, which, too, has been implemented as a directly applicable constitutional law in Austria. Given the fact that the Constitutional Court has begun to interpret the B-VG's equal treatment clause and other constitutional rights rather broadly since at least the early 1980s, civil rights are, as a general matter, relatively well protected. ==Further checks and balances== In addition to their legislative capacity, the members of the two houses of parliament have the authority to impeach the president, who is then tried before the Constitutional Court, serving as State Court, or call for a referendum to have the federal president removed from office. Exertion of these emergency powers is a two-step process: first the National Council requests the president to be impeached or subjected to referendum, then the members of the National Council and the Federal Council convene in joint session, thus forming the National Assembly, and decide on the National Council's motion. If a referendum is held, and the President is not removed from office by popular vote, he is automatically considered re-elected for another six-year term (although he may still not serve for more than twelve consecutive years). The National Council will then be dissolved automatically and new general elections must be held. The president may also dissolve the National Council, but only once for the same reason during his term of office. Note that the president does not have the power to veto specific acts of legislation: no matter how vehemently he objects to some particular bill, or believes it to be unconstitutional, all he can actually do is threaten to dismiss the government or dissolve the National Council before the bill is actually passed. Needless to say, none of these emergency powers have been exercised thus far. ==Criticism and reform proposals== Perhaps the most unusual aspect of Austrian constitutional law is the relative ease with which it can be changed, combined with the fact that a constitutional amendment need not be incorporated into the main text of the B-VG, or for that matter any of the more important parts of the constitutional body, but can be enacted as a separate constitutional act, or even as a simple section within any act, simply designated as \\"constitutional\\" (Verfassungsbestimmung). In reality, all that is needed is a majority of two-thirds in the National Council. Only in the case of a fundamental change (\\"Gesamtänderung\\") of the constitution a confirmation by referendum is required. Austria's accession to EU in 1995 was considered such a change. Over the years, the Austrian legal system became littered with thousands of constitutional provisions, split up over numerous acts. The reason for this was in many cases that the legislaturein particular when the governing coalition possessed a two-thirds majority in the National Council (such as between 1945–1966, 1986–1994, 1995–1999, and 2007–2008)enacted laws that were considered \\"constitutionally problematic\\" as constitutional laws, effectively protecting them from judicial review by the Constitutional Court. There have even been cases where a provision that had been previously declared unconstitutional by the competent Constitutional Court has subsequently been enacted as constitutional law. Needless to say, the Constitutional Court did and does not like that practice, and has declared that it might, in a not-too-distant future, consider such changes, in their entirety, as \\"fundamental change\\" to the Constitution, which would require a public referendum. From 2003 to 2005, a constitutional convention (Österreich Konvent) consisting of representatives of all parties, representatives of all layers of government and many groups of Austrian society debated whether and how to reform the constitution. There was no general consensus on a draft for a new constitution, however, and some minor points that were universally agreed upon have yet to be implemented. == See also == === Former constitutions === * Pillersdorf Constitution (1848) * Kremsier Constitution (1848) * March Constitution (1849) * October Diploma (1860) * February Patent (1861) * December Constitution (1867) * May Constitution (1934) === Others === *Judiciary *Rechtsstaat *Rule of law *Rule According to Higher Law *Linguistic rights == References == * Bundes-Verfassungsgesetz (B-VG).

Originating in Bristol, England, they rose to fame in the 1990s with their UK-charting singles \\"The Gift\\" and \\"Ajare\\", and their debut studio album Way Out West was released in 1997 to critical and commercial success. Their 2001 follow-up, Intensify, also garnered chart success, along with its singles \\"The Fall\\", \\"Intensify\\" and \\"Mindcircus\\", the latter of which reached number one on the UK Dance Chart. Way Out West temporarily became a trio in 2004 with the addition of singer Omi (Emma Everett) for their third studio album, Don't Look Now. In 2009, their fourth album We Love Machine was released, and after a near eight-year hiatus, they released their fifth album Tuesday Maybe in 2017. Additionally, they are known for their remixes for artists such as Sasha, Reel 2 Real, Paul van Dyk, Orbital, BT and Tiësto. They have produced and performed together for over twenty five years, and have both had success as solo musicians and DJs respectively. ==History== ===1992–97: Way Out West=== In the early 1990s, the duo met in a record store that Nick Warren was working in, and discovered their similar direction in music. They then initially produced music under the names Sub-Version 3 and Echo while also releasing remixes as Way Out West, as a side-project. Following the success of their remixes, Way Out West became their main project and the duo signed a deal with Deconstruction Records. Way Out West began releasing singles in 1994, including \\"Shoot\\", \\"Montana\\", and \\"Ajare\\". \\"Ajare\\" became a club hit, initially peaking at #52 in the UK Dance Chart that year. In 1996, the duo released another two singles: \\"Domination\\", and the UK Top 15 hit, \\"The Gift\\" (which sampled Joanna Law's cover version of \\"The First Time Ever I Saw Your Face\\"). \\"The Gift\\" would later be used for the title theme of the MTV television show True Life. On 1 September 1997, the duo released their eponymous debut studio album, Way Out West. The album included most of their previous singles, and also spawned the singles \\"Blue\\" (a reinterpretation of the theme from the film Withnail and I), and a 1997 re-release of \\"Ajare\\", which achieved greater success than the original, charting at position #36 in the UK. ===2000–02: Intensify=== On 27 November 2000, Way Out West released their single, \\"The Fall\\", (which sampled Coldcut's cover of \\"Autumn Leaves\\") through BMG; the former parent company of the group's previous label Deconstruction (defunct in 1998). \\"The Fall\\" peaked at #61 on the UK Singles Chart and was followed by the group's final release on BMG, the UB Devoid EP. Two of the EP's tracks would later go on to feature on their then-upcoming album. On 20 August 2001, Way Out West released their second studio album, Intensify. The album's release was marked by a move from the defunct Deconstruction Records to Distinctive Records, and a change in their sound, from club instrumentals and sampled vocals to a mixture of club tracks and original songs. Singles from the album included \\"The Fall\\", \\"Mindcircus\\" (which reached number 1 in the UK Dance Chart), and the club hit \\"Intensify\\". \\"Activity\\" from this release also appeared in the 2001 PlayStation 2 game Kinetica and Paul van Dyks album The Politics of Dancing. ===2003–04: Don't Look Now=== In 2003, the duo released the song \\"Killa\\", which was later remixed by Orkidea and gained club popularity. \\"Killa\\" was also featured the 2005 video game Juiced. In 2004, Way Out West became a trio with the addition of vocalist Omi (Emma Everett), the group's only ever third member. Later that year, the group then released their third studio album, Don't Look Now. Excluding \\"Killa\\", the album spawned two singles: \\"Anything but You\\" (featured in the video game Tiger Woods PGA Tour 07) and \\"Don't Forget Me\\" (featured in season two of Grey's Anatomy). Other songs from the album include \\"Melt\\" (appeared in The O.C. as well as the season 2 episode \\"Bones of Contention\\" for the series Numb3rs), and \\"Just Like a Man\\" (appeared on season 3, episode 8 of CSI: Miami).Just Like A Man on CSI: Miami, YouTube video ===2008–10: We Love Machine=== In 2008, Way Out West contributed the song \\"Evelina\\" to the Survival International charity album, Songs for Survival. In 2009, Way Out West returned as a duo and moved to the label Hope Recordings, of which Nick Warren continues to be the A&R; manager. The duo's fourth album, We Love Machine, was released on 5 October 2009. The song \\"Only Love\\" with Jonathan Mendelsohn performing vocals (their first collaboration with a male vocalist) was the first single from the album, released on 31 August 2009, followed by \\"Future Perfect\\" on 7 December. The album was released on Hope Recordings and Armada Music. In April 2010, Deconstruction Records re-released \\"The Gift\\" together with remixes by Logistics, Gui Boratto, Tek-One and Michael Woods; Way Out West themselves also recorded a new remix of the track. Later that year, We Love Machine – The Remixes was released via Hope Recordings. The release featured remixes of tracks from We Love Machine by producers such as Scuba, Henry Saiz, Jaytech and D. Ramirez. ===2017–present: Tuesday Maybe=== In April 2017, Way Out West announced their fifth studio album Tuesday Maybe, with the release of three web-exclusive singles: \\"Oceans\\" (featuring Liu Bei), \\"The Call\\" (featuring Doe Paoro) and \\"Slam\\". The album also features their 2016 singles \\"Tuesday Maybe\\" and \\"Set My Mind\\". The album was released on 16 June 2017 through Anjunadeep. In January 2018, Wisternoff hosted a Reddit AMA and hinted at upcoming work from Way Out West, claiming \\"Me and Nick are working on new material together\\". He also announced a then upcoming remix album for Tuesday Maybe. On 2 February 2018, the remix album, Tuesday Maybe (Remixed), was released on digital download stores. In 2018, Way Out West announced a five track EP comprising chill-out remixes of songs from Tuesday Maybe, titled Sunday Maybe. The EP's release was supported by the single \\"Sunday Maybe\\" on 3 April 2018, and was released on 20 April, on Anjunadeep. ==Live performances== In support of their third studio album Don't Look Now in 2003 & 2004, the duo expanded from their DJ roots to a full-fledged touring collective, playing at festivals such as Glastonbury 2003 & 2004, Creamfields, and The Glade. The band had supported Faithless on their Australian tour in October 2004, and embarked on their own tour in the US in May and November 2004. In September 2017, Way Out West announced a UK concert tour to promote the release of Tuesday Maybe through their social media. The tour commenced in February 2018 and concluded in March the same year. ===2001–03, 2017–18=== * Jody Wisternoff - keyboards, synths, samples, programming * Nick Warren - engineering * Adam Pickard (The Orb, The String Cheese Incident) - drums, electronic percussion ===2004=== * Jody Wisternoff - keyboards, synths, samples, programming * Nick Warren - engineering * Omi (Emma Everett) - vocals * George Vjestica (Groove Armada, Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds) - guitars * Joe Allen (Alison Moyet, Roni Size) - bass * Damon Reece (Massive Attack, The Orb, Goldfrapp, Spiritualized, Echo & the Bunnymen, Lupine Howl.[ Lupine Howl] at Allmusic[ Reverberation] at Allmusic \\\\- drums, electronic percussion ===2016=== * Jody Wisternoff - keyboards, synths, samples, programming * Nick Warren - engineering * Josh Devine (One Direction) - drums, electronic percussion ===2018=== * Jody Wisternoff - keyboards, synths, samples, programming * Nick Warren - engineering, electronic percussion ==Discography== ;Studio albums * Way Out West (1997) * Intensify (2001) * Don't Look Now (2004) * We Love Machine (2009) * Tuesday Maybe (2017) ==References== ==External links== *Official site * * *Twitter account *Last.fm profile *Facebook fan page Category:English house music groups Category:Musical groups from Bristol Category:Musical groups established in 1994 Category:English musical duos Category:Electronic music duos Category:Trip hop groups Category:Big beat groups Category:Progressive house musicians ","title":"Way Out West (duo)"},{"id":"1279988","text":"Stéphane Yvon Quintal (born October 22, 1968) is a Canadian former professional ice hockey player who played in the National Hockey League (NHL) for 16 seasons. He is currently the senior vice president of player safety for the NHL. ==Playing career== Quintal played 16 NHL seasons before retiring as a player in August 2005. He had been the last Montreal Canadiens player to wear number 5 before the Canadiens retired it in honour of Bernard \\"Boom-Boom\\" Geoffrion. Quintal joined the Department of Player Safety, one of the NHL's disciplinary arms, at its creation at the opening of the 2011–12 season. The head of the department was initially Brendan Shanahan, who left his position after the completion of the 2013–14 regular season to become president of the Toronto Maple Leafs. At the time, Quintal became the head of the department on an interim basis. On September 8, 2014, the NHL named Quintal the permanent head of the department with the title of senior vice president of player safety. Quintal continued Shanahan's practice of releasing videos explaining his rulings on plays that were sent to the league office for review. However, he only narrates French-language videos for incidents involving the Canadiens or Ottawa Senators, a practice dating to when Shanahan ran the department. All other videos are narrated by a deputy, Patrick Burke. ==Career statistics== ===Regular season and playoffs=== { border=\\"0\\" cellpadding=\\"1\\" cellspacing=\\"0\\" style=\\"text-align:center; width:60em\\" - bgcolor=\\"#e0e0e0\\" ! colspan=\\"3\\" bgcolor=\\"#ffffff\\"  ! rowspan=\\"99\\" bgcolor=\\"#ffffff\\"  ! colspan=\\"5\\"  Regular season ! rowspan=\\"99\\" bgcolor=\\"#ffffff\\"  ! colspan=\\"5\\"  Playoffs - bgcolor=\\"#e0e0e0\\" !

David Levy, through his connections to McCartney's management, delivered the studio session, complete with all the stems, to Maas.Billboard.\\"Mystery 1985 Revealed\\", \\"Billboard\\". Over the proceeding few months, Maas tried working on the stems with different people after a while the project went back on the shelf. It was only a few years later when Maas played the unfinished work to his good friend and My Favorite Robot label head James Teej, that the pair felt they could do something with it. The duo spent a week listening to different parts and working intensely on the track until it was finished. The track was sent to McCartney's team from whom it got the approval for release.Music Radar. \\"Timo Maas on his love for Music\\", \\"Music Radar\\". What followed was a marketing strategy generated by Maas' management that saw the vinyl being released as an unknown white label with only Paul McCartney's face stamped on it on the Phonica Records website. The vinyl-run was limited and sold out in a few hours, having its prices soar to upwards $400 on eBay and other websites and going #1 on Phonica Records’ website. There was some speculation whether the vinyl was officially sanctioned by McCartney himself, but eventually got conclusive proof on its origins. The story of its overnight success got quickly picked up by major publications such as I-D magazine,I-d. \\"As the world's greatest living songwriter just dropped a mysterious new record?\\", \\"I-d Vice\\". Billboard, NME,NME. , \\"NME\\". Rolling Stone Germany,Rolling Stone. \\"Video Premier 1985 Remix\\", \\"Rolling Stone\\". Clash Magazine.Clash Music. \\"That Sweet Stuff\\", \\"Clash Music\\". The track was positively received and played by many industry heavyweights such as Pete Tong,Soundcloud. , \\"Soundcloud\\". Annie Mac,Soundcloud. , \\"Soundcloud\\". Seth Troxler and Damian Lazarus. The inspiration behind the remix was to come up with a modern take of a classic song with respect to the original, with more emphasis on the bass and reinforcing McCartney's blues-inspired vocals. The record got its official release on Virgin in June 2016, followed by a remix package featuring versions from Paul Woolford,Cool Hunting. \\"1985 - Paul Woolford Rework\\", \\"Cool Hunting\\".

Four major types of seismograms, or seismic signatures. A harmonic tremor is a sustained release of seismic and infrasonic energy typically associated with the underground movement of magma, the venting of volcanic gases from magma, or both. It is a long-duration release of seismic energy, with distinct spectral lines, that often precedes or accompanies a volcanic eruption. More generally, a volcanic tremor is a sustained signal that may or may not possess these harmonic spectral features. Being a long-duration continuous signal from a temporally extended source, a volcanic tremor contrasts distinctly with transient sources of seismic radiation, such as tremors that are typically associated with earthquakes and explosions.

Freya worked at higher frequencies, and was thus smaller than its Chain Home counterpart. The anode block of the original cavity magnetron built by Randal and Boot, which provided a leap forward in radar design. The history of radar (where radar stands for RAdio Detection And Ranging) started with experiments by Heinrich Hertz in the late 19th century that showed that radio waves were reflected by metallic objects. This possibility was suggested in James Clerk Maxwell's seminal work on electromagnetism. However, it was not until the early 20th century that systems able to use these principles were becoming widely available, and it was German inventor Christian Hülsmeyer who first used them to build a simple ship detection device intended to help avoid collisions in fog (Reichspatent Nr. 165546). Numerous similar systems, which provided directional information to objects over short ranges, were developed over the next two decades. The development of systems able to produce short pulses of radio energy was the key advance that allowed modern radar systems to come into existence. By timing the pulses on an oscilloscope, the range could be determined and the direction of the antenna revealed the angular location of the targets. The two, combined, produced a \\"fix\\", locating the target relative to the antenna. In the 1934–1939 period, eight nations developed independently, and in great secrecy, systems of this type: the United Kingdom, Germany, the United States, the USSR, Japan, the Netherlands, France, and Italy. In addition, Britain shared their information with the United States and four Commonwealth countries: Australia, Canada, New Zealand, and South Africa, and these countries also developed their own radar systems. During the war, Hungary was added to this list.Raymond C. Watson, Jr.; Radar Origins Worldwide’’, Trafford Publishing, 2009. The term RADAR was coined in 1939 by the United States Signal Corps as it worked on these systems for the Navy.Part 4 – America Between The Wars; Progress during the war was rapid and of great importance, probably one of the decisive factors for the victory of the Allies. A key development was the magnetron in the UK, which allowed the creation of relatively small systems with sub-meter resolution. By the end of hostilities, Britain, Germany, the United States, the USSR, and Japan had a wide variety of land- and sea-based radars as well as small airborne systems. After the war, radar use was widened to numerous fields including: civil aviation, marine navigation, radar guns for police, meteorology and even medicine. Key developments in the post-war period include the travelling wave tube as a way to produce large quantities of coherent microwaves, the development of signal delay systems that led to phased array radars, and ever- increasing frequencies that allow higher resolutions. Increases in signal processing capability due to the introduction of solid state computers has also had a large impact on radar use. == Significance == The place of radar in the larger story of science and technology is argued differently by different authors. On the one hand, radar contributed very little to theory, which was largely known since the days of Maxwell and Hertz. Therefore, radar did not advance science, but was simply a matter of technology and engineering. Maurice Ponte, one of the developers of radar in France, states: But others point out the immense practical consequences of the development of radar. Far more than the atomic bomb, radar contributed to the Allied victory in World War II. Robert BuderiBuderi, Robert; The Invention that Changed the World, Simon & Schuster, 1996 states that it was also the precursor of much modern technology. From a review of his book: In later years radar was used in scientific instruments, such as weather radar and radar astronomy. ==Early contributors== ===Heinrich Hertz=== In 1886–1888 the German physicist Heinrich Hertz conducted his series of experiments that proved the existence of electromagnetic waves (including radio waves), predicted in equations developed in 1862–4 by the Scottish physicist James Clerk Maxwell. In Hertz's 1887 experiment he found that these waves would transmit through different types of materials and also would reflect off metal surfaces in his lab as well as conductors and dielectrics. The nature of these waves being similar to visible light in their ability to be reflected, refracted, and polarized would be shown by Hertz and subsequent experiments by other physicists.Such experiments were conducted by Oliver Lodge, Jagadish Chandra Bose, and Alexander Stepanovich Popov. === Guglielmo Marconi === Radio pioneer Guglielmo Marconi noticed radio waves were being reflected back to the transmitter by objects in radio beacon experiments he conducted on March 3, 1899 on Salisbury Plain. In 1916 he and British engineer Charles Samuel Franklin used short- waves in their experiments, critical to the practical development of radar. He would relate his findings 6 years later in a 1922 paper delivered before the Institution of Electrical Engineers in London: ===Christian Hülsmeyer=== In 1904, Christian Hülsmeyer gave public demonstrations in Germany and the Netherlands of the use of radio echoes to detect ships so that collisions could be avoided. His device consisted of a simple spark gap used to generate a signal that was aimed using a dipole antenna with a cylindrical parabolic reflector. When a signal reflected from a ship was picked up by a similar antenna attached to the separate coherer receiver, a bell sounded. During bad weather or fog, the device would be periodically spun to check for nearby ships. The apparatus detected the presence of ships up to , and Hülsmeyer planned to extend its capability to . It did not provide range (distance) information, only warning of a nearby object. He patented the device, called the telemobiloscope, but due to lack of interest by the naval authorities the invention was not put into production. Hülsmeyer also received a patent amendment for estimating the range to the ship. Using a vertical scan of the horizon with the telemobiloscope mounted on a tower, the operator would find the angle at which the return was the most intense and deduce, by simple triangulation, the approximate distance. This is in contrast to the later development of pulsed radar, which determines distance via two-way transit time of the pulse. ==United Kingdom== Robert Watson-Watt In 1915, Robert Watson Watt joined the Meteorological Office as a meteorologist, working at an outstation at Aldershot in Hampshire. Over the next 20 years, he studied atmospheric phenomena and developed the use of radio signals generated by lightning strikes to map out the position of thunderstorms. The difficulty in pinpointing the direction of these fleeting signals using rotatable directional antennas led, in 1923, to the use of oscilloscopes in order to display the signals. The operation eventually moved to the outskirts of Slough in Berkshire, and in 1927 formed the Radio Research Station (RRS), Slough, an entity under the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research (DSIR). Watson Watt was appointed the RRS Superintendent. As war clouds gathered over Britain, the likelihood of air raids and the threat of invasion by air and sea drove a major effort in applying science and technology to defence. In November 1934, the Air Ministry established the Committee for the Scientific Survey of Air Defence (CSSAD) with the official function of considering \\"how far recent advances in scientific and technical knowledge can be used to strengthen the present methods of defence against hostile aircraft\\". Commonly called the \\"Tizard Committee\\" after its Chairman, Sir Henry Tizard, this group had a profound influence on technical developments in Britain. H. E. Wimperis, Director of Scientific Research at the Air Ministry and a member of the Tizard Committee, had read about a German newspaper article claiming that the Germans had built a death ray using radio signals, accompanied by an image of a very large radio antenna. Both concerned and potentially excited by this possibility, but highly skeptical at the same time, Wimperis looked for an expert in the field of radio propagation who might be able to pass judgement on the concept. Watt, Superintendent of the RRS, was now well established as an authority in the field of radio, and in January 1935, Wimperis contacted him asking if radio might be used for such a device. After discussing this with his scientific assistant, Arnold F. 'Skip' Wilkins, Wilkins quickly produced a back-of-the-envelope calculation that showed the energy required would be enormous. Watt wrote back that this was unlikely, but added the following comment: \\"Attention is being turned to the still difficult, but less unpromising, problem of radio detection and numerical considerations on the method of detection by reflected radio waves will be submitted when required\\". Over the following several weeks, Wilkins considered the radio detection problem. He outlined an approach and backed it with detailed calculations of necessary transmitter power, reflection characteristics of an aircraft, and needed receiver sensitivity. He proposed using a directional receiver based on Watt's lightning detection concept, listening for powerful signals from a separate transmitter. Timing, and thus distance measurements, would be accomplished by triggering the oscilloscope's trace with a muted signal from the transmitter, and then simply measuring the returns against a scale. Watson Watt sent this information to the Air Ministry on February 12, 1935, in a secret report titled \\"The Detection of Aircraft by Radio Methods\\". Reflection of radio signals was critical to the proposed technique, and the Air Ministry asked if this could be proven. To test this, Wilkins set up receiving equipment in a field near Upper Stowe, Northamptonshire. On February 26, 1935, a Handley Page Heyford bomber flew along a path between the receiving station and the transmitting towers of a BBC shortwave station in nearby Daventry. The aircraft reflected the 6 MHz (49 m) BBC signal, and this was readily detected by Arnold \\"Skip\\" Wilkins using Doppler-beat interference at ranges up to . This convincing test, known as the Daventry Experiment, was witnessed by a representative from the Air Ministry, and led to the immediate authorization to build a full demonstration system. This experiment was later reproduced by Wilkins for the 1977 BBC television series The Secret War episode \\"To See a Hundred Miles\\". Based on pulsed transmission as used for probing the ionosphere, a preliminary system was designed and built at the RRS by the team. Their existing transmitter had a peak power of about 1 kW, and Wilkins had estimated that 100 kW would be needed. Edward George Bowen was added to the team to design and build such a transmitter. Bowens’ transmitter operated at 6 MHz (50 m), had a pulse-repetition rate of 25 Hz, a pulse width of 25 μs, and approached the desired power. Orfordness, a narrow peninsula in Suffolk along the coast of the North Sea, was selected as the test site. Here the equipment would be openly operated in the guise of an ionospheric monitoring station. In mid-May 1935, the equipment was moved to Orfordness. Six wooden towers were erected, two for stringing the transmitting antenna, and four for corners of crossed receiving antennas. In June, general testing of the equipment began. On June 17, the first target was detected—a Supermarine Scapa flying boat at range.Bowen, E. G.; Radar Days, Inst. of Physics Publishing, 1987, p. 16 It is historically correct that, on June 17, 1935, radio-based detection and ranging was first demonstrated in Britain . Watson Watt, Wilkins, and Bowen are generally credited with initiating what would later be called radar in this nation.Latham, Colin, and Anne Stobbs (2011). The Birth of British Radar: The memoirs of Arnold 'Skip' Wilkins, Second Edition, Radio Society of Great Britain, In December 1935, the British Treasury appropriated £60,000 for a five-station system called Chain Home (CH), covering approaches to the Thames Estuary. The secretary of the Tizard Committee, Albert Percival Rowe, coined the acronym RDF as a cover for the work, meaning Range and Direction Finding but suggesting the already well-known Radio Direction Finding. Late in 1935, responding to Lindemann's recognition of the need for night detection and interception gear, and realizing existing transmitters were too heavy for aircraft, Bowen proposed fitting only receivers, what would later be called bistatic radar.Judkins, Phil. \\"Making Vision into Power\\" , International Journal of Engineering and Technology, Vol 82, No 1 (January 2012), pp. 103–104. Frederick Lindemann's proposals for infrared sensors and aerial mines would prove impractical.Judkins, p.113. It would take Bowen's efforts, at the urging of Tizard, who became increasingly concerned about the need, to see Air to Surface Vessel (ASV), and through it Airborne Interception (AI), radar to fruition.Judkins, pp.113–114. In 1937, Bowen's team set their crude ASV radar, the world's first airborne set, to detect the Home Fleet in dismal weather.Judkins, p.109. Only in spring 1939, \\"as a matter of great urgency\\" after the failure of the searchlight system Silhouette,Judkins, p.114. did attention turn to using ASV for air-to-air interception (AI). Demonstrated in June 1939, AI got a warm reception from Air Chief Marshal Hugh Dowding, and even more so from Churchill. This proved problematic. Its accuracy, dependent on the height of the aircraft, meant that CH, capable of only , was not accurate enough to place an aircraft within its detection range, and an additional system was required.Judkins, p.116. Its wooden chassis had a disturbing tendency to catch fire (even with attention from expert technicians),Judkins, p.117. so much so that Dowding, when told that Watson-Watt could provide hundreds of sets, demanded \\"ten that work\\".Judkins, p.116: quoting from Jones, R. V. Most Secret War (London: Hamish Hamilton, 1978), pp.155–156. The Cossor and MetroVick sets were overweight for aircraft use and the RAF lacked night fighter pilots, observers,Judkins, p.115. and suitable aircraft.Braham, J. R. D., Wing Commander, RAF. Night Fighter (Bantam, 1984). In 1940, John Randall and Harry Boot developed the cavity magnetron, which made ten-centimetre ( wavelength ) radar a reality. This device, the size of a small dinner plate, could be carried easily on aircraft and the short wavelength meant the antenna would also be small and hence suitable for mounting on aircraft. The short wavelength and high power made it very effective at spotting submarines from the air. To aid Chain Home in making height calculations, at Dowding's request, the Electrical Calculator Type Q (commonly called the \\"Fruit Machine\\") was introduced in 1940. The solution to night intercepts would be provided by Dr. W. B. \\"Ben\\" Lewis, who proposed a new, more accurate ground control display, the Plan Position Indicator (PPI), a new Ground-Controlled Interception (GCI) radar, and reliable AI radar. The AI sets would ultimately be built by EMI. GCI was unquestionably delayed by Watson-Watt's opposition to it and his belief that CH was sufficient, as well as by Bowen's preference for using ASV for navigation, despite Bomber Command disclaiming a need for it, and by Tizard's reliance on the faulty Silhouette system.Judkins, pp.114, 116, 118, & 119–120. ===Air Ministry=== Chain Home Radar Coverage 1939–1940 In March 1936, the work at Orfordness was moved to Bawdsey Manor, nearby on the mainland. Until this time, the work had officially still been under the DSIR, but was now transferred to the Air Ministry. At the new Bawdsey Research Station, the Chain Home (CH) equipment was assembled as a prototype. There were equipment problems when the Royal Air Force (RAF) first exercised the prototype station in September 1936. These were cleared by the next April, and the Air Ministry started plans for a larger network of stations. Initial hardware at CH stations was as follows: The transmitter operated on four pre-selected frequencies between 20 and 55 MHz, adjustable within 15 seconds, and delivered a peak power of 200 kW. The pulse duration was adjustable between 5 and 25 μs, with a repetition rate selectable as either 25 or 50 Hz. For synchronization of all CH transmitters, the pulse generator was locked to the 50 Hz of the British power grid. Four steel towers supported transmitting antennas, and four wooden towers supported cross-dipole arrays at three different levels. A goniometer was used to improve the directional accuracy from the multiple receiving antennas. By the summer of 1937, 20 initial CH stations were in check-out operation. A major RAF exercise was performed before the end of the year, and was such a success that £10,000,000 was appropriated by the Treasury for an eventual full chain of coastal stations. At the start of 1938, the RAF took over control of all CH stations, and the network began regular operations. In May 1938, Rowe replaced Watson Watt as Superintendent at Bawdsey. In addition to the work on CH and successor systems, there was now major work in airborne RDF equipment. This was led by E. G. Bowen and centered on 200-MHz (1.5 m) sets. The higher frequency allowed smaller antennas, appropriate for aircraft installation. From the initiation of RDF work at Orfordness, the Air Ministry had kept the British Army and the Royal Navy generally informed; this led to both of these forces having their own RDF developments. ===British Army=== In 1931, at the Woolwich Research Station of the Army's Signals Experimental Establishment (SEE), W. A. S. Butement and P. E. Pollard had examined pulsed 600 MHz (50-cm) signals for detection of ships. Although they prepared a memorandum on this subject and performed preliminary experiments, for undefined reasons the War Office did not give it consideration.Butement, W. A. S., and P. E. Pollard; “Coastal Defense Apparatus”, Recorded in the Inventions Book of the Royal Engineers Board, Jan. 1931 As the Air Ministry's work on RDF progressed, Colonel Peter Worlledge of the Royal Engineer and Signals Board met with Watson Watt and was briefed on the RDF equipment and techniques being developed at Orfordness. His report, “The Proposed Method of Aeroplane Detection and Its Prospects”, led the SEE to set up an “Army Cell” at Bawdsey in October 1936. This was under E. Talbot Paris and the staff included Butement and Pollard. The Cell's work emphasize two general types of RDF equipment: gun-laying (GL) systems for assisting anti-aircraft guns and searchlights, and coastal- defense (CD) systems for directing coastal artillery and defense of Army bases overseas. Pollard led the first project, a gun-laying RDF code-named Mobile Radio Unit (MRU). This truck-mounted system was designed as a small version of a CH station. It operated at 23 MHz (13 m) with a power of 300 kW. A single tower supported a transmitting antenna, as well as two receiving antennas set orthogonally for estimating the signal bearing. In February 1937, a developmental unit detected an aircraft at a range of 60 miles (96 km). The Air Ministry also adopted this system as a mobile auxiliary to the CH system. In early 1938, Butement started the development of a CD system based on Bowen's evolving 200-MHz (1.5-m) airborne sets. The transmitter had a 400 Hz pulse rate, a 2-μs pulse width, and 50 kW power (later increased to 150 kW). Although many of Bowen's transmitter and receiver components were used, the system would not be airborne so there were no limitations on antenna size. Primary credit for introducing beamed RDF systems in Britain must be given to Butement. For the CD, he developed a large dipole array, high and wide, giving much narrower beams and higher gain. This could be rotated at a speed up to 1.5 revolutions per minute. For greater directional accuracy, lobe switching on the receiving antennas was adopted. As a part of this development, he formulated the first – at least in Britain – mathematical relationship that would later become well known as the “radar range equation”. By May 1939, the CD RDF could detect aircraft flying as low as and at a range of . With an antenna above sea level, it could determine the range of a 2,000-ton ship at and with an angular accuracy of as little as a quarter of a degree. ===Royal Navy=== Although the Royal Navy maintained close contact with the Air Ministry work at Bawdsey, they chose to establish their own RDF development at the Experimental Department of His Majesty's Signal School (HMSS) in Portsmouth, Hampshire, on the south coast. HMSS started RDF work in September 1935. Initial efforts, under R. F. Yeo, were in frequencies between 75 MHz (4 m) and 1.2 GHz (25 cm). All of the work was under the utmost secrecy; it could not even be discussed with other scientists and engineers at Portsmouth. A 75 MHz range-only set was eventually developed and designated Type 79X. Basic tests were done using a training ship, but the operation was unsatisfactory. In August 1937, the RDF development at HMSS changed, with many of their best researchers brought into the activity. John D. S. Rawlinson was made responsible for improving the Type 79X. To increase the efficiency, he decreased the frequency to 43 MHz ( 7 metre wavelength ). Designated Type 79Y, it had separate, stationary transmitting and receiving antennas. Prototypes of the Type 79Y air-warning system were successfully tested at sea in early 1938. The detection range on aircraft was between 30 and 50 miles (48 and 80 km), depending on height. The systems were then placed into service in August on the cruiser and in October on the battleship HMS Rodney. These were the first vessels in the Royal Navy with RDF systems.Coales, J. F., and J. D. S. Rawlinson; “The Development of Naval Radar 1935–1945”, J. Naval Science, vol. 13, nos. 2–3, 1987. ==Germany== A radio-based device for remotely indicating the presence of ships was built in Germany by Christian Hülsmeyer in 1904. Often referred to as the first radar system, this did not directly measure the range (distance) to the target, and thus did not meet the criteria to be given this name. Over the following three decades in Germany, a number of radio-based detection systems were developed but none were true radars. This situation changed before World War II. Developments in three leading industries are described.Kummritz, Herbert; “On the Development of Radar Technologies in Germany up to 1945”, in Tracking the History of Radar, ed. by Oskar Blumtritt et al., IEEE-Rutgers, 1994 ===GEMA=== In the early 1930s, physicist Rudolf Kühnhold, Scientific Director at the Kriegsmarine (German navy) Nachrichtenmittel-Versuchsanstalt (NVA—Experimental Institute of Communication Systems) in Kiel, was attempting to improve the acoustical methods of underwater detection of ships. He concluded that the desired accuracy in measuring distance to targets could be attained only by using pulsed electromagnetic waves. During 1933, Kühnhold first attempted to test this concept with a transmitting and receiving set that operated in the microwave region at 13.5 cm (2.22 GHz). The transmitter used a Barkhausen-Kurz tube (the first microwave generator) that produced only 0.1 watt. Unsuccessful with this, he asked for assistance from Paul-Günther Erbslöh and Hans-Karl Freiherr von Willisen, amateur radio operators who were developing a VHF system for communications. They enthusiastically agreed, and in January 1934, formed a company, Gesellschaft für Elektroakustische und Mechanische Apparate (GEMA), for the effort. From the start, the firm was always called simply GEMA.Kroge, Harry von; GEMA: Birthplace of German Radar and Sonar, translated by Louis Brown, Inst. of Physics Publishing, 2000 Work on a Funkmessgerät für Untersuchung (radio measuring device for research) began in earnest at GEMA. Hans Hollmann and Theodor Schultes, both affiliated with the prestigious Heinrich Hertz Institute in Berlin, were added as consultants. The first apparatus used a split-anode magnetron purchased from Philips in the Netherlands. This provided about 70 W at 50 cm (600 MHz), but suffered from frequency instability. Hollmann built a regenerative receiver and Schultes developed Yagi antennas for transmitting and receiving. In June 1934, large vessels passing through the Kiel Harbor were detected by Doppler- beat interference at a distance of about . In October, strong reflections were observed from an aircraft that happened to fly through the beam; this opened consideration of targets other than ships. Kühnhold then shifted the GEMA work to a pulse-modulated system. A new 50 cm (600 MHz) Philips magnetron with better frequency stability was used. It was modulated with 2- μs pulses at a PRF of 2000 Hz. The transmitting antenna was an array of 10 pairs of dipoles with a reflecting mesh. The wide-band regenerative receiver used Acorn tubes from RCA, and the receiving antenna had three pairs of dipoles and incorporated lobe switching. A blocking device (a duplexer), shut the receiver input when the transmitter pulsed. A Braun tube (a CRT) was used for displaying the range. The equipment was first tested at a NVA site at the Lübecker Bay near Pelzerhaken. During May 1935, it detected returns from woods across the bay at a range of . It had limited success, however, in detecting a research ship, Welle, only a short distance away. The receiver was then rebuilt, becoming a super-regenerative set with two intermediate-frequency stages. With this improved receiver, the system readily tracked vessels at up to range. In September 1935, a demonstration was given to the Commander-in- Chief of the Kriegsmarine. The system performance was excellent; the range was read off the Braun tube with a tolerance of 50 meters (less than 1 percent variance), and the lobe switching allowed a directional accuracy of 0.1 degree. Historically, this marked the first naval vessel equipped with radar. Although this apparatus was not put into production, GEMA was funded to develop similar systems operating around 50 cm (500 MHz). These became the Seetakt for the Kriegsmarine and the Freya for the Luftwaffe (German Air Force). Kühnhold remained with the NVA, but also consulted with GEMA. He is considered by many in Germany as the Father of Radar. During 1933–6, Hollmann wrote the first comprehensive treatise on microwaves, Physik und Technik der ultrakurzen Wellen (Physics and Technique of Ultrashort Waves), Springer 1938. ===Telefunken=== In 1933, when Kühnhold at the NVA was first experimenting with microwaves, he had sought information from Telefunken on microwave tubes. (Telefunken was the largest supplier of radio products in Germany) There, Wilhelm Tolmé Runge had told him that no vacuum tubes were available for these frequencies. In fact, Runge was already experimenting with high-frequency transmitters and had Telefunken's tube department working on cm-wavelength devices. In the summer of 1935, Runge, now Director of Telefunken's Radio Research Laboratory, initiated an internally funded project in radio-based detection. Using Barkhausen-Kurz tubes, a 50 cm (600 MHz) receiver and 0.5-W transmitter were built. With the antennas placed flat on the ground some distance apart, Runge arranged for an aircraft to fly overhead and found that the receiver gave a strong Doppler-beat interference signal.“Telefunken firm in Berlin reveals details of a 'mystery ray' system capable of locating position of aircraft through fog, smoke and clouds.” Electronics, September 1935 Runge, now with Hans Hollmann as a consultant, continued in developing a 1.8 m (170 MHz) system using pulse-modulation. Wilhelm Stepp developed a transmit-receive device (a duplexer) for allowing a common antenna. Stepp also code-named the system Darmstadt after his home town, starting the practice in Telefunken of giving the systems names of cities. The system, with only a few watts transmitter power, was first tested in February 1936, detecting an aircraft at about distance. This led the Luftwaffe to fund the development of a 50 cm (600 MHz) gun-laying system, the Würzburg.Runge. W.; “A personal reminiscence”, in Radar Development to 1945, edited by Russell Burns, Peter Peregrinus Ltd, 1988, p.227 ===Lorenz=== Since before the First World War, Standard Elektrik Lorenz had been the main supplier of communication equipment for the German military and was the main rival of Telefunken. In late 1935, when Lorenz found that Runge at Telefunken was doing research in radio-based detection equipment, they started a similar activity under Gottfried Müller. A pulse-modulated set called Einheit für Abfragung (DFA – Device for Detection) was built. It used a type DS-310 tube (similar to the Acorn) operating at 70 cm (430 MHz) and about 1 kW power, it had identical transmitting and receiving antennas made with rows of half-wavelength dipoles backed by a reflecting screen. In early 1936, initial experiments gave reflections from large buildings at up to about . The power was doubled by using two tubes, and in mid-1936, the equipment was set up on cliffs near Kiel, and good detections of ships at and aircraft at were attained. The success of this experimental set was reported to the Kriegsmarine, but they showed no interest; they were already fully engaged with GEMA for similar equipment. Also, because of extensive agreements between Lorenz and many foreign countries, the naval authorities had reservations concerning the company handling classified work. The DFA was then demonstrated to the Heer (German Army), and they contracted with Lorenz for developing Kurfürst (Elector), a system for supporting Flugzeugabwehrkanone (Flak, anti-aircraft guns). ==United States== In the United States, both the Navy and Army needed means of remotely locating enemy ships and aircraft. In 1930, both services initiated the development of radio equipment that could meet this need. There was little coordination of these efforts; thus, they will be described separately. ===United States Navy=== In the autumn of 1922, Albert H. Taylor and Leo C. Young at the U.S. Naval Aircraft Radio Laboratory were conducting communication experiments when they noticed that a wooden ship in the Potomac River was interfering with their signals. They prepared a memorandum suggesting that this might be used for ship detection in a harbor defense, but their suggestion was not taken up.Brown, Louis; A Radar History of World War II; Inst. of Physics Publishing, 1999, p.43 In 1930, Lawrence A. Hyland working with Taylor and Young, now at the U.S. Naval Research Laboratory (NRL) in Washington, D.C., used a similar arrangement of radio equipment to detect a passing aircraft. This led to a proposal and patent for using this technique for detecting ships and aircraft.Hyland, L.A., A.H. Taylor, and L.C. Young; \\"System for detecting objects by radio\\", U.S. Patent No. 1981884, 27 Nov. 1934 A simple wave- interference apparatus can detect the presence of an object, but it cannot determine its location or velocity. That had to await the invention of pulsed radar, and later, additional encoding techniques to extract this information from a CW signal. When Taylor's group at the NRL were unsuccessful in getting interference radio accepted as a detection means, Young suggested trying pulsing techniques. This would also allow the direct determination of range to the target. In 1924, Hyland and Young had built such a transmitter for Gregory Breit and Merle A. Tuve at the Carnegie Institution of Washington for successfully measuring the height of the ionosphere.Breit, Gregory, and Merle A. Tuve; \\"A Radio Method for Estimating the Height of the Conducting Layer\\", Nature, vol. 116, 1925, p. 116 Robert Morris Page was assigned by Taylor to implement Young's suggestion. Page designed a transmitter operating at 60 MHz and pulsed 10 μs in duration and 90 μs between pulses. In December 1934, the apparatus was used to detect a plane at a distance of one mile (1.6 km) flying up and down the Potomac. Although the detection range was small and the indications on the oscilloscope monitor were almost indistinct, it demonstrated the basic concept of a pulsed radar system.Page, Robert Morris; The Origin of Radar, Doubleday, 1962, p. 66. Based on this, Page, Taylor, and Young are usually credited with building and demonstrating the world's first true radar. An important subsequent development by Page was the duplexer, a device that allowed the transmitter and receiver to use the same antenna without overwhelming or destroying the sensitive receiver circuitry. This also solved the problem associated with synchronization of separate transmitter and receiver antennas which is critical to accurate position determination of long-range targets. The experiments with pulsed radar were continued, primarily in improving the receiver for handling the short pulses. In June 1936, the NRL's first prototype radar system, now operating at 28.6 MHz, was demonstrated to government officials, successfully tracking an aircraft at distances up to . Their radar was based on low frequency signals, at least by today's standards, and thus required large antennas, making it impractical for ship or aircraft mounting. Ship radar of the United States Navy Antenna size is inversely proportional to the operating frequency; therefore, the operating frequency of the system was increased to 200 MHz, allowing much smaller antennas. The frequency of 200 MHz was the highest possible with existing transmitter tubes and other components. The new system was successfully tested at the NRL in April 1937, That same month, the first sea-borne testing was conducted. The equipment was temporarily installed on the USS Leary, with a Yagi antenna mounted on a gun barrel for sweeping the field of view. Based on success of the sea trials, the NRL further improved the system. Page developed the ring oscillator, allowing multiple output tubes and increasing the pulse- power to 15 kW in 5-µs pulses. A 20-by-23 ft (6 x 7 m), stacked-dipole “bedspring” antenna was used. In laboratory test during 1938, the system, now designated XAF, detected planes at ranges up to . It was installed on the battleship USS New York for sea trials starting in January 1939, and became the first operational radio detection and ranging set in the U.S. fleet. In May 1939, a contract was awarded to RCA for production. Designated CXAM, deliveries started in May 1940. The acronym RADAR was coined from \\"Radio Detection And Ranging\\". One of the first CXAM systems was placed aboard the USS California, a battleship that was sunk in the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941. ===United States Army=== As the Great Depression started, economic conditions led the U.S. Army Signal Corps to consolidate its widespread laboratory operations to Fort Monmouth, New Jersey. On June 30, 1930, these were designated the Signal Corps Laboratories (SCL) and Lt. Colonel (Dr.) William R. Blair was appointed the SCL Director. Among other activities, the SCL was made responsible for research in the detection of aircraft by acoustical and infrared radiation means. Blair had performed his doctoral research in the interaction of electromagnet waves with solid materials, and naturally gave attention to this type of detection. Initially, attempts were made to detect infrared radiation, either from the heat of aircraft engines or as reflected from large searchlights with infrared filters, as well as from radio signals generated by the engine ignition. Some success was made in the infrared detection, but little was accomplished using radio. In 1932, progress at the Naval Research Laboratory (NRL) on radio interference for aircraft detection was passed on to the Army. While it does not appear that any of this information was used by Blair, the SCL did undertake a systematic survey of what was then known throughout the world about the methods of generating, modulating, and detecting radio signals in the microwave region. The SCL's first definitive efforts in radio-based target detection started in 1934 when the Chief of the Army Signal Corps, after seeing a microwave demonstration by RCA, suggested that radio-echo techniques be investigated. The SCL called this technique radio position-finding (RPF). Based on the previous investigations, the SCL first tried microwaves. During 1934 and 1935, tests of microwave RPF equipment resulted in Doppler-shifted signals being obtained, initially at only a few hundred feet distance and later greater than a mile. These tests involved a bi-static arrangement, with the transmitter at one end of the signal path and the receiver at the other, and the reflecting target passing through or near the path. Blair was evidently not aware of the success of a pulsed system at the NRL in December 1934. In an internal 1935 note, Blair had commented: In 1936, W. Delmar Hershberger, SCL's Chief Engineer at that time, started a modest project in pulsed microwave transmission. Lacking success with microwaves, Hershberger visited the NRL (where he had earlier worked) and saw a demonstration of their pulsed set. Back at the SCL, he and Robert H. Noyes built an experimental apparatus using a 75 watt, 110 MHz (2.73 m) transmitter with pulse modulation and a receiver patterned on the one at the NRL. A request for project funding was turned down by the War Department, but $75,000 for support was diverted from a previous appropriation for a communication project. In October 1936, Paul E. Watson became the SCL Chief Engineer and led the project. A field setup near the coast was made with the transmitter and receiver separated by a mile. On December 14, 1936, the experimental set detected at up to range aircraft flying in and out of New York City.Coulton, Roger B.; \\"Radar in the U.S. Army\\", Proc. IRE, vol. 33, 1947, pp. 740–753 Work then began on a prototype system. Ralph I. Cole headed receiver work and William S. Marks lead transmitter improvements. Separate receivers and antennas were used for azimuth and elevation detection. Both receiving and the transmitting antennas used large arrays of dipole wires on wooden frames. The system output was intended to aim a searchlight. The first demonstration of the full set was made on the night of May 26, 1937. A bomber was detected and then illuminated by the searchlight. The observers included the Secretary of War, Henry A. Woodring; he was so impressed that the next day orders were given for the full development of the system. Congress gave an appropriation of $250,000. The frequency was increased to 200 MHz (1.5 m). The transmitter used 16 tubes in a ring oscillator circuit (developed at the NRL), producing about 75 kW peak power. Major James C. Moore was assigned to head the complex electrical and mechanical design of lobe switching antennas. Engineers from Western Electric and Westinghouse were brought in to assist in the overall development. Designated SCR-268, a prototype was successfully demonstrated in late 1938 at Fort Monroe, Virginia. The production of SCR-268 sets was started by Western Electric in 1939, and it entered service in early 1941. Even before the SCR-268 entered service, it had been greatly improved. In a project led by Major (Dr.) Harold A. Zahl, two new configurations evolved – the SCR-270 (mobile) and the SCR-271 (fixed-site). Operation at 106 MHz (2.83 m) was selected, and a single water-cooled tube provided 8 kW (100 kW pulsed) output power. Westinghouse received a production contract, and started deliveries near the end of 1940. The Army deployed five of the first SCR-270 sets around the island of Oahu in Hawaii. At 7:02 on the morning of December 7, 1941, one of these radars detected a flight of aircraft at a range of due north. The observation was passed on to an aircraft warning center where it was misidentified as a flight of U.S. bombers known to be approaching from the mainland. The alarm went unheeded, and at 7:48, the Japanese aircraft first struck at Pearl Harbor. ==USSR== In 1895, Alexander Stepanovich Popov, a physics instructor at the Imperial Russian Navy school in Kronstadt, developed an apparatus using a coherer tube for detecting distant lightning strikes. The next year, he added a spark-gap transmitter and demonstrated the first radio communication set in Russia. During 1897, while testing this in communicating between two ships in the Baltic Sea, he took note of an interference beat caused by the passage of a third vessel. In his report, Popov wrote that this phenomenon might be used for detecting objects, but he did nothing more with this observation. In a few years following the 1917 Russian Revolution and the establishment the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR or Soviet Union) in 1924, Germany's Luftwaffe had aircraft capable of penetrating deep into Soviet territory. Thus, the detection of aircraft at night or above clouds was of great interest to the Soviet Air Defense Forces (PVO). The PVO depended on optical devices for locating targets, and had physicist Pavel K. Oshchepkov conducting research in possible improvement of these devices. In June 1933, Oshchepkov changed his research from optics to radio techniques and started the development of a razvedyvlatl’naya elektromagnitnaya stantsiya (reconnaissance electromagnetic station). In a short time, Oshchepkov was made responsible for a technical expertise sector of PVO devoted to radiolokatory (radio-location) techniques as well as heading a Special Design Bureau (SKB, spetsialnoe konstruktorskoe byuro) in Leningrad. ===Radio-location beginnings=== The Glavnoe Artilleriyskoe Upravlenie (GAU, Main Artillery Administration) was considered the “brains” of the Red Army. It not only had competent engineers and physicists on its central staff, but also had a number of scientific research institutes. Thus, the GAU was also assigned the aircraft detection problem, and Lt. Gen. M. M. Lobanov was placed in charge. After examining existing optical and acoustical equipment, Lobanov also turned to radio-location techniques. For this he approached the Tsentral’naya Radiolaboratoriya (TsRL, Central Radio Laboratory) in Leningrad. Here, Yu. K. Korovin was conducting research on VHF communications, and had built a 50 cm (600 MHz), 0.2 W transmitter using a Barkhausen-Kurz tube. For testing the concept, Korovin arranged the transmitting and receiving antennas along the flight path of an aircraft. On January 3, 1934, a Doppler signal was received by reflections from the aircraft at some 600 m range and 100–150 m altitude.Erickson, J.; “The air defense problem and the Soviet radar programme 1934/35-1945”, in Radar Development to 1945, ed. by Russell Burns, Peter Peregrinus Ltd., 1988, pp. 227–234 For further research in detection methods, a major conference on this subject was arranged for the PVO by the Russian Academy of Sciences (RAN). The conference was held in Leningrad in mid-January 1934, and chaired by Abram Fedorovich Ioffe, Director of the Leningrad Physical-Technical Institute (LPTI). Ioffe was generally considered the top Russian physicist of his time. All types of detection techniques were discussed, but radio-location received the greatest attention. To distribute the conference findings to a wider audience, the proceedings were published the following month in a journal. This included all of the then-existing information on radio-location in the USSR, available (in Russian language) to researchers in this field throughout the world.Ioffe, A. F.; “Contemporary problems of the development of the technology of air defense”, Sbornik PVO, February 1934 (in Russian) Recognizing the potential value of radio-location to the military, the GAU made a separate agreement with the Leningrad Electro- Physics Institute (LEPI), for a radio-location system. This technical effort was led by B. K. Shembel. The LEPI had built a transmitter and receiver to study the radio-reflection characteristics of various materials and targets. Shembel readily made this into an experimental bi-static radio-location system called Bistro (Rapid). The Bistro transmitter, operating at 4.7 m (64 MHz), produced near 200 W and was frequency-modulated by a 1 kHz tone. A fixed transmitting antenna gave a broad coverage of what was called a radioekran (radio screen). A regenerative receiver, located some distance from the transmitter, had a dipole antenna mounted on a hand-driven reciprocating mechanism. An aircraft passing into the screened zone would reflect the radiation, and the receiver would detect the Doppler-interference beat between the transmitted and reflected signals. Bistro was first tested during the summer of 1934. With the receiver up to 11 km away from the transmitter, the set could only detect an aircraft entering a screen at about range and under 1,000 m. With improvements, it was believed to have a potential range of 75 km, and five sets were ordered in October for field trials.Shembel, B. K.; At the Origin of Radar in USSR, Sovetskoye Radio, 1977 (in Russian) Bistro is often cited as the USSR's first radar system; however, it was incapable of directly measuring range and thus could not be so classified. LEPI and TsRL were both made a part of Nauchno-issledovatelsky institut-9 (NII-9, Scientific Research Institute #9), a new GAU organization opened in Leningrad in 1935. Mikhail A. Bonch-Bruyevich, a renowned radio physicist previously with TsRL and the University of Leningrad, was named the NII-9 Scientific Director. Research on magnetrons began at Kharkov University in Ukraine during the mid-1920s. Before the end of the decade this had resulted in publications with worldwide distribution, such as the German journal Annalen der Physik (Annals of Physics).Slutzkin, A. A., and D. S. Shteinberg, \\"Die Erzeugung von kurzwelligen ungedämpften Schwingungen bei Anwendung des Magnetfeldes\\" [\\"The generation of undamped shortwave oscillations by application of a magnetic field\\"], Annalen der Physik, vol. 393, no. 5, pages 658–670 (May 1929) Based on this work, Ioffe recommended that a portion of the LEPI be transferred to the city of Kharkiv, resulting in the Ukrainian Institute of Physics and Technology (LIPT) being formed in 1930. Within the LIPT, the Laboratory of Electromagnetic Oscillations (LEMO), headed by Abram A. Slutskin, continued with magnetron development. Led by Aleksandr S. Usikov, a number of advanced segmented-anode magnetrons evolved. (It is noted that these and other early magnetrons developed in the USSR suffered from frequency instability, a problem in their use in Soviet radar systems.) In 1936, one of Usikov's magnetrons producing about 7 W at 18 cm (1.7 GHz) was used by Shembel at the NII-9 as a transmitter in a radioiskatel (radio-seeker) called Burya (Storm). Operating similarly to Bistro, the range of detection was about 10 km, and provided azimuth and elevation coordinates estimated to within 4 degrees. No attempts were made to make this into a pulsed system, thus, it could not provide range and was not qualified to be classified as a radar. It was, however, the first microwave radio-detection system. While work by Shembel and Bonch-Bruyevich on continuous-wave systems was taking place at NII-9, Oshehepkov at the SKB and V. V. Tsimbalin of Ioffe's LPTI were pursuing a pulsed system. In 1936, they built a radio-location set operating at 4 m (75 MHz) with a peak-power of about 500 W and a 10-μs pulse duration. Before the end of the year, tests using separated transmitting and receiving sites resulted in an aircraft being detected at 7 km. In April 1937, with the peak- pulse power increased to 1 kW and the antenna separation also increased, test showed a detection range of near 17 km at a height of 1.5 km. Although a pulsed system, it was not capable of directly providing range – the technique of using pulses for determining range had not yet been developed. ===Pre-war radio location systems=== In June 1937, all of the work in Leningrad on radio- location suddenly stopped. The infamous Great Purge of dictator Joseph Stalin swept over the military high commands and its supporting scientific community. The PVO chief was executed. Oshchepkov, charged with “high crime”, was sentenced to 10 years at a Gulag penal labor camp. NII-9 as an organization was saved, but Shenbel was dismissed and Bonch-Bruyevich was named the new director.Siddiqi, Asif A.; “Rockets Red Glare: Technology, Conflict, and Terror in the Soviet Union”; Technology & Culture, vol. 44, 2003, p.470 The Nauchnoissledovatel'skii ispytalel'nyi institut svyazi RKKA (NIIIS-KA, Scientific Research Institute of Signals of the Red Army), had initially opposed research in radio-location, favoring instead acoustical techniques. However, this portion of the Red Army gained power as a result of the Great Purge, and did an about face, pressing hard for speedy development of radio- location systems. They took over Oshchepkov's laboratory and were made responsible for all existing and future agreements for research and factory production. Writing later about the Purge and subsequent effects, General Lobanov commented that it led to the development being placed under a single organization, and the rapid reorganization of the work.Lobanov, M. M.; The Beginning of Soviet Radar, Sovetskoye Radio, 1975 (in Russian) At Oshchepkov's former laboratory, work with the 4 m (75 MHz) pulsed-transmission system was continued by A. I. Shestako. Through pulsing, the transmitter produced a peak power of 1 kW, the highest level thus far generated. In July 1938, a fixed- position, bi-static experimental system detected an aircraft at about 30 km range at heights of 500 m, and at 95 km range, for high-flying targets at 7.5 km altitude. The system was still incapable of directly determining the range. The project was then taken up by Ioffe's LPTI, resulting in the development of a mobile system designated Redut (Redoubt). An arrangement of new transmitter tubes was used, giving near 50 kW peak-power with a 10 μs pulse-duration. Yagi antennas were adopted for both transmitting and receiving. The Redut was first field tested in October 1939, at a site near Sevastopol, a port in Ukraine on the coast of the Black Sea. This testing was in part to show the NKKF (Soviet Navy) the value of early-warning radio-location for protecting strategic ports. With the equipment on a cliff about 160 meters above sea level, a flying boat was detected at ranges up to 150 km. The Yagi antennas were spaced about 1,000 meters; thus, close coordination was required to aim them in synchronization. An improved version of the Redut, the Redut-K, was developed by Aksel Berg in 1940 and placed aboard the light cruiser Molotov in April 1941. Molotov became the first Soviet warship equipped with radar.Watson, Raymond C. (2009).Radar Origins Worldwide. Trafford Publishing, p. 306. At the NII-9 under Bonch-Bruyevich, scientists developed two types of very advanced microwave generators. In 1938, a linear-beam, velocity-modulated vacuum tube (a klystron) was developed by Nikolay Devyatkov, based on designs from Kharkiv. This device produced about 25 W at 15–18 cm (2.0–1.7 GHz) and was later used in experimental systems. Devyatkov followed this with a simpler, single-resonator device (a reflex klystron). At this same time, D. E. Malyarov and N. F. Alekseyev were building a series of magnetrons, also based on designs from Kharkov; the best of these produced 300 W at 9 cm (3 GHz). Also at NII-9, D. S. Stogov was placed in charge of the improvements to the Bistro system. Redesignated as Reven (Rhubarb), it was tested in August 1938, but was only marginally better than the predecessor. With additional minor operational improvements, it was made into a mobile system called Radio Ulavlivatel Samoletov (RUS, Radio Catcher of Aircraft), soon designated as RUS-1. This continuous-wave, bi-static system had a truck-mounted transmitter operating at 4.7 m (64 MHz) and two truck-mounted receivers. Although the RUS-1 transmitter was in a cabin on the rear of a truck, the antenna had to be strung between external poles anchored to the ground. A second truck carrying the electrical generator and other equipment was backed against the transmitter truck. Two receivers were used, each in a truck-mounted cabin with a dipole antenna on a rotatable pole extended overhead. In use, the receiver trucks were placed about 40 km apart; thus, with two positions, it would be possible to make a rough estimate of the range by triangulation on a map. The RUS-1 system was tested and put into production in 1939, then entered service in 1940, becoming the first deployed radio-location system in the Red Army. About 45 RUS-1 systems were built at the Svetlana Factory in Leningrad before the end of 1941, and deployed along the western USSR borders and in the Far East. Without direct ranging capability, however, the military found the RUS-1 to be of little value. Even before the demise of efforts in Leningrad, the NIIIS-KA had contracted with the UIPT in Kharkov to investigate a pulsed radio-location system for anti-aircraft applications. This led the LEMO, in March 1937, to start an internally funded project with the code name Zenit (a popular football team at the time). The transmitter development was led by Usikov, supplier of the magnetron used earlier in the Burya. For the Zenit, Usikov used a 60 cm (500 MHz) magnetron pulsed at 10–20 μs duration and providing 3 kW pulsed power, later increased to near 10 kW. Semion Braude led the development of a superheterodyne receiver using a tunable magnetron as the local oscillator. The system had separate transmitting and receiving antennas set about 65 m apart, built with dipoles backed by 3-meter parabolic reflectors. Zenit was first tested in October 1938. In this, a medium-sized bomber was detected at a range of 3 km. The testing was observed by the NIIIS- KA and found to be sufficient for starting a contracted effort. An agreement was made in May 1939, specifying the required performance and calling for the system to be ready for production by 1941. The transmitter was increased in power, the antennas had selsens added to allow them to track, and the receiver sensitivity was improved by using an RCA 955 acorn triode as the local oscillator. A demonstration of the improved Zenit was given in September 1940. In this, it was shown that the range, altitude, and azimuth of an aircraft flying at heights between 4,000 and 7,000 meters could be determined at up to 25 km distance. The time required for these measurements, however, was about 38 seconds, far too long for use by anti-aircraft batteries. Also, with the antennas aimed at a low angle, there was a dead zone of some distance caused by interference from ground-level reflections. While this performance was not satisfactory for immediate gun-laying applications, it was the first full three-coordinate radio-location system in the Soviet Union and showed the way for future systems.Kostenko, Alexei A., Alexander I, Nosich, and Irina A. Tishchenko; “Development of the First Soviet Three-Coordinate L-Band Pulsed Radar in Kharkov Before WWII”, IEEE Antennas and Propagation Magazine, vol. 43, June 2001, pp. 29–48; Work at the LEMO continued on Zenit, particularly in converting it into a single-antenna system designated Rubin. This effort, however, was disrupted by the invasion of the USSR by Germany in June 1941. In a short while, the development activities at Kharkov were ordered to be evacuated to the Far East. The research efforts in Leningrad were similarly dispersed.Chernyak, V. S., I. Ya. Immoreev, and B. M. Vovshin; “Radar in the Soviet Union and Russia: A Brief Historical Outline”, IEEE AES Magazine, vol. 19, December 2003, p. 8 After eight years of effort by highly qualified physicists and engineers, the USSR entered World War II without a fully developed and fielded radar system. ==Japan== As a seafaring nation, Japan had an early interest in wireless (radio) communications. The first known use of wireless telegraphy in warfare at sea was by the Imperial Japanese Navy, in defeating the Russian Imperial Fleet in 1904 at the Battle of Port Arthur. There was an early interest in equipment for radio direction-finding, for use in both navigation and military surveillance. The Imperial Navy developed an excellent receiver for this purpose in 1921, and soon most of the Japanese warships had this equipment. In the two decades between the two World Wars, radio technology in Japan made advancements on a par with that in the western nations. There were often impediments, however, in transferring these advancements into the military. For a long time, the Japanese had believed that they had the best fighting capability of any military force in the world. The military leaders, who were then also in control of the government, sincerely felt that the weapons, aircraft, and ships that they had built were fully sufficient and, with these as they were, the Japanese Army and Navy were invincible. In 1936, Japan joined Nazi Germany and Fascist Italy in a Tripartite Pact. ===Technology background=== Radio engineering was strong in Japan's higher education institutions, especially the Imperial (government- financed) universities. This included undergraduate and graduate study, as well as academic research in this field. Special relationships were established with foreign universities and institutes, particularly in Germany, with Japanese teachers and researchers often going overseas for advanced study. The academic research tended toward the improvement of basic technologies, rather than their specific applications. There was considerable research in high-frequency and high-power oscillators, such as the magnetron, but the application of these devices was generally left to industrial and military researchers. One of Japan's best-known radio researchers in the 1920s–1930s era was Professor Hidetsugu Yagi. After graduate study in Germany, England, and America, Yagi joined Tohoku University, where his research centered on antennas and oscillators for high-frequency communications. A summary of the radio research work at Tohoku University was contained in a 1928 seminal paper by Yagi.Yagi, H., “Beam Transmission of Ultra Short Waves”, Proc. IRE, vol. 16, June 1928 Jointly with Shintaro Uda, one of Yagi's first doctoral students, a radically new antenna emerged. It had a number of parasitic elements (directors and reflectors) and would come to be known as the Yagi-Uda or Yagi antenna. A U.S. patent, issued in May 1932, was assigned to RCA. To this day, this is the most widely used directional antenna worldwide. The cavity magnetron was also of interest to Yagi. This HF (~10-MHz) device had been invented in 1921 by Albert W. Hull at General Electric, and Yagi was convinced that it could function in the VHF or even the UHF region. In 1927, Kinjiro Okabe, another of Yagi's early doctoral students, developed a split-anode device that ultimately generated oscillations at wavelengths down to about 12 cm (2.5 GHz). Researchers at other Japanese universities and institutions also started projects in magnetron development, leading to improvements in the split-anode device. These included Kiyoshi Morita at the Tokyo Institute of Technology, and Tsuneo Ito at Tokoku University. Shigeru Nakajima at Japan Radio Company (JRC) saw a commercial potential of these devices and began the further development and subsequent very profitable production of magnetrons for the medical dielectric heating (diathermy) market. The only military interest in magnetrons was shown by Yoji Ito at the Naval Technical Research Institute (NTRI). The NTRI was formed in 1922, and became fully operational in 1930. Located at Meguro, Tokyo, near the Tokyo Institute of Technology, first-rate scientists, engineers, and technicians were engaged in activities ranging from designing giant submarines to building new radio tubes. Included were all of the precursors of radar, but this did not mean that the heads of the Imperial Navy accepted these accomplishments. In 1936, Tsuneo Ito (no relationship to Yoji Ito) developed an 8-split-anode magnetron that produced about 10 W at 10 cm (3 GHz). Based on its appearance, it was named Tachibana (or Mandarin, an orange citrus fruit). Tsuneo Ito also joined the NTRI and continued his research on magnetrons in association with Yoji Ito. In 1937, they developed the technique of coupling adjacent segments (called push-pull), resulting in frequency stability, an extremely important magnetron breakthrough. By early 1939, NTRI/JRC had jointly developed a 10-cm (3-GHz), stable-frequency Mandarin-type magnetron (No. M3) that, with water cooling, could produce 500-W power. In the same time period, magnetrons were built with 10 and 12 cavities operating as low as 0.7 cm (40 GHz). The configuration of the M3 magnetron was essentially the same as that used later in the magnetron developed by Boot and Randall at Birmingham University in early 1940, including the improvement of strapped cavities. Unlike the high-power magnetron in Britain, however, the initial device from the NTRI generated only a few hundred watts.Nakajima, S., \\"The history of Japanese radar development to 1945\\", in Russell Burns, Radar Development to 1945, Peter Peregrinus Ltd, 1988 In general, there was no lack of scientific and engineering capabilities in Japan; their warships and aircraft clearly showed high levels of technical competency. They were ahead of Britain in the development of magnetrons, and their Yagi antenna was the world standard for VHF systems. It was simply that the top military leaders failed to recognize how the application of radio in detection and ranging – what was often called the Radio Range Finder (RRF) – could be of value, particularly in any defensive role; offense not defense, totally dominated their thinking. ===Imperial Army=== In 1938, engineers from the Research Office of Nippon Electric Company (NEC) were making coverage tests on high-frequency transmitters when rapid fading of the signal was observed. This occurred whenever an aircraft passed over the line between the transmitter and receiving meter. Masatsugu Kobayashi, the Manager of NEC's Tube Department, recognized that this was due to the beat-frequency interference of the direct signal and the Doppler-shifted signal reflected from the aircraft. Kobayashi suggested to the Army Science Research Institute that this phenomenon might be used as an aircraft warning method. Although the Army had rejected earlier proposals for using radio-detection techniques, this one had appeal because it was based on an easily understandable method and would require little developmental cost and risk to prove its military value. NEC assigned Kinji Satake of their Research Institute to develop a system called the Bi-static Doppler Interference Detector (BDID). For testing the prototype system, it was set up on an area recently occupied by Japan along the coast of China. The system operated between 4.0–7.5 MHz (75–40 m) and involved a number of widely spaced stations; this formed a radio screen that could detect the presence (but nothing more) of an aircraft at distances up to . The BDID was the Imperial Army's first deployed radio-based detection system, placed into operation in early 1941. A similar system was developed by Satake for the Japanese homeland. Information centers received oral warnings from the operators at BDID stations, usually spaced between 65 and 240 km (40 and 150 mi). To reduce homing vulnerability – a great fear of the military – the transmitters operated with only a few watts power. Although originally intended to be temporary until better systems were available, they remained in operation throughout the war. It was not until after the start of war that the Imperial Army had equipment that could be called radar.Wilkinson, Roger I.; “Short survey of Japanese radar – Part I”, Trans. AIEE, vol. 65, 1946, p. 370 ===Imperial Navy=== In the mid-1930s, some of the technical specialists in the Imperial Navy became interested in the possibility of using radio to detect aircraft. For consultation, they turned to Professor Yagi who was the Director of the Radio Research Laboratory at Osaka Imperial University. Yagi suggested that this might be done by examining the Doppler frequency-shift in a reflected signal. Funding was provided to the Osaka Laboratory for experimental investigation of this technique. Kinjiro Okabe, the inventor of the split-anode magnetron and who had followed Yagi to Osaka, led the effort. Theoretical analyses indicated that the reflections would be greater if the wavelength was approximately the same as the size of aircraft structures. Thus, a VHF transmitter and receiver with Yagi antennas separated some distance were used for the experiment. In 1936, Okabe successfully detected a passing aircraft by the Doppler-interference method; this was the first recorded demonstration in Japan of aircraft detection by radio. With this success, Okabe's research interest switched from magnetrons to VHF equipment for target detection. This, however, did not lead to any significant funding. The top levels of the Imperial Navy believed that any advantage of using radio for this purpose were greatly outweighed by enemy intercept and disclosure of the sender's presence. Historically, warships in formation used lights and horns to avoid collision at night or when in fog. Newer techniques of VHF radio communications and direction-finding might also be used, but all of these methods were highly vulnerable to enemy interception. At the NTRI, Yoji Ito proposed that the UHF signal from a magnetron might be used to generate a very narrow beam that would have a greatly reduced chance of enemy detection. Development of microwave system for collision avoidance started in 1939, when funding was provided by the Imperial Navy to JRC for preliminary experiments. In a cooperative effort involving Yoji Ito of the NTRI and Shigeru Nakajima of JRC, an apparatus using a 3-cm (10-GHz) magnetron with frequency modulation was designed and built. The equipment was used in an attempt to detect reflections from tall structures a few kilometers away. This experiment gave poor results, attributed to the very low power from the magnetron. The initial magnetron was replaced by one operating at 16 cm (1.9 GHz) and with considerably higher power. The results were then much better, and in October 1940, the equipment obtained clear echoes from a ship in Tokyo Bay at a distance of about . There was still no commitment by top Japanese naval officials for using this technology aboard warships. Nothing more was done at this time, but late in 1941, the system was adopted for limited use. In late 1940, Japan arranged for two technical missions to visit Germany and exchange information about their developments in military technology. Commander Yoji Ito represented the Navy's interest in radio applications, and Lieutenant Colonel Kinji Satake did the same for the Army. During a visit of several months, they exchanged significant general information, as well as limited secret materials in some technologies, but little directly concerning radio- detection techniques. Neither side even mentioned magnetrons, but the Germans did apparently disclose their use of pulsed techniques. After receiving the reports from the technical exchange in Germany, as well as intelligence reports concerning the success of Britain with firing using RDF, the Naval General Staff reversed itself and tentatively accepted pulse-transmission technology. On August 2, 1941, even before Yoji Ito returned to Japan, funds were allocated for the initial development of pulse-modulated radars. Commander Chuji Hashimoto of the NTRI was responsible for initiating this activity. A prototype set operating at 4.2 m (71 MHz) and producing about 5 kW was completed on a crash basis. With the NTRI in the lead, the firm NEC and the Research Laboratory of Japan Broadcasting Corporation (NHK) made major contributions to the effort. Kenjiro Takayanagi, Chief Engineer of NHK's experimental television station and called “the father of Japanese television”, was especially helpful in rapidly developing the pulse-forming and timing circuits, as well as the receiver display. In early September 1941, the prototype set was first tested; it detected a single bomber at and a flight of aircraft at . The system, Japan's first full Radio Range Finder (RRF – radar), was designated Mark 1 Model 1. Contracts were given to three firms for serial production; NEC built the transmitters and pulse modulators, Japan Victor the receivers and associated displays, and Fuji Electrical the antennas and their servo drives. The system operated at 3.0 m (100 MHz) with a peak- power of 40 kW. Dipole arrays with matte+-type reflectors were used in separate antennas for transmitting and receiving. In November 1941, the first manufactured RRF was placed into service as a land-based early-warning system at Katsuura, Chiba, a town on the Pacific coast about from Tokyo. A large system, it weighed close to 8,700 kg (19,000 lb). The detection range was about for single aircraft and for groups.Nakajima, S.; “Japanese radar development prior to 1945”, IEEE Antennas and Propagation Magazine, vol. 34, Dec., 1992, pp. 17–22 ==Netherlands== Early radio-based detection in the Netherlands was along two independent lines: one a microwave system at the firm Philips and the other a VHF system at a laboratory of the Armed Forces.Le Pair, C. (Kees); “Radar in the Dutch Knowledge Network”, Telecommunication and Radar Conference, EUMW98, Amsterdam, 1998; The Philips Company in Eindhoven, Netherlands, operated Natuurkundig Laboratorium (NatLab) for fundamental research related to its products. NatLab researcher Klaas Posthumus developed a magnetron split into four elements.Posthumus, K; \\"Oscillations in a Split- Anode Magnetron, Mechanism of Generation\\", Wireless Engineer, vol. 12, 1935, pp. 126–13 In developing a communication system using this magnetron, C.H.J.A. Staal was testing the transmission by using parabolic transmitting and receiving antennas set side-by-side, both aimed at a large plate some distance away. To overcome frequency instability of the magnetron, pulse modulation was used. It was found that the plate reflected a strong signal. Recognizing the potential importance of this as a detection device, NatLab arranged a demonstration for the Koninklijke Marine (Royal Netherlands Navy). This was conducted in 1937 across the entrance to the main naval port at Marsdiep. Reflections from sea waves obscured the return from the target ship, but the Navy was sufficiently impressed to initiate sponsorship of the research. In 1939, an improved set was demonstrated at Wijk aan Zee, detecting a vessel at a distance of . A prototype system was built by Philips, and plans were started by the firm Nederlandse Seintoestellen Fabriek (a Philips subsidiary) for building a chain of warning stations to protect the primary ports. Some field testing of the prototype was conducted, but the project was discontinued when Germany invaded the Netherlands on May 10, 1940. Within the NatLab, however, the work was continued in great secrecy until 1942.Staal, M., and J.L.C. Weiller; “Radar Development in the Netherlands before the war”, in Radar Development to 1945, ed. by Russell Burns, Peter Peregrinus, 1988, pp. 235–237 During the early 1930s, there were widespread rumours of a “death ray” being developed. The Dutch Parliament set up a Committee for the Applications of Physics in Weaponry under G.J. Elias to examine this potential, but the Committee quickly discounted death rays. The Committee did, however, establish the Laboratorium voor Fysieke Ontwikkeling (LFO, Laboratory for Physical Development), dedicated to supporting the Netherlands Armed Forces. Operating in great secrecy, the LFO opened a facility called the Meetgebouw (Measurements Building) located on the Plain of Waalsdorp. In 1934, J.L.W.C. von Weiler joined the LFO and, with S.G. Gratama, began research on a 1.25-m (240-MHz) communication system to be used in artillery spotting.”Measurements Building” In 1937, while tests were being conducted on this system, a passing flock of birds disturbed the signal. Realizing that this might be a potential method for detecting aircraft, the Minister of War ordered continuation of the experiments. Weiler and Gratama set about developing a system for directing searchlights and aiming anti-aircraft guns. The experimental “electrical listening device” operated at 70 cm (430 MHz) and used pulsed transmission at an RPF of 10 kHz. A transmit-receive blocking circuit was developed to allow a common antenna. The received signal was displayed on a CR tube with a circular time base. This set was demonstrated to the Army in April 1938 and detected an aircraft at a range of . The set was rejected, however, because it could not withstand the harsh environment of Army combat conditions. The Navy was more receptive. Funding was provided for final development, and Max Staal was added to the team. To maintain secrecy, they divided the development into parts. The transmitter was built at the Delft Technical College and the receiver at the University of Leiden. Ten sets would be assembled under the personal supervision of J.J.A. Schagen van Leeuwen, head of the firm Hazemeijer Fabriek van Signaalapparaten. The prototype had a peak-power of 1 kW, and used a pulse length of 2 to 3 μs with a 10- to 20 kHz PRF. The receiver was a super- heterodyne type using Acorn tubes and a 6 MHz IF stage. The antenna consisted of 4 rows of 16 half-wave dipoles backed by a 3- by 3-meter mesh screen. The operator used a bicycle-type drive to rotate the antenna, and the elevation could be changed using a hand crank.Swords, S. S.; Technical history of the beginnings of radar, Peter Peregrinus Ltd, 1986, pp. 142–144 Several sets were completed, and one was put into operation on the Malieveld in The Hague just before the Netherlands fell to Germany in May 1940. The set worked well, spotting enemy aircraft during the first days of fighting. To prevent capture, operating units and plans for the system were destroyed. Von Weiler and Max Staal fled to England aboard one of the last ships able to leave, carrying two disassembled sets with them. Later, Gratama and van Leeuwen also escaped to England. ==France== In 1927, French physicists Camille Gutton and Emile Pierret experimented with magnetrons and other devices generating wavelengths going down to 16 cm. Camille's son, Henri Gutton, was with the Compagnie générale de la télégraphie sans fil (CSF) where he and Robert Warneck improved his father's magnetrons. In 1934, following systematic studies on the magnetron, the research branch of the CSF, headed by Maurice Ponte, submitted a patent application for a device designed to detect obstacles using continuous radiation of ultra-short wavelengths produced by a magnetron.French patent (no. 788.795, \\"New system of location of obstacles and its applications\\") These were still CW systems and depended on Doppler interference for detection. However, as most modern radars, antennas were collocated.Molyneux-Berry, R. B.; “Henri Gutton, French radar pioneer”, in Radar Development to 1945, ed. by Russell Burns, Peter Peregrinus, 1988, pp. 45–52 The device was measuring distance and azimuth but not directly as in the later \\"radar\\" on a screen (1939). Still, this was the first patent of an operational radio-detection apparatus using centimetric wavelengths. The system was tested in late 1934 aboard the cargo ship Oregon, with two transmitters working at 80 cm and 16 cm wavelengths. Coastlines and boats were detected from a range of 10–12 nautical miles. The shortest wavelength was chosen for the final design, which equipped the liner as early as mid-1935 for operational use. In late 1937, Maurice Elie at SFR developed a means of pulse- modulating transmitter tubes. This led to a new 16-cm system with a peak power near 500 W and a pulse width of 6 μs. French and U.S. patents were filed in December 1939.\\"System for Object Detection and Distance Measurement\\" http://www.freepatentsonline.com/2433838.html The system was planned to be sea-tested aboard the Normandie, but this was cancelled at the outbreak of war. At the same time, Pierre David at the Laboratoire National de Radioélectricité (National Laboratory of Radioelectricity, LNR) experimented with reflected radio signals at about a meter wavelength. Starting in 1931, he observed that aircraft caused interference to the signals. The LNR then initiated research on a detection technique called barrage électromagnétique (electromagnetic curtain). While this could indicate the general location of penetration, precise determination of direction and speed was not possible. In 1936, the Défense Aérienne du Territoire (Defence of Air Territory), ran tests on David's electromagnetic curtain. In the tests, the system detected most of the entering aircraft, but too many were missed. As the war grew closer, the need for an aircraft detection was critical. David realized the advantages of a pulsed system, and in October 1938 he designed a 50 MHz, pulse-modulated system with a peak-pulse power of 12 kW. This was built by the firm SADIR.David, Pierre; Le Radar (The Radar), Presses Universitaires de France, 1949 (in French) France declared war on Germany on September 1, 1939, and there was a great need for an early-warning detection system. The SADIR system was taken to near Toulon, and detected and measured the range of invading aircraft as far as . The SFR pulsed system was set up near Paris where it detected aircraft at ranges up to . However, the German advance was overwhelming and emergency measures had to be taken; it was too late for France to develop radars alone and it was decided that her breakthroughs would be shared with her allies. In mid-1940, Maurice Ponte, from the laboratories of CSF in Paris, presented a cavity magnetron designed by Henri Gutton at SFR (see above) to the GEC laboratories at Wembley, Britain. This magnetron was designed for pulsed operation at a wavelength of 16 cm. Unlike other magnetron designs to that day, such as the Boots and Randall magnetron (see British contributions above), this tube used an oxide-coated cathode with a peak power output of 1 kW, demonstrating that oxide cathodes were the solution for producing high-power pulses at short wavelengths, a problem which had eluded British and American researchers for years. The significance this event was underlined by Eric Megaw, in a 1946 review of early radar developments: \\"This was the starting point of the use of the oxide cathode in practically all our subsequent pulsed transmitting waves and as such was a significant contribution to British radar. The date was the 8th May 1940\\".Megaw, Eric C. S.; “The High-Power Magnetron: A Review of Early Developments”, Journal of the IEE, vol. 93, 1946, p. 928, A tweaked version of this magnetron reached a peak output of 10 kW by August 1940. It was that model which, in turn, was handed to the Americans as a token of good faithPaul A. Redhead, The invention of the cavity magnetron and its introduction into Canada and the U.S.A., PHYSICS IN CANADA, November/December 2001, during the negotiations made by the Tizard delegation in 1940 to obtain from the U.S. the resources necessary for Britain to exploit the full military potential of her research and development work. ==Italy== Guglielmo Marconi initiated the research in Italy on radio-based detection technology. In 1933, while participating with his Italian firm in experiments with a 600 MHz communications link across Rome, he noted transmission disturbances caused by moving objects adjacent to its path. This led to the development at his laboratory at Cornegliano of a 330-MHz (0.91-m) CW Doppler detection system that he called radioecometro. Barkhausen- Kurz tubes were used in both the transmitter and receiver. In May 1935, Marconi demonstrated his system to the Fascist dictator Benito Mussolini and members of the military General Staff; however the output power was insufficient for military use. While Marconi's demonstration raised considerable interest, little more was done with his apparatus. Mussolini directed that radio-based detection technology be further developed, and it was assigned to the Regio Istituto Elettrotecnico e delle Comunicazioni (RIEC, Royal Institute for Electro-technics and Communications). The RIEC had been established in 1916 on the campus of the Italian Naval Academy in Livorno. Lieutenant Ugo Tiberio, a physics and radio-technology instructor at the Academy, was assigned to head the project on a part-time basis.Calamia, M., and R. Palandri; “The History of the Italian Radio Detector Telemetro”, in Radar Development to 1945, ed. by Russell Burns, Peter Peregrinus, 1988, pp. 97–105 Tiberio prepared a report on developing an experimental apparatus that he called telemetro radiofonico del rivelatore (RDT, Radio-Detector Telemetry). The report, submitted in mid-1936, included what was later known as the radar range equation. When the work got underway, Nello Carrara, a civilian physics instructor who had been doing research at the RIEC in microwaves,Carrara, N.; “The detection of microwaves”, Proc. IRE, vol. 20, Oct. 1932, pp. 1615–1625 was added to be responsible for developing the RDT transmitter. Before the end of 1936, Tiberio and Carrara had demonstrated the EC-1, the first Italian RDT system. This had an FM transmitter operating at 200 MHz (1.5 m) with a single parabolic cylinder antenna. It detected by mixing the transmitted and the Doppler-shifted reflected signals, resulting in an audible tone. The EC-1 did not provide a range measurement; to add this capability, development of a pulsed system was initiated in 1937. Captain Alfeo Brandimarte joined the group and primarily designed the first pulsed system, the EC-2. This operated at 175 MHz (1.7 m) and used a single antenna made with a number of equi-phased dipoles. The detected signal was intended to be displayed on an oscilloscope. There were many problems, and the system never reached the testing stage. Work then turned to developing higher power and operating frequencies. Carrara, in cooperation with the firm FIVRE, developed a magnetron-like device. This was composed of a pair of triodes connected to a resonate cavity and produced 10 kW at 425 MHz (70 cm). It was used in designing two versions of the EC-3, one for shipboard and the other for coastal defense.Tiberio, U.; “Some historical data concerning the first Italian naval radar”, IEEE Trans. AES, vol. 15, Sept., 1979, p. 733 Italy, joining Germany, entered WWII in June 1940 without an operational RDT. A breadboard of the EC-3 was built and tested from atop a building at the Academy, but most RDT work was stopped as direct support of the war took priority. ==Others== In early 1939, the British Government invited representatives from the most technically advanced Commonwealth Nations to visit England for briefings and demonstrations on the highly secret RDF (radar) technology. Based on this, RDF developments were started in Australia, Canada, New Zealand, and South Africa by September 1939. In addition, this technology was independently developed in Hungary early in the war period. In Australia, the Radiophysics Laboratory was established at Sydney University under the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research; John H. Piddington was responsible for RDF development. The first project was a 200-MHz (1.5-m) shore-defense system for the Australian Army. Designated ShD, this was first tested in September 1941, and eventually installed at 17 ports. Following the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, the Royal Australian Air Force urgently needed an air-warning system, and Piddington's team, using the ShD as a basis, put the AW Mark I together in five days. It was being installed in Darwin, Northern Territory, when Australia received the first Japanese attack on February 19, 1942. A short time later, it was converted to a light-weight transportable version, the LW-AW Mark II; this was used by the Australian forces, as well as the U.S. Army, in early island landings in the South Pacific.Sinnott, D. H.; “Radar Development in Australia: 1939 to Present”, Proc. of IEEE 2005 International Radar Conference, 9–12 May, pp. 5–9 The early RDF developments in Canada were at the Radio Section of the National Research Council of Canada. Using commercial components and with essentially no further assistance from Britain, John Tasker Henderson led a team in developing the Night Watchman, a surface-warning system for the Royal Canadian Navy to protect the entrance to the Halifax Harbour. Successfully tested in July 1940, this set operated at 200 MHz (1.5 m), had a 1 kW output with a pulse length of 0.5 μs, and used a relatively small, fixed antenna. This was followed by a ship-borne set designated Surface Warning 1st Canadian (SW1C) with the antenna hand-rotated through the use of a Chevrolet steering wheel in the operator's compartment. The SW1C was first tested at sea in mid-May 1941, but the performance was so poor compared to the Royal Navy's Model 271 ship-borne radar that the Royal Canadian Navy eventually adopted the British 271 in place of the SW1C. For coastal defense by the Canadian Army, a 200 MHz set with a transmitter similar to the Night Watchman was developed. Designated CD, it used a large, rotating antenna atop a wooden tower. The CD was put into operation in January 1942.Moorcroft, Don; “Origins of Radar-based Research in Canada”, Univ. Western Ontario, 2002; Ernest Marsden represented New Zealand at the briefings in England, and then established two facilities for RDF development – one in Wellington at the Radio Section of the Central NZ Post Office, and another at Canterbury University College in Christchurch. Charles N. Watson-Munro led the development of land-based and airborne sets at Wellington, while Frederick W. G. White led the development of shipboard sets at Christchurch. Before the end of 1939, the Wellington group had converted an existing 180-MHz (1.6-m), 1 kW transmitter to produce 2-μs pulses and tested it to detect large vessels at up to 30 km; this was designated CW (Coastal Watching). A similar set, designated CD (Coast Defense) used a CRT for display and had lobe-switching on the receiving antenna; this was deployed in Wellington in late 1940. A partially completed ASV 200 MHz set was brought from Britain by Marsden, and another group at Wellington built this into an aircraft set for the Royal New Zealand Air Force; this was first flown in early 1940. At Christchurch, there was a smaller staff and work went slower, but by July 1940, a 430-MHz (70-cm), 5 kW set was tested. Two types, designated SW (Ship Warning) and SWG (Ship Warning, Gunnery), were placed into service by the Royal New Zealand Navy starting in August 1941. In all some 44 types were developed in New Zealand during WWII.Unwin, R. S.; “Development of Radar in New Zealand in World War II”, IEEE Antennas and Propagation Magazine, vol. 34, June, pp.31–33, 1992 South Africa did not have a representative at the 1939 meetings in England, but in mid-September, as Ernest Marsden was returning by ship to New Zealand, Basil F. J. Schonland came aboard and received three days of briefings. Schonland, a world authority on lightning and Director of the Bernard Price Institute of Geophysics at Witwatersrand University, immediately started an RDF development using amateur radio components and Institute's lightning-monitoring equipment. Designated JB (for Johannesburg), the 90-MHz (3.3-m), 500-W mobile system was tested in November 1939, just two months after its start. The prototype was operated in Durban before the end of 1939, detecting ships and aircraft at distances up to 80 km, and by the next March a system was fielded by anti-aircraft brigades of the South African Defence Force.Hewitt, F. J.; “South Africa’s Role in the Development and Use of Radar in World War II”, Military History Journal, vol. 3, no, 3, June 1975; In Hungary, Zoltán Lajos Bay was a Professor of Physics at the Technical University of Budapest as well as the Research Director of Egyesült Izzolampa (IZZO), a radio and electrical manufacturing firm. In late 1942, IZZO was directed by the Minister of Defense to develop a radio-location (rádiólokáció, radar) system. Using journal papers on ionospheric measurements for information on pulsed transmission, Bay developed a system called Sas (Eagle) around existing communications hardware. The Sas operated at 120 MHz (2.5 m) and was in a cabin with separate transmitting and receiving dipole arrays attached; the assembly was all on a rotatable platform. According to published records, the system was tested in 1944 atop Mount János and had a range of “better than 500 km”. A second Sas was installed at another location. There is no indication that either Sas installation was ever in regular service. After the war, Bay used a modified Sas to successfully bounce a signal off the moon.Renner, Peter; “The Role of the Hungarian Engineers in the Development of Radar Systems”, Periodica Polytechnica Ser. Soc. Man. Sci, Vol. 12, p. 277, 2004; ==World War II radar== At the start of World War II in September 1939, both the United Kingdom and Germany knew of each other's ongoing efforts in radio navigation and its countermeasures – the \\"Battle of the beams\\". Also, both nations were generally aware of, and intensely interested in, the other's developments in radio-based detection and tracking, and engaged in an active campaign of espionage and false leaks about their respective equipment. By the time of the Battle of Britain, both sides were deploying range and direction-finding units (radars) and control stations as part of integrated air defense capability. However, the German Funkmessgerät (radio measuring device) systems could not assist in an offensive role and was thus not supported by Adolf Hitler. Also, the Luftwaffe did not sufficiently appreciate the importance of British Range and Direction Finding (RDF) stations as part of RAF's air defense capability, contributing to their failure. While the United Kingdom and Germany led in pre-war advances in the use of radio for detection and tracking of aircraft, there were also developments in the United States, the Soviet Union, and Japan. Wartime systems in all of these nations will be summarized. The acronym RADAR (for RAdio Detection And Ranging) was coined by the U.S. Navy in 1940, and the subsequent name \\"radar\\" was soon widely used. The XAF and CXAM search radars were designed by the Naval Research Laboratory, and were the first operational radars in the US fleet, produced by RCA. When France had just fallen to the Nazis and Britain had no money to develop the magnetron on a massive scale, Churchill agreed that Sir Henry Tizard should offer the magnetron to the Americans in exchange for their financial and industrial help (the Tizard Mission). An early 6 kW version, built in England by the General Electric Company Research Laboratories, Wembley, London (not to be confused with the similarly named American company General Electric), was given to the US government in September 1940. The British magnetron was a thousand times more powerful than the best American transmitter at the time and produced accurate pulses. At the time the most powerful equivalent microwave producer available in the US (a klystron) had a power of only ten watts. The cavity magnetron was widely used during World War II in microwave radar equipment and is often credited with giving Allied radar a considerable performance advantage over German and Japanese radars, thus directly influencing the outcome of the war. It was later described by noted Historian James Phinney Baxter III as \\"The most valuable cargo ever brought to our shores\\".James Phinney Baxter III (Official Historian of the Office of Scientific Research and Development), Scientists Against Time (Boston: Little, Brown, and Co., 1946), page 142. The Bell Telephone Laboratories made a producible version from the magnetron delivered to America by the Tizard Mission, and before the end of 1940, the Radiation Laboratory had been set up on the campus of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology to develop various types of radar using the magnetron. By early 1941, portable centimetric airborne radars were being tested in American and British aircraft. In late 1941, the Telecommunications Research Establishment in Great Britain used the magnetron to develop a revolutionary airborne, ground-mapping radar codenamed H2S. The H2S radar was in part developed by Alan Blumlein and Bernard Lovell. The magnetron radars used by the US and Britain could spot the periscope of a U-boat ==Post-war radar== World War II, which gave impetus to the great surge in radar development, ended between the Allies and Germany in May 1945, followed by Japan in August. With this, radar activities in Germany and Japan ceased for a number of years. In other countries, particularly the United States, Britain, and the USSR, the politically unstable post-war years saw continued radar improvements for military applications. In fact, these three nations all made significant efforts in bringing scientists and engineers from Germany to work in their weapon programs; in the U.S., this was under Operation Paperclip. Even before the end of the war, various projects directed toward non-military applications of radar and closely related technologies were initiated. The US Army Air Forces and the British RAF had made wartime advances in using radar for handling aircraft landing, and this was rapidly expanded into the civil sector. The field of radio astronomy was one of the related technologies; although discovered before the war, it immediately flourished in the late 1940s with many scientists around the world establishing new careers based on their radar experience. Four techniques, highly important in post-war radars, were matured in the late 1940s-early 1950s: pulse Doppler, monopulse, phased array, and synthetic aperture; the first three were known and even used during wartime developments, but were matured later. *Pulse-Doppler radar (often known as moving target indication or MTI), uses the Doppler-shifted signals from targets to better detect moving targets in the presence of clutter.Barlow, E. J.; “Doppler Radar”, Proc. IRE, vol. 37, pp. 340–355, April 1949 *Monopulse radar (also called simultaneous lobing) was conceived by Robert Page at the NRL in 1943. With this, the system derives error-angle information from a single pulse, greatly improving the tracking accuracy.Page, R. M.; “Monopulse Radar”, op. cet. *Phased-array radar has the many segments of a large antenna separately controlled, allowing the beam to be quickly directed. This greatly reduces the time necessary to change the beam direction from one point to another, allowing almost simultaneous tracking of multiple targets while maintaining overall surveillance.Von Aulock, W. H.; “Properties of Phased Arrays”, Proc. IRE, vol. 48, pp. 1715–1727, Oct., 1960 *Synthetic- aperture radar (SAR), was invented in the early 1950s at Goodyear Aircraft Corporation. Using a single, relatively small antenna carried on an aircraft, a SAR combines the returns from each pulse to produce a high-resolution image of the terrain comparable to that obtained by a much larger antenna. SAR has wide applications, particularly in mapping and remote sensing.”Airborne Synthetic Aperture Radar”; One of the early applications of digital computers was in switching the signal phase in elements of large phased-array antennas. As smaller computers came into being, these were quickly applied to digital signal processing using algorithms for improving radar performance. Other advances in radar systems and applications in the decades following WWII are far too many to be included herein. The following sections are intended to provide representative samples. ===Military radars=== In the United States, the Rad Lab at MIT officially closed at the end of 1945. The Naval Research Laboratory (NRL) and the Army's Evans Signal Laboratory continued with new activities in centimeter radar development. The United States Air Force (USAF) – separated from the Army in 1946 – concentrated radar research at their Cambridge Research Center (CRC) at Hanscom Field, Massachusetts. In 1951, MIT opened the Lincoln Laboratory for joint developments with the CRC. While the Bell Telephone Laboratories embarked on major communications upgrades, they continued with the Army in radar for their ongoing Nike air-defense program In Britain, the RAF's Telecommunications Research Establishment (TRE) and the Army's Radar Research and Development Establishment (RRDE) both continued at reduced levels at Malvern, Worcestershire, then in 1953 were combined to form the Radar Research Establishment. In 1948, all of the Royal Navy's radio and radar R&D; activities were combined to form the Admiralty Signal and Radar Establishment, located near Portsmouth, Hampshire. The USSR, although devastated by the war, immediately embarked on the development of new weapons, including radars. During the Cold War period following WWII, the primary \\"axis\\" of combat shifted to lie between the United States and the Soviet Union. By 1949, both sides had nuclear weapons carried by bombers. To provide early warning of an attack, both deployed huge radar networks of increasing sophistication at ever-more remote locations. In the West, the first such system was the Pinetree Line, deployed across Canada in the early 1950s, backed up with radar pickets on ships and oil platforms off the east and west coasts. The Pinetree Line initially used vintage pulsed radars and was soon supplemented with the Mid-Canada Line (MCL). Soviet technology improvements made these Lines inadequate and, in a construction project involving 25,000 persons, the Distant Early Warning Line (DEW Line) was completed in 1957. Stretching from Alaska to Baffin Island and covering over , the DEW Line consisted of 63 stations with AN/FPS-19 high-power, pulsed, L-Band radars, most augmented by AN/FPS-23 pulse-Doppler systems. The Soviet Unit tested its first Intercontinental Ballistic Missile (ICBM) in August 1957, and in a few years the early-warning role was passed almost entirely to the more capable DEW Line. Both the U.S. and the Soviet Union then had ICBMs with nuclear warheads, and each began the development of a major anti-ballistic missile (ABM) system. In the USSR, this was the Fakel V-1000, and for this they developed powerful radar systems. This was eventually deployed around Moscow as the A-35 anti-ballistic missile system, supported by radars designated by NATO as the Cat House, Dog House, and Hen House. In 1957, the U.S. Army initiated an ABM system first called Nike-X; this passed through several names, eventually becoming the Safeguard Program. For this, there was a long- range Perimeter Acquisition Radar (PAR) and a shorter-range, more precise Missile Site Radar (MSR).”ABM Research and Development at Bell Laboratories”, The PAR was housed in a -high nuclear-hardened building with one face sloping 25 degrees facing north. This contained 6,888 antenna elements separated in transmitting and receiving phased arrays. The L-Band transmitter used 128 long-life traveling-wave tubes (TWTs), having a combined power in the megawatt range The PAR could detect incoming missiles outside the atmosphere at distances up to . The MSR had an , truncated pyramid structure, with each face holding a phased-array antenna in diameter and containing 5,001 array elements used for both transmitting and receiving. Operating in the S-Band, the transmitter used two klystrons functioning in parallel, each with megawatt- level power. The MSR could search for targets from all directions, acquiring them at up to range. One Safeguard site, intended to defend Minuteman ICBM missile silos near the Grand Forks AFB in North Dakota, was finally completed in October 1975, but the U.S. Congress withdrew all funding after it was operational but a single day. During the following decades, the U.S. Army and the U.S. Air Force developed a variety of large radar systems, but the long- serving BTL gave up military development work in the 1970s. A modern radar developed by of the U.S. Navy is the AN/SPY-1. First fielded in 1973, this S-Band, 6 MW system has gone through a number of variants and is a major component of the Aegis Combat System. An automatic detect-and-track system, it is computer controlled using four complementary three-dimensional passive electronically scanned array antennas to provide hemispherical coverage. Radar signals, traveling with line-of-sight propagation, normally have a range to ground targets limited by the visible horizon, or less than about . Airborne targets can be detected by ground-level radars at greater ranges, but, at best, several hundred miles. Since the beginning of radio, it had been known that signals of appropriate frequencies (3 to 30 MHz) could be “bounced” from the ionosphere and received at considerable distances. As long-range bombers and missiles came into being, there was a need to have radars give early warnings at great ranges. In the early 1950s, a team at the Naval Research Laboratory came up with the Over-the-Horizon (OTH) radar for this purpose. To distinguish targets from other reflections, it was necessary to use a phase- Doppler system. Very sensitive receivers with low-noise amplifiers had to be developed. Since the signal going to the target and returning had a propagation loss proportional to the range raised to the fourth power, a powerful transmitter and large antennas were required. A digital computer with considerable capability (new at that time) was necessary for analyzing the data. In 1950, their first experimental system was able to detect rocket launches away at Cape Canaveral, and the cloud from a nuclear explosion in Nevada distant. In the early 1970s, a joint American-British project, code named Cobra Mist, used a 10-MW OTH radar at Orfordness (the birthplace of British radar), England, in an attempt to detect aircraft and missile launchings over the Western USSR. Because of US-USSR ABM agreements, this was abandoned within two years.”Cobra Mist”; In the same time period, the Soviets were developing a similar system; this successfully detected a missile launch at . By 1976, this had matured into an operational system named Duga (“Arc” in English), but known to western intelligence as Steel Yard and called Woodpecker by radio amateurs and others who suffered from its interference – the transmitter was estimated to have a power of 10 MW.”Mystery Signals Of The Short Wave”, Wireless World, Feb. 1977; Australia, Canada, and France also developed OTH radar systems. With the advent of satellites with early-warning capabilities, the military lost most of its interest in OTH radars. However, in recent years, this technology has been reactivated for detecting and tracking ocean shipping in applications such as maritime reconnaissance and drug enforcement. Systems using an alternate technology have also been developed for over-the-horizon detection. Due to diffraction, electromagnetic surface waves are scattered to the rear of objects, and these signals can be detected in a direction opposite from high-powered transmissions. Called OTH- SW (SW for Surface Wave), Russia is using such a system to monitor the Sea of Japan, and Canada has a system for coastal surveillance. ===Civil aviation radars=== The post-war years saw the beginning of a revolutionary development in Air Traffic Control (ATC) – the introduction of radar. In 1946, the Civil Aeronautics Administration (CAA) unveiled an experimental radar-equipped tower for control of civil flights. By 1952, the CAA had begun its first routine use of radar for approach and departure control. Four years later, it placed a large order for long-range radars for use in en route ATC; these had the capability, at higher altitudes, to see aircraft within 200 nautical miles (370 km). In 1960, it became required for aircraft flying in certain areas to carry a radar transponder that identified the aircraft and helped improve radar performance. Since 1966, the responsible agency has been called the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA). A Terminal Radar Approach Control (TRACON) is an ATC facility usually located within the vicinity of a large airport. In the US Air Force it is known as RAPCON (Radar Approach Control), and in the US Navy as a RATCF (Radar Air Traffic Control Facility). Typically, the TRACON controls aircraft within a 30 to 50 nautical mile (56 to 93 km) radius of the airport at an altitude between 10,000 and 15,000 feet (3,000 to 4,600 m). This uses one or more Airport Surveillance Radars (ASR-8, 9 and 11, ASR-7 is obsolete), sweeping the sky once every few seconds. These Primary ASR radars are typically paired with secondary radars (Air Traffic Radar Beacon Interrogators, or ATCBI) of the ATCBI-5, Mode S or MSSR types. Unlike primary radar, secondary radar relies upon an aircraft based transponder, which receives an interrogation from the ground and replies with an appropriate digital code which includes the aircraft id and reports the aircraft's altitude. The principle is similar to the military IFF Identification friend or foe. The secondary radar antenna array rides atop the primary radar dish at the radar site, with both rotating at approximately 12 revolutions per minute. The Digital Airport Surveillance Radar (DASR) is a newer TRACON radar system, replacing the old analog systems with digital technology. The civilian nomenclature for these radars is the ASR-9 and the ASR-11, and AN/GPN-30 is used by the military. In the ASR-11, two radar systems are included. The primary is an S-Band (~2.8 GHz) system with 25 kW pulse power. It provides 3-D tracking of target aircraft and also measures rainfall intensity. The secondary is a P-Band (~1.05 GHz) system with a peak-power of about 25 kW. It uses a transponder set to interrogate aircraft and receive operational data. The antennas for both systems rotate atop a tall tower.”Airport Surveillance Radars”; ===Weather radar=== David Atlas During World War II, military radar operators noticed noise in returned echoes due to weather elements like rain, snow, and sleet. Just after the war, military scientists returned to civilian life or continued in the Armed Forces and pursued their work in developing a use for those echoes. In the United States, David Atlas,David Atlas, \\"Radar in Meteorology\\", published by American Meteorological Society for the Air Force group at first, and later for MIT, developed the first operational weather radars. In Canada, J.S. Marshall and R.H. Douglas formed the \\"Stormy Weather Group \\" in Montreal. Marshall and his doctoral student Walter Palmer are well known for their work on the drop size distribution in mid-latitude rain that led to understanding of the Z-R relation, which correlates a given radar reflectivity with the rate at which water is falling on the ground. In the United Kingdom, research continued to study the radar echo patterns and weather elements such as stratiform rain and convective clouds, and experiments were done to evaluate the potential of different wavelengths from 1 to 10 centimetres. Between 1950 and 1980, reflectivity radars, which measure position and intensity of precipitation, were built by weather services around the world. In United States, the U.S. Weather Bureau, established in 1870 with the specific mission of to provide meteorological observations and giving notice of approaching storms, developed the WSR-1 (Weather Surveillance Radar-1), one of the first weather radars. This was a modified version of the AN/APS-2F radar, which the Weather Bureau acquired from the Navy. The WSR-1A, WSR-3, and WSR-4 were also variants of this radar.Whiton, Roger C., et al. \\"History of Operational Use of Weather Radar by U.S. Weather Services. Part I: The Pre-NEXRAD Era\\"; Weather and Forecasting, vol. 13, no. 2, pp. 219–243, 19 Feb. 1998; http://ams.allenpress.com/amsonline/?request=get- document&doi;=10.1175%2F1520-0434(1998)013%3C0219:HOOUOW%3E2.0.CO%3B2 This was followed by the WSR-57 (Weather Surveillance Radar – 1957) was the first weather radar designed specifically for a national warning network. Using WWII technology based on vacuum tubes, it gave only coarse reflectivity data and no velocity information. Operating at 2.89 GHz (S-Band), it had a peak-power of 410 kW and a maximum range of about . AN/FPS-41 was the military designation for the WSR-57. The early meteorologists had to watch a cathode ray tube. During the 1970s, radars began to be standardized and organized into larger networks. The next significant change in the United States was the WSR-74 series, beginning operations in 1974. There were two types: the WSR-74S, for replacements and filling gaps in the WSR-57 national network, and the WSR-74C, primarily for local use. Both were transistor-based, and their primary technical difference was indicated by the letter, S band (better suited for long range) and C band, respectively. Until the 1990s, there were 128 of the WSR-57 and WSR-74 model radars were spread across that country. The first devices to capture radar images were developed during the same period. The number of scanned angles was increased to get a three-dimensional view of the precipitation, so that horizontal cross-sections (CAPPI) and vertical ones could be performed. Studies of the organization of thunderstorms were then possible for the Alberta Hail Project in Canada and National Severe Storms Laboratory (NSSL) in the US in particular. The NSSL, created in 1964, began experimentation on dual polarization signals and on Doppler effect uses. In May 1973, a tornado devastated Union City, Oklahoma, just west of Oklahoma City. For the first time, a Dopplerized 10-cm wavelength radar from NSSL documented the entire life cycle of the tornado. The researchers discovered a mesoscale rotation in the cloud aloft before the tornado touched the ground : the tornadic vortex signature. NSSL's research helped convince the National Weather Service that Doppler radar was a crucial forecasting tool. Between 1980 and 2000, weather radar networks became the norm in North America, Europe, Japan and other developed countries. Conventional radars were replaced by Doppler radars, which in addition to position and intensity of could track the relative velocity of the particles in the air. In the United States, the construction of a network consisting of wavelength radars, called NEXRAD or WSR-88D (Weather Service Radar 1988 Doppler), was started in 1988 following NSSL's research. In Canada, Environment Canada constructed the King City station, with a five centimeter research Doppler radar, by 1985; McGill University dopplerized its radar (J. S. Marshall Radar Observatory) in 1993. This led to a complete Canadian Doppler network between 1998 and 2004. France and other European countries switched to Doppler network by the end of the 1990s to early 2000s. Meanwhile, rapid advances in computer technology led to algorithms to detect signs of severe weather and a plethora of \\"products\\" for media outlets and researchers. After 2000, research on dual polarization technology moved into operational use, increasing the amount of information available on precipitation type (e.g. rain vs. snow). \\"Dual polarization\\" means that microwave radiation which is polarized both horizontally and vertically (with respect to the ground) is emitted. Wide-scale deployment is expected by the end of the decade in some countries such as the United States, France, and Canada. Since 2003, the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration has been experimenting with phased-array radar as a replacement for conventional parabolic antenna to provide more time resolution in atmospheric sounding. This would be very important in severe thunderstorms as their evolution can be better evaluated with more timely data. Also in 2003, the National Science Foundation established the Engineering Research Center for Collaborative Adaptive Sensing of the Atmosphere, \\"CASA\\", a multidisciplinary, multi-university collaboration of engineers, computer scientists, meteorologists, and sociologists to conduct fundamental research, develop enabling technology, and deploy prototype engineering systems designed to augment existing radar systems by sampling the generally undersampled lower troposphere with inexpensive, fast scanning, dual polarization, mechanically scanned and phased array radars. ===Mapping radar=== The plan position indicator, dating from the early days of radar and still the most common type of display, provides a map of the targets surrounding the radar location. If the radar antenna on an aircraft is aimed downward, a map of the terrain is generated, and the larger the antenna, the greater the image resolution. After centimeter radar came into being, downward-looking radars – the H2S ( L-Band) and H2X (C-Band) – provided real-time maps used by the U.S. and Britain in bombing runs over Europe at night and through dense clouds. In 1951, Carl Wiley led a team at Goodyear Aircraft Corporation (later Goodyear Aerospace) in developing a technique for greatly expanding and improving the resolution of radar-generated images. Called synthetic aperture radar (SAR), an ordinary- sized antenna fixed to the side of an aircraft is used with highly complex signal processing to give an image that would otherwise require a much larger, scanning antenna; thus, the name synthetic aperture. As each pulse is emitted, it is radiated over a lateral band onto the terrain. The return is spread in time, due to reflections from features at different distances. Motion of the vehicle along the flight path gives the horizontal increments. The amplitude and phase of returns are combined by the signal processor using Fourier transform techniques in forming the image. The overall technique is closely akin to optical holography. Through the years, many variations of the SAR have been made with diversified applications resulting. In initial systems, the signal processing was too complex for on-board operation; the signals were recorded and processed later. Processors using optical techniques were then tried for generating real-time images, but advances in high-speed electronics now allow on-board processes for most applications. Early systems gave a resolution in tens of meters, but more recent airborne systems provide resolutions to about 10 cm. Current ultra-wideband systems have resolutions of a few millimeters. ===Other radars and applications=== There are many other post-war radar systems and applications. Only a few will be noted. ====Radar gun==== The most widespread radar device today is undoubtedly the radar gun. This is a small, usually hand-held, Doppler radar that is used to detect the speed of objects, especially trucks and automobiles in regulating traffic, as well as pitched baseballs, runners, or other moving objects in sports. This device can also be used to measure the surface speed of water and continuously manufactured materials. A radar gun does not return information regarding the object's position; it uses the Doppler effect to measure the speed of a target. First developed in 1954, most radar guns operate with very low power in the X or Ku Bands. Some use infrared radiation or laser light; these are usually called LIDAR. A related technology for velocity measurements in flowing liquids or gasses is called laser Doppler velocimetry; this technology dates from the mid-1960s. ====Impulse radar==== As pulsed radars were initially being developed, the use of very narrow pulses was examined. The pulse length governs the accuracy of distance measurement by radar – the shorter the pulse, the greater the precision. Also, for a given pulse repetition frequency (PRF), a shorter pulse results in a higher peak power. Harmonic analysis shows that the narrower the pulse, the wider the band of frequencies that contain the energy, leading to such systems also being called wide-band radars. In the early days, the electronics for generating and receiving these pulses was not available; thus, essentially no applications of this were initially made. By the 1970s, advances in electronics led to renewed interest in what was often called short-pulse radar. With further advances, it became practical to generate pulses having a width on the same order as the period of the RF carrier (T = 1/f). This is now generally called impulse radar. The first significant application of this technology was in ground- penetrating radar (GPR). Developed in the 1970s, GPR is now used for structural foundation analysis, archeological mapping, treasure hunting, unexploded ordnance identification, and other shallow investigations. This is possible because impulse radar can concisely locate the boundaries between the general media (the soil) and the desired target. The results, however, are non-unique and are highly dependent upon the skill of the operator and the subsequent interpretation of the data. In dry or otherwise favorable soil and rock, penetration up to is often possible. For distance measurements at these short ranges, the transmitted pulse is usually only one radio-frequency cycle in duration; With a 100 MHz carrier and a PRF of 10 kHz (typical parameters), the pulse duration is only 10 ns (nanosecond). leading to the \\"impulse\\" designation. A variety of GPR systems are commercially available in back-pack and wheeled-cart versions with pulse-power up to a kilowatt.Daniels, Jeffrey J.; “Ground Penetrating Radar Fundamentals”; With continued development of electronics, systems with pulse durations measured in picoseconds became possible. Applications are as varied as security and motion sensors, building stud-finders, collision-warning devices, and cardiac-dynamics monitors. Some of these devices are matchbox sized, including a long-life power source.”Micropower Impulse Radar”; ====Radar astronomy==== As radar was being developed, astronomers considered its application in making observations of the Moon and other near-by extraterrestrial objects. In 1944, Zoltán Lajos Bay had this as a major objective as he developed a radar in Hungary. His radar telescope was taken away by the conquering Soviet army and had to be rebuilt, thus delaying the experiment. Under Project Diana conducted by the Army's Evans Signal Laboratory in New Jersey, a modified SCR-271 radar (the fixed- position version of the SCR-270) operating at 110 MHz with 3 kW peak-power, was used in receiving echoes from the Moon on January 10, 1946.Mofenson, Jack; “Radio Echoes From the Moon”, Electronics, April 1946; Zoltán Bay accomplished this on the following February 6.Bay, Z.; \\"Reflection of microwaves from the moon\\", Hung. Acta Phys., vol. 1, pp. 1–22, April 1946. 1946 newsreel Radio astronomy also had its start following WWII, and many scientists involved in radar development then entered this field. A number of radio observatories were constructed during the following years; however, because of the additional cost and complexity of involving transmitters and associated receiving equipment, very few were dedicated to radar astronomy. In fact, essentially all major radar astronomy activities have been conducted as adjuncts to radio astronomy observatories. The radio telescope at the Arecibo Observatory, opened in 1963, is the largest in the world. Owned by the U.S. National Science Foundation and contractor operated, it is used primarily for radio astronomy, but equipment is available for radar astronomy. This includes transmitters operating at 47 MHz, 439 MHz, and 2.38 GHz, all with very-high pulse power. It has a 305-m (1,000-ft) primary reflector fixed in position; the secondary reflector is on tracks to allow precise pointing to different parts of the sky. Many significant scientific discoveries have been made using the Arecibo radar telescope, including mapping of surface roughness of Mars and observations of Saturns and its largest moon, Titan. In 1989, the observatory radar-imaged an asteroid for the first time in history. Several spacecraft orbiting the Moon, Mercury, Venus, Mars, and Saturn have carried radars for surface mapping; a ground-penetration radar was carried on the Mars Express mission. Radar systems on a number of aircraft and orbiting spacecraft have mapped the entire Earth for various purposes; on the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission, the entire planet was mapped at a 30-m resolution. The Jodrell Bank Observatory, an operation of the University of Manchester in Britain, was originally started by Bernard Lovell to be a radar astronomy facility. It initially used a war-surplus GL-II radar system operating at 71 MHz (4.2 m). The first observations were of ionized trails in the Geminids meteor shower during December 1945. While the facility soon evolved to become the third largest radio observatory in the world, some radar astronomy continued. The largest (250-ft or 76-m in diameter) of their three fully steerable radio telescopes became operational just in time to radar track Sputnik 1, the first artificial satellite, in October 1957.Lovell, Bernard; Story of Jodrell Bank, Oxford U.

Wishing to make such introspection available to others he developed Naikan as a less difficult method which he first introduced to young people who had been incarcerated for committing crime and social disturbances. Later the practice was introduced to the general public. Naikan practitioners claim that Naikan helps people understand themselves and their relationships. Naikan practice is based on three questions: * What have I received from (person x)? * What have I given to (person x)? * What troubles and difficulties have I caused to (person x)? A related fourth question, \\"What troubles and difficulties has (person x) caused me\\", is purposely ignored in Naikan. (Naikan) presupposes that we're all naturally good at seeing answers to this fourth question, and that too much focus on this question is responsible for much of one's misery in day-to-day life. There are many forms of Naikan practice, all focusing on these three questions. The most rigorous form of Naikan is practiced in one week Naikan retreats. Naikan retreats start by focusing on the three questions on the individual's relationship to their mother. The questions can then later be expanded outwards to other relationships. During the sessions a guide comes and listens to the participant from time to time allowing them to put into words what they have discovered. Today, there are about 40 Naikan centers in Japan and Naikan is used in mental health counseling, addiction treatment, rehabilitation of prisoners, schools, and business. It has also taken root in Europe, with Naikan centers now established in Austria and Germany. Mishirabe practices from which Naikan is derived are also still conducted in a religious context within some Jodo Shinshu temples and communities but the harsh, ascetic nature of Yoshimoto Ishin's original practice is unusual given the Jodo Shinshu rejection of self-power practice. The family-relationship focus of traditional Naikan may sometimes be less appropriate to those with fragmented or seriously dysfunctional family backgrounds. However, as with Buddhist metta meditation (mettā bhāvanā), there is no reason why Naikan practice need necessarily take family relationships as starting point. The benefit of looking at family relationships is that these are often most emotionally complex and connected with our sense of 'self' . == The importance of self-reflection == The practice of self-reflection goes back many centuries and is rooted in the world’s great spiritual traditions. Early adherents of such practices include the Christian desert hermits and Japanese samurai. More contemporary proponents included Albert Schweitzer, Ben Franklin, and Bishop Fulton J. Sheen. Franklin, in particular, had a rather comprehensive and systematic approach to self-reflection. He developed a list of thirteen virtues and each day he would evaluate his conduct relative to a particular virtue. Daily self-reflection was a fundamental aspect of Franklin’s life. Formal methods of self-reflection generally involve certain basic characteristics. First, there is the requirement for time which is set aside exclusively for the purpose of self-reflection. Second, use of a space, preferably with some degree of isolation that limits external distraction. And third, the application of questions or structure which helps us examine our lives with an emphasis on our conduct in relation to other people, creatures and objects. Its structure uses our relationships with others as the mirror in which people can see themselves. We reflect on what we have received from others, what we have given, and what troubles we have caused. == See also == * Constructive Living: A practice combining elements of Naikan and Morita therapy == Bibliography == * Chikako Ozawa-de Silva (2007).

Greeking obscures portions of a work for the purpose of either emphasizing form over details or displaying placeholders for unavailable content. The name is a reference to the phrase \\"Greek to me\\", meaning something that one cannot understand, so that it might as well be in a foreign language. ==In typography== Greeking in the form of a lorem ipsum placeholder text that was inadvertently published in ', a Singapore newspaper, on 26 April 2014 Greeked text is used in typography to evaluate a certain typeface's appropriateness, overall style or type color.Production First Software Encyclopedia of Typography and Electronic Communication : G Because a viewer can be distracted by meaningful content, greeking unimportant text forces the viewer to focus on layout and design. Greeking is also used when a design is being developed but the content is unfinished. One example might be the layout of a magazine article which has photographs but no text; initially, a lorem ipsum text is used, and then the nonsense text is replaced with draft versions as they become available. This allows design and layout to be carried out in parallel with content revisions. ==In computing== Greeking can refer to the automatic rendering of text characters as unreadable symbols or lines in the layout preview function of word processing documents, either to speed up screen display\\"Greeking\\" or because the graphics display capabilities of the monitor are insufficient for rendering extremely small texts.Greeking, from Webopedia The term \\"greeking\\" was applied by various WYSIWYG editors of the 1980s, such as ApplixWare and Island Graphics. Greeking referred to the substitution of text with a placeholder gray bar upon moving out of focus. ==In visual media== As in typography, greeking involves inserting nonsense text or, commonly, Greek or Latin text in prototypes of visual media projects (such as in graphic and web design) to check the layout of the final version before the actual text is available, or to enhance layout assessment by eliminating the distraction of readable text. Text of this sort is known as \\"greeked text\\", \\"dummy text\\", or \\"jabberwocky text\\". Lorem ipsum is a commonly used example, though this is derived from Latin, not Greek. ==In the arts== Greeking in theatre, television, and film production art-department work refers to the process of changing or hiding corporate trademarks that have not been \\"cleared\\" legally for use in the production. Anime and manga series show prolific examples of trademark greeking, creating altered versions of trademarked terms like Hescafé, WcDonald's, and AVIO. ==References== Category:Typography Category:Filler text ","title":"Greeking"},{"id":"1280078","text":"Yuri Lvovich Slezkine (Russian: Ю́рий Льво́вич Слёзкин Yúriy L'vóvich Slyózkin; born February 7, 1956) is a Russian-born American historian, writer, and translator. He is a professor of Russian history, sovietologist and Director of the Institute of Slavic, East European, and Eurasian Studies at the University of California, Berkeley. He is best known as the author of the book The Jewish Century (2004) and The House of Government: A Saga of The Russian Revolution (2017). ==Career== Slezkine originally trained as an interpreter in Moscow State University. His first trip outside the Soviet Union was in the late 1970s, when he worked as a translator in Mozambique. He returned to Moscow to serve as a translator of Portuguese, and spent 1982 in Lisbon before emigrating to Austin, Texas the next year. He earned a PhD from the University of Texas, Austin. Slezkine is a W. Glenn Campbell and Rita Ricardo-Campbell National Fellow at Stanford University's Hoover Institution and Jane K. Sather Professor of History at the University of California, Berkeley. He is also a member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences (2008). ==Slezkine's theory of ethnic identity== Slezkine characterizes the Jews (alongside other groups such as the Armenians and Overseas Chinese) as a Mercurian people \\"specializ[ing] exclusively in providing services to the surrounding food-producing societies,\\" which he characterizes as \\"Apollonians\\". This division is, according to him, recurring in pre-20th century societies. With the exception of the Romani, these \\"Mercurian peoples\\" have all enjoyed great socioeconomic success relative to the average among their hosts, and have all, without exception, attracted hostility and resentment. A recurring pattern of the relationship between Apollonians and Mercurian people is that the social representation of each group by the other is symmetrical, for instance Mercurians see Apollonians as brutes while Apollonians see Mercurians as effeminate. Mercurians develop a culture of \\"purity\\" and \\"national myths\\" to cultivate their separation from the Apollonians, which allows them to provide international services (intermediaries, diplomacy) or services that are taboo for the local Apollonian culture (linked to death, magic, sexuality or banking). Slezkine develops this thesis by arguing that the Jews, the most successful of these Mercurian peoples, have increasingly influenced the course and nature of Western societies, particularly during the early and middle periods of Soviet Communism, and that modernity can be seen as a transformation of Apollonians into Mercurians. ==Works== *The House of Government: A Saga of the Russian Revolution, Princeton University Press, 2017 *The Jewish Century, Princeton University Press, 2004 () *In the Shadow of the Revolution: Life Stories of Russian Women from 1917 to the Second World War, edited by Sheila Fitzpatrick and Yuri Slezkine, Princeton University Press, 2000 *Arctic Mirrors: Russia and the Small Peoples of the North, Cornell University Press, 1994 *The USSR as a Communal Apartment, or How a Socialist State Promoted Ethnic Particularism, Slavic Review, Vol. 53, No. 2 (Summer 1994), 414-452 *Between Heaven and Hell: The Myth of Siberia in Russian Culture, 1993 == Awards == * 2002: National Jewish Book Award in the Eastern European Studies for The Jewish Century ==See also== *The Culture of Critique series * Amy Chua, American writer on Market dominant minorities * Model minority **Dominant minority *Minoritarianism ==References== ==External links== *Slezkine's website at Berkeley *The Jewish Century, Chapter One: MERCURY'S SANDALS: THE JEWS AND OTHER NOMADS *An interview with Yuri Slezkine discussing the theses of his book The Jewish Century *The Chosen People: The Nation's review of The Jewish Century by Daniel Lazare, November 30, 2005 * Yuri Slezkine: «I tend to do my own things and expect you to do yours» (an interview, April 4, 2013) Category:1956 births Category:20th-century male writers Category:20th-century translators Category:American male non-fiction writers Category:American people of Russian-Jewish descent Category:American translators Category:Fellows of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences Category:Historians of Russia Category:Jewish American historians Category:Jewish American writers Category:Living people Category:Minorities Category:Russian historians Category:Soviet emigrants to the United States Category:Soviet Jews Category:University of California, Berkeley faculty Category:University of Texas at Austin alumni ","title":"Yuri Slezkine"},{"id":"1280082","text":"Chris Ray Hetherington (born November 27, 1972) is a former American football fullback in the NFL who last played for the San Francisco 49ers.

He won a Stanley Cup in 1993 with the Montreal Canadiens. His brother, Patrick, also played a short time in the NHL. ==Playing career== Lebeau was a scoring sensation in junior with the Shawinigan Cataractes of the Quebec Major Junior Hockey League, and in 1987–88 he led the QMJHL in goals scored with 94. He finished his junior career second all-time in QMJHL career goals with 281, behind Mike Bossy, and second all-time in career points with 580, behind only Shawinigan-teammate Patrice Lefebvre. Lebeau continued his scoring prowess in the American Hockey League after being signed by the Montreal Canadiens in 1986. He played one season in the AHL with the Sherbrooke Canadiens and led the league with 70 goals and 134 points as a rookie, which garnered him three major awards, including the Dudley \\"Red\\" Garrett Memorial Award as the league's top rookie. The next season, he moved up to the NHL full-time, and scored 15 goals and 35 points in his rookie season. Over the next three seasons Lebeau's point total steadily improved, climaxing with 80 points in the 1992–93 season, the same year the Canadiens came away with the Stanley Cup. However the next season he failed to produce at the same clip, and midway through was traded to the Mighty Ducks of Anaheim for goalie Ron Tugnutt. He would play in Anaheim until 1994–95, and then he moved on to play in Switzerland before retiring in 2001. He currently resides in Sherbrooke, Quebec and runs the hockey program at Bishop's College School in Lennoxville. In 2015, he started to coach the Cougars of Champlain College Lennoxville. He has a son called Jeffrey and a distant cousin, Nicolas, who is a rugby player at Bishop’s University. ==Awards== *QMJHL Second All-Star Team (1987, 1988) *AHL First All-Star Team (1989) *Dudley \\"Red Garrett Memorial Award (1989) *John B.

It was founded in 1927 by Theodate Pope Riddle, one of the first female architects in America. Its current headmaster is Jim Detora. ==Early history== The school's original conception dates to a few years before 1918, at which time Mrs. Riddle purchased 3,000 acres of land on which the school could be built. Together with architect Charles Pratt, she then toured a number of boys' schools in New England, including Andover, Groton School, Hotchkiss School, Middlesex School, Pomfret School, St. Mark's School, and St. Paul's School. As Mrs. Riddle wrote to a friend, \\"They all illustrate exceedingly well the things I wish to avoid.\\" In 1918 she created the Pope-Brooks Foundation, to manage both her house, Hill-Stead and its artworks, and the as-yet unformed school. School buildings were constructed from 1923-1926, to her designs, by over 500 workmen from America and the Cotswolds. For her designs Mrs. Riddle was elected a Fellow of the American Institute of Architects, and awarded the Robinson Memorial Medal of the Architectural Club of New Haven. The school opened in the autumn of 1927 with 48 students, who were expected to plant gardens, raise poultry, work in the dairy and machine shop, smithy, carpenter shop, electrical laboratory, and print shop. It was \\"organized and governed on the lines of a village political unit, the four upper forms (grades 9-12) being eligible for office as citizens\\". The school's earliest days were marked by vigorous disagreements between Mrs. Riddle and the school's board and members. Its first board was created in September 1926, but immediately dismissed by Mrs. Riddle when it refused to grant her absolute control over all aspects of the school, including her dictum that \\"there will be no gymnasium and no indoor inter- school athletics\\". The school was then run directly by the Pope-Brooks foundation. Its first Provost (headmaster), John Mitchell Froelicher, served from 1927-1929, when he was dismissed. After several abortive attempts to find a replacement, Reverend Percy Gamble Kammerer was named Provost in August 1930. He served until January 1940, when he was forced to resign. That summer, Rev. W. Brooke Stabler was named as his replacement. He too had disagreements with Mrs. Riddle, who was unbending in her authority, and in March 1944 he resigned. At this event, the entire faculty resigned en masse. Starting in June 1944, during World War II, the campus was reworked to serve as the Old Farms Convalescent Hospital for blind veterans. Mrs. Riddle died in 1946, the hospital wound down in 1947, and in 1948 the Avon Old Farms School resumed operation under Provost Donald W. Pierpoint. ==Athletics== Avon Old Farms is in the Founders League. Avon ice hockey teams have won eight Division 1 New England Championships (five between 2004 and 2010). In the 2015–16 season, the Winged Beavers won the Founders League and landed third in the USHR standings. Avon produced NHL players such as Hockey Hall of Fame member Brian Leetch, as well as Jonathan Quick, Chris Higgins, Cam Atkinson, and Nick Bonino. Coach John Gardner has a record of 603–178–29. On December 21, 2009, Avon played Taft School in the first hockey game played at Fenway Park. In 2012 Jonathan Quick joined fellow alumni Brian Leetch (1994) as a winner of the Conn Smythe Trophy. Avon's lacrosse team was coached by Skip Flanagan. After Coach Flanagan left the school, Ted Garber became head coach. In 2015 the Avon lacrosse program saw its best team yet. Avon's varsity team finished with a 15-2 record. They also won the Western New England and the Founders League. The 2015 team was also rated as the number one team in New England and one of the best programs in the \\"Elite 25\\" by USA Today. ==Notable alumni== * Deon Anderson, former NFL player *David C.

Society for American Baseball Research biography project is a former professional baseball pitcher. He played for the Milwaukee Brewers from 1986 to 1988. == Career == Nieves was signed by the Milwaukee Brewers, with a $115,000 signing bonus, after he went 19-1 with a 1.05 ERA during his senior season at the Avon Old Farms school in Connecticut.Juan Nieves' New England journey On April 15, 1987, Nieves threw a no-hitter against the Baltimore Orioles, becoming the second-youngest player in Major League history to do so. To date, he is the only Milwaukee Brewers pitcher to throw a no-hitter. Nieves' no-hitter became the first ever thrown by a Puerto Rican in Major League Baseball. NIeves was mostly a starter, but on September 5, 1988, he did earn his only career save against the White Sox. He threw 1 perfect inning, closing out a 5-2 Brewers victory and saving the game for starter Don August. https://www.baseball-reference.com/boxes/MIL/MIL198809050.shtml After playing for the Brewers from 1986 to 1988, he suffered a career-ending arm injury. He worked as a minor league pitching instructor for the New York Yankees (1992–1996) and the White Sox (1999–2007) before joining the Chicago White Sox Major League staff as the bullpen coach serving for the five seasons.mlb.com He was mentored by Don Cooper, first when Cooper was the White Sox' roving coordinator in their minor league hierarchy, and later when Cooper became the pitching coach of the Sox.

He played nearly 1,200 games in the National Hockey League (NHL) with the Minnesota North Stars, Montreal Canadiens, Tampa Bay Lightning, Mighty Ducks of Anaheim and the Washington Capitals. He was a member of the 1993 Stanley Cup-winning Montreal Canadiens. ==Playing career== Bellows played junior hockey in the Ontario Hockey League with the Kitchener Rangers. During this time, he was featured in Sports Illustrated, which described him as the hottest prospect since Wayne Gretzky. Bellows was drafted second overall by the Minnesota North Stars, who had acquired the draft pick in a trade with Detroit with the purpose of having a shot at Bellows. North Stars GM Lou Nanne sent Don Murdoch, Greg Smith, and a first round pick (Murray Craven) to the Wings in exchange for what later turned out to be the second overall draft pick. Bellows was often compared to Gretzky, which led to a tough rookie season. The pressure of such comparisons caused criticisms when he did not live up to them. Bellows improved greatly in the second half of the season and finished with 35 goals. In the playoffs that year, Bellows scored 9 points (5 goals, 4 assists) in 9 games. Bellows played 10 seasons with the North Stars and was popular in Minnesota for his charity work, as well as his goal-scoring. He had a North Star record 342 goals in 753 games, peaking with 55 goals in 1989–90. In 1990–91, Bellows scored 29 points in the post-season to become the North Stars career playoff point leader, and took the North Stars to the Stanley Cup finals where they fell to the Pittsburgh Penguins. When team captain Craig Hartsburg was injured partway through the 1983–84 season, Bellows was named interim captain for the remainder of the season. At 19 years and 4 months, Bellows became captain at an earlier age than Connor McDavid, Gabriel Landeskog and Sidney Crosby. However, because Bellows was an interim captain, McDavid is still considered the youngest captain in history. On August 31, 1992, Bellows was traded to the Montreal Canadiens for Russ Courtnall. The trade angered Bellows at first, but he relished the chance to play for the Canadiens. In the 1992-93 NHL season his 88 points were the second highest season total of his career, and his 15 playoff points helped the Canadiens win the Stanley Cup in 1993. As his career was winding down, Bellows played for the Tampa Bay Lightning, Mighty Ducks of Anaheim and the Washington Capitals. In the 1997–98 season the Capitals made it to the Stanley Cup Finals, but lost to the Detroit Red Wings. En route to the Eastern Conference championship, Bellows scored the series-clinching overtime goal in the first round in Game 6 against the Boston Bruins. The 1998–99 season was his last. On January 2, 1999, Bellows scored his 1,000th career regular season point, becoming the 54th NHL player to reach that plateau. Bellows was named to the 1990 Second All-Star team, and played in three NHL All-Star Games (1984, 1988 and 1992). He retired with 485 goals, 537 assists and 1,022 points. He was named the top forward at the 1989 World Ice Hockey Championships, as Canada won the silver medal. ==Personal life== Bellows lives in Edina, Minnesota, and works in Minneapolis as a broker at investment bank Piper Jaffray.http://ourhistory.canadiens.com/article/Where-Are-They-Now- Brian-Bellowshttp://financial-advisors.credio.com/l/137119/Brian-Bellows Bellows's son Kieffer Bellows in 2016 was drafted in the first round, 19th overall, by the New York Islanders. ==Awards== * Stanley Cup champion – 1993 * 3× NHL All-Star Game selection: 1984, 1988 and 1992 * NHL Second All-Star Team – 1990 ==Career statistics== ===Regular season and playoffs=== { border=\\"0\\" cellpadding=\\"1\\" cellspacing=\\"0\\" style=\\"text-align:center; width:60em\\" - bgcolor=\\"#e0e0e0\\" ! colspan=\\"3\\" bgcolor=\\"#ffffff\\" ! rowspan=\\"99\\" bgcolor=\\"#ffffff\\" ! colspan=\\"5\\"Regular season ! rowspan=\\"99\\" bgcolor=\\"#ffffff\\" ! colspan=\\"5\\"Playoffs - bgcolor=\\"#e0e0e0\\" !

He was the first player in NBA history to win championships with three franchises (a list that also includes Robert Horry, Danny Green, and LeBron James), as well as the first player in the NBA to win a championship in three different decades. After being drafted in the first round out of Georgia Tech in the 1986 NBA draft, the 6'11 (2.11 m) Salley played both power forward and center for the Detroit Pistons, Miami Heat, Toronto Raptors, Chicago Bulls, Panathinaikos and Los Angeles Lakers. He was a long-time host of the former Fox Sports Net show The Best Damn Sports Show Period. He is a vegan activist, chef, and wellness entrepreneur. ==Early life and college career== Salley was born in Brooklyn, New York. Salley played high school ball at Canarsie High School in Brooklyn.Anderson, Dave. \\" Sports of The Times; City Teen-Agers Hold A Calm Garden Party\\", The New York Times, March 19, 1995. Accessed October 10, 2007. He is a 1988 graduate of Georgia Tech's College of Management.Leigh Montville. \\"Holy Cow, What Digs!\\". Sports Illustrated. November 6, 1989. Retrieved on January 9, 2010. He helped the Yellow Jackets win the 1985 ACC Championship, they also advanced to the Elite Eight of the NCAA Tournament. He left in 1986 as Tech’s all-time leader in blocked shots. He holds Georgia Tech's personal fouls record, and has had his jersey number 22 retired--a very rare honor in college basketball.The retiring of players' jerseys is not uncommon in college basketball, but retirement of numbers is far more rare. The main reason is that far fewer numbers are available for use by college teams than in the NBA. NCAA rules, unlike those of the NBA, prohibit the use of any digits greater than five in player numbers. Georgia Tech has not only retired Salley's number 22, but also the number 25 worn by Salley's teammate Mark Price, the number 15 worn by current NBA player Matt Harpring, the number 20 worn by former NBA player Tom Hammonds, and the numbers 21 and 40 worn by Roger Kaiser and Rich Yunkus, respectively. ==Professional career== ===Detroit Pistons=== Salley was drafted by the Detroit Pistons in the first round of the 1986 NBA draft out of Georgia Tech. After joining the Pistons, he became close friends with Adrian Dantley, who taught him proper nutrition, how to exercise, and how to conduct himself off the court. Salley, for his part, called Dantley \\"The Teacher\\". Salley would become good friends with comedian Eddie Murphy and made several appearances at comedy clubs in the off-season. In 1989 and 1990, he played on two Pistons NBA championship teams. He is among the Pistons' all-time leaders in blocked shots. Under the coaching of Chuck Daly, Salley was part of the Pistons era that featured three consecutive NBA finals appearances. The team's defense oriented style of play earned them the nickname of the NBA's \\"Bad Boys\\", with Salley playing alongside Dennis Rodman, Bill Laimbeer, James Edwards, Joe Dumars, Isiah Thomas, Rick Mahorn and Dantley. After losing the 1988 NBA Finals in 7 games to the Lakers, the Pistons turned it around to sweep the Lakers in 4 games in 1989. Salley and the Pistons repeated in 1990 defeating the Portland Trail Blazers in 5 games. The Pistons' run came to an end when the Michael Jordan-led Chicago Bulls swept them in 4 games in the 1991 Eastern Conference finals; following game four, while most of the Pistons players chose to return to the locker room rather than congratulate the new Eastern Conference champions, Salley was one of the few who stayed on the court as the game ended to congratulate the Bulls. ===Miami Heat, Toronto Raptors=== Salley was traded to the Miami Heat in 1992. In the 1995 NBA expansion draft he was selected by the inaugural Toronto Raptors team after being made available by the Heat. In February 1996, he negotiated a buyout of his contract and was waived thus ending his stint with the Raptors during which he averaged 19.3 minutes and 6 points per game. ===Chicago Bulls=== Free of his Raptors contract, in early March 1996, Salley signed a 10-day contract with the Chicago Bulls, where he played with Michael Jordan, Scottie Pippen, Toni Kukoč, and former Pistons teammates Dennis Rodman and James Edwards. Following another 10-day contract right after the first one ended, the Bulls signed Salley as a free agent and he spent the rest of the season with the team. The 1995-96 Bulls achieved a record-breaking 72-win season, the best- ever regular season record at the time, later surpassed by the 2015-16 Golden State Warriors at 73-9. ===One month with Panathinaikos=== In September 1996, thirty-two-year-old Salley came out of what turned out to be only a three- month retirement and went to play in Greece, where he joined the Greek Basket League team Panathinaikos on a one-year US$1 million contract. Before accepting the offer from the Božidar Maljković-coached Panathinaikos, Salley had reportedly consulted with recent Bulls teammate Toni Kukoč who knew Maljković well having spent four trophy-laden seasons anchoring his late 1980s KK Split teams.Ο μήνας της \\"αράχνης\\" . Salley made his Panathinaikos debut on 25 September 1996 in EuroLeague away at FC Barcelona, a 77-58 loss during which he scored 5 points before fouling out in only 12 minutes of action. Right away, Salley got on the bad side of coach Maljković who refused to modify his disciplinarian approach in order to accommodate a veteran player with a notable NBA career behind him. Though Salley's performances somewhat improved over the following three EuroLeague outings — 10 points in a home loss versus ASVEL, 9 points and 11 rebounds in a blowout home win versus KK Split, and 21 points and 8 rebounds in a win away at minnows Bayer Leverkusen — as he seemingly adjusted to European referees and managed to stay out of foul trouble, he continued to butt heads with coach Maljković. After flying back to Athens with the team the morning after the Leverkusen game, Salley refused to go to practice and as a result, got dropped by Maljković for their Greek League game the following day. He then flew back to the United States for meetings with TV executives over a new talk show he had been planning to host for Disney, returning to Athens an hour before the club's Greek Cup game versus P.A.O.K. on 22 October 1996 — a trip that included Salley renting a private Lear jet in Paris for US$20,000 out of his own pocket in order to make it back to Athens in time for the game after having his connecting flight delayed and then even renting a helicopter once he landed at Athens' Ellinikon Airport to take him right to Panathinaikos' OACA Hall in the city's Marousi neighbourhood. However, Maljković still refused to include him in the lineup and in response, Salley decided to leave Panathinaikos unilaterally two days later after only a month at the club. Salley appeared in seven games for Panathinaikos and ended up getting paid about €300,000. ===Los Angeles Lakers=== In 1999, Salley joined a Lakers team led by superstars Shaquille O'Neal and Kobe Bryant and also reunited with his former Bulls coach, Phil Jackson. He saw little action for the Lakers en route to their first of three consecutive NBA championships from 2000 to 2002. In 2000, he retired again following the first Lakers championship season after proudly proclaiming that he had won \\"four championship rings, with three different teams, in three different decades and two different millenniums\\". 14 years later, Tim Duncan of the San Antonio Spurs became the second player to achieve this (sans the requirement of different teams) by leading his Spurs to five championships between 1999 and 2014. ==Post-basketball career== Salley in 2008 ===Film=== In 1995, John Salley had a role in Bad Boys as a thick-glassed computer hacking nerd who gets out of jail because he helps crack files for the Miami Police Department.

As of 2016, it is the 12th busiest civil airport in China. It is located in the suburban Jiangning District, over south of the city center, and is connected to Nanjing and neighboring towns by expressways. Phase I of the Ninggao Intercity Line and Line S1 of the Nanjing Metro link the airport with Nanjing South railway station. Nanjing is the hub for China Eastern Airlines' Jiangsu Company, and a focus city for Shenzhen Airlines. China Southern Airlines and XiamenAir also operate a considerable number of flights there. Nanjing is the main base for China Postal Airlines, with pure cargo service to all major cities in China, handling express mail and cargo transportation for China Post. In 2017, the airport handled 25,822,936 passengers and 374,214.9 tons of freight. ==History== Construction of Nanjing Lukou International Airport started on 28 February 1995, and was completed two years later. When the airport opened on 1 July 1997, all civilian operations were transferred to it from Nanjing Dajiaochang Airport, and Nanjing Dajiaochang was converted to a Chinese military air base. Although Nanjing Lukou had been designated an international airport since commencing operations, China’s state administrations only approved it for foreign aircraft on 18 November 1997. In 2006, China Post started building its express logistics center at Nanjing Lukou to handle its express mail services. Initial construction was completed by 2009, with additional facilities and functions added continuously. The final project, as planned, would be the largest in Asia and the third-largest in the world of its kind. In 2009, the airport handled 10 million passengers. In 2013, that number surpassed 15 million, which was 3 million above the terminal’s designed operational capacity. In preparation for the 2014 Summer Youth Olympics, hosted by Nanjing, Terminal 2 was completed after more than three years of construction. Also completed were a new parallel runway with taxiways, a new tower, new aircraft parking positions, and new cargo handling facilities. On 12 July 2014, all flights were relocated to Terminal 2, and Terminal 1 was closed for renovation. The new facilities removed the bottleneck caused by the limited capability of the old terminal and runway. In November 2014, with the launching of the Phase 2 expansion and optimization of neighboring air traffic patterns, authorities approved an increase of peak- hour flight volume from 28 flights per hour to 38 flights per hour. With the added capacity, Nanjing Airport has seen rapid increase in both aircraft movement and total passengers. In 2015, the number of total passengers exceeded 19 million (until 28 December), that is 2.87 million on top of 2014, a 17.7% increase compared to the same period of the previous year. The airport continues to see substantial increase into 2016, which saw 29,210 aircraft movements and 3.39 million passengers handled in January and February, a 16.9% and a 21.2% increase respectively, comparing to the same period 2015. ==Composition== The airport consists of two terminals, two 3600-meter runways (paralleled by three taxiways and connected by two taxiways), two control towers, a cargo center, a transportation center, and an apron. Adjacent to, but not belonging to, the airport is the China Post express logistics center and the base for China Postal Airlines. The older section of the airport consists of: *Terminal 1 (renovated floor space 160,000m², 80 check-in counters and 33 security lanes. *one northern runway (length 3600 m, width 60 m, 4E rating) *one runway (length 3600 m, width 45 m) *a cargo center (34,000m²) *an apron (447,000m²) *a control tower (height 87 m) Terminal 1 was closed on 14 July 2014 for renovation, it reopened on 29 July 2020 as the International terminal. The Phase 2 expansion includes: *Terminal 2 (263,000m² floor space, 35 boarding bridges, annual capacity 18 million passengers) *a new 4F-rating southern runway and two parallel taxiways *two taxiways connecting the northern and southern runways *20 aircraft parking positions *a second control tower (height 107 m) *an 11,000m² carpark *a transportation center, which seats a subway station, a coach station, a Pullman Hotel, and shopping and dining facilities The two terminals are also connected by the transportation center structure. ==Airlines and destinations== ===Passenger=== Waiting hall Interior of NKG T2 ===Cargo=== ==Ground transportation== ===Airport shuttle=== ====City to airport==== * From Nanjing South Railway Station: 6:00–21:00, every 20 minutes, duration 40 minutes * From Nanjing Railway Station East Square (with a stop at 221 Middle Longpan Road): 5:40–21:00, every 20 minutes, duration 80 minutes ====Airport to city==== * Line 1: 30 minutes after the first landing to the last landing of the day (stops: Yuhua Square, Qinhong Bridge, Xihuamen, Nanjing railway station); max. interval 30 minutes * Line 2: 9:30–22:30 (stops: Cuipingshan Hotel, Nanjing South railway station, Zhonghuamen Subway Station), max. interval 30 minutes ===Expressway=== The airport is accessed by Konggang Road, which connects to the Airport Expressway.

It was published in the interest of the labour movement and supported the Labour Party. It underwent several changes of management before ceasing publication in 1964, when it was relaunched as The Sun, in its pre-Murdoch form. == Origins == In December 1910 the printers' union, the London Society of Compositors (LSC), became engaged in an industrial struggle to establish a 48-hour workweek and started a daily strike bulletin called The World. Will Dyson, an Australian artist in London, contributed a cartoon. From 25 January 1911 it was renamed the Daily Herald and was published until the end of the strike in April 1911. At its peak it had daily sales of 25,000. Ben Tillett, the dockers' leader, and other radical trade unionists were inspired to raise funds for a permanent labour movement daily, to compete with the newspapers that championed the two main political parties, the Liberals and Conservatives, but independent of the official Labour Party and the Trades Union Congress, which were planning a daily of their own (launched as the Daily Citizen in October 1912). The initial organising group included Tillett, T. E. Naylor of the LSC, George Lansbury, socialist politician, Robert Williams of the Transport Workers, W. N. Ewer and Francis Meynell. Retaining the strike sheet name they formed a Daily Herald company. Readers and supporters formed local branches of the Daily Herald League, through which they had their say in the running of the paper. == Syndicalist period, 1912–1913 == The first issue appeared on 15 April 1912, edited by William H. Seed. A key feature was Dyson's cartoons, which made a contribution to the paper's political tone. Its politics were broadly syndicalist: it gave unconditional support to strikers and argued for a socialist revolution based on workers' self-organisation in trade unions. It also gave strong support to suffragettes and to anti-colonial struggles, especially in Ireland. Early issues dealt with the loss of the RMS Titanic, emphasising the disproportionate loss of life among crew members and poor third-class passengers, and demonstrating the distinct perspective of the new paper. Staff writers included W. P. Ryan, Langdon Everard and George Slocombe. The editor of the Women's Page was Margaret Travers-Symons, and Katharine Susannah Prichard wrote for it.https://www.brandl.com.au/loving-words/310, 321 Vance Palmer's poems were used on the front page. G. K. Chesterton was a frequent contributor. His brother Cecil and Hilaire Belloc were occasional contributors. After Seed was removed as editor, Rowland Kenney, the brother of Annie Kenney; C. Sheridan Jones; and finally Charles Lapworth held the position. In June 1913, the Daily Herald company was forced into liquidation. Lansbury and Lapworth formed a new company, the Limit Printing and Publishing Company. (When the Liberal leader Lloyd George was asked a question about the Herald he declared \\"That paper is the limit.\\") The shortfall in production costs was guaranteed by wealthy friends of Lansbury, and Francis Meynell joined the board as their representative. From December 1912 until August 1914 one of the main financial supporters was H. D. Harben, also a founder of the New Statesman. From this point the members of the Daily Herald League had no formal influence on the paper. In late 1913, Lapworth was asked by the other two board members to resign as editor. Lansbury and the paper's financial backers were disturbed by Lapworth and other writers’ attacks on individuals, both in the establishment and the labour movement. \\"Hatred of conditions by all means, but not of persons\\" was how Lapworth quoted Lansbury. The aftermath was aired in the letter pages of The New Age between December 1913 and April 1914. == The Herald under Lansbury, 1914–1922 == A handwritten letter to the Herald's literary editor Siegfried Sassoon from Arthur Quiller-Couch, about the possibility of Quiller-Couch writing for the paper The new paper struggled financially but somehow survived, with Lansbury playing an ever-increasing role in keeping it afloat. Under Lansbury, the Herald took an eclectic but relentlessly militant political position and achieved sales of 50,000–150,000 a day. But war in August 1914 – or rather the subsequent split on the left whether to support or oppose the war – radically reduced its constituency. Lansbury and his colleagues, core of the anti-war left, decided to go weekly. The paper played a key role in the campaign against the war for the next four years. It was in the forefront of the movement against conscription and supported conscientious objectors; and it welcomed the Russian Revolutions of February and October 1917. There were notable journalistic scoops, most famously its story in 1917 on \\"How they starve at the Ritz\\", an exposé of conspicuous consumption by the rich at a time of national hardship that panicked the government into food-rationing. The Herald resumed daily publication in 1919, and again played a role propagandising for strikes and against armed intervention in Russia amid the social turmoil of 1919–21. When the radical wave subsided, the Herald found itself broke and unable to continue as an independent left daily. Lansbury handed over the paper to the Trades Union Congress and the Labour Party in 1922. The newspaper had begun to publish the Bobby Bear cartoon strip in 1919. In August 1920 Lev Kamenev, a Bolshevik diplomat visiting London on official business, sent a telegram addressed to Lenin in Moscow which was intercepted and deciphered by British intelligence. The telegram stated that Kamenev had paid £40,000.00 to the Daily Herald, and a further payment of £10,000.00 would be made shortly.Gilbert, Martin. Winston S. Churchill, Volume IV 1917–1922. Heinemann: London. 1975. pp.423–424. Historical copies of the Daily Herald are available to search and view in digitised form at the British Newspaper Archive. == The third Daily Herald, 1922–1929 == The Herald was official organ of the Trade Union Congress from 1922, during which point the fledgling Labour Party brought in Hamilton Fyfe who recruited prestigious journalists such as Douglas Cole (better known as G.D.H. Cole) and Evelyn Sharp who were supportive of socialism. He left in 1926 over disputes regarding what to publish, at which point Frederick Salusbury was appointed acting editor-in-chief. Previous to Fyfe's resignation, Salusbury had served as a columnist at the Daily Express where he helped create the Express' famous Beachcomber gossip column with Dominic Wyndham Lewis. During his brief time as acting editor, Salusbury began to attract middle and upper class readership, although the publication was primarily marketed to tradesmen. Between 1923 and 1964 the newspaper awarded the Order of Industrial Heroism, popularly known as the \\"Workers' VC\\", to honour examples of heroism carried out by ordinary workers. == The fourth Daily Herald, 1930–1964 == The TUC sold a 51 per cent share of the Herald to Odhams Press, publisher of The People, a Sunday paper, in 1930. Odhams was interested in using its presses during the week; the TUC wanted Odhams' expertise in promoting newspapers. A promotion campaign ensued, and in 1933, the Herald became the world's best-selling daily newspaper, with certified net sales of 2 million. This accomplishment set off a war with more conservative London papers, such as the Daily Express. The Daily Herald strongly condemned the Nazi-Soviet Pact and the Soviet invasion of Finland. In an editorial about the latter, the paper stated \\"Now finally Stalin's Russia sacrifices all claims to the respect of the working class movement...The Union of Soviet Socialist Republics is dead. Stalin's new imperialist Russia takes its place\\".Bill Jones,The Russia complex : the British Labour Party and the Soviet Union. Manchester [England] : Manchester University Press, 1977.

(p.97) The Herald's sales were static or in decline during the post-war period, but a survey in 1958 suggested that it had the highest level of appreciation of any newspaper among its almost exclusively working class readership.Curran, p.86 Amongst the oldest and poorest people living in Britain, 59% of them were male, the highest proportion of any newspaper being published at the time.Roy Greenslade Press Gang: How Newspapers Make Profits From Propaganda, London: Pan, 2004, [2003], p.112 According to Roy Greenslade, the editorial staff were firmly entrenched between those advocating populism or politics with no \\"synthesis\\" between the positions possible.Gereenslade, p.114 The International Publishing Corporation acquired Odhams shares around 1961 when they took over that company and the minority stake owned by the TUC in 1964.James Curran and Jean Seaton Power Without Responsibility, Abingdon: Routledge, 2010, p.85 In 1955 the title's share of total newspaper circulation and advertising sales were both 10.8%, but this had declined to 8.1% and 3.5% respectively by 1964.Greenslade, p.155 Following a study commissioned from market researcher Mark Abrams, whose conclusions suggested reasons why the Herald was in decline, it was reborn as The Sun in 1964 under editor Sydney Jacobson. Roy Greenslade, though, has suggested that the Daily Herald was, in fact, losing readers to its own stable mate, the Daily Mirror, rather than because of social changes.Roy Greenslade Press Gang, p.157 By 1969 the original Sun had fewer readers than the Herald at the end of its existence. The newspaper was sold to Rupert Murdoch's News Limited (the holding group for all of his interests at the time), and its format and (eventually) its politics were significantly altered. The photographic archive of the Daily Herald, including the work of photographers such as James Jarché, is at the National Media Museum in Bradford. ==Editors== :1912: William H.

It was part of the Province of Greater Poland. Together with the Plock and Masovian Voivodeships it formed the former Duchy of Masovia. The voivodeship had its capital in the town of Rawa Mazowiecka, and its origins date back to the second half of the 15th century. In 1462, after the deaths of local Piast dynasty dukes, Mazovian lands of Rawa and Gostynin were incorporated into the Crown of the Kingdom of Poland. In 1476, the Land of Sochaczew returned to Poland as well. Borders of Rawa Voivodeship remained unchanged for more than 300 years, until the second partition of Poland in 1793, when it was annexed by the Kingdom of Prussia. Rawa Voivodeship had four senators in the Senate of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth. These were the Voivode of Rawa, the Castellan of Rawa, and the castellans of Sochaczew and Gostynin. Local starostas resided in Rawa, Sochaczew and Gostynin. Zygmunt Gloger in his monumental book Historical Geography of the Lands of Old Poland provides this description of Rawa Voivodeship: “In the 15th century, the Duchy of Mazovia, ruled by local branch of the Piast dynasty, was divided into three parts, one of which was the Duchy of Rawa (...) On January 1, 1462, Siemowit VI died at the age of eighteen. A few weeks later, his teenage brother Wladyslaw II also died. Siemowit VI was the Duke of Plock and Rawa, and after his death, King Kazimierz Jagiellonczyk decided to incorporate the Duchy of Rawa, making it the first part of Mazovia that returned to Poland (...) Rawa Voivodeship had the area of 92 sq. miles. It was divided into three lands: those of Rawa, Sochaczew and Gostynin. Each land was divided into two counties. The lands were of roughly the same size, and in the mid-16th century, whole voivodeship had 100 Roman Catholic parishes and 15 towns (...)

The territory of Smolensk was part of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania since 1404, but the voivodeship was established only in 1508. Just six years later, in 1514, it was lost to the Grand Duchy of Moscow during the Muscovite–Lithuanian Wars. The voivodeship was recaptured by the Commonwealth in 1611 during the Polish–Muscovite War (1605–18) and lost again in 1654 during the Russo-Polish War (1654–67). Even when the territory was under Russian control, Poland and Lithuania claimed it as a titular voivodeship. The capital of the voivodeship, and the seat of its governor (voivode), was in Smolensk. It was subdivided into two powiats: Smolensk and Starodub. Zygmunt Gloger in his monumental book Historical Geography of the Lands of Old Poland provides this description of the Smolensk Voivodeship: “In the 9th century, Smolensk was main center of the Krivichs. In the 11th century, it became the capital of a separate duchy, the Principality of Smolensk, which in the 14th century was conquered by the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. In 1404, it became a permanent part of Lithuania, and later on, the Principality was turned into a Voivodeship. In 1514, Smolensk was captured by Muscovy, which was confirmed by a 1522 treaty. For the next 89 years Smolensk belonged to Muscovy. It was recovered by King Sigismund III of Poland in 1611, but Smolensk Voivodeship as part of the Commonwealth existed only for 56 years. In 1654 it was recaptured by the Russians, which was confirmed by the Truce of Andrusovo in 1667. Smolensk Voivodeship had three senators: the Bishop, the Voivode, and the Castellan of Smolensk. It was divided into two counties: those of Smolensk and Starodub. After its annexation by the Russian Empire, it continued to exist as a so-called fictitious voivodeship, with sejmiks taking place at a Bernardine Church in Wilno. Furthermore, the fictitious title of Bishop of Smolensk remained in use.

Zygmunt Gloger in his monumental book Historical Geography of the Lands of Old Poland provides this description of the Witebsk Voivodeship: “Witebsk (in Latin Vitebscum), located on the Dvina river, was one of main gord of the Principality of Polotsk. In the second half of the 12th century, it emerged as a local center of government. Conquered by one of the sons of Mindaugas in ca. 1239, it became a permanent part of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania since the times of Gediminas. In ca. 1342 Witebsk was already the seat of a starostas, who in the early 16th century were named voivodes. First voivode of Witebsk was Jerzy Chlebowicz (...) The Dvina river divided the voivodeship into two parts, of which northern one was smaller. Since the town of Witebsk was located in the middle of a sparsely populated province, at first the voivodeship was not divided into counties. Later on, however, the County of Orsza, which had been part of Smolensk Voivodeship, was attached to Witebsk Voivodeship (...) Witebsk Voivodeship remained in the Commonwealth until September 1772, when most of it was annexed by the Russian Empire.

Starostas resided at Witebsk and Orsza, while local sejmiks took place in both towns. Altogether, Witebsk Voivodeship elected four deputies to the Sejm - two from each county.

Also it was used as a fictitious title in the Commonwealth until the Partitions of Poland in 1772/1795. In 1635, Marcin Kalinowski was the first voivode (governor) of the Chernihiv Voivodeship. The voivodeship was part of the Lesser Poland Province of the Polish Crown, and was divided into two counties: Czernihow and Nowogrod Siewierski. Local sejmiks took place at Czernihow, and it had two senators in the Polish–Lithuanian Senate. Together with Kijow Voivodeship and Bracław Voivodeship it made the territory that came to be known as Ukraine. ==History== The history of Czernihow Voivodeship dates back to 1618, when after the Truce of Deulino, the Commonwealth gained control of the towns of Smolensk, Czernihow and Nowogrod Siewierski. Since the truce was set to expire in 14.5 years, new acquisitions were not organized in official way. Smolensk was annexed by the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, while both Czernihow and Nowogrod became part of the Crown of the Kingdom of Poland forming the Duchy of Siveria.Kulakovskyi, P. Chernihiv Voivodeship (ЧЕРНІГІВСЬКЕ ВОЄВОДСТВО). Encyclopedia of History of UkraineKulakovskyi, P. Duchy of Siveria (СІВЕРСЬКЕ КНЯЗІВСТВО). Encyclopedia of History of Ukraine In 1633, during the Smolensk War, Polish Parliament (Sejm) introduced a bill in which both land court and starosta office were established at Czernihow. In 1634 the Treaty of Polyanovka confirmed that Czernihow remained part of Poland, so finally in 1635 the Sejm created the voivodeship, with two senators - the Voivode and the Castellan of Czernihow. Both county elected two deputies to the Sejm, and one deputy to the Lesser Poland Tribunal at Lublin. In 1637, construction of a fortress at Konotop began, whose purpose was to protect the newly acquired province. The fortress was completed in 1642. The Commonwealth lost control of the province as early as 1648, during the Khmelnytsky Uprising. In the Treaty of Hadiach (1658), the Duchy of Ruthenia was created out of Czernihow Voivodship, Kiev Voivodeship and Bracław Voivodeship. The idea however was quickly abandoned, and after the Truce of Andrusovo (1667), Czernihow Voivodeship was annexed by the Tsardom of Russia. The history of Czernihow Voivodeship does not end in 1667. Following the example of other provinces lost by the Commonwealth in the mid-17th century (e.g. Smolensk Voivodeship), the government in Warsaw continued to claim it as a titular voivodeship, with fictitious titles of voivode, senators, deputies and starostas named by the King, and remaining in use until the Partitions of Poland. The nobility of former Czernihow Voivodeship had its sejmiks at Wlodzimierz Wolynski. Last voivode of Czernihow was a man named Ludwik Wilga, nominated in 1783. In 1785, Stanisław August Poniatowski gave fictitious title of starosta of Nowogrod Siewierski to Tadeusz Czacki.

It was constituted from Brest-Litovsk and Pinsk counties. ==Overview== It was created from southern part of Trakai Voivodeship in 1566. In 1791 Kobryn and Pinsk-Zarzeche (Its center was Poltnica, now Plotnitsa) counties were created. Pinsk-Zarzeche country was renamed as Zapynsky and its seat was moved to Stolin. After the Second Partition of Poland, in 1793, Pinsk and Zapynsky countries were left to Russian Empire as part of Minsk Governorate. Finally remainder of it was dissolved in 1795 and part of Slonim Governorate. Zygmunt Gloger in his monumental book Historical Geography of the Lands of Old Poland provides this description of the Brest Litovsk Voivodeship: “After the death of Yaroslav the Wise, the land located between the Bug, and the Dniepr were divided into several duchies. The Principality of Turov and Pinsk in the late 1310s joined the Grand Duchy of Lithuania (...) Kestutis, the son of the Grand Duke Gediminas, ruled western Lithuania, including Podlasie, Troki Voivodeship, and Polesie, together with Pinsk. During his reign, the three regions of Polesie - those of Brzesc, Pinsk and Turow were united. After the Union of Lublin, due to its immense area, Polesie was separated from Troki Voivodeship. Brzesc Voivodeship was created, in a shape which remained unchanged until the 1793 Second Partition of Poland. Central and eastern parts of the voivodeship were made of former Principality of Turov and Pinsk (...) Brzesc Voivodeship was divided into two enormous counties - those of Brzesc and Pinsk. Each county had its own starosta, electing two deputies to the Sejm, and two deputies to the Lithuanian Tribunal. The voivodeship had two senators, who were the Castellan and the Voivode (...) Among major cities were Brzesc, Pinsk, Biala Podlaska, Koden, Wolczyn and Kamieniec Litewski. In northeastern corner of Brzesc Voivodeship was Bialowieza Forest, where Polish kings hunted”. ==Governors== Voivodeship Governor (Wojewoda) seat: * Brest- Litovsk Voivodes: * Jerzy Ilinicz (1566) * Jerzy Tyszkiewicz Łohojski (1566-1576) * Gabriel Hornostaj (1576-1587) * Mikołaj Michał Sapieha (1587-1588) * Jan Kiszka (1589—1592) * Krzysztof Zenowicz (Zienowicz) (1592—1615) * Jan Ostafi Tyszkiewicz Łohojski (1615-1631) * Aleksander Ludwik Radziwiłł (1631–1635) * Mikołaj Sapieha (XI 1638-VII 1642) * Teofil Iwan Tryzna (1642—1644) * Andrzej Massalski (1645-1651/1652) * Jerzy Klonowski (1652—1653) * Maksymilian Brzozowski (1653-1659) * Kazimierz Ludwik Jewłaszewski (1659—1664) * Jakub Teodor Kuncewicz (1664—1666/1667) * Melchior Stanisław Sawicki (1666—1668) * Krzysztof Piekarski (1668-1672) * Stefan Kurcz (1672—1702) * Krzysztof Komorowski (1702-1708) * Władysław Jozafat Sapieha (1709-1733) * Kazimierz Leon Sapieha (1735-1738) * Adam Tadeusz Chodkiewicz (1738-1745) * Jan Michał Sołłohub (1745-1748) * Karol Józef Sapieha (1748-1768) * Jan Antoni Horain (1768-1777) * Mikołaj Tadeusz Łopaciński (1777—1778) * Jan Tadeusz Zyberg (1783—1795) ==References== * Słownik geograficzny Królestwa Polskiego i innych krajów słowiańskich, vol.

Nilan played 688 National Hockey League (NHL) regular season games as a right-wing for the Montreal Canadiens, Boston Bruins, and New York Rangers between 1980 and 1992. He won the Stanley Cup in 1986 with Montreal. Known as \\"Knuckles\\", he was famous for his propensity to fight. He holds a record for most penalty minutes by an American-born player. Nilan's life and career are prominently featured in Alex Gibney's 2011 documentary film The Last Gladiators. ==Playing career== Nilan grew up in Massachusetts where he idolized Bobby Orr and dreamed of playing for the Boston Bruins. He played his youth hockey with the Parkway (West Roxbury, Massachusetts) team of the Greater Boston Youth Hockey League (GBYHL), sponsored by the Metropolitan District Commission (MDC). He later played college hockey for the Northeastern University Huskies, from 1976 to 1979, averaging 3.5 penalty minutes per game in his final collegiate season. Nilan was selected 231st overall in the 1978 NHL Entry Draft, and was best known as a tough-guy for the Montreal Canadiens in the mid 1980s. One of only nine players in National Hockey League (NHL) history to have recorded more than 3,000 career penalty minutes, he holds the records of highest penalty minute average per game at 4.42 minutes per game, the most penalty minutes in a single playoff season at 141, as well as the record for most penalties in a single game; on March 31, 1991, when the Hartford Whalers visited Nilan's Bruins, Nilan was assessed a record ten penalties: six minors, two majors, one misconduct and one game misconduct, for a total of 42 penalty minutes. Seriously hobbled by repeated injuries, Nilan missed over two hundred games in his final five seasons, and retired after the 1992 season. Highlights of his career include winning the Stanley Cup in 1986 with the Canadiens, being named to Team USA for the 1987 Canada Cup, and his controversial selection to the 1991 NHL All-Star Game by his then-coach Mike Milbury (Nilan missed the game with a broken left ankle), which led to changes in how players are selected for all-star games. ==Post career== Nilan returned to the Boston area and went into the insurance business after retirement. He spent three years as community relations consultant for John Hancock Insurance before returning to hockey as a coach. He was initially hired as an assistant coach of the New Jersey Devils on August 3, 1995, and remained in that position until May 1996, before becoming a head coach for the Chesapeake Icebreakers of the ECHL. Nilan was married to Karen Stanley in 1981. They were divorced in 2006. They have two daughters, Colleen and Tara, and one son, Christopher. Karen was a daughter of Theresa Stanley, who was one of notorious crime boss Whitey Bulger's girlfriends. Today Nilan talks openly about his past problems with alcohol and prescription drugs, as well as battling a heroin addiction. He is involved in numerous social and charitable causes. Nilan also speaks to local students in Montreal about learning from his life experiences and mistakes. Nilan lived in Oregon for two years, where he met his current girlfriend, Jaime Holtz (who is originally from Kailua-Kona, Hawaii). Chris moved back to Montreal with Jaime in 2011, and they currently reside in Dorval. He began hosting his own program, Off the Cuff on TSN Radio 690 Montreal, on March 18, 2013, after being a daily phone-in guest on Melnick in the Afternoon for a number of months. He is on the air from noon to 3:00 p.m. weekdays local time, also streaming live online. ==Awards== *Won the Stanley Cup in 1986 with the Montreal Canadiens *Selected to one NHL All-Star Game: 1991 ==Career statistics== ===Regular season and playoffs=== Bold indicates led league { border=\\"0\\" cellpadding=\\"1\\" cellspacing=\\"0\\" style=\\"text-align:center; width:60em\\" - bgcolor=\\"#e0e0e0\\" ! colspan=\\"3\\" bgcolor=\\"#ffffff\\" ! rowspan=\\"100\\" bgcolor=\\"#ffffff\\" ! colspan=\\"5\\"Regular season ! rowspan=\\"100\\" bgcolor=\\"#ffffff\\" ! colspan=\\"5\\"Playoffs - bgcolor=\\"#e0e0e0\\" !

Vytautas copied the Polish system of administrative division in order to centralize and strengthen the government. Trakai Voivodeship replaced the former Duchy of Trakai, which was ruled directly by the Grand Duke or his close relative (brother or son). The Duke of Trakai () was replaced by appointed officials – voivodes and his deputy castellan. The voivodeship was divided into four powiats: Grodno County, Kaunas, Trakai (ruled directly by the voivode), and Upytė. The biggest cities in the voivodeship were Kaunas, Grodno and Trakai. The western portion of the voivodeship was split off in 1513 by Sigismund I the Old and transferred to the Polish Crown. It was organized as the Podlaskie Voivodeship. In 1793, the counties of Grodno, Sokółka and Wołkowysk one of Nowogródek Voivodeship were merged into Grodno Voivodeship. After the Union of Lublin the voivodeship, together with the whole Grand Duchy of Lithuania, became part of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth until the partitions of the Commonwealth in 1795. Most of the territory became part of the Russian Empire, while territories west of the Neman River – part of the Province of East Prussia. ==Voivodes== The Voivode of Trakai (, ) was one of the most important state offices in the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. They were appointed from prominent magnate families and competed only with voivode of Vilnius and Grand Chancellors for power and prestige. Voivodes were the ex officio members of the Lithuanian Council of Lords. Voivodes had their residence in Trakai city, near Galvė Lake, north of the Trakai Peninsula Castle. ===List of voivodes=== Trakai Voivodeship in the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth * Jonas Goštautas (1440) * Iwaszko Moniwidowicz (1443–1458) * Radvila Astikas (1466–1477) * Martynas Goštautas (1480–1483) * Jan Zabrzeziński (1498–1505) * Olbracht Gasztołd (Albrecht Goštautas) (1519–1522) * Konstanty Ostrogski (1522–1530) * Stanisław Gasztołd (Stanislovas Goštautas) (1542) * Mikołaj Krzysztof \\"the Orphan\\" Radziwiłł (1590–1604) * Janusz Skumin Tyszkiewicz (1626–1640) * Piotr Pac (X 1640–VII 1642) * Mikołaj Abramowicz (1647–1651?) * Marcjan Ogiński (since 1670) * Tadeusz Franciszek Ogiński (1770–1783) * Józef Mikołaj Radziwiłł (since 1788) ==Notes== Category:Voivodeships of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth Category:Former voivodeships of Grand Duchy of Lithuania Category:1413 establishments in Europe Category:15th-century establishments in Lithuania Category:1795 disestablishments in the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth ","title":"Trakai Voivodeship"},{"id":"1280282","text":"E-mu Emax (1986) The Emax was a line of samplers, developed, manufactured, and sold by E-mu Systems from 1986 to 1995. Sold alongside their more expensive Emulator II and III samplers, the Emax line was conceived after the release of the Akai S-612 and Sequential Prophet 2000, and was designed to compete for the lower end of the sampling market. The name Emax can refer to one of two specific models, the Emax (which was grey), and the Emax II (which was black). The Emax is sometimes referred to as the Emax I or the Emax 1000 to avoid confusion between the two models (although E-mu Systems never referred to it this way, there is an internal control label that says EMAX 1000 inside every unit). ==The Emax== The original Emax was released in 1986, as a low cost version of the Emulator II. The base model cost $2,995; a rack version was also available for $2,695. Although it was fairly similar to the Emulator II in sampling specifications, the Emax used much more reliable parts, and stored sounds on 3½\\" floppy disks, as opposed to the more antiquated 5¼\\" floppy disks that the Emulator used. The Emax was advertised as a 12-bit sampler, which was, in reality, only half-true; although playback was 12-bit, only 8 bits were used to store each sample. While this led some to regard the Emax as inferior to its competitors, many modern users consider it to be a key part of the Emax's sound. E-mu Emax SE (1988) Several upgrades were available for the Emax during its lifetime. The Emax HD featured a 20 megabyte hard drive for storing samples. The Emax SE added an additive synthesis engine that let the user create sounds from scratch. The Emax Plus added external SCSI device capability in addition to the other updates. Sample memory remained the same at 512 KB for all models. SCSI can be retrofitted to second and third revision motherboards and was standard on the final model the Plus. The Emax was discontinued in 1989 and replaced by Emax-II ==The Emax II== The Emax was replaced in 1989 by the Emax II and Emax II Turbo. Although the Emax II was a true 16-bit sampler with more polyphony, it also used digital filters and components, which sounded noticeably different from the original's analogue filter chips. The Emax II also sported a noticeably higher pricetag; a base model cost $3,595, while a fully expanded model could cost as much as $8,000. Nevertheless, the Emax II found a niche among many professionals due to its large and varied sample library, and it enjoyed the longest production run of any E-mu product. The EMAX II has different versions, labeled between 2201 and 2214, including mono and stereo versions. The Emax II Turbo, released in 1990, added more built-in sample memory (8 Mb from factory) and an internal SCSI Hard Disk. E-mu ESI-32 (1994/1995) In 1995, the Emax II was discontinued, replaced by the rackmountable ESi-32, and later the ESI-4000 and the ESI-2000. ==Notable users== * Alphaville - Emax * Beastie Boys - on Paul's Boutique * Cabaret Voltaire * Depeche Mode - all three keyboard players can be seen operating Emax keyboards on their 1989 live film, 101, and Emax II keyboards in the Devotional film. * Faith No More - Can be seen in the \\"Epic\\", \\"Falling to Pieces\\" and other videos * Fear Factory - Used an Emax during their performance at Dynamo Open Air in 1993 (particularly during the song \\"Scapegoat\\") * Ice MC - Can be seen in the \\"Easy\\" video * Johnny Hates Jazz - Emax used on Turn Back the Clock (album) * KMFDM - Used an Emax * Los Prisioneros * Manufacture * Mats/Morgan Band - Emax II * Meat Beat Manifesto * Mouse on Mars * Nine Inch Nails - used an Emax SE extensively on Pretty Hate Machine * Die Krupps - Emax II * Orbital * Saint Etienne - credited with using the Emax on their 1991 album \\"Foxbase Alpha\\" * Skinny Puppy * Steve Roach * Tony Toni Tone * Tyske Ludder - Emax II * U2 * Tom Waits - credited with using the Emax on his 1993 album \\"The Black Rider\\" * The Whispers * The Wiggles - credited with using the Emax on their 1991 album \\"The Wiggles\\" * White Town - Emax II extensively used on Your Woman ==References== Category:Samplers (musical instrument) Category:E-mu synthesizers ","title":"E-mu Emax"},{"id":"1280290","text":"Dignaga. A statue in Elista, Russia. Dignāga (a.k.a. Diṅnāga, c. 480 – c. 540 CE) was an Indian Buddhist scholar and one of the Buddhist founders of Indian logic (hetu vidyā). Dignāga's work laid the groundwork for the development of deductive logic in India and created the first system of Buddhist logic and epistemology (Pramana).Zheng Wei-hong; Dignāga and Dharmakīrti: Two Summits of Indian Buddhist Logic. Research Institute of Chinese Classics; Fudan University; Shanghai, China According to Georges B. Dreyfus, his philosophical school brought about an Indian \\"epistemological turn\\" and became the \\"standard formulation of Buddhist logic and epistemology in India and Tibet.\\"Recognizing Reality: Dharmakirti’s Philosophy and its Tibetan Interpretations, (Suny: 1997), page 15-16. Dignāga's thought influenced later Buddhist philosophers like Dharmakirti and also Hindu thinkers of the Nyaya school. Dignāga's epistemology accepted only \\"perception\\" (pratyaksa) and \\"inference\\" (anumāṇa) are valid instruments of knowledge and introduced the widely influential theory of \\"exclusion\\" (apoha) to explain linguistic meaning.Arnold, Dan. The Philosophical Works and Influence of Dignāga and Dharmakīrti, http://www.oxfordbibliographies.com/view/document/obo-9780195393521/obo-9780195393521-0085.xml His work on language, inferential reasoning and perception were also widely influential among later Indian philosophers.Dunne, John. \\"Dignaga\\" in Buswell (ed.) ENCYCLOPEDIA OF BUDDHISM. Volume One A-L According to Richard P. Hayes \\"some familiarity with Dinnaga's arguments and conclusions is indispensable for anyone who wishes to understand the historical development of Indian thought.\\"Hayes (1982), p. ix. Dignāga was born in Simhavakta near Kanchipuram and very little is known of his early years, except that he took Nagadatta of the Pudgalavada school as his spiritual preceptor, before being expelled and becoming a student of Vasubandhu. ==Philosophy== Buddhist epistemology holds that perception and inference are the means to correct knowledge. Dignāga mature philosophy is expounded in his magnum opus, the Pramāṇa-samuccaya. In chapter one, Dignāga's explains his epistemology which holds that there are only two 'instruments of knowledge' or 'valid cognitions' (pramāṇa); \\"perception\\" or \\"sensation\\" (pratyaksa) and \\"inference\\" or \\"reasoning\\" (anumāṇa). In chapter one, Dignāga writes: > Sensation and reasoning are the only two means of acquiring knowledge, > because two attributes are knowable; there is no knowable object other than > the peculiar and the general attribute. I shall show that sensation has the > peculiar attribute as its subject matter, while reasoning has the general > attribute as its subject matter.Hayes (1982), p 133. Perception is a non-conceptual knowing of particulars which is bound by causality, while inference is reasonable, linguistic and conceptual.Tom Tillemans (2011), Dharmakirti, Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy This conservative epistemic theory was in contrast to the Nyaya school who accepted other means of knowledge such as Upamāṇa (comparison and analogy). ===Pratyaksa=== Pratyaksa is a kind of awareness that acquires information about particulars, and is immediately present to one of the senses. This is the topic of the first chapter of the Pramāṇa-samuccaya.Hayes (1982), p 132. For Dignāga, perception is pre-verbal, pre-conceptual and unstructured sense data. In chapter two of the Pramāṇa-samuccaya he writes: > Sensation is devoid of structure. That cognition in which there is no > structure is sensation. What kind of thing is this so-called structure? > Attaching a name, a universal and so forth.Hayes (1982), p 134. According to Dignāga our mind always takes raw sense data or particulars and interprets them or groups them together in more complex ways, compares them to past experiences, gives them names to classify them based on general attributes (samanyalaksana) and so forth. This process he terms kalpana (arranging, structuring).Hayes (1982), p 135. This cognitive process is already different than sensation, which is a simple cognition based only on the immediately present. Thus pratyaksa is only awareness of particular sense data such as a patch of green color and the sensation of hardness, never awareness of a macroscopic object such an apple which is always a higher level synthesis.Hayes (1982), p 138. For Dignāga, sensation is also inerrant, it cannot \\"stray\\" because it is the most basic and simple phenomenon of experience or as he puts it: > \\"it is impossible too for the object of awareness itself to be errant, for > errancy is only the content of misinterpretation by the mind.\\"Hayes (1982), > p 139. Also, for Dignaga, pratyaksa is mostly phenomenalist and is not dependent on the existence of an external world. It is also inexpressible and private.Hayes (1982), p 143. ===Anumana=== Anumana (inference or reasoning) for Dignāga is a type of cognition which is only aware of general attributes, and is constructed out of simpler sensations. Inference can also be communicated through linguistic conventions.Hayes (1982), p 143. A central issue which concerned Dignāga was the interpretation of signs (linga) or the evidence (hetu) which led one to an inference (anumana) about states of affairs; such as how smoke can lead one to infer that there is a fire.Hayes (1982), p 1. This topic of svārthānumāna (reasoning, literally \\"inference for oneself\\") is the subject of chapter two of the Pramāṇa-samuccaya while the topic of the third chapter is about demonstration (parārthānumāna, literally \\"inference for others\\"), that is, how one communicates one's inferences through proper argument.Hayes (1982), p 132-33. According to Richard Hayes, in Dignāga's system, to obtain knowledge that a property (the \\"inferable property\\", sadhya) is inherent in a \\"subject of inference\\" (paksa) it must be derived through an inferential sign (linga). For this to occur, the following must be true:Hayes (1982), p 146, 153. #The inferential sign must be a property of the subject of the inference. That is, there exists in the subject of inference a property, which is different from the inferable property and which is furthermore evident to the person drawing the inference; this second property may serve as an inferential sign in case it has two further characteristics. #The inferential sign must be known to occur in at least one locus, other than the subject of inference, in which the inferable property occurs. #The inferential sign must not be known to occur in any other loci in which the inferable property is absent. Richard Hayes interprets these criteria as overly strict and this is because he sees Dignāga's system as one of rational skepticism. Dignāga's epistemology, argues Hayes, is a way to express and practice the traditional Buddhist injunction not become attached to views and opinions.Hayes (1982), p 146, 167. According to Hayes, for Dignāga, the role of logic is: > to counter dogmatism and prejudice. As a weapon in the battle against > prejudice that rages in every mind that seeks wisdom--in minds of the vast > majority of people who do not seek wisdom, prejudice simply takes full > control without a contest-there is nothing as powerful as the kind of reason > that lies at the heart of Dignaga's system of logic. For it should be clear > that very few of our judgments in ordinary life pass the standards set by > the three characteristics of legitimate' evidence. Taken in its strictest > interpretation, none of the judgments of any but a fully omniscient being > passes. And, since there is no evidence that there exist any fully > omniscient beings, the best available working hypothesis is that no one's > thinking is immune from errors that require revision in the face of newly > discovered realities.Hayes (1982), p 167. ===Apohavada and language=== Dignāga considered the interpretation of conventional and symbolic signs such as the words and sentences of human language to be no more than special or conventional instances of the general principles of inference or anumana.Hayes (1982), p 1. He takes up several issues relating to language and its relationship to inference in the fifth chapter of his Pramāṇa-samuccaya.Hayes (1982), p 132. During Dignāga's time, the orthodox Indian Nyaya school and also Hindu Sanskrit grammarians (such as Bhartṛhari) had discussed issues of epistemology and language respectively, but their theories generally accepted the concept of universals which was rejected by most Buddhist philosophers. Influenced by the work of these thinkers as well as by Buddhist philosophers of the Sautrantika school who rejected Hindu theories of universals in favor of nominalism (prajñapti), Dignāga developed his own Buddhist theory of language and meaning based on the concept of \\"apoha\\" (exclusion).Hayes (1982), p 27-28. Hattori Masaaki explains the doctrine thus: > a word indicates an object merely through the exclusion of other objects > (anyapoha, -vyavrtti). For example, the word \\"cow\\" simply means that the > object is not a non-cow. As such, a word cannot denote anything real, > whether it be an individual (vyakti), a universal (jati), or any other > thing. The apprehension of an object by means of the exclusion of other > objects is nothing but an inference.Hayes (1982), p 26. ==Works== As noted by Hayes, the difficulty in studying the highly terse works of Dignāga is considerable, because none of them have survived in the original Sanskrit and the Tibetan and Chinese translations which do survive show signs of having been done by translators who were not completely certain of the meaning of the work.Hayes, (1982), p. 6. This difficulty has also led scholars to read Dignaga through the lens of later authors such as Dharmakirti and their Indian and Tibetan interpreters as well as their Hindu Nyaya opponents. Because of this tendency in scholarship, ideas which are actually innovations of Dharmakirti and later authors have often been associated with Dignaga by scholars such as Fyodor Shcherbatskoy and S. Mookerjee, even though these thinkers often differ.Hayes, (1982), p. 15. Dignāga's magnum opus, the Pramāṇa-samuccaya (Compendium of Valid Cognition), examined perception, language and inferential reasoning. It presents perception as a bare cognition, devoid of conceptualization and sees language as useful fictions created through a process of exclusion (Apoha).Arnold, Dan. The Philosophical Works and Influence of Dignāga and Dharmakīrti, http://www.oxfordbibliographies.com/view/document/obo-9780195393521/obo-9780195393521-0085.xml Other works include: *Hetucakra (The wheel of reason), considered his first work on formal logic. It may be regarded as a bridge between the older doctrine of trairūpya and Dignāga's own later theory of vyapti which is a concept related to the Western notion of implication. *Alambana-parīkṣā, (The Treatise on the Objects of Cognition) and its auto commentary (vrtti). *Abhidharmakośa-marma-pradīpa – a condensed summary of Vasubandhu's seminal work the Abhidharmakosha *A summary of the Mahayana Aṣṭasāhasrika- prajñāpāramitā sūtra *Trikāla-parikṣa, (Treatise on the tri-temporality) *Nyāya-mukha (Introduction to logic). ==Tradition and Influence== Dignāga founded a tradition of Buddhist logic, and this school is sometimes called the \\"School of Dignāga\\" or the \\"Dignāga-Dharmakīrti school\\". In Tibetan it is often called “those who follow reasoning” (Tibetan: rigs pa rjes su ‘brang ba); in modern literature it is sometimes known by the Sanskrit 'pramāṇavāda', often translated as \\"the Epistemological School\\"Tillemans, Tom, \\"Dharmakīrti\\", The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Spring 2014 Edition), Edward N. Zalta (ed.), URL = . or \\"The logico-epistemological school.\\" Buddhist philosophers who wrote on pramana include: *Dharmakīrti (c. 7th century) *Jinendrabuddhi *Dharmapala of Nalanda *Santabhadra *Śāntarakṣita (725–788) *Dharmottara (8th century) *Prajñakaragupta *Samkarananda *Ratnākaraśānti (c.1000) *Jñanasrimitra (975–1025) *Ratnakīrti (11th century) This tradition of logic and epistemology continued in Tibet, where it was expanded by thinkers such as Cha-ba (1182–1251) and Sakya Pandita (1182–1251). Dignaga also influenced non- Buddhist Sanskrit thinkers. According to Lawrence J. McCrea, and Parimal G. Patil, Dignaga set in motion an \\"epistemic turn\\" in Indian philosophy: ==See also== * Buddhist logic * Critical Buddhism ==References== ==Further reading== * Chu, Junjie (2006).On Dignāga's theory of the object of cognition as presented in PS (V) 1, Journal of the International Association of Buddhist Studies 29 (2), 211–254 * Frauwallner, Erich, Dignāga, sein Werk und seine Entwicklung.

French is the medium of instruction. Before World War II very few Gabonese learned French, nearly all of them working in either business or government administration. After the war, France worked for universal primary education in Gabon, and by the 1960-61 census, 47% of the Gabonese over the age of 14 spoke some French, while 13% were literate in the language. By the 1990s, the literacy rate had risen to about 60%. It is estimated that 80% La Francophonie dans le monde 2006-2007 published by the Organisation internationale de la Francophonie. Nathan, Paris, 2007 of the country's population can speak the language competently and one-third of residents of Libreville, the capital city, had become native French speakers. More than 10,000 French people live in Gabon, and France predominates the country's foreign cultural and commercial influences. Outside the capital, French is less commonly spoken, though it is used by those who have completed a secondary or university education. The indigenous languages are all members of the Bantu family, estimated to have come to Gabon about 2,000 years ago, and differentiated into about 40 languages. They are generally spoken but not written; while missionaries from the United States and France developed transcriptions for a number of languages based on the Latin alphabet starting in the 1840s, and translated the Bible into several of them, French colonial policy officially promoted the study of French and discouraged African languages. The languages continue to be transmitted through family and clan, and individuals in cities and other areas where different people may learn several Bantu languages. The Gabonese government sponsored research on the Bantu languages starting in the 1970s. The three largest languages are Fang, Mbere, and Sira (Eshira), each with about 25–30% of the speakers. The remainder of the languages are single-digit percentages, and some have only a few thousand speakers. Education for the deaf in Gabon uses American Sign Language, introduced by the deaf American missionary Andrew Foster. (See Francophone African Sign Language.) In October 2012, just before the 14th summit of the Organisation internationale de la Francophonie, the country declared an intention to add English as a second official language, reportedly in response to an investigation by France into corruption in the African country. However, the spokesman for Ali Bongo Ondimba said: \\"\\"You know very well that once you leave the Francophonie space, if you do not speak English, you are almost handicapped. What is most interesting in the issue is the realization that French writers publish some of their materials in English, and that during international conferences, the French diplomats speak in English. If the French themselves are moving toward English, why would anyone expect the Gabonese not to?\\" It was later clarified that the country intended to introduce English as a first foreign language in schools, while keeping French as the general medium of instruction. == List of languages == *Indo-European languages **Romance languages ***French (ISO code fra) *Niger–Congo languages **Beti languages ***Fang (fng) **Kele–Tsogo languages ***Kendell (kbs) ***Sake (sag) ***Seki (syi) ***Sighu (sxe) ***Simba (sbw) ***Tsogo (tsv) ***Wumbvu (wum) **Makaa–Njem languages ***Bekwel (bkw) **Mbam languages ***Bubi (buw) **Mbete languages ***Kanin (kzo) **Nzebi languages ***Duma (dma) ***Tsaangi (tsa) ***Wandji (wdd) **Sawabantu languages ***Benga (ben) ***Yasa (yko) **Sira languages ***Barama (bbg) ***Bwisi (bwz) ***Sangu (snq) ***Sira (swj), aka Eshira, Shira ***Vili (vif) **Teke languages ***Northern Teke (teg) ***Western Teke (tez) ***Vumbu (vum) *Ubangian languages **Ngbaka languages ***Baka ==References== ==External links== * Ethnologue.com report on languages of Gabon * PanAfriL10n page on Gabon ","title":"Languages of Gabon"},{"id":"1280302","text":"The radio frequency of 500 kilohertz (500 kHz) has been an international calling and distress frequency for Morse code maritime communication since early in the 20th century. For most of its history, the international distress frequency was referred to by its equivalent wavelength, 600 meters, or, using the earlier frequency unit name, 500 kilocycles (per second) or 500 kc. The United States Coast Guard and comparable agencies of other nations once maintained 24-hour watches on this frequency, staffed by highly skilled radio operators. Many SOS calls and medical emergencies at sea were handled via this frequency until December 1999. However, because of the near disappearance of the commercial use of Morse code, the frequency is now rarely used. Emergency traffic on 500 kHz has been almost completely replaced by the Global Maritime Distress Safety System (GMDSS). Beginning in the late 1990s, most nations ended monitoring of transmissions on 500 kHz. The nearby frequencies of 518 kHz and 490 kHz are used for the Navtex component of GMDSS. Proposals to allocate frequencies at or near 500 kHz to amateur radio use resulted in the creation of the 630-meter band. == Initial adoption == International standards for the use of 500 kHz first appeared in the first International Radiotelegraph Convention in Berlin, which was signed November 3, 1906, and became effective July 1, 1908. The second Service Regulation affixed to this Convention designated 500 kHz as one of the standard frequencies to be employed by shore stations, specifying that \\"Two wave lengths, one of 300 meters [1 Mc/s] and the other of 600 meters, are authorized for general public service. Every coastal station opened to such service shall use one or the other of these two wave lengths.\\" (These regulations also specified that ship stations normally used 1 MHz). == Expanded policies == International standards for the use of 500 kHz were expanded by the second International Radiotelegraph Convention, which was held after the sinking of the RMS Titanic. This Convention, meeting in London, produced an agreement which was signed on July 5, 1912, and became effective July 1, 1913. The Service Regulations, affixed to the 1912 Convention, established 500 kHz as the primary frequency for seagoing communication, and the standard ship frequency was changed from 1,000 kHz to 500 kHz, to match the coastal station standard. Communication was generally conducted in Morse code, initially using spark-gap transmitters. Most two-way radio contacts were to be initiated on this frequency, although once established, the participating stations could shift to another frequency to avoid the congestion on 500 kHz. To facilitate communication between operators speaking different languages, standardized abbreviations were used, including a set of \\"Q codes\\" specified by the 1912 Service Regulations. 500 kHz transmitter and receiver position on SS Jeremiah O'Brien, a World War II Liberty ship Article XXI of the Service Regulations required that whenever an SOS distress call was heard, all transmissions unrelated to the emergency had to immediately cease until the emergency was declared over. There was a potential problem if a ship transmitted a distress call: the use of 500 kHz as a common frequency often led to heavy congestion, especially around major ports and shipping lanes, and it was possible the distress message would be drowned out by the bedlam of ongoing commercial traffic. To help address this problem, the Service Regulation's Article XXXII specified that \\"Coastal stations engaged in the transmission of long radiograms shall suspend the transmission at the end of each period of 15 minutes, and remain silent for a period of three minutes before resuming the transmission. Coastal and shipboard stations working under the conditions specified in Article XXXV, par. 2, shall suspend work at the end of each period of 15 minutes and listen in with a wave length of 600 meters during a period of three minutes before resuming the transmission.\\" During distress working all non-distress traffic was banned from 500 kHz and adjacent coast stations then monitored 512 kHz as an additional calling frequency for ordinary traffic. == Later policies == The silent and monitoring periods were soon expanded and standardized. For example, Regulation 44, from the July 27, 1914, edition of Radio Communication Laws of the United States, stated: \\"The international standard wave length is 600 meters, and the operators of all coast stations are required, during the hours the station is in operation, to 'listen in' at intervals of not more than 15 minutes and for a period not less than 2 minutes, with the receiving apparatus tuned to receive this wave length, for the purpose of determining if any distress signals or messages are being sent and to determine if the transmitting operations of the 'listening station' are causing interference with other radio communication.\\" International refinements for the use of 500 kHz were specified in later agreements, including the 1932 Madrid Radio Conference. In later years, except for distress traffic, stations shifted to nearby \\"working frequencies\\" to exchange messages once contact was established. 425, 454, 468, 480, and 512 kHz were used by ships while the coast stations had their own individual working frequencies. Twice each hour, all stations operating on 500 kHz were required to maintain a strictly enforced three-minute silent period, starting at 15 and 45 minutes past the hour. Ship's radio room clock with silence periods markedAs a visual memory aid, a typical clock in a ship's radio room would have the silence periods marked by shading the sectors between h+15 to h+18 and h+45 to h+48 in RED. Similar sectors between h+00 to H+03 and h+30 to h+33 are marked in GREEN which is the corresponding silence period for the 2182 kHz voice communications distress signals. In addition, during this silent period all coastal and ship stations were required to monitor the frequency, listening for any distress signals. All large ships at sea had to monitor 500 kHz at all times, either with a licensed radio operator or with equipment (called an auto-alarm) that automatically detected an SOS alarm signal. Simulated auto-alarm signal. Shore stations throughout the world operated on this frequency to exchange messages with ships and to issue warning about weather and other navigational warnings. At night, transmission ranges of 3,000–4,000 miles (4,500–6,500 kilometers) were typical. Daytime ranges were much shorter, on the order of 300–1,500 miles (500–2,500 kilometers). Terman's Radio Engineering Handbook (1948) shows the maximum distance for 1 kW over salt water to be 1,500 miles, and this distance was routinely covered by ships at sea, where signals from ships and nearby coastal stations would cause congestion, covering up distant and weaker signals. During the silence, a distress signal could more easily be heard at great distances. ==Amateur radio== Regions with a 500 kHz amateur radio allocation. Blue indicates official allocations based on WRC-12. Light blue indicates official allocations that are outside the WRC-12 frequencies. Green indicates experimental allocations. Operation is prohibited in red regions. With maritime traffic largely displaced from the 500 kHz band, some countries have taken steps to allocate frequencies at or near 500 kHz to amateur radio use. In Belgium, amateurs were allocated a 501 to 504 kHz segment on a secondary basis on January 15, 2008. Only continuous wave (CW) may be used with a maximum effective radiated power (ERP) of 5 watts. In Norway, the band segment 493–510 kHz was allocated to radio amateurs on November 6, 2009. Only radiotelegraphy is permitted. In New Zealand, the band segment of 505 to 515 kHz was allocated temporarily, pending an international frequency allocation. In the Netherlands Amateur radio operators have allocated the band segment from 501 to 505 kHz with a maximum of 100 watts PEP on January 1, 2012. == See also == *2182 kHz the international distress frequency for voice maritime communication *630-meter band *Navtex a maritime weather and safety text broadcast on 518 kHz and 490 kHz *Aircraft emergency frequency *Call for help for emergency frequencies in current use *Distress signal *GMDSS *Mayday *Medium frequency radio propagation *Radio Act of 1912 *Radio propagation *SOS ==References== ==External links== * Berlin International Radiotelegraphic Convention of 1906 * Radio Laws and Regulations of the United States: Edition July 27, 1914.

In 2013 he became a fellow of the Association for Computing Machinery.ACM Names Fellows for Computing Advances that Are Transforming Science and Society , Association for Computing Machinery, accessed 2013-12-10. ==Research== Kleinberg is best known for his work on networks and particularly for his HITS algorithm, developed while he was at IBM. HITS is an algorithm for web search that builds on the eigenvector-based methods used in algorithms and served as the full-scale model for PageRank by recognizing that web pages or sites should be considered important not only if they are linked to by many others (as in PageRank), but also if they link to many others. Search engines themselves are examples of sites that are important because they link to many others. Kleinberg realized that this generalization implies two different classes of important web pages, which he called \\"hubs\\" and \\"authorities\\". The HITS algorithm is an algorithm for automatically identifying the leading hubs and authorities in a network of hyperlinked pages. Kleinberg is also known for his work on algorithmic aspects of the small world experiment. He was one of the first to realize that Stanley Milgram's famous \\"six degrees\\" letter-passing experiment implied not only that there are short paths between individuals in social networks but also that people seem to be good at finding those paths, an apparently simple observation that turns out to have profound implications for the structure of the networks in question. The formal model in which Kleinberg studied this question is a two dimensional grid, where each node has both short-range connections (edges) to neighbours in the grid and long-range connections to nodes further apart. For each node v, a long-range edge between v and another node w is added with a probability that decays as the second power of the distance between v and w. This is generalized to a d-dimensional grid, where the probability decays as the d-th power of the distance.

It serves the counties of Indian River, Martin, Okeechobee and St. Lucie. ==History== The college was established in 1959 as Indian River Junior College and located in a former public school building in Fort Pierce. IRJC moved to its current main campus on Virginia Avenue in 1963 after the city of Fort Pierce donated the site to the institution. In 1970, the Board of Trustees decided a name more fitting of the College's service to the community was needed, and it was renamed Indian River Community College. This was in keeping with the national trend for public junior colleges to drop the word \\"junior\\" in favor of 'Community.\\" Within the confines of the College, the school is called The River or 'the ersk', pronouncing the school's acronym, IRSC. The school's mascot is the Pioneer. On 10 September 2007, IRCC's Board of Trustees voted unanimously to change the college's name to Indian River College, as it began its transition into a four-year institution. The name change needed to be enacted into law by the Florida Legislature.IRCC likely to change its name, drop 'community' : Treasure Coast : TCPalm Ultimately, the school's name was changed to Indian River State College by the college's board of trustees effective 1 July 2008. ==Campus== The main campus occupies a site that was formerly the Fort Pierce landfill site. It has branch campuses in Okeechobee (Dixon Hendry campus), Port St. Lucie (Pruitt campus), Stuart (Chastain campus) and Vero Beach (Mueller campus) plus additional learning centers facilities in the area. In August 2020, the main campus in Fort Pierce was named Massey campus after the retiring president Edwin R. Massey. ==Academics== Nine bachelor's degree programs have been added in middle and secondary school teacher education in math and science, exceptional student education, nursing, organizational management, public safety administration and healthcare management. Indian River State College is accredited by the Commission on Colleges of the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools to award Associate and Baccalaureate Degrees. The institution offers additional educational programs such as Technical Certificates and Applied Technology Diplomas. The institution also offers an Adult High School Program that allows adults that have not graduated high school to continue earning credits that may be counted towards their completion of the GED. IRSC also participates in the dual enrollment state program to allow students to take college classes at a discount while in a public high school. They host the Clark Advanced Learning Center, a technology-based high school as a joint venture between the Martin County School District and IRSC. The Kight Center for Emerging Technologies is #1 in technology in the nation for mid-size colleges. This designation was awarded by the American Association of Community Colleges and the Center for Digital Education for 2005, 2006, and 2007. In September 2014, the college was named as one of the ten best community colleges in the United States by the Aspen Institute. In 2018, the college was regarded runner-up for the best state college in the United States by the Aspen Institute. Then again in 2019, it won another from the Aspen Institute, for the #1 best state college in the United States, tied with Miami Dade College in Miami, FL.https://www.aspeninstitute.org/news/press-release/2019-aspen-prize-for- community-college- excellence/#:~:text=Washington%2C%20DC%2C%20April%202%2C,recognition%20of%20high%20achievement%20and ==Athletics== The college athletic teams, which are nicknamed the Pioneers, compete in the Southern Conference of the Florida State College Activities Association, a body of the National Junior College Athletic Association Region 8. The college has very successful swimming and diving team. Indian River men's swimming and diving have won 45 straight NJCAA swimming and diving championships, and the women's team has won 37 straight national championships. With 45 consecutive wins, IRSC currently holds title to the longest unbroken U.S. championship winning streak in any sport at the collegiate level.

He is best remembered for his 1936 parody of Time magazine, which skewered the magazine's inverted narrative structure. Gibbs wrote, \\"Backward ran sentences until reeled the mind\\"; he concluded the piece, \\"Where it all will end, knows God!\\" He also wrote a comedy, Season in the Sun, which ran on Broadway for 10 months in 1950–51 and was based on a series of stories that originally appeared in The New Yorker. He was a friend and frequent editor of John O'Hara, who named his fictional town of \\"Gibbsville, Pa.\\" for him. ==Early life== Gibbs was born in New York City on March 15, 1902. He was the son of Lucius Tuckerman Gibbs (1869–1909) and Angelica Singleton (née Duer) Gibbs, who married in 1901. His father was a Cornell-educated mechanical and electrical engineer who variously worked for Otis Elevators, American Rheostat and obtained patents for motors, running gears and heating systems. His sister Angelica was born in 1908 and his father died of lobar pneumonia in 1909. His paternal grandparents were Francis Sarason Gibbs and Eliza Gay (née Hosmer) Gibbs and his maternal grandparents were Edward Alexander Duer and Sarah Anna (née Vanderpoel) Duer. He was a descendant of mineralogist George Gibbs and the great-nephew of the chemist Oliver Wolcott Gibbs with whom he shared all three names. The younger Gibbs, however, disdained the \\"Oliver\\" and never used it. Through his maternal grandfather, he was a descendant of William Duer, a member of the Continental Congress and signer of the United States Articles of Confederation, and through his maternal grandmother, he was a direct descendant of U.S. President Martin Van Buren.Reitwiesner, William Addams.

Americans of Royal Descent: A Collection of Genealogies of American Families Whose Lineage is Traced to the Legitimate Issue of Kings. 1891, Page 121. He was also a direct descendant of Oliver Wolcott Sr., signer of the Declaration of Independence, and Secretary of the Treasury under George Washington and John Adams. He also descended from the Livingston family and the Schuyler family.Reitwiesner, William Addams. Ancestry of George W. Bush http://www.wargs.com/political/bush.html Accessed March 15, 2016. After the death of his father and his mother's alcoholism, Gibbs and his sister were sent to live with his uncle, George Gibbs V. He attended various schools, including Horace Mann School, Riverdale Country Day School, The Hill School in Pottstown, Pennsylvania, and the Roxbury School. but he rebelled and was kicked out of nearly all of them. ==Career== After failing his school exams, Gibbs began a series of dead-end jobs including working as a timekeeper, a chauffeur, a draftsman, and four years on the freight crew of the Long Island Railroad, which his uncle was affiliated with. Realizing he was unhappy and unfulfilled in his work, his cousin, Alice Duer Miller, set him up working as an editor for their cousin through marriage, Lloyd Carpenter Griscom. Griscom made Gibbs the associate editor of the East Norwich Enterprise and, eventually, reporter and editor for the North Hempstead Record, both Long Island newspapers. Gibbs succeeded and eventually went to The New Yorker in 1927 as a copy reader. Ten years later, when E. B. White temporarily left the magazine, he took over the Talk of the Town section. Although not a regular member of the Algonquin Round Table, Gibbs was closely associated with many of its leading names, inheriting the job of theatre critic at The New Yorker from Robert Benchley in 1938. Because his years at the magazine largely overlapped with those of the better-known Alexander Woollcott, many people have confused them or assumed they were related. In fact, Gibbs was a cousin of Alice Duer Miller – yet another member of the Algonquin set – but he was not a relative of Woollcott's. On numerous occasions, in print and in person, Gibbs expressed an intense dislike for Woollcott as both an author and as a person. In a letter to James Thurber, in fact, Gibbs wrote that he thought Woollcott was \\"one of the most dreadful writers who ever existed.\\" Thomas Kunkel asserts in his biography of New Yorker founder Harold Ross, \\"Genius in Disguise,\\" that a profile of Alexander Woollcott written by Gibbs sparked the disassociation of Woollcott and the magazine. For many years, Gibbs was also the editor and publisher of The Fire Islander a weekly newspaper on Fire Island, where he had a vacation home. ==Personal life== Gibbs was married three times. His first marriage was on July 24, 1926 to Helen Marguerite Galpin, the daughter of William Galpin (an English butler who worked for Mortimer Schiff). His second wife was Elizabeth Ada Crawford, whom he married in August 1929, a Detroit native who worked as a writer in The New Yorker's promotion department. Less than a year after their marriage, Elizabeth committed suicide by plunging to her death from the window of their apartment on the seventeenth floor of 45 Prospect Place in Tudor City, New York on March 31, 1930. After Elizabeth's death, he began a nearly three-year relationship with writer Nancy Hale, who was then married to Taylor Scott Hardin. Hale refused to leave Hardin for Gibbs (although she did eventually divorce Hardin and married Charles Wertenbaker and, later, Fredson Bowers). He then met his third, and final, wife, whom he married in 1933; Elinor Mead Sherwin (1903–1963), daughter of architect Harold Sherwin of the Sherwin-Williams paint family. Together, they were the parents of two children: * Wolcott Gibbs Jr. (b. 1935), known as \\"Tony,\\" who married Elizabeth Villa in 1958. He has written extensively about yachting and was an editor at The New Yorker for several years in the 1980s. * Janet Gibbs, who married James Ward. An alcoholic and heavy smoker, he died of a heart attack while reading proofs of his upcoming book, More in Sorrow, on August 16, 1958 at his home on Ocean Beach, Fire Island. He was buried at Ferncliff Cemetery in Hartsdale, New York. His widow died on July 30, 1963 of burns she received in a fire at her New York home, 352 East 50th Street. ===Legacy=== On October 11, 2011, Bloomsbury USA released the anthology \\"Backward Ran Sentences: The Best of Wolcott Gibbs of The New Yorker\\" (), with a foreword by P.J.

The male is mainly dark green with a blue-green rump. It has a dark mask through the eye, with buff stripes above and below this, and down the centre of the throat. The central feathers of the tapered tail are—for large hermit—relatively short and white-tipped, and are wiggled in display at the communal leks. The reddish bill is long and decurved.

Green hermit with its white tongue out ==Distribution and habitat== The nominate subspecies Phaethornis guy guy is found in Venezuela and Trinidad. The western P. g. apicalis of the American cordillera is slightly smaller and the sexes more similar. This hermit inhabits forest undergrowth, usually near water, and prefers hilly areas. It seems to favor primary rainforest and wet premontane forest, and though it tolerates some amount of habitat destruction (e.g. subsistence farmland) it will try to avoid secondary forest as long as better habitat is available. In the Colombian Cordillera Oriental, it has been recorded at altitudes from ASL. Habitat there usually has a canopy height of around and is dominated by trees such as Elaeagia (Rubiaceae) or palms;E.g. Iriartea deltoidea or Wettinia praemorsa: Salaman et al. (2002) there is usually plentiful undergrowth and/or epiphytes and hemiepiphytes (e.g. Clusiaceae).Salaman et al. (2002) ==Behaviour== Santa Elena Reserve, Monteverde, Costa Rica ===Feeding=== The food of this species is nectar, taken from a wide variety of flowers, and some small insects; it prefers flowers 30–50 mm long by 2–7 mm wide, though it will occasionally visit flowers up to 75 mm long and 20 mm wide or as short as 15 mm. At Monteverde (Costa Rica), preferred foodplants include yellow jacobinia (Justicia umbrosa) and Razisea spicata (Acanthaceae), Pitcairnia brittoniana (Bromeliaceae), spiral ginger (Costus barbatus, Costaceae), Drymonia conchocalyx and D. rubra (Gesneriaceae), Heliconia tortuosa (Heliconiaceae), and Malvaviscus palmanus (Malvaceae).

In the Colombian Cordillera Oriental, active leks were observed between September and November, but neither in August nor in December, indicating a distinct breeding season. The green hermit lays one egg in a conical nest suspended under a large leaf, usually over water. Incubation is 17–18 days, and fledging another 21 to 23 days. ==References== ===Notes=== ===Sources=== * ffrench, Richard; O'Neill, John Patton & Eckelberry, Don R.

Hawaii Route 61, often called the Pali Highway, is in Honolulu County, Hawaii, United States, that is the main highway connecting downtown Honolulu with the windward side of Oahu island. From downtown, it traverses up Nuuanu Valley and the residential neighborhood of Nuuanu, passes through the Nuuanu Pali Tunnels, and descends to the major windward communities of Kāneohe (reached by Kamehameha Highway, State Route 83) and Kailua. ==History== The current Pali Highway is actually the third roadway to be built here. The original Pali \\"highway\\" went along much of the same route and portions of the old road still exist, although closed to vehicular traffic. When the current Pali Highway and its tunnels opened, the original roadway was closed and is now used by hikers. The \\"Old Pali Highway\\", as it is now called, is noted in the popular culture of Hawaii for being a place with strong spiritual connections. Many ghost stories have settings along this old highway. A large portion of the old highway was built over the ancient Hawaiian foot paths that traversed the famous Pali pass, which was the most easily accessible route to take from the Windward to Honolulu side. This was because much of the Koolau range on the Windward side has steep cliffs that make it nearly impossible to traverse over safely. \\"Pali\\" is the Hawaiian word for precipice. The highway was mentioned as an \\"awe-inspiring drive\\" in Car and Driver's \\"10 Best Drivers' Cities.\\" ==Points of interest== The lower mouth of Nuuanu valley is the site of historic Oahu Cemetery, founded in 1844. Over time it was expanded with the Royal Mausoleum of Hawaii in 1863, and the Kyoto Gardens of Honolulu Memorial Park. A few blocks to the east is the National Memorial Cemetery of the Pacific. Hawaii Route 61 has several free scenic lookouts, including the Pali Lookout. The Queen Emma Summer Palace is also on the Pali (2913 Pali Hwy).

Norton and Company, 1979.Roger LeRoy Miller, \\"Intermediate Microeconomics Theory Issues Applications, Third Edition\\", New York: McGraw-Hill, Inc, 1982.Tirole, Jean, \\"The Theory of Industrial Organization\\", Cambridge, Massachusetts: The MIT Press, 1988.John Black, \\"Oxford Dictionary of Economics\\", New York: Oxford University Press, 2003. In a perfectly competitive market, the additional revenue generated by selling an additional unit of a good is equal to the price the firm is able to charge the buyer of the good.O'Sullivan & Sheffrin (2003), p. 112. This is because a firm in a competitive market will always get the same price for every unit it sells regardless of the number of units the firm sells since the firm's sales can never impact the industry's price. However, a monopoly determines the entire industry's sales. As a result, it will have to lower the price of all units sold to increase sales by 1 unit. Therefore, the marginal revenue generated is always lower than the price the firm is able to charge for the unit sold, since each reduction in price causes unit revenue to decline on every good the firm sells. The marginal revenue (the increase in total revenue) is the price the firm gets on the additional unit sold, less the revenue lost by reducing the price on all other units that were sold prior to the decrease in price. A firm’s profits will be maximized when marginal revenue (MR) equals marginal cost (MC). If MR > MC then a profit-maximizing firm will increase output for more profit, while if MR < MC then the firm will decrease output for additional profit. Thus the firm will choose the profit- maximizing output level as that for which MR = MC. == Definition == Marginal revenue is equal to the ratio of the change in revenue for some change in quantity sold to that change in quantity sold. This can also be represented as a derivative when the change in quantity sold becomes arbitrarily small. Define the revenue function to be :R(Q)=P(Q)\\\\cdot Q , where Q is output and P(Q) is the inverse demand function of customers. By the product rule, marginal revenue is then given by :R'(Q)=P(Q) + P'(Q)\\\\cdot Q, where the prime sign indicates a derivative. For a firm facing perfect competition, price does not change with quantity sold (P'(Q)=0), so marginal revenue is equal to price. For a monopoly, the price decreases with quantity sold (P'(Q)<0), so marginal revenue is less than price (for positive Q.) ==Marginal revenue curve== The marginal revenue curve is affected by the same factors as the demand curve – changes in income, changes in the prices of complements and substitutes, changes in populations, etc. These factors can cause the MR curve to shift and rotate.Landsburg, S Price 2002. p. 137. ==Relationship between marginal revenue and elasticity== The relationship between marginal revenue and the elasticity of demand by the firm's customers can be derived as follows:Perloff (2008) p. 364. :R=P(Q)\\\\cdot Q, :MR = dR/dQ = P+\\\\frac{dP}{dQ}\\\\cdot Q = P+\\\\left(\\\\frac{dP}{dQ}\\\\frac{Q}{P}\\\\right)\\\\cdot P = P \\\\cdot \\\\left(1+\\\\frac{1}{e}\\\\right), where R is total revenue, P(Q) is the inverse of the demand function, and e < 0 is the price elasticity of demand. If demand is inelastic (e > –1) then MR will be negative, because to sell a marginal (infinitesimal) unit the firm would have to lower the selling price so much that it would lose more revenue on the pre-existing units than it would gain on the incremental unit. If demand is elastic (e < –1) MR will be positive, because the additional unit would not drive down the price by so much. If the firm is a perfect competitor, so that it is so small in the market that its quantity produced and sold has no effect on the price, then the price elasticity of demand is negative infinity, and marginal revenue simply equals the (market-determined) price. ==Marginal revenue and markup pricing== Profit maximization requires that a firm produces where marginal revenue equals marginal costs. Firm managers are unlikely to have complete information concerning their marginal revenue function or their marginal costs. However, the profit maximization conditions can be expressed in a “more easily applicable form”: :MR = MC, :MR = P(1 + 1/e), :MC = P(1 + 1/e), :MC = P + P/e, :(P - MC)/ P = –1/e.Pindyck, R & Rubinfeld, D (2001) p. 334. Markup is the difference between price and marginal cost. The formula states that markup as a percentage of price equals the negative (and hence the absolute value) of the inverse of the elasticity of demand. (P - MC)/ P = –1/e is called the Lerner index after economist Abba Lerner.Perloff (2008) p. 371. The Lerner index is a measure of market power — the ability of a firm to charge a price that exceeds marginal cost. The index varies from zero (when demand is infinitely elastic (a perfectly competitive market) to 1 (when demand has an elasticity of –1). The closer the index value is to 1, the greater is the difference between price and marginal cost. The Lerner index increases as demand becomes less elastic. Alternatively, the relationship can be expressed as: :P = MC/(1 + 1/e). Thus, for example, if e is –2 and MC is $5.00 then price is $10.00. Example If a company can sell 10 units at $20 each or 11 units at $19 each, then the marginal revenue from the eleventh unit is (11 × 19) - (10 × 20) = $9. ==See also== * Cost curve * Profit maximization ==Notes== ==References== * Landsburg, S 2002 Price Theory & Applications, 5th ed.

He was best known for his long and increasingly successful campaign for the acceptance of gay and lesbian people by Christians in general, and the Episcopal Church in particular. ==Biography== Louie Crew was born December 9, 1936, in Anniston, Alabama. He has written about \\"Growing Up Gay in Dixie\\" Crew was graduated from The McCallie School (1954), and received a B.A. from Baylor University (1958) a M.A. from Auburn University (1959) and a Ph.D. from the University of Alabama (1971). Crew has taught at Auburn University, Darlington School, St. Andrew's School (Delaware), Penge Secondary Modern School, London, University of Alabama, Experiment in International Living, Claflin University, Fort Valley State University, University of Wisconsin–Stevens Point, Beijing International Studies University, Chinese University of Hong Kong and Rutgers University. Louie Crew Clay died on November 27, 2019, 12 days shy of his 83rd birthday. ==Activism== While teaching at Fort Valley State University, Crew founded Integrity USA, a gay-acceptance group within the Episcopal church (1974). With Julia Penelope, Crew co-founded the LGBT caucus of the National Council of Teachers of English (1975). He served on the board of directors of the National Gay and Lesbian Task Force from 1976 to 1978. After he moved to Wisconsin, he served on the Wisconsin Governor's Council on Lesbian and Gay Issues in 1983. When Crew first began working for the inclusion of LGBT people in the Episcopal church, he was widely denounced and dismissed, but today the Episcopal Church has come to agree with many of his views, while some churches and dioceses are strongly opposed. Crew sat on the Episcopal Church's executive council (2000–2006). He was elected by the Episcopal Diocese of Newark to serve as a deputy to six triennial national General Conventions (1994, 1997, 2000, 2003, 2006, 2009). He was a devoted Anglo-Catholic and for many years a member of Grace Church in Newark. Crew maintained a comprehensive Web site with information about the Episcopal Church and the Anglican Communion. Professor Ed Rodman at the Episcopal Divinity School says that Crew's first and foremost contribution was that \\"he brought internet literacy to the church\\" ==Marriage== Louie Crew married Ernest Clay on February 2, 1974, although at the time their marriage had no legal standing. They married legally on August 22, 2013 and Crew took on his husband's last name. The two are featured together in \\"Not That Kind of Christian\\" an 80-minute documentary film by Andrew Grossman, which premiered at the Breckenridge Film Festival in 2007. ==Queer Poet and Writer== Editors have published more than 2,638 of Crew's manuscripts, including his most recent book Letters from Samaria: The Prose & Poetry of Louie Crew Clay edited by Max Niedzwiecki (Morehouse, New York, 2015) plus four poetry volumes: Sunspots (Lotus Press, Detroit, 1976) Midnight Lessons (Samisdat, 1987), Lutibelle's Pew (Dragon Disks, 1990), and Queers! for Christ's Sake! (Dragon Disks, 2003) Crew sometimes uses the noms de plume Li Min Hua, Quean Lutibelle, and Dr. Ddungo. YouTube has numerous videos of Crew reading his own poems. Crew wrote the first openly lgbt materials ever published by Christianity & Crisis, Change Magazine Chronicle of Higher Education, FOR (Fellowship of Reconciliation), The Living Church and Southern Exposure. With Rictor Norton, Crew co-edited a special issue of College English on \\"The Homosexual Imagination\\" (November 1974). He served on the editorial board of the Journal of Homosexuality (1978–83; 1989-2012). He edited the 1978 book The Gay Academic, the book Telling Our Stories and the book 101 Reasons to Be Episcopalian. Crew's papers are deposited in The Labadie Collection at the University of Michigan ==Recognition== * Crew received honorary Doctor of Divinity degrees from Episcopal Divinity School in 1999 and from General Theological Seminary in 2003, and an honorary Doctor of Humane Letters degree from the Church Divinity School of the Pacific in 2004. * He had been a Fellow for the National Endowment for the Humanities three times: University of California, Berkeley 1974, University of Texas at Austin 1977, and University of Chicago, 1981. * He has been a poet in residence at Helene Wurlitzer Foundation of New Mexico (1963) and at Ragdale (1988) * Episcopal Divinity School established scholarship under his name. * He was the recipient of the Bishop's Cross from the Rt.

The core has a short outer thread which is screwed into the inner thread of the stem. The visible outer thread of the stem holds the dust cap. The Schrader valve (also called American valve) is a type of pneumatic tire valve used on virtually every motor vehicle in the world today. The Schrader company, for which it was named, was founded in 1844 by August Schrader. The original Schrader valve design was invented in 1891, and patented in the United States in 1893.George H.F. Schrader, \\"Valve,\\" (filed: January 9, 1893 ; issued: April 11, 1893). The Schrader valve consists of a valve stem into which a valve core is threaded. The valve core is a poppet valve assisted by a spring. A small rubber seal located on the core keeps the fluid from escaping through the threads. Using the appropriate tools, a faulty valve core can be immediately extracted from the valve stem and replaced with a new one. ==Uses== The Schrader valve is used on virtually all automobile tires and motorcycle tires and most wider rimmed bicycle tires. In addition to tube and tubeless tires, Schrader valves of varying diameters are used on many refrigeration and air conditioning systems to allow servicing, including recharging with refrigerant; by plumbers conducting leak-down pressure tests on pipe installations; as a bleeding and test port on the fuel rail of some fuel injected engines; on bicycle air shock absorbers to allow adjustment of air pressure according to the rider's weight; and in the buoyancy compensator (BC) inflators of SCUBA systems where the ability to easily disconnect an air hose (even underwater) without the loss of tank air is critical. Schrader valves are also widely used in high-pressure hydraulic systems on aircraft. Many domestic fire extinguishers use an internal valve identical to a Schrader valve, but with a lever on top to enable quick release of the pressurized content. == Valve == Long (old) version of the core. upright=0.37 A Schrader valve consists of an externally threaded hollow cylindrical metal tube, typically of nickel plated brass. In the center of the exterior end is a metal pin pointing along the axis of the valve stem; the pin's end is approximately flush with the end of the valve body. All Schrader valves used on tires have threads and bodies of a single standard size at the exterior end, so caps and tools generally are universal for the valves on all common applications. The core of the valve can be removed or tightened with a tool. Industrial Schrader valves are available in different diameters and valve core variants and are used in refrigeration, propane, and a variety of other uses. A new development is Schrader valve stems with integrated transmitters for tire pressure monitoring systems (TPMS). == Cap == A valve cap is important on a Schrader valve because if one is not fitted, dirt and water can enter the inside of the valve stem, potentially jamming it or contaminating the sealing surfaces and causing a leak. Metal, and some hard plastic valve caps have a rubber-washer seal (or a synthetic-rubber-washer seal) inside to help make a hermetic seal. A cap equipped with such a secondary sealing means helps prevent air from escaping from a slightly leaking valve core; substantial valve core leaks, however, may still find their way around the rubber washer. In addition, the rubber washer prevents the cap from loosening and falling off due to vibrations and hence being lost, by acting as a cushion between the cap and the valve stem and in this way damping the vibrations, though most caps are a softer plastic, making the need for a separate seal unnecessary. ==Schrader versus other valve types== A Schrader valve advertisement, Horseless Age, 1918. National Geographic April, 1921. Schrader valve stem with valve core Whereas Schrader valves are almost universal on car tires, bicycle tubes have Schrader or Presta valves, with most higher end bikes having Presta valves. Both the Schrader and the Presta types are good at sealing high pressures. Their chief differences are that Schrader valves are larger and have springs that close the valve except when the pin is depressed. Schrader valves are used in a wide variety of compressed gas and pressurized liquid applications such as small torch and grill cylinders, and air shocks. Schrader valves are also viewed as more complex (requiring two seals over one), and heavier than Presta valves. Presta valve stems are 6 mm in diameter, whereas Schrader valve stems for bicycle tires are 8 mm, thus requiring a larger diameter hole in a bicycle rim. While not a concern on wider bike rims, it will weaken a narrow wheel rim, precluding their use on (road) racing bicycles. Another disadvantage of the Schrader is that the air chuck must depress the spring-loaded pin before air can flow during inflation (and potentially introducing debris into the tube or the seal inside the valve), whereas the Presta valve relies on a small knurled nut to keep it shut. Filling up a bicycle tire with a Presta-valved tube at an automobile filling station requires an adaptor, while a Schrader- valved tube does not. Bike riders also need to purchase Presta pumps, or, more commonly, the dual valve capable pumps for both Schrader and Presta valves. Presta valves are also available in a wider variety of stem lengths for aero- bicycle rims. A removable core Presta valve has become common in many applications, specifically tubeless tires where the ability to introduce sealant into the tire through the stem is considered useful. Dunlop valves (also called \\"British\\" or \\"Woods\\" valves) are occasionally used on bicycles in certain countries including India, China, Japan, Korea, Ireland and the Netherlands, but are rarely found in the United States. Dunlop valves are compatible with Presta inflators. == Dimensions == * 8V1 thread: x 32 TPI ( pitch) (Tap size: 8v1-32) * 5V1 thread: x 36 TPI ( pitch)(Tap size: 5v1-36) ==References== == External links == * TRA (The Tire and Rim Association, Inc.) * Schrader-Bridgeport International (North American English version) * Valve threads Category:Vehicle parts Category:Air valves Category:Tires Category:1891 introductions Category:American inventions fr:Valve Schrader ","title":"Schrader valve"},{"id":"1280481","text":"The molecular formula C6H6 (molar mass: 78.114) * Benzene * Benzvalene * Bicyclopropenyl * Dewar benzene * Fulvene * Prismane * [3]Radialene * 3-Methylidenepent-1-en-4-yne * Hexadiyne ** 1,3-Hexadiyne ** 1,4-Hexadiyne ** 1,5-Hexadiyne ** 2,4-Hexadiyne *Hexadienyne **1,2-Hexadien-4-yne **1,2-Hexadien-5-yne **1,3-Hexadien-5-yne **1,5-Hexadien-3-yne (Basavraj) **2,3-Hexadien-5-yne Historical and hypothetical compounds: * Claus' benzene ==References== ","title":"C6H6"},{"id":"1280496","text":"Protul Chandra Sorcar (23 February 19136 January 1971) was an Indian magician.

The Chanson was later reworked and incorporated in an extended Crusade cycle, of the 14th century, which was far more fabulous and embroidered, more distinctly romance than epic. The subject is the preaching of the First Crusade, the preparations for departure, the tearful goodbyes, the arrival at Constantinople and the siege and taking of Antioch. The lost original poem was said to have been composed by an eye-witness, Richard le Pèlerin, (\\"Richard the Pilgrim\\"), a North French or Flemish jongleur, who began it partly on the spot, during the eight-month siege of Antioch. The oldest version now known was recast by Graindor de Douai, a contemporary of Louis VII of France. Graindor borrowed details from the chroniclers to make his work more lively and more accurate, for his object from the start was to tell the true praiseworthy tale, not cozen his listeners of their coin: :Seignor, oïés canchon, qui moult fait à loer :Par itel convenant la vos puis- je conter... :Je ne vous vorrai mie mensonges raconter :Ne fables, ne paroles pour vos deniers embler :Ains vous dirai canchon où il n'a hamender :Del barnage de Franche qui tant fait à loer! Such claims of truth-telling are part of the poet's epic repertory. Hyperbole and epic lists are other major features in this chanson: the poet takes care to mention every knightly name that would cause a rustle of recognition among his hearers, in a tradition as old as Homer, with the result that the Chanson d'Antioche was taken as history by heralds and genealogists of a later generation. In some of its details it has won the admiration of modern historians (see links). Crusade cycles had a wide medieval audience: free translations and versions of the Chanson d'Antioche appeared in Old Occitan, Spanish, English, Dutch, and German. The Chanson d'Antioche was forgotten, until it was printed and published in 1848 by Alexis Paulin Paris, at the height of the Romantic Gothic Revival.

Hardon, Modern Catholic DictionaryWill apiel Harvard Dictionary of Music (Harvard University Press 1969), p. 310 == Origin of the term == The Harvard Dictionary of Music explains the origin of the term feria as \\"the reverse of the original meaning of L. feria, i.e., festival day. The reversal came about by extending the use of the word from Saturday to the other days, Sunday being named feria prima, Monday feria secunda, Tuesday feria tertia, etc.\\" Since in ecclesiastical Latin the names of Sunday and Saturday do not contain the word feria and are called respectively dominica and sabbatum, some use the term feria \\"to denote the days of the week with the exception of Sunday and Saturday\\",Francis Mershman did so in his article \\"Feria\\" in the 1909 Catholic Encyclopedia, in which he also interpreted the Gospel phrases una sabbati and prima sabbati (in Greek μιᾷ τῶν σαββάτων and πρώτῃ σαββάτου – Mark 16:2, 9) as meaning \\"the first day from the Sabbath\\", instead of the usual interpretation as \\"the first day of the week\\", with σάββατον meaning \\"week\\", as indicated in Strong's Concordance. in spite of the official definition given above and the actual usage in official liturgical books. The Portuguese language uses the same terminology as ecclesiastical Latin for the days of the week, calling the days from Monday to Friday segunda-feira, terça-feira, etc., but calling Saturday sábado and Sunday domingo (see Numbered days of the week). == Classification == The Roman Rite no longer distinguishes different classes of ferias (weekdays) as in the 1960 Code of Rubrics of Pope John XXIII, but it attributes different positions to them in ranking liturgical days. In the Table of Liturgical Days according to their order of precedence, attached to the Universal Norms on the Liturgical Year and the Calendar,This can be consulted, for instance, in the Roman Missal, where it is printed immediately after the General Instruction of the Roman Missal. Ash Wednesday and weekdays of Holy Week from Monday up to and including Thursday are outranked only by the Paschal Triduum, the four solemnities of Christmas, Epiphany, Ascension and Pentecost, and the Sundays of Advent, Lent, and Easter. Weekdays of Advent from 17 December up to and including 24 December and weekdays of Lent rank above memorials. Other liturgical weekdays (ferias) come last in the ranking. The Code of Rubrics of 1960 introduced a newly invented division of ferias into four classes: * First-class ferias, outranking all feasts: Ash Wednesday and all the weekdays of Holy Week; * Second-class ferias, outranking local second-class feasts and, if impeded, requiring to be commemorated: ferias of Advent from 17 December to 23 December, and Ember Days of Advent, Lent and September; * Third-class ferias: ferias in Lent from Thursday after Ash Wednesday to Saturday before the Second Sunday of the Passion (Palm Sunday) except Ember Days (these outranked third-class feasts), and ferias in Advent up to 16 December except Ember Days (these were outranked by third-class feasts); * Fourth-class ferias: all other ferias (weekday liturgies). Before 1960, the Roman Rite knew a simpler distinction between major and minor ferias. The major ferias were those of Advent and Lent, the Ember days, and the Monday of Rogation week. These had to be commemorated even on the highest feasts. All the others were minor ferias (liturgical weekdays). In addition, the major ferias of Ash Wednesday and Holy Week were privileged: these liturgies were to be celebrated no matter what feast happened to occur on those days.Catholic Encyclopedia (1909): Feria == See also == *Ranking of liturgical days in the Roman Rite *Solemnity *Memorial *Ember Days *Octave *General Roman Calendar *Liturgical year *Calendar of saints *Commemoration == References == Category:Catholic liturgy Category:History of the Catholic Church ","title":"Feria"},{"id":"1280531","text":"Mort & Phil () is a Spanish comic series, published in more than a dozen languages. It appeared for the first time in 1958 in the children's comic-book magazine Pulgarcito drawn by Francisco Ibáñez. The series features Mort (), the tall, bald master of disguise named after mortadella sausage, and his bossy partner, the shorter, pudgier Phil () Pi. Initially, they were private detectives operating as Mortadelo y Filemón, Agencia de Información, but now both serve as secret agents in the T.I.A. (a spoof on CIA), the Técnicos de Investigación Aeroterráquea (Aeroterrestrial Investigation Technicians). \\"Tía\\" is the Spanish word for \\"aunt\\". The series frequently uses slapstick humour whereby the characters constantly suffer mishaps - such as falls from heights, explosions, and being crushed by heavy objects. Thanks to cartoon physics, the effects rarely last more than one panel. ==Overview== Mort and Phil are a pair of idiots, and no matter what kind of mission they are assigned they always manage to get it wrong. The results are almost invariably extremely violent, and most often directed towards Phil. At the T.I.A. (Spanish for \\"aunt\\", a parody of the CIA), which combats \\"enemy organisations\\" like R.A.N.A. (\\"frog\\") or A.B.U.E.L.A. (\\"grandmother\\"), they interact with their boss, the bad- tempered Superintendente Vicente; with Professor Bacterio, a black-bearded, disastrous scientist parodying James Bond's Q; and with the fat, blonde secretary Ofelia, a parody of Moneypenny, whose attempts at seducing Mort or Phil always fail. Outside Spain, the series is especially popular in Germany as Clever & Smart. After the 1980s, the albums have featured current news, like computer sabotage, the AVE, Islamic terrorism, Spanish and European politics, and specials for the Olympic Games and the football World Cup. Ibáñez likes to introduce whimsies unrelated to the action, especially in front covers. Examples have included a water tap sprouting from a tree, two mice chatting, and a vase containing a foot or an eggplant. In the final page of the album El 35 aniversario (1993), featured a New York scene with an aeroplane crashing into the World Trade Center. This attracted attention after the 9/11 attacks of 2001. Ibáñez issues several albums a year. One animated series and some animated films were also produced. There are two live-action movies based on the series, one of them made in 2003 in Spain titled La gran aventura de Mortadelo y Filemón (Mort & Phil: The Big Adventure). A second movie was released in 2008, Mortadelo y Filemón. Misión: salvar la Tierra (Mort & Phil. Mission: Save Earth), marking the 50th anniversary of the series. == Characters == ===Mort (Mortadelo)=== Mort is a bald detective with pebble glasses and a long nose who usually wears a black frock coat. He is always fighting with Phil, his partner, mostly because he tends to mess things up, usually to Phil's discomfort: his profound lack of skills to make his disguises believable and common sense have often made him a danger to everyone around him. His favourite hobby is wearing all sorts of (sometimes outrageous) disguises - professional and historical clothes and gear, animals, inanimate objects, even small-sized vehicles like miniature blimps and mopeds - which he mostly dons for special tasks or when he is on the run from Phil or his boss, and which all include his signature collar which obscures part of his mouth. He holds a grudge against Bacterio because he used to have lush hair until Bacterio offered him a supposed medicine against baldness, which actually made his hair fall out. His real name, Mortadelo, comes from \\"mortadela\\", a kind of sausage. ===Phil Pi (Filemón Pi)/\\"Jefe\\"=== Mort's partner and friend. He only has two hairs on his head and wears a white shirt with a black bowtie and red trousers. He usually insults Mort because Mort is quite clumsy, but is often at the receiving end of any mishaps which come their way, mostly in the shape of their outraged boss. Mortadelo habitually addresses him as \\"Jefe\\" (Spanish for \\"chief\\" or \\"boss\\"). As the leader of the two-man team, Phil is an educated man and an expert in a variety of fields. In the movies, however, Filemón seems to be just as ditzy as Mortadelo, but his \\"bad luck streak\\" drastically increases (especially in the animated movie Mortadelo and Filemon: Mission Implausible). ===Vicente /\\"El Superintendente\\"=== Called for short \\"Súper\\" or just \\"El Súper\\", Vicente is Mort and Phil's boss. While he, as the head of the organisation, lives in splendour, indulging himself in expensive beverages and Cuban cigars, he keeps the T.I.A.'s operatives on an extremely tight budget. Vicente is bald and has a dense moustache, which makes him the object of mocking abuse by his underlings as a human walrus. He is very short-tempered and usually gets angry with Mort and Phil because they fail in their missions, making a mess of everything - occasionally at the expense of his own possessions. Just as often, however, he ends up as the one being chased by his underlings, as his frequently short-sighted assignments cause them no end of grief. He usually fails in initially introducing the missions properly to Mort and Phil, who run away to ridiculous hiding places at the first thought. He owns a variety of wild animals that he uses to coerce the pair. ===Professor Bacterio=== The T.I.A.'s black-bearded scientist and chief inventor. Mort blames him for his baldness (he had tried a new hair-strengthening concoction on Mort's then-lush mane, which made the hair fall out instead) and therefore the doctor is the unwilling prime recipient of Mort's practical jokes. His inventions, which are intended to assist Mort and Phil in their assignments, often fail quite spectacularly, mostly because they either achieve the opposite of what they are supposed to do, or work perfectly but fail at the most inconvenient moment. His name comes from bacteria. ===Ofelia=== The fat and vain secretary of Superintendente Vicente. She is still single and would like to become involved with someone (usually with Mort), but so far her attempts have been in vain. She is quite touchy her lack of luck with a relationship and being called fat; she reacts with corresponding violence when either of topics are brought up; and with her considerable weight, this is nothing to be ignored. She was the first female character created for the series. ===Irma=== The bombshell secretary of El Súper. Both Mort and Phil have a huge crush on her (much to Ofelia's chagrin), but she is not interested. This character disappeared from the series after only 24 volumes. ===F. Ibañez=== The creator of the series himself has a number of cameo appearances, either by name or in cartoon form. Mostly he is portrayed as the bald and bespectacled \\"Artist of the Nation\\", in perhaps the same league as Pablo Picasso. On several occasions, the series' characters often long to be \\"as rich as Ibáñez\\". ===\\"Rompetechos\\"=== \\"Rompetechos\\" is a small man in a black suit, with an oversized head, receding black hair and a small moustache. He is always put in as a comic relief character; his short-sightedness causes him to react in ways which causes some inconvenience to Mort and Phil if they happen to cross his path. He has his own comic series (little known outside Spain) and makes cameo appearances in Ibañez's other works. ===The Minister=== Vicente's boss (and the only person who he ever shows deference to). His appearance changes constantly throughout the series. In recent appearances has been replaced by a caricature of the President of the Government of Spain. ===Señora Superintendente=== The wife of Vicente (also with an ever-changing face). She is in charge of their household. ===Bestiájez=== The giant agent of the T.I.A. He usually has to hunt down Mort and Phil because they do not want to do their missions. A rather minor character, his face has changed many times in the past. Many other agents appear, most of them having descriptive surnames ending in \\"-ez\\" (\\"Bestiájez\\" comes from \\"bestia\\", beast). ===Tete Cohete=== Tete Cohete (lit. \\"Tete Rocket\\") is a fifteen-year-old boy who is an enthusiastic amateur mechanic and inventor. He habitually tinkers with mechanical devices, turning many of them into rocket-powered (hence his name) or hazardous contraptions, and because he neglects to warn other people about his modifications, often causes a lot of grief to any adults in his vicinity. Tete Cohete was the main protagonist for another Ibáñez comic series which ran from 1981 to 1986. He makes infrequent cameos in other Ibáñez titles, particularly Mortadelo y Filemón and El botones Sacarino. ===Parody characters=== There are also parodies of numerous celebrities and political personalities such as Ronald Reagan, José María Aznar or (in three albums in 2017) Donald Trump. ==Albums== In order of publication: ===Between 1969 and 1971=== *El sulfato atómico *Contra el \\"gang\\" del Chicharrón *Safari callejero *Valor y... ¡al toro! *El caso del bacalao *Chapeau el \\"esmirriau\\" *La máquina del cambiazo *La caja de los diez cerrojos *¡Magín \\"el mago\\"! *¡A la caza del cuadro! ===Between 1972 and 1974=== *Los inventos del profesor Bacterio *Gatolandia 76 *Operación: ¡Bomba! *Los diamantes de la gran duquesa *El otro \\"yo\\" del profesor Bacterio *Los monstruos *El elixir de la vida *El circo *El antídoto *Los invasores *Los cacharros majaretas *¡A las armas! *El plano de Alí-Gusa-No ===Between 1975 and 1976=== *¡Pánico en el zoo! *Concurso- oposición *Los mercenarios *Objetivo: eliminar al Rana *Misión de perros *Los secuestradores *La gallina de los huevos de oro *El caso del calcetín ===Between 1977 and 1979=== *El brujo *¡Soborno! *Los guardaespaldas *Mundial 78 *Los gamberros *Contrabando *La máquina de copiar gente *Los \\"bomberos\\" *El transformador metabólico *¡A por el niño! *La gente de Vicente *Secuestro aéreo ===Between 1980 and 1981=== *Olimpiada 1980 *La elasticina *Kilociclos asesinos *Ladrones de coches *Lo que el viento se dejó *La brigada bichera *Tete Cohete *En marcha el mundial 82 *El caso de los señores pequeñitos ===Between 1982 and 1983=== *En Alemania *Queda inaugurado el mundial 82 *El balón catastrófico *Billy \\"El Horrendo\\" *¡Hay un traidor en la T.I.A.! *El bacilón *El ascenso ===Between 1984 and 1985=== *La estatua de la libertad *Testigo de cargo *Los Ángeles 84 *El cacao espacial *El preboste de seguridad *El cochecito leré ===Between 1986 and 1987=== *¡Terroristas! *El huerto siniestro *El estropicio metereológico *Los que volvieron de \\"allá\\" *Seúl 88 ===Between 1988 and 1989=== *La perra de las galaxias *Los sobrinetes *Los superpoderes *Las tacillas volantes *La cochinadita nuclear *Armas con bicho *La maldición gitana *El candidato *La Gomeztroika *El ansia de poder *¡...Va la T.I.A. y se pone al día! ===Between 1990 and 1992=== *El profeta Jeremías *El premio No-Vel *El rescate botarate *El gran sarao *Los espantajomanes *El inspector general *El atasco de incluencias *La crisis del golfo *Barcelona 92 *El caso del señor-probeta *La tergiversicina *Las embajadas chifladas *El racista *El quinto centenario *El S.O.E. *El 35 aniversario ===Between 1993 and 1994=== *El señor todoquisque *Maastricht ¡...Jesús! *El nuevo \\"cate\\" *Robots bestiajos *Clínicas antibirria *Dinosaurios *La ruta del yerbajo *Mundial 94 *El pinchazo telefónico *¡Pesadillaaa...! *Corrupción a mogollón ===Between 1995 and 1996=== *¡Timazo al canto! *Animalada *20.000 leguas de viaje sibilino *¡Silencio, se rueda! *El disfraz, cosa falaz... *La prensa cardiovascular *El jurado popular *El ángel de la guarda *Atlanta 96 *100 años de cómic *Expediente J *El trastomóvil ===Between 1997 and 1998=== *¡Desastre! *Bye bye, Hong-Kong! *Esos kilitos malditos *Los verdes *Las vacas chaladas *Mundial 98 *La banda de los guiris *Su vida privada *¡Deportes de espanto! *El espeluznante doctor Bíchez ===Between 1999 and 2000=== *El óscar del moro *La maldita maquinita *El tirano *La M.I.E.R. *Impeachment! *De los ochenta p´arriba... *Siglo XX, ¡qué progreso! *Sydney 2000 *La vuelta *La sirenita *Fórmula uno ===Between 2001 and 2003=== *La rehabilitación esa *Los vikingos *¡Llegó el euro! *El ordenador... ¡qué horror! *¡Okupas! *Mundial 2002 *¡Misión triunfo! *¡El estrellato! *¡Mascotas! *Parque de atracciones *El UVA (Ultraloca Velocidad Automotora) ===Between 2004 and 2008=== *¡Rapto tremendo! *Atenas 2004 *El señor de los ladrillos *Mortadelo de la Mancha *Prohibido fumar *¡El carnet al punto! *El kamikaze Regúlez *Mundial 2006 *¡Bajo el bramido del trueno! *El dopaje...¡qué potaje! *Euro Basket 2007 *¡...Y van 50 tacos! *¡Venganza cincuentona! *¡El dos de mayo! *Pekín 2008 *Gasolina... ¡la ruina! ===Between 2009 and 2017=== *¡En la Luna! *¡Por Isis, llegó la crisis! *Nuestro antepasado, El Mico *La gripe \\"U\\" *Mundial 2010 *Marrullería en la Alcaldía *Chernobil... ¡Qué cuchitril! *¡A reciclar se ha dicho! *Jubilación... ¡a los noventa! *La bombilla... ¡chao, chiquilla! *Londres 2012 *¡Espías! *El coche eléctrico *¡Brommm! *La litrona...¡vaya mona! *Mundial 2014 *¡Tijeretazo! *Contra Jimmy el Cachondo *El Tesorero *¡Elecciones! *Río 2016 *¡El capo se escapa! *Sueldecitos más bien bajitos *Drones Matones *¡Miseria, La Bacteria! *El 60 Aniversario ===Between 2018 and 2020=== *Mundial 2018 *Por el Olimpo ese *Urgencias del Hospital... ¡Fatal! *Da Vinci, el Pintamona...

It also had an English dub that only released in the United Kingdom. ==Film adaptations== Between 1965 and 1970, Rafael Vara directed 16 short animated films which were united in two films (Festival de Mortadelo y Filemón and Segundo festival de Mortadelo y Filemón). In 1970 he made a proper feature film, El armario del tiempo. There are two live action films based on the comic: Mortadelo & Filemon: The Big Adventure by Javier Fesser (2003) and Mort & Phil. Mission: Save Earth by Miguel Bardem (2008). Javier Fesser directed the 3D animated film Mortadelo and Filemon: Mission Implausible (2014). ==Video game adaptation== A video game based on Mort & Phil, entitled El sulfato atómico, was developed by the Spanish company Alcachofa Soft, creator of Drascula: The Vampire Strikes Back. It sold above 40,000 units. According to its lead designer, it was developed on a small budget. ==In other languages== *Afrikaans: Rommel en Drommel *Arabic: شاطر و ماكر (Smart and Cunning) *Catalan: Mortadel·lo i Filemó *Chinese: 特工二人组 *Czech: Clever & Smart *Danish: Flip og Flop *Dutch: Paling en Ko *English: Mort & Phil *French: Mortadel et Filémon (formerly also Futt et Fil) *German: Clever & Smart (formerly also Flip & Flap) *Greek: Αντιρίξ και Συμφωνίξ (Antirix kai Symfonix; Antirix \\"He who disagrees\\", Symfonix \\"He who agrees\\") *Hungarian: Mortadelo és Filemón *Italian: Mortadello e Polpetta *Japanese: モートとフィル *Norwegian: Flipp og Flopp (earliest pocket editions), Clever & Smart *Polish: Mortadelo i Filemon *Portuguese: Mortadelo e Salaminho (Brazil), Mortadela e Salamão (Portugal) *Romanian: Mortadelo și Filemon *Russian: Морт и Фил (Мортадело и Филемон) (Mort i Fil (Mortadelo i Filemon)) *Slovak: Clever & Smart *Slovene: Mortadelc pa File *Swedish: Flink & Fummel *Turkish: Dörtgöz ile Dazlak *Finnish: Älli ja Tälli (earlier Nopsa ja Näpsä) *Serbo-Croatian: Zriki Švargla i Šule Globus ==See also== *Francisco Ibáñez *Spanish comics *Spy vs. Spy ==References== ==External links== * Category:1958 comics debuts Category:Fictional Spanish people Category:Comics adapted into television series Category:Comics adapted into video games ","title":"Mort &amp; Phil"},{"id":"1280543","text":"The Kittanning Expedition, also known as the Armstrong Expedition or the Battle of Kittanning, was a raid during the French and Indian War that led to the destruction of the American Indian village of Kittanning, which had served as a staging point for attacks by Delaware (Lenape) warriors against colonists in the British Province of Pennsylvania. Commanded by Lieutenant Colonel John Armstrong, this raid deep into hostile territory was the only major expedition carried out by Pennsylvania Provincial troops during a brutal backcountry war. Early on September 8, 1756, they launched a surprise attack on the Indian village. ==Background== Although it eventually became a worldwide conflict known as the Seven Years' War, the French and Indian War began on the Pennsylvania frontier as a struggle for control of the Ohio Country. With the surrender of George Washington at Fort Necessity in 1754 and Braddock's defeat in 1755, the settlers on the Pennsylvania frontier were without professional military protection, and scrambled to organize a defense. The French-allied Indians who had defeated General Edward Braddock at the Monongahela were primarily from the Great Lakes region to the north. The local Indians, mostly Delaware and Shawnee who had migrated to the area after white colonists had settled their lands to the east, had waited to see who would win the contest-- they could not risk siding with the loser. With Fort Duquesne now secured, the victorious French encouraged the Delaware and Shawnee to \\"take up the hatchet\\" against those who had taken their land. Beginning about October 1755, Delaware and Shawnee war parties, often with French cooperation, began raiding settlements in Pennsylvania. Although European-Americans also waged war with cruelty, they found Indian warfare particularly brutal and frightening. Notable among the Indian raiders were the Delaware war leaders Shingas and Captain Jacobs, both of whom lived at Kittanning. The colonial governments of Pennsylvania and Virginia offered rewards for their scalps. Captain Jacobs was on an expedition led by Louis Coulon de Villiers that descended on Fort Granville (near present-day Lewistown) on the morning of August 2, 1756. The attackers were held off, but the garrison commander was killed, and his second in command surrendered the garrison, including the women and children, the next morning.O'Meara, p. 174 The commander's brother, Lieutenant Colonel John Armstrong, immediately organized an expedition against Kittanning in response. ==Raid== Armstrong led 300 Pennsylvania Provincial soldiers from Fort Shirley on August 31. By September 7, the column had reached the vicinity of Kittanning. Signs of a small Indian camp prompted Colonel Armstrong to detach a dozen men under Lieutenant James Hogg to monitor it while the column moved on toward the village.Fisher, p. 10 The next morning Armstrong launched a surprise attack on the village. Many of the Kittanning residents fled, but Captain Jacobs put up a defense, holing up with his wife and family inside their home. When he refused to surrender, his house and others were set on fire, touching off gunpowder that had been stored inside. Some buildings exploded, and pieces of Indian bodies flew high into the air and landed in a nearby cornfield.Fisher, pp. 11-12 Captain Jacobs was killed and scalped after jumping from his home in an attempt to escape the flames. The battle ended when the entire village was engulfed in flames.Fischer, p. 12 Prisoners informed Armstrong that a party of 24 men had left the day before in advance of another planned raid. This news caused Armstrong some concern over the fate of Lieutenant Hogg, so he precipitately ordered a withdrawal. They were met after several miles by a mortally wounded Hogg, who reported that his force had been attacked by a larger Indian force. Some of his men had immediately fled, and most of the rest had been killed. By September 13, Armstrong and his remaining force had returned to Fort Loudon.Fisher, p. 13 According to Armstrong's report, he took 11 scalps and freed 11 prisoners, mostly women and children. He estimated that his men killed between 30 and 40 Indians. Many of the white captives were ferried across the Allegheny River in canoes, then taken by foot over trails into Ohio, where they assimilated into the tribes. Many were not rescued until Henry Bouquet brought them back from Ohio to Pennsylvania in 1764. ==Aftermath== Historian Fred Anderson notes that equivalent raids by Indians on Pennsylvania villages were usually labeled massacres, and that the Indians considered the raid to be one.Anderson, Crucible of War, p. 163 The destruction of Kittanning was hailed as a victory in Pennsylvania, and Armstrong was known afterwards as the \\"Hero of Kittanning\\". He and his men collected the \\"scalp bounty\\" that had been placed on Captain Jacobs.Anderson, Crucible of War, p. 164 However, the victory had limitations: the attackers suffered more casualties than they inflicted, and most of the villagers escaped, taking with them almost all of the prisoners that had been held in the village.Hunter, Pennsylvania Frontier, p. 405–410 The expedition also probably aggravated the frontier war; subsequent Indian raids that autumn were fiercer than ever. The Kittanning raid revealed to the village's inhabitants their vulnerability, and many moved to more secure areas. A peace faction led by Shingas's brother Tamaqua soon came to the forefront.McConnell, p. 126 Tamaqua eventually made peace with Pennsylvania in the Treaty of Easton, which enabled the British under General John Forbes to successfully mount an expedition in 1758 that drove the French from Fort Duquesne. ==Notes== ==References== * * Crytzer, Brady J.

His father left Prague in the 1930s to avoid rising fascism; his grandparents disappeared in the 1950s after the Communists took charge. His mother's family owned a banana plantation in the island city of Santa Cruz de la Palma, where he grew up alongside his sister, Evangelina. He was homeschooled when he was a child. After he grew up, he attended a Swiss boarding school. Later, his parents wanted him to be a diplomat and enrolled him at the University of Geneva majoring in Politics and Law. However, Blahnik changed his majors to Literature and Architecture. In 1965, he got his degree and moved to Paris to study art at the École des Beaux-Arts and Stage Set Design at the Louvre Art School, all while working at a vintage clothing shop.Manolo Blahnik Design Museum Retrieved 7 August 2008 In 1969, he moved to London to work as a buyer at fashion boutique \\"Feathers\\" and wrote for L’Uomo Vogue, an Italian men's version of Vogue. In 1969, Blahnik had a chance to meet Diana Vreeland, the editor-in-chief of U.S Vogue, while he was traveling in New York. He then presented his portfolio of fashions and set designs to Vreeland, at which point she looked him straight in the eye and said, \\"Young man, make things, make accessories, make shoes.\\" She admired his shoe sketches and advised him to concentrate on designing footwear. Blahnik followed her advice and worked on designing shoes.Morton, Camilla (2011). Manolo Blahnik and the Tale of the Elves and the Shoemaker, p. 101. Harper Entertainment. . In 1971, Ossie Clark invited him to create shoes for his runway show, he also designed shoes for other London fashion designers, such as Jean Muir and Zandra Rhodes. From 1971, Blahnik was selling Manolo Blahnik shoes for Zapata. With a loan of £2,000, Blahnik bought the Zapata Shoe Company from its owner and opened his own boutique. In 1974, Blahnik became the second man ever to be featured on the cover of U.K. Vogue (after Helmut Berger). In 1977, Blahnik created his first American collection. These were sold in 1978 through Bloomingdales. Blahnik opened his first boutique in the US in 1979. Manolo Blahnik's flagship store remains in Old Church Street in the Chelsea district of London. Blahnik's boutiques are located in London, New York, Geneva, Madrid, Barcelona, Moscow, Dubai, Abu Dhabi, Doha, Hong Kong, Kuala Lumpur, Seoul, Singapore, Tokyo, and Taipei. Bloomingdales (for which he created his first American collection), Nordstrom, Neiman Marcus, Barneys, Bergdorf Goodman and Saks Fifth Avenue carry his line in the United States and newly opened in Dubai Mall. The company has signed a long-term deal with the shoewear retailer Kurt Geiger to operate Manolo Blahnik boutiques. In 2000, Blahnik, together with Neiman Marcus, launched the first commercial virtual reality online showroom featuring 3D models of his shoes. The entire collection was sold out online within three weeks. Blahnik was elevated to the International Best Dressed List Hall of Fame in 1987. In 2007, Blahnik was appointed as an honorary Commander of the Order of the British Empire for his service to the British fashion industry. Blahnik currently resides in Bath, United Kingdom and was awarded an honorary degree from Bath Spa University in July 2012.

Blahnik and his family often travelled to Paris and Madrid ordering clothes. His mother was always dissatisfied with the shoes from their hometown, so she made her own. She learned the rudiments of her craft from a local Canary Island cobbler and as a boy, Blahnik loved to watch his mother when she made beautiful shoes.

He learned the skills by visiting shoe factories and talking to pattern cutters, technicians, and machine operators. At first, he designed men's footwear, but he immediately found that men's shoe design limited his imagination and lacked the element of fashion so he focussed on woman's shoes. When mainstream shoe styles were still dominated by clunky platforms in the 1970s, he revived the sleek stiletto heel, which has since become a classic. Also, he dislikes wedges and believes in the power of heels and the sex appeal they convey. Jo Craven. \\"Manolo Blahnik\\".

It first appeared in print in Harper's Magazine in December 1907 and January 1908, and was published in book form with some revisions in 1909. This was the last story published by Twain during his life.Ketterer, David. Tales of Wonder - Notes, p. ix-x (1984) ==Description and plot outline== The story follows Captain Elias Stormfield on his decades long cosmic journey to Heaven; his accidental misplacement after racing a comet; his short-lived interest in singing and playing the harp (generated by his preconceptions of heaven); and the general obsession of souls with the celebrities of Heaven such as Adam, Moses, and Elijah, who according to Twain become as distant to most people in Heaven as living celebrities are on Earth (an early parody of celebrity culture). Twain uses this story to show his view that the common conception of Heaven is ludicrous, and points out the incongruities of such beliefs with his characteristic adroit usage of hyperbole. Much of the story's description is given by the character Sandy McWilliams, a cranberry farmer who is very experienced in the ways of Heaven. Sandy gives Stormfield, a newcomer, the description in the form of a conversational question-and-answer session. The Heaven described by him is similar to the conventional Christian Heaven, but includes a larger version of all the locations on Earth, as well as of everywhere in the universe (which mention of, albeit as a backdrop, is the last science fiction element). All sentient life-forms travel to Heaven, often through interplanetary or interstellar space, and land at a particular gate (which are without number), which is reserved for people from that originating planet. Each newcomer must then give his name and planet of origin to a gatekeeper, who sends him in to Heaven. Once inside, the person spends eternity living as it thinks fit, usually according to its true (sometimes undiscovered) talent. According to one of the characters, a cobbler who \\"has the soul of a poet in him won't have to make shoes here,\\" implying that he would instead turn to poetry and achieve perfection in it. On special occasions a procession of the greatest people in history is formed; on this particular occasion this includes Buddha, William Shakespeare, Homer, Muhammed, Daniel, Ezekiel, and Jeremiah plus several otherwise unknown people whose talents far exceeded those of the world's pivotal figures, but who were never famous on Earth. As Stormfield proceeds through Heaven he learns that the conventional image of angels as winged, white-robed figures bearing haloes, harps, and palm leaves is a mere illusion generated for the benefit of humans, who mistake \\"figurative language\\" for accurate description (the wings are part of their uniforms, and not functionally wings); that all of Heaven's denizens choose their ages, thus aligning themselves with the time of life at which they were most content; that anything desired is awarded to its seeker, if it does not violate any prohibition; that the prohibitions themselves are different from those envisioned on Earth; that each of the Earth-like regions of Heaven includes every human being who has ever lived on it; that families are not always together forever, because of decisions made by those who have died first; that white-skinned people are a minority in Heaven; that kings are not kings in Heaven (Charles II is a comedian while Henry VI has a religious book-stand), etc. ==Background== Although not published until 1907 in Harper's Magazine, followed by a slim book version with some revisions in 1909, the story was quite old. The original manuscript dated back perhaps as far as 1868, and an 1873 version has survived. The story was revised several times, and chapters 3 and 4 of the manuscript became the Harper's story.Autobiography of Mark Twain, Volume 1, p. 31 (2010) Longer versions of the manuscript have subsequently been published, including one edited by Dixon Wector which appeared as part of Report from Paradise (1952), and in part 1 of Mark Twain's Quarrel with Heaven: \\"Captain Stormfield's Visit to Heaven\\" And Other Sketches\\" (Ray B. Browne, ed., 1970). Twain claimed that the story in its early version was a satire of Elizabeth Stuart Phelps Ward's The Gates Ajar, a very popular novel published in 1868.Baetzhold, Howard G. & Joseph B. McCulloch (eds.) The Bible According to Mark Twain, p. 130 (1995) ==Cultural references== The story mentions several public figures who were widely known at the time of first publication, but are not as well known today. These include Moody and Sankey, Charles Peace, Thomas De Witt Talmage and Prince Gortschakoff. ==References== ==External links== * Category:1909 short stories Category:Short stories by Mark Twain Category:Works originally published in Harper's Magazine Category:Harper & Brothers books Category:Fictional comets Category:Cultural depictions of Adam and Eve Category:Cultural depictions of Moses Category:Cultural depictions of Muhammad Category:Cultural depictions of William Shakespeare Category:Heaven in popular culture ","title":"Captain Stormfield's Visit to Heaven"},{"id":"1280554","text":"Otilio Warrington, known popularly as Bizcocho (born February 26, 1944) is a comedian, best known for his roles of \\"Bizcocho\\" and \\"Cuca Gómez\\". ==Early years== Warrington was born in the Barrio Obrero area of Santurce, Puerto Rico. When he was six years old, his family moved to the Lloréns Torres public housing project. There he lived for the next 25 years. Warrington left school when he was a teenager and made a living by polishing shoes at a local barbershop. One of the barbershop's regular customers was Tommy Muñiz, a television show producer. One day Warrington asked Muñiz for a job in television but was told to get some more education and come back to him after he graduated.Puerto Rico Popular Culture ==Bizcocho== Encouraged by Mr. Muñiz's challenge, Warrington returned to school and graduated from San Juan's Central High School in 1960; he then went back to Mr. Muñiz to take him up on his earlier offer. Tommy Muñiz kept his word and let Otilio assist in the TV show \\"El Special de Corona\\" (The Corona Special). Thus, Warrington became the \\"first\\" black Puerto Rican male comedian to be regularly featured on a local TV program. One of the show's sections involved a group of \\"wacky\\" soldiers and included José Miguel Agrelot and Jacobo Morales. When Otilio joined the group, Morales baptized him as \\"Soldier Bizcocho\\" (Cake), a nickname that would remain with him for the rest of his life. Muñiz saw potential in Otilio and paid for his college education; as a result Warrington attended the University of Puerto Rico graduating with an associate degree in Television Direction and Production. After graduation Otilio participated in many local TV programs such as: \\"Ja ja ji ji jo jo con Agrelot\\" and \\"El Show del Mediodía\\" (The Noon Show). Warrington joined ASTRA productions in the 1970s and after working for different shows landed a spot in \\" Cogiendo Impulso\\", which was transmitted on Channel 11; it was here that he developed the characters of \\"Juancito\\" and \\"Pito\\". In (1979) he participated in the movie production of Jacobo Morales' Díos los Cría (And God raised them) alongside Norma Candal, Gladys Rodríguez, Esther Sandoval and Alicia Moreda.Eddie Miró ==Cuca Gómez== Later in 1980, while working in the comedy Kakukómicos, Warrington developed the character of \\"Cuca Gómez\\", a cross-dressing role that would help settle Warrington's fame as a comedian. The plot involved a female cosmetologist who was involved in all kinds of hilarious and off-the-wall situations. \\"Cuca Gómez\\" became very popular in Puerto Rico and soon appeared in other TV shows as a special guest star. In 1985, Warrington was named \\"Mr. Television\\" by the Artistic Association of Puerto Rico.Imdb ==Music== In 1986, Pijuán, a Puerto Rican musician, in conjunction with Bizcocho created an album called Bizcocho & Pijuán \\"El premio 'Gordo' del Sabor\\", under Private Ranch Records. ==Later years== In the 1990s, Warrington starred in his own TV show, Mi Familia (My Family), where he acted as \\"Arcadio\\". He also worked in El Show de las 12 (The 12 o'clock Show) acting as \\"Don Ambrosio\\" and \\"Yeyito\\". ==Other shows== Among the shows which Warrington has hosted are Friendo y Comiendo alongside Luis Antonio Cosme, Café con Leche alongside Lily García and Yan Ruíz and a television program transmitted through WAPA-TV called La Cocina Caliente de Luis y Bizcocho (Luis and Bizcocho's Hot Kitchen), alongside Luisito Vigoreaux; Hola Gente alongside Alexandra Fuentes and Gerardo Ortiz; and together with Lily and Yan a morning show called \\"¡Buenos Días!\\" (Good Morning!) ==See also== *List of Puerto Ricans *Black history in Puerto Rico *Pijuan ==References== ==External links== * La Comedia Category:1944 births Category:Living people Category:Puerto Rican comedians Category:People from Santurce, Puerto Rico ","title":"Otilio Warrington"},{"id":"1280566","text":"Roughing It is a book of semi-autobiographical travel literature by Mark Twain. It was written in 1870-71 and published in 1872, as a prequel to his first travel book The Innocents Abroad (1869). Roughing It is dedicated to Twain's mining companion Calvin H. Higbie, later a civil engineer who died in 1914. The book follows the travels of young Mark Twain through the Wild West during the years 1861-1867\\\\. After a brief stint as a Confederate cavalry militiaman (not included in the account), he joined his brother Orion Clemens, who had been appointed Secretary of the Nevada Territory, on a stagecoach journey west. Twain consulted his brother's diary to refresh his memory and borrowed heavily from his active imagination for many stories in the book. Roughing It illustrates many of Twain's early adventures, including a visit to Salt Lake City, gold and silver prospecting, real-estate speculation, a journey to the Kingdom of Hawaii, and his beginnings as a writer. This memoir provides examples of Twain's rough-hewn humor, which would become a staple of his writing in such later books as Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (1884), The Adventures of Tom Sawyer (1876), and A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court (1889). ==In popular culture== U.S. astronauts Frank Borman and Jim Lovell read Roughing It aloud to pass the time aboard NASA's Gemini VII, a 14-day-long Earth orbital mission in December 1965. In Lords of St. Thomas, a 2018 historical novel set in St. Thomas, Nevada, the main character \\"Little\\" Henry Lord is reading Roughing It when he learns that his father has fallen from the Hoover Dam. ==Adaptations== Various sections of Roughing It were borrowed by television series such as Bonanza. In 1960, an hour-long adaptation was broadcast on NBC starring Andrew Prine and James Daly. A four- hour 2002 mini-series adaptation was broadcast on Hallmark Channel. Directed by Charles Martin Smith, it starred James Garner as an elderly Samuel Clemens and Robin Dunne as a young Clemens. Roughing It recounts midway through the book that a rich \\"blind lead\\" gold strike was discovered and claimed by a partnership of Twain, Calvin Higbie, and a mine foreman A.D. Allen, giving them well-founded hopes of being millionaires. To establish a claim, it was required that any or all of the claimants do a reasonable amount of work on the claimed strike within ten days. Due to chance happenings and failed communications between the three, the work requirement was left unfulfilled, and the forfeited but rich claim was quickly seized by others ten days after it was discovered. In the dedication of the book, Twain refers to Higbie as an \\"Honest Man, a Genial Comrade, and a Steadfast Friend … dedicated in Memory of the Curious Time When We Two Were Millionaires for Ten Days\\". The prospecting story is also covered in a 1968 episode of the syndicated television anthology series Death Valley Days, hosted by Robert Taylor. In the television dramatization, Tom Skerritt plays Twain, and Dabney Coleman was cast as Higbie. ==Notes* Text plus additional background material. * Category:1872 books Category:Books by Mark Twain Category:Latter Day Saints in popular culture Category:American travel books Category:American frontier Category:American autobiographies ","title":"Roughing It"},{"id":"1280581","text":"Aristotle's Poetics The term hamartia derives from the Greek ἁμαρτία, from ἁμαρτάνειν hamartánein, which means \\"to miss the mark\\" or \\"to err\\".\\"Hamartia\\".

Web. Érudit. 1 Nov 2014. ==Definition== Hamartia as it pertains to dramatic literature was first used by Aristotle in his Poetics. In tragedy, hamartia is commonly understood to refer to the protagonist's error or tragic flaw that leads to a chain of plot actions culminating in a reversal from felicity to disaster. What qualifies as the error or flaw can include an error resulting from ignorance, an error of judgement, a flaw in character, or a wrongdoing. The spectrum of meanings has invited debate among critics and scholars and different interpretations among dramatists. == In Aristotle's Poetics == thumbA list of the six parts of Aristotle's Greek tragedy \\"Aristotle's Tragic Plot Structure\\"—click to view a larger version Hamartia is first described in the subject of literary criticism by Aristotle in his Poetics. The source of hamartia is at the juncture between character and the character's actions or behaviors as described by Aristotle. In his introduction to the S. H. Butcher translation of Poetics, Francis Fergusson describes hamartia as the inner quality that initiates, as in Dante's words, a \\"movement of spirit\\" within the protagonist to commit actions which drive the plot towards its tragic end, inspiring in the audience a build of pity and fear that leads to a purgation of those emotions, or catharsis.Fergusson 8Internet Classics Archive by Daniel C. Stevenson, Web Atomics. Web. 11 Dec. 2014. Jules Brody, however, argues that \\"it is the height of irony that the idea of the tragic flaw should have had its origin in the Aristotelian notion of hamartia. Whatever this problematic word may be taken to mean, it has nothing to do with such ideas as fault, vice, guilt, moral deficiency, or the like. Hamartia is a morally neutral non-normative term, derived from the verb hamartano, meaning 'to miss the mark', 'to fall short of an objective'. And by extension: to reach one destination rather than the intended one; to make a mistake, not in the sense of a moral failure, but in the nonjudgmental sense of taking one thing for another, taking something for its opposite. Hamartia may betoken an error of discernment due to ignorance, to the lack of an essential piece of information. Finally, hamartia may be viewed simply as an act which, for whatever reason, ends in failure rather than success.\\"Jules Brody, \\"Fate, Philology, Freud,\\" Philosophy and Literature 38.1 (April 2014): 23. In a Greek tragedy, for a story to be \\"of adequate magnitude\\" it involves characters of high rank, prestige, or good fortune. If the protagonist is too worthy of esteem, or too wicked, his/her change of fortune will not evoke the ideal proportion of pity and fear necessary for catharsis. Here Aristotle describes hamartia as the quality of a tragic hero that generates that optimal balance. == In Christian theology == Hamartia is also used in Christian theology because of its use in the Septuagint and New Testament. The Hebrew (chatá) and its Greek equivalent (àµaρtίa/hamartia) both mean \\"missing the mark\\" or \\"off the mark\\".Strong's, bibclassic.orgStrong's, blueletterbible.orgLegal Dictionary, thefreedictionary.com There are four basic usages for hamartia: # Hamartia is sometimes used to mean acts of sin \\"by omission or commission in thought and feeling or in speech and actions\\" as in Romans 5:12, \\"all have sinned\\".Thayer, J. H. Greek-English Lexicon of the New Testament (Harper, 1887), s.v. ?µa?t?a online at Google Books # Hamartia is sometimes applied to the fall of man from original righteousness that resulted in humanity's innate propensity for sin, that is original sin.Cooper, Eugene \\"Sarx and Sin in Pauline Theology\\" in Laval théologique et philosophique. 29.3 (1973) 243-255.

Bromiley, Theological Dictionary of the New Testament: Abridged in One Volume (Eerdmans, 1985), 48. For example, Romans 6:20 speaks of being enslaved to hamartia (sin). == Tragic flaw, tragic error, and divine intervention == Aristotle mentions hamartia in Poetics. He argues that it is a powerful device to have a story begin with a rich and powerful hero, neither exceptionally virtuous nor villainous, who then falls into misfortune by a mistake or error (hamartia). Discussion among scholars centers mainly on the degree to which hamartia is defined as tragic flaw or tragic error. ===Critical argument for flaw=== Poetic justice describes an obligation of the dramatic poet, along with philosophers and priests, to see that their work promotes moral behavior.Burnley Jones and Nicol, 125 18th-century French dramatic style honored that obligation with the use of hamartia as a vice to be punishedBurnley Jones and Nicol,12,125Thomas Rymer. (2014). In Encyclopædia Britannica. Retrieved from http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/514581/Thomas-Rymer Phèdre, Racine's adaptation of Euripides' Hippolytus, is an example of French Neoclassical use of hamartia as a means of punishing vice.Worthen, B.

Web. 11 Dec. 2014. http://www.bartleby.com/26/3/ Jean Racine says in his Preface to Phèdre, as translated by R.C. Knight: The play is a tragic story about a royal family.

Web. 8 Dec. 2014. http://www.bartleby.com/8/7/ ===Critical argument for error=== In her 1963 Modern Language Review article, The Tragic Flaw: Is it a Tragic Error?, Isabel Hyde traces the twentieth-century history of hamartia as tragic flaw, which she argues is an incorrect interpretation. Hyde draws upon the language in Butcher's interpretation of Poetics regarding hamartia as both error and \\"defect in character\\". Hyde points out a footnote in which Butcher qualifies his second definition by saying it is not a \\"natural\\" expression to describe a flaw in behavior.Butcher, Samuel H., Aristotle’s Theory of Poetry and Fine Art, New York 41911 Hyde calls upon another description from A.C. Bradley's Shakespearean Tragedy of 1904 which she contends is misleading: Hyde goes on to elucidate interpretive pitfalls of treating hamartia as tragic flaw by tracing the tragic flaw argument through several examples from well-known tragedies including Hamlet and Oedipus the King. Hyde observes that students often state \\"thinking too much\\" as Hamlet's tragic flaw upon which his death in the story depends. That idea does not, however, offer explanation for the moments when Hamlet does act impulsively and violently. It also embarks down a trail of logic that suggests he ought to have murdered Claudius right away to avoid tragedy, which Hyde asserts is problematic. In Oedipus the King, she observes that the ideas of Oedipus' hasty behavior at the crossroads or his trust in his intellect as being the qualities upon which the change of fortune relies is incomplete. Instead, to focus on his ignorance of the true identity of his parents as the foundation of his downfall takes into account all of his decisions that lead to the tragic end. Rather than a flaw in character, error, in Oedipus' case based upon lack of information, is the more complete interpretation. In his 1978 Classical World article Hamartia, Atë, and Oedipus, Leon Golden compares scholarship that examines where to place hamartia's definition along a spectrum connecting the moral, flaw, and the intellectual, error. His goal is to revisit the role, if any, Atë, or divine intervention, plays in hamartia. The Butcher translation of \\"Poetics\\" references hamartia as both a \\"single great error\\", and \\"a single great defect in character\\", prompting critics to raise arguments. Mid-twentieth-century scholar Phillip W. Harsh sees hamartia as tragic flaw, observing that Oedipus assumes some moral ownership of his demise when he reacts excessively with rage and murder to the encounter at the crossroads.Golden, Leon. \\"Hamartia, Ate, and Oedipus\\". The Classical World, 72.1 (Sep., 1978), 3-12. Baltimore: Johns Hopkins UP. Web. 7 Dec. 2014. https://www.jstor.org/stable/4348969 Van Braam, on the other hand, notes of Oedipus' hamartia, \\"no specific sin attaching to him as an individual, but the universally human one of blindly following the light of one's own intellect.\\"P. van Braam, \\"Aristotle's Use of Ἁμαρτία\\" The Classical Quarterly, 6.4 (Oct., 1912), 266-272. London: Cambridge UP. Web. 7 Dec. 2014. https://www.jstor.org/stable/635946 He adds that a defining feature of tragedy is that the sufferer must be the agent of his own suffering by no conscious moral failing on his part in order to create a tragic irony. O. Hey's observations fall into this camp as well. He notes that the term refers to an action that is carried out in good moral faith by the protagonist, but as he has been deprived of key pieces of information, the action brings disastrous results.Hey, O. \\"ἁμαρτία Zur Bedeutungsgeschichte des Wortes\\" Philologus 83 1-15, (1928). Web. 7 Dec. 2014. J.M. Bremer also conducted a thorough study of hamartia in Greek thought, focusing on its usage in Aristotle and Homer. His findings lead him, like Hyde, to cite hamartia as an intellectual error rather than a moral failing.Bremer, J.M. \\"Hamartia.\\" Tragic Error in the Poetics of Aristotle and in Greek Tragedy. Amsterdam, Adolf M. Hakkert, 1969. ===Critical arguments on divine intervention=== J.M. Bremer and Dawe both conclude that the will of the gods may factor into Aristotelian hamartia. Golden disagrees.Golden, 6 Bremer observes that the Messenger in Oedipus Rex says, \\"He was raging - one of the dark powers pointing the way, ...someone, something leading him on - he hurled at the twin doors and bending the bolts back out of their sockets, crashed through the chamber,\\".Worthen, 85 Bremer cites Sophocles' mention of Oedipus being possessed by \\"dark powers\\" as evidence of guidance from either divine or daemonic force. Dawe's argument centers around tragic dramatists' four areas from which a protagonist's demise can originate. The first is fate, the second is wrath of an angry god, the third comes from a human enemy, and the last is the protagonist's frailty or error. Dawe contends that the tragic dénouement can be the result of a divine plan as long as plot action begets plot action in accordance with Aristotle. Golden cites Van Braam's notion of Oedipus committing a tragic error by trusting his own intellect in spite of Tiresias' warning as the argument for human error over divine manipulation. Golden concludes that hamartia principally refers to a matter of intellect, although it may include elements of morality. What his study asserts is separate from hamartia, in a view that conflicts with Dawe's and Bremer's, is the concept of divine retribution.Golden, 10 ==See also== ==References== ===Inline citations=== ===Sources referenced=== *Bremer, J.M. \\"Hamartia.\\" Tragic Error in the Poetics of Aristotle and in Greek Tragedy.

After emigrating to the United States, he obtained in 1981 a Ph.D. in mathematics from Columbia University, where his advisor was Joan Birman. Przytycki then returned to Poland, where he became an assistant professor at the University of Warsaw. From 1986 to 1995 he held visiting positions at the University of British Columbia, the University of Toronto, Michigan State University, the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, New Jersey, the University of California, Riverside, Odense University, and the University of California, Berkeley. In 1995 he joined the Mathematics Department at George Washington University in Washington, D.C., rising to the rank of professor in 1999. According to the Mathematics Genealogy Project, he has supervised 13 Ph.D. students (as of 2019). He has authored and co-authored many mathematical publications, including more than 100 research papers, 25 conference proceedings and 2 books, having over 1,470 citations on MathSciNet. In 1987, Przytycki and Pawel Traczyk published a paper, which included a description of what is now called the HOMFLY(PT) polynomial. Postal delays prevented Przytycki and Traczyk from receiving full recognition alongside the other six discoverers. Przytycki also introduced skein modules in a paper written in 1989 and published in 1991; see also his entry in the online Encyclopedia of Mathematics. Every semester since 1995, Przytycki has co-organized the conference Knots in Washington. He also co-organized several international Knot Theory conferences in Europe, for example Knots in Poland (1995, 2003 and 2010), Knots in Hellas (1998 and 2016), and the Advanced School and Conference on Knot Theory and its Applications to Physics and Biology, Trieste, Italy (2009).

Runology forms a specialized branch of Germanic linguistics. ==History== Runology was initiated by Johannes Bureus (1568-1652) who was very interested in the linguistics of the Geatish language (Götiska språket), i.e. Old Norse. However, he did not look at the runes as merely an alphabet but rather something holy or magical. The study of runes was continued by Olof Rudbeck Sr (1630-1702) and presented in his collection Atlantica. The physicist Anders Celsius (1701-44) further extended the science of runes and travelled around the whole of Sweden to examine the bautastenar (megaliths, today termed runestones). Another early treatise is the 1732 Runologia by Jón Ólafsson of Grunnavík. The sundry runic scripts were well understood by the 19th century, when their analysis became an integral part of the Germanic philology and historical linguistics. Wilhelm Grimm brought out his Ueber deutsche Runen in 1821, where among other things he dwelt upon the \\"Marcomannic runes\\" (chapter 18, pp. 149-159). In 1828 he published a supplement, titled Zur Literatur der Runen, where he discusses the Abecedarium Nordmannicum. Sveriges runinskrifter was published from 1900. The dedicated journal Nytt om runer has been published by the \\"Runic Archives\\" of the Museum of Cultural History at the University of Oslo from 1985.

The original intent of a TIF program is to stimulate private investment with a blighted area that has been designated to be in need of economic revitalization. Similar or related value capture strategies are used around the world. Through the use of TIF, municipalities typically divert future property tax revenue increases from a defined area or district toward an economic development project or public improvement project in the community. TIF subsidies are not appropriated directly from a city's budget, but the city incurs loss through foregone tax revenue. The first TIF was used in California in 1952. By 2004, all 50 American states had authorized the use of TIF, except Arizona. The first TIF in Canada was used in 2007.If the cost of basic services increases, with TIF in place, the result is a revenue shortfall that has to be paid from sources other than tax revenues of the TIF district to prevent service cuts. ==Use of Tax Increment Financing== Tax increment financing (TIF) subsidies, which are used for both publicly subsidized economic development and municipal projects, have provided the means for cities and counties to gain approval of redevelopment of blighted properties or public projects such as city halls, parks, libraries etc. The definition of blight has taken on a broad inclusion of nearly every type of land including farmland, which has given rise to much of the criticism. \\" To provide the needed subsidy, the urban renewal district, or TIF district, is essentially always drawn around hundreds or thousands of acres of additional real estate (beyond the project site) to provide the needed borrowing capacity for the project or projects. The borrowing capacity is established by committing all normal yearly future real estate tax increases from every parcel in the TIF district (for 20–25 years, or more) along with the anticipated new tax revenue eventually coming from the project or projects themselves. If the projects are public improvements paying no real estate taxes, all of the repayment will come from the adjacent properties within the TIF district. Although questioned, it is often presumed that even public improvements trigger gains in taxes above what occurs, or would have occurred in the district without the investment. In many jurisdictions yearly property tax increases are restricted and cannot exceed what would otherwise have occurred. The completion of a public or private project can at times result in an increase in the value of surrounding real estate, which generates additional tax revenue. Sales-tax revenue may also increase, and jobs may be added, although these factors and their multipliers usually do not influence the structure of TIF. The routine yearly increases district-wide, along with any increase in site value from the public and private investment, generate an increase in tax revenues. This is the \\"tax increment.\\" Tax increment financing dedicates tax increments within a certain defined district to finance the debt that is issued to pay for the project. TIF was designed to channel funding toward improvements in distressed, underdeveloped, or underutilized parts of a jurisdiction where development might otherwise not occur. TIF creates funding for public or private projects by borrowing against the future increase in these property-tax revenues.Various, (2001). Tax Increment Financing and Economic Development, Uses, Structures and Impact. Edited by Craig L. Johnson and Joyce Y. Man. State University of New York Press. ==History== Tax increment financing was first used in California in 1952 and there are currently thousands of TIF districts still currently operate nationwide in the US, from small and mid-sized cities to large urban areas. As of 2008, California had over four hundred TIF districts with an aggregate of over $10 billion per year in revenues, over $28 billion of long-term debt, and over $674 billion of assessed land valuation. The state of California discontinued the use of TIF financing due to lawsuits in 2011, and enacted the California Fiscal Emergency Proclamation 2010, thereby ending the diversion of property tax revenues from public funding, including the use of TIFs for the funding of the nearly 400 redevelopment agencies in the state.\\"Urban Renewal Dead in California,\\" The Antiplanner, Thoreau Institute (2 January 2012).See California Redevelopment Association v. Ana Matosantos. The RDAs appealed that decision, though they were eventually eliminated in February 2012 after the passage of the 2011 state budget. However, in 2015, the California Community Revitalization and Investment Authority Act was made law, providing for the creation of Community Revitalization and Investment Authorities (CRIAs), funded by Tax-Increment Financing. The primary purposes of CRIAs are the development or preservation of affordable housing for low and moderate income households (a minimum of 25% of TIF funding must be placed in an affordable housing fund) and creation or upgrading of public infrastructure in economically disadvantaged areas as defined under the provisions of the law. Additionally, Enhanced Infrastructure Financing Districts (EIFDs) may be created and financed by TIFs in the California. With the exception of Arizona, every state and the District of Columbia has enabled legislation for tax increment financing.Council of Development Finance Agencies 2008 TIF State-By- State Report accessed 2014-3-21. Some states, such as Illinois, have used TIF for decades, but others have only recently embraced TIF.Arkansas (2000), Washington (2001), New Jersey (2002), Delaware (2003), Louisiana (2003), North Carolina (2005), and New Mexico (2006). The state of Maine has a program named TIF; however, this title refers to a process very different than in most states. Since the 1970s, the following factors have led local governments (cities, townships, etc.) to consider tax increment financing: lobbying by developers, a reduction in federal funding for redevelopment-related activities (including spending increases), restrictions on municipal bonds (which are tax-exempt bonds), the transfer of urban policy to local governments, State-imposed caps on municipal property tax collections, and State-imposed limits on the amounts and types of city expenditures. Considering these factors, many local governments have chosen TIF as a way to strengthen their tax bases, attract private investment, and increase economic activity. ==Urban regeneration== In a 2015 literature review on best practices in urban regeneration, with cities across the United States seeking ways to reverse trends of unemployment, declining population and disinvestment in their core downtown areas, as developers continue to expand into suburban areas. Re-investment in downtown core areas include mixed-use development and new or improved transit systems. With successful revitalization comes gentrification with higher property values and taxes, and the exodus of lower income earners. == Unintended consequences == TIF districts have attracted much criticism. Some question whether TIF districts actually serve their resident populations. An organization called Municipal Officials for Redevelopment Reform (MORR) holds regular conferences on redevelopment abuse. Here are further claims made by TIF opponents: *As investment in an area increases, it is not uncommon for real estate values to rise and for gentrification to occur. * Although generally sold to legislatures as a tool to redevelop blighted areas, some districts are drawn up where development would happen anyway, such as ideal development areas at the edges of cities. California has passed legislation designed to curb this abuse. * The designation of urban areas as \\"blighted,\\" essential to most TIF implementation, can allow governmental condemnation of property through eminent domain laws. The famous Kelo v. City of New London United States Supreme Court case, where homes were condemned for a private development, arose over actions within a TIF district. *The TIF process arguably leads to favoritism for politically connected developers, implementing attorneys, economic development officials, and others involved in the processes. * In some cases, school districts within communities using TIF are experiencing larger increases in state aid than districts not in such communities. This may be creating an incentive for governments to \\"over-TIF,\\" consequently taking on riskier development projects. Local governments are under no obligation to recognize when TIF designation would adversely affect a school district's financial condition, and consequently the quality of some schools can be compromised. * Normal inflationary increases in property values can be captured with districts in poorly written TIFs, representing money that would have gone into the public coffers even without the financed improvements. * Districts can be drawn excessively large thus capturing revenue from areas that would have appreciated in value regardless of TIF designation. * Approval of districts can sometimes capture one entity's future taxes without its official input, i.e. a school districts taxes will be frozen on action of a city. * Capturing the full tax increment and directing it to repay the development bonds ignores the fact that the incremental increase in property value likely requires an increase in the provision of public services, which will now have to be funded from elsewhere (often from subsidies from less economically thriving areas). For example, the use of tax increment financing to create a large residential development means that public services from schools to public safety will need to be expanded, yet if the full tax increment is captured to repay the development bonds, other money will have to be used. ==Examples== ===Chicago=== The city of Chicago, in Cook County, Illinois, has a significant number of TIF districts and has become a prime location for examining the benefits and disadvantages of TIF districts. The city runs 131 districts with tax receipts totaling upwards of $500 million for 2006. Lori Healey, appointed commissioner of the city's Planning and Development department in 2005 was instrumental in the process of approving TIF districts as first deputy commissioner. The Chicago Reader, a Chicago alternative newspaper published weekly, has published articles regarding tax increment financing districts in and around Chicago. Written by staff writer Ben Joravsky, the articles are critical of tax increment financing districts as implemented in Chicago. Cook County Clerk David Orr, in order to bring transparency to Chicago and Cook County tax increment financing districts, began to feature information regarding Chicago area districts on his office's website. The information featured includes City of Chicago TIF revenue by year, maps of Chicago and Cook County suburban municipalities' TIF districts. The Neighborhood Capital Budget Group of Chicago, Illinois, a non-profit organization, advocated for area resident participation in capital programs. The group also researched and analyzed the expansion of Chicago's TIF districts. In April 2009, the \\"TIF Sunshine Ordinance\\" introduced by Alderman Scott Waguespack and Alderman Manuel Flores (then 1st Ward Alderman) passed City Council. The ordinance made all TIF Redevelopment Agreements and attachments available on the City's website in a searchable electronic format. The proposal intended to improve the overall transparency of TIF Agreements, thereby facilitating significantly increased public accountability. According to an article published in the Journal of Property Tax Assessment & Administration in 2009, the increase in the use of TIF in Chicago resulted in a \\"substantial portion of Chicago's property tax base and the land area\\" being subsumed by these levy zones — \\"26 percent of the city’s land area and almost a quarter of the total value of commercial property is in TIF districts\\" by 2007. The study notes the difficulties in establishing how effective TIF are. ===Albuquerque=== Currently, the 2nd largest TIF project in America is located in Albuquerque, New Mexico: the $500 million Mesa del Sol development. Mesa del Sol is controversial in that the proposed development would be built upon a \\"green field\\" that presently generates little tax revenue and any increase in tax revenue would be diverted into a tax increment financing fund. This \\"increment\\" thus would leave governmental bodies without funding from the developed area that is necessary for the governmental bodies' operation. ===Detroit=== In July 2014, Detroit's Downtown Development Authority announced TIF financing for the new Red Wings hockey stadium. The total project cost, including additional private investments in retail and housing, is estimated at $650 million, of which $250 million will be financed using TIF capture to repay 30-year tax exempt bonds purchased by the Michigan Strategic Fund, the state's economic development arm. ===California=== In an article published in 1998 the Public Policy Institute of California, Michael Dardia challenged the governing redevelopment agencies' (RDAs) assumption \\"that redevelopment pays for itself through tax increment financing. The claim is that RDAs \\"receive any increase in property tax revenues (above a 2 percent inflation factor) in project areas because their investment in area improvements is responsible for increasing property values.\\" Dardia argued that property tax revenues channeled to tax increment financing results in revenues lost to \\"other local jurisdictions—the county, schools, and special districts\\" and if the RDAs \\"are not largely responsible for the increase in property values, those jurisdictions are, in effect, subsidizing redevelopment, with no say in how the revenues are used.\\" By December 6, 2010 Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger issued a fiscal emergency which was reaffirmed by Governor Jerry Brown in December 2011 to underscore \\"the need for immediate legislative action to address California’s massive budget deficit.\\" Governor Brown enacted measures to stabilize school funding by reducing or eliminating the diversion of property taxes from the public sector including, school districts, to RDAs. New legislation including Assembly Bill 26 and Assembly Bill 27 were passed, which led to the elimination of California's nearly 400 redevelopment agencies thereby stopping the diversion of property tax revenues from public funding. The RDAs appealed the decision however they were eventually eliminated. The state reintroduced the option of tax-increment financing for the funding of Community Revitalization and Investment Authorities (CRIAs) in 2015, the latter being authorities created by local governments to create or upgrade infrastructure and create or preserve affordable housing for low and moderate income households. Enhanced Infrastructure Financing Districts (EIFDs) in the state are also financed by a tax-increment bond and their purposes are largely similar, though the requirement for use and the projects covered are somewhat different. ====Alameda==== In 2009, SunCal Companies, an Irvine, California- based developer, introduced a ballot initiative that embodied a redevelopment plan for the former Naval Air Station Alameda and a financial plan based in part on roughly $200 million worth of tax increment financing to pay for public amenities. SunCal structured the initiative so that the provision of public amenities was contingent on receiving tax increment financing, and on the creation of a community facilities (Mello-Roos) district, which would levy a special (extra) tax on property owners within the development. Since Alameda City Council did not extend the Exclusive Negotiation Agreement with Suncal, this project will not move forward. In California, Community Redevelopment Law governs the use of tax increment financing by public agencies. ===Iowa=== In 2002 economists at Department of Economics Iowa State University, claimed that \\"existing taxpayers, its householders, wage earners, and retirees are aggressively subsidizing business growth and population\\" TIF designated zones in Iowa. ===Wisconsin=== TIFs were established in Wisconsin in 1975. In 2001 critics argued that TIF supported developers to develop in green spaces citing a 2000 1,000 Friends of Wisconsin report which stated that 45% of tax incremental financing districts were used to develop open space land. ===Denver=== From 1995 through 2005 Denver tax payers were able to leverage over $5 billion in private investment by committing to over half a billion dollars of TIF subsidies. At that time new TIF subsidized projects under consideration included the \\"redevelopment of the old Gates Rubber Factory complex at I-25 and Broadway, and the realization of Denver’s ambitious plans for the downtown Union Station area.\\" Denver's urban landscape was transformed from 1995 through 2005 through TIF-subsidized projects such as \\"the landmark resurrection\\" of the Denver Dry Goods building, the Adams Mark hotel, Denver Pavilions, and REI flagship store, Broadway Marketplace shopping area and the demolition of the old Woolworth's building, the relocation and expansion of Elitch's into the Six Flags Elitch Gardens Amusement park, the redevelopment of Lowry Air Force Base and the redevelopment of the old Stapleton airport – \\"the largest urban infill project in the nation.\\" By 2005 the City Denver had already \\"mortgaged over $500 million in future tax revenue to pay off existing TIF subsidies to private developers\\" and was preparing to \\"increase that sum substantially with several new TIF projects in the next five years.\\" In 2005 the \\"diversions of tax revenue to pay for TIF subsidies [represented] an annual cost of almost $30 million to Denver taxpayers, and [were] rising rapidly.\\" By 2007 TIF tax expenditures in the form of foregone tax revenue totaled nearly \\"$30 million annually – equal to almost 7% of Denver’s entire annual General Fund revenues\\" and at that time the amount was rapidly increasing. In a 2005 study it was revealed through wage surveys at TIF projects \\"that jobs there pay substantially less than Denver average wages, and 14%-27% less even than average wages for comparable occupational categories.\\" In part 1 of a three part series researchers \\"explained the history and mechanics of TIF, and analyzed the total cost of TIF to Denver taxpayers, including “hidden” costs from increased public service burdens that TIF projects do not pay for.\\" In \\"Who Profits from TIF Subsidies?\\" researchers \\"examined the types of businesses Denver attracts through TIF, and the profit rates of developers with whom Denver partners to bring TIF projects into existence, and the transparency of the TIF approval process.\\" In part three of the study researchers examined \\"quality and housing affordability at TIF- subsidized projects.\\" ==Applications and administration== Cities use TIF to finance public infrastructure, land acquisition, demolition, utilities and planning costs, and other improvements including sewer expansion and repair, curb and sidewalk work, storm drainage, traffic control, street construction and expansion, street lighting, water supply, landscaping, park improvements, environmental remediation, bridge construction and repair, and parking structures. State enabling legislation gives local governments the authority to designate tax increment financing districts. The district usually lasts 20 years, or enough time to pay back the bonds issued to fund the improvements. While arrangements vary, it is common to have a city government assuming the administrative role, making decisions about how and where the tool is applied. Most jurisdictions only allow bonds to be floated based upon a portion (usually capped at 50%) of the assumed increase in tax revenues. For example, if a $5,000,000 annual tax increment is expected in a development, which would cover the financing costs of a $50,000,000 bond, only a $25,000,000 bond would be typically allowed. If the project is moderately successful, this would mean that a good portion of the expected annual tax revenues (in this case over $2,000,000) would be dedicated to other public purposes other than paying off the bond. ==Community revitalization levy (CRL) in Canada== By 2015 major Canadian cities had already implemented community revitalization levies (CRL) — the term used for TIFs in Canada. ===Alberta=== In April 2012, it was proposed that the Alberta government change regulations so that the Community Revitalization Levy (CRL) could be applied to remediation costs \\"incurred by a private developer.\\" The Calgary Municipal Land Corporation (CMLC) — an arms- length a subsidiary of the City of Calgary, established in 2007, to revisit land use in the longtime deserted chunk of land in the east downtown core along the Bow River — used a CRL to develop Downtown East Village, Calgary making Calgary the first Canadian city to use the CRL. The CMLC \\"committed approximately $CDN 357 million to East Village infrastructure and development\\" and claims that it \\"has attracted $CDN 2.4 billion of planned development that is expected to return $CDN 725 million of revenue to the CRL.\\" The designated levy zone for the Rivers District CRL is wider than the East Village, making it financially sound since it collects taxes for twenty years on its anchor building, the 58-storey Bow tower, and from developments in nearby Victoria Park (Calgary). In an interview with the Calgary Sun in February 2015, Michael Brown, CRL president and CEO said they were looking into a CRL for the development of the West Village similar to that used to finance the remediation of the East Village. In August CalgaryNEXT sports complex was proposed as a potential anchor to the levy zone. Local politicians expressed concern about the funding model, which proposed that the city would front between $440 and $690 million of the projected cost, most which would only be recouped over a long period of time. Mayor Naheed Nenshi commented that one of a number of challenges to the CalgaryNEXT proposal was the requirement of a community revitalization levy, along with the need for a land contribution from the City, \\"and significant investments in infrastructure to make the West Village a complete and vibrant community.\\" Edmonton, Alberta creating a CRL to revitalize the downtown with a massive development project including a new arena, park development and upgrades including sewers which total approximately $CDN 500 million. The city hopes to \\"generate approximately $941 million in revenue in a medium-growth scenario.\\" ===Ontario=== Toronto's Mayor John Tory plans on creating a levy zone to finance a massive $CDN 2.7-billion SmartTrack surface rail line project spanning 53 kilometres. == See also == * Public finance * Value capture == References == == External links == *Scott, Brendan S., 2013 \\"Factors that Influence the Size of Tax Increment Financing Districts in Texas\\" Applied Research Project, Texas State University. * An abstract of Weber's Equity and Entrepreneurialism: The Impact of Tax Increment Financing on School Finance (2003). * An abstract of Weber, et al.'s \\"Does Tax Increment Financing Raise Urban Industrial Property Values?\\" (2003). * Category:Tax policy ","title":"Tax increment financing"},{"id":"1280603","text":"The International 420 Dinghy is a sailing dinghy. The name refers to the boat length in centimeters, being 4.2 meters (13 ft 9 in). The hull is fiberglass with internal buoyancy tanks. The 420 has a bermuda rig and an optional spinnaker and trapeze. It has a large sail-area-to-weight ratio, and is designed to plane easily. It can be rigged to be sailed single-handed or double-handed. The 420 is an International class recognized by the International Sailing Federation. ==History== The International 420 was designed by Christian Maury. The class developed rapidly in France, being adopted nationally as a youth trainer for the larger Olympic class International 470. By the late 1960s the class was adopted by a few UK university sailing clubs for training and team racing. The 420 was designed specifically to be easier to handle than its larger higher-performance cousin, the 470. ===Construction=== The class adopted a policy of \\"prudent evolution\\" so as to allow development without making existing dinghies obsolete. The hull's seaworthiness and stability at speed proved to be better than most of its contemporaries, and this together with its modest sail area make it fun to sail in heavy weather and thus an excellent youth trainer, qualities that led to its adoption for that role by the Royal Yachting Association in the mid-1970s. With its trapeze and spinnaker it provides the capability for advanced sailing techniques for international standard sailors, while still remaining affordable and accessible to beginners. The International 420 maintains a large multinational class association. The combination of effective class management, the boat's inherent sailing qualities, and prudent evolution have contributed to the class's continuing success. ==Club 420== The Club 420, or C420, is a derivative of the 420 and is not recognized by World Sailing or the International 420 Class Association. Designed by Vanguard boats in the 1970s, it has a heavier hull, reinforced for durability in institutional sailing, and a stiff, untapered mast. The boat is much more simple to sail, yet lacks the performance of the original dinghy due to its extra weight. The Club 420 is used extensively on the youth race circuit in the US, with over 5,000 boats in North America,url=http://club420.org but is not sailed in most other countries. It cannot be used at I420 class events. ==Z420== The Z420 is a transformation of the Club 420 into a lighter, safer, and more responsive platform for college sailors. The Z420 hull is 50 pounds lighter and 40 percent stiffer than the C420.

She participated in the Pacific War campaign of World War II, receiving six battle stars for her service. The United States later transferred her to Brazil in a joint cooperation program. ==Service history== ===United States Navy=== Plaice was laid down by the Portsmouth Navy Yard, Kittery, Maine on 14 July 1943; launched on 15 November 1943, sponsored by Miss Eleanor Fazzi; and commissioned on 12 February 1944, Lieutenant Commander Clyde B. Stevens in command. Following shakedown and training, Plaice got underway for the Panama Canal Zone on 15 April, and arrived Pearl Harbor on 13 May. She departed on her first war patrol in the Bonin Islands area on 3 June. Plaice torpedoed and sank Hyakufuku Maru on 30 June; Kogi Maru on 5 July; and Submarine Chaser No. 50 on 18 July, before returning to Midway Island. The submarine was off on her second war patrol on 17 August, this time in the Nansei Shoto area. In the early afternoon on 7 September, Plaice scored one torpedo hit on a Kongō Maru-class liner converted to an auxiliary cruiser. On 24 September, Plaice launched four torpedoes at a , briefly stopping its screws. Three days later she sank Coast Defense Vessel No. 10., and put three torpedoes into the side of a transport, which blossomed a bright orange flame. The patrol ended as Plaice drew into Midway on 7 October and got underway the following day for Pearl Harbor with . Plaice departed Pearl Harbor on 9 November for her third patrol in the Southwestern Japanese Empire off the coast of Shikoku and Kyūshū. On 9 December, she damaged . She patrolled the traffic lanes east of Van Diemen Strait and pulled into Guam 20 December without having sunk any ships on the patrol. The undersea raider departed Guam on her fourth patrol in the Luzon Straits-Formosa areas. Plaice was part of a coordinated attack group which included , , , , and . This long patrol in the face of enemy antisubmarine measures resulted in but one contact worthy of torpedo fire, a convoy of a small freighter, a medium freighter and three escorts. Three attacks resulted in but one hit. On 23 March 1945, Plaice moored at Midway. The fifth patrol originated from Midway on 26 April and took Plaice to the Kuril Islands-Okhotsk Sea area. The first enemy contact was made on 13 May, when the submarine trailed four sea trucks and four small luggers until she opened a surface engagement with her and 40 mm guns, sinking all four sea trucks and two luggers. When all her larger ammunition had been expended, she drove the remaining two luggers toward the beach and damaged them by 20 mm and small arms fire. On 18 May, seven fishing boats came into view. The staccato of 20 mm and .50 caliber guns tore into two of the boats and damaged them visibly. Plaice ended her patrol at Pearl Harbor 13 June. USS Plaice (SS-390) crew The sixth patrol - commencing on 18 July - took Plaice to the East China Sea area, but she made no enemy contacts. She picked up five survivors from an Army B-25 Mitchell, and transferred them to a Navy patrol bomber the following day. On 15 August, Japan accepted the Potsdam Declaration and nine days later Plaice pulled into Midway. After the war was over, Plaice operated in the Pacific until, by directive dated November 1947, she was placed out of commission, in reserve, at Mare Island Naval Shipyard. Plaice was reactivated 18 May 1963 in preparation for a five-year loan to Brazil on 7 September 1963 under the Military Assistance Program. ===Brazilian Navy=== Capitão-de-Fragata (Commander) Abílio Simões Machado of the Brazilian Navy took command of the submarine at Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, on 7 September 1963. Commissioned in the Brazilian Navy as Bahia (S-12), she was the first Balao- class submarine to undergo alterations at the Brazilian Navy Arsenal in Rio de Janeiro; her hydrodynamic shape was modified with the installation of a new conning tower and periscope guide. After the completion of the modifications, Bahias underwater speed increased by one knot and she was quieter when submerged. S-12 Bahia, Former Plaice (SS-390) after changes. Bahia took part in UNITAS naval exercises and assisted in surveillance in the South Atlantic Ocean during the Cold War. She logged 140,503 nautical miles (260,212 kilometers), spending 2,863 hours submerged and 836 days at sea. Her loan to Brazil was extended beyond its original five-year term at regular intervals. Bahia was decommissioned on 19 January 1973. She was sold to the Technology Museum of São Paulo, which intended to tow her Santos, Brazil, and convert her into a museum ship. However, these plans were not realized, and instead Bahia was scrapped following a ceremony on 27 March 1973. ==Awards== Plaice received six battle stars for her World War II service. ==References== * ==External links== * Category:Balao-class submarines Category:Ships built in Kittery, Maine Category:1943 ships Category:World War II submarines of the United States Category:Balao-class submarines of the Brazilian Navy ","title":"USS Plaice (SS-390)"},{"id":"1280625","text":"Jan Sigurd Baalsrud, MBE (13 December 1917 – 30 December 1988) was a commando in the Norwegian resistance trained by the British during World War II. == Biography == === Early life === Jan Baalsrud was born in Kristiania (now Oslo), Norway and moved to Kolbotn in the early 1930s, where he lived until the 1950s. He graduated as a cartographical instrument-maker in 1939. === World War II === During the German invasion of Norway in 1940, Baalsrud fought in Vestfold. He later escaped to Sweden, but he was convicted of espionage and expelled from the country. In 1941, he arrived in Britain after having travelled through the Soviet Union, Africa and the US. He joined the Norwegian Company Linge. In early 1943, he, three other commandos, and a boat crew of eight, all Norwegians, embarked on a mission to destroy a German airfield control tower at Bardufoss, and recruit for the Norwegian resistance movement. This mission, Operation Martin, was compromised when Baalsrud and his fellow soldiers, seeking a trusted Resistance contact, accidentally made contact with an unaligned civilian shopkeeper, with the same name as their contact, who, fearing for his life and suspecting it was a test by the Germans, reported them to the local police office, who then reported them to the Germans. The morning after their blunder, on March 29, their fishing boat Brattholm - containing around 100 kilos of explosives intended to destroy the air control tower - was attacked by a German vessel. The Norwegians scuttled their boat by detonating the 100 kilos of explosive using a time delay fuse, and fled in a small boat. However, the small boat was promptly sunk by the Germans. He and others swam ashore in ice-cold Arctic waters. Baalsrud was the only commando to evade capture and, soaking wet and missing one sea boot, he escaped into a snow gully, where he shot and killed a German Gestapo officer with his pistol. He evaded capture for approximately two months, suffering from frostbite and snow blindness. His deteriorating physical condition forced him to rely on the assistance of Norwegian patriots. It was during this time, in a wooden hut at Revdal, which he called Hotel Savoy, that Baalsrud was forced to operate on his feet with a pocket knife. He suspected he had gangrene, and fearing it would spread, he cut off his big toe and the infected bit of the index toe. Not long after that, Baalsrud was left close to death on a high plateau, on a stretcher in the snow, for 27 days due to weather and German patrols in the town of Manndalen, Kåfjord. It was during this time, while he lay behind a snow wall built round a rock to shelter him, that Baalsrud amputated nine of his toes to stop the spread of gangrene, an action which saved his feet. Fellow Norwegians transported Baalsrud by stretcher towards the border with Finland. Then, he was put in the care of some Sami (the native people of northern Fenno-Scandinavia) who, with reindeer, pulled him on a sled across Finland and into neutral Sweden. From Saarikoski, in northern Finland, he was collected by a Red Cross seaplane and flown to Boden. Baalsrud spent seven months in a Swedish hospital in Boden before he was flown back to Britain in an RAF de Havilland Mosquito aircraft. He soon went to Scotland to help train other Norwegian patriots who were going back to Norway to continue the fight against the Germans. After a long struggle to learn to walk properly again without his toes, Baalsrud eventually got his own way and was sent to Norway as an agent, where he was still in active service at the time of the war's end, in 1945. The end of the war signalled the end of German occupation, and he was able to travel to Oslo and reunite with his family, whom he had left 5 years before. Baalsrud was appointed honorary Member of the Order of the British Empire by the British. The date given for publication in the London Gazette is misleading, other honours listed in this recommendation were gazetted on that date, but honorary appointments to the Order of the British Empire are not gazetted. From Norway, he received the St. Olav's medal with Oak Branch. He was a Second Lieutenant (Fenrik). === Later years and death === After the war, Baalsrud contributed to the local scout and football associations, as well as the Norwegian Disabled Veterans Union of which he was chairman from 1957 to 1964. In 1962, he moved to Tenerife, Canary Islands, where he lived for most of the remainder of his life. He returned to Norway during his final years. He lived there until his death on 30 December 1988, aged 71. His ashes are buried in Manndalen, in a grave shared with Aslak Aslaksen Fossvoll (1900–1943), one of the local men who helped him escape to Sweden. ==Legacy== An annual remembrance march in Baalsrud's honour takes place on July 25 in Troms, where the participants follow his escape route for nine days. About the remembrance march A street in Kolbotn, Norway is named Jan Baalsruds plass (Jan Baalsrud's Place) in his honor. ==In media== === Books === * * * ===Films === * Ni Liv (En.

F. Husain (17 September 1915 – 9 June 2011) was a controversial Indian artist known for executing bold, vibrantly coloured narrative paintings in a modified Cubist style. He was one of the most celebrated and internationally recognized Indian artists of the 20th century. He was one of the founding member of Bombay Progressive Artists' Group. M.F. Husain is associated with Indian modernism in the 1940s. His early association with the Bombay Progressive Artists' Group used modern technique, and was inspired by the \\"new\\" India after the partition of 1947. His narrative paintings, executed in a modified Cubist style, can be caustic and funny as well as serious and sombre. His themes—sometimes treated in series—include topics as diverse as Gandhi, Mother Teresa, the Ramayana, the Mahabharata, the British Raj, and motifs of Indian urban and rural life. Husain's later works have stirred controversy, which included nude portrayals of Hindu deities, and a nude portrayal of Bharat Mata. Right-wing organizations called for his arrest, and several lawsuits were filed against him for hurting religious sentiments. He remained in a self imposed exile from 2006 until his death in 2011, accepting Qatari citizenship in 2008. In 1967, he received the National Film Award for Best Experimental Film for Through the Eyes of a Painter. In 2004, he directed Meenaxi: A Tale of Three Cities, a film he worked on with his artist son Owais Husain, which was screened in the Marché du film section of the 2004 Cannes Film Festival. ==Biography== Hussain was born on 17 September 1915 in Pandharpur, Maharashtra. in a Suleymani Bohra family. He picked up taste in art through studying calligraphy while he stayed at a Madrasa in Baroda. Husain attended the Sir Jamsetjee Jeejebhoy School of Art in Mumbai. Early in his career, Husain painted cinema posters in Mumbai. To earn additional income, he worked for a toy company designing and building toys. He often traveled to Gujarat to paint landscapes whenever he could afford to travel. Husain developed his painting skills in the 1930s, painting billboards for the growing Bollywood film industry. This was a clique of young artists who wished to break with the nationalist traditions established by the Bengal school of art and to encourage an Indian avant-garde, engaged at an international level. The artist cite \\"The Partition\\" of India and Pakistan 14 August 1947, with its resulting religious rioting and heavy loss of life as their reason for forming The Progressive Artist's Group in Bombay in December 1947. The artists saw the Partition as a \\"turning point\\" for India, and their new style of art was urged on by, and was also a turning point for, (modern) Indian Art. Husain's first solo art exhibition was in 1952 in Zurich. His first U.S.A. exhibit was at India House in New York in 1964. his biography written by Akhilesh \\"Maqbool\\" is the most appreciated book published by Rajkamal Prakashan New Delhi. ===1914 – 1918=== Husain was a special invitee along with Pablo Picasso at the Sao Paulo Biennial, Brazil in 1971. He was nominated to the Rajya Sabha in 1986. he died in 2011 ===1990 – 2005=== Although he was raised in a Muslim household, Husain sought freedom to capture the essence of beauty in other religious cultures, for which he received a backlash. His paintings allegedly hurt the religious sentiments of Hindu nationalist groups, which beginning in the 1990s mounted a campaign of protest against him. The paintings in question were created in 1970, but did not become an issue until 1996, when they were printed in Vichar Mimansa, a Hindi monthly magazine, which published them in an article headlined \\"M.F. Husain: A Painter or Butcher\\". In response, eight criminal complaints were filed against him. In 2004, Delhi High Court dismissed these complaints of \\"promoting enmity between different groups ... by painting Hindu goddesses – Durga and Sarswati, that was later compromised by Hindu fundamentalist groups.\\" In 1998 Husain's house was attacked by Hindu fundamentalist groups like Bajrang Dal and art works were vandalised. The leadership of another fundamentalist political party Shiv Sena endorsed the attack. Twenty-six Bajrang Dal activists were arrested by the police. Protests against Husain also led to the closure of an exhibition in England. He has also produced & directed several movies, including Gaja Gamini (2000) (with his muse Madhuri Dixit who was the subject of a series of his paintings which he signed Fida). The film was intended as a tribute to Ms. Dixit herself. In this film she can be seen portraying various forms and manifestations of womanhood including the muse of Kalidasa, the Mona Lisa, a rebel, and musical euphoria. He also appeared in a scene in film Mohabbat, which had Madhuri Dixit in lead role. In the film, the paintings that were supposedly done by Madhuri were actually Husain's. He went on to make Meenaxi: A Tale of Three Cities (with Tabu). The film was pulled out of cinemas a day after some Muslim organisations raised objections to one of the songs in it. The All-India Ulema Council complained that the Qawwali song Noor-un-Ala-Noor was blasphemous. It argued that the song contained words directly taken from the Quran. The council was supported by Muslim organisations like the Milli Council, All-India Muslim Council, Raza Academy, Jamiat-ul-Ulema-e-Hind and Jamat-e-Islami. Husain's son stated that the words were a phrase referring to divine beauty that were being sung by the central character played by Tabu. He said there was no intention to offend. Following the wave of protests the enraged artist withdrew his movie from cinemas. The film was well received by the critics, however, and went on to win various awards. ===2006 – 2011=== In February 2006, Husain was charged with \\"hurting sentiments of people\\" because of his nude portraits of Hindu gods and goddesses. In addition, on 6 February 2006 issue, India Today, a national English weekly published an advertisement titled \\"Art For Mission Kashmir\\". This advertisement contains a painting of {Bharatmata} (Mother India) as a nude woman posed across a map of India with the names of Indian States on various parts of her body. The exhibition was organised by Nafisa Ali of Action India - an (NGO) and Apparao Art Gallery. Organizations like VHP protested persistently against Husain displaying the painting on the websites and even in exhibitions in north Europe. As a result, Husain apologized and promised to withdraw the painting from an auction, which was later sold for Rs 80 lakh in the auction. The painting later appeared on Husain's official website. Husain claims that the loss of his mother at the age of a year and a half is a possible reason for his pattern of paintings depicting a maternal Indian figure. Husain became the best-paid painter in India, his highest- selling piece fetching $1.6 million at a 2008 Christie's auction. Hundreds of lawsuits in connection with Husain's allegedly obscene art were outstanding as of 2007. A warrant was issued for his arrest after he did not appear at a hearing, though this warrant was later suspended. Husain lived in self-imposed exile from 2006 until his death. He generally lived in Doha and summered in London. For the last years of his life Husain lived in Doha and London, staying away from India, but expressing a strong desire to return, despite fears of being prosecuted. In 2008 Husain was commissioned to create 32 large- scale paintings of Indian history. He finished 8 before his death. In 2010, he was conferred Qatari nationality, and he surrendered his Indian passport. In Qatar, he principally worked on two large projects, one on the history of Arab civilization, commissioned by Qatar's first lady, Mozah bint Nasser Al Missned, and one on the history of Indian civilization. The works are to be housed in a museum in Doha. At the age of 92 Husain was given the prestigious Raja Ravi Varma award by the government of Kerala. The announcement led to controversy in Kerala and some cultural organisations campaigned against the granting of the award and petitioned the Kerala courts. Social Activist, Rahul Easwar, went to Kerala High Court and it granted an interim order to stay the granting of the award until the petition had been disposed of. In 2010, the Jordanian Royal Islamic Strategic Studies Centre named Husain as one of the 500 most influential Muslims. Grave of M. F. Husain in Brookwood Cemetery in Surrey, England. M. F. Husain died, aged 95, on 9 June 2011, following a heart attack. He had been unwell for several months. He died at the Royal Brompton Hospital in London, and was buried in Brookwood Cemetery on 10 June 2011. Other Indian artists expressed criticism. Satish Gujral publicly asked Husain whether he would dare to portray Islamic figures similarly. However Gujral stated that he deeply regretted the way Husain was treated and forced into an exile because of what Gujral termed \\"the mob culture\\". And Harsh Goenka, a Mumbai-based industrialist, claims that forcing Husain into exile \\"is, in a way, showing the weakness of the system, that we cannot protect the rights of the citizen”. Writing in The Pioneer, Chandan Mitra wrote, \\"As long as such a law exists in the statutes, nobody can be faulted for approaching the courts against Husain's objectionable paintings, nor can the judiciary be pilloried for ordering action against the artist for his persistent and deliberate refusal to appear before the court.\\" In response to the controversy, Husain's admirers petitioned the government to grant Husain the Bharat Ratna, India's highest award. According to Shashi Tharoor, who supported the petition, it praised Husain because his \\"life and work are beginning to serve as an allegory for the changing modalities of the secular in modern India – and the challenges that the narrative of the nation holds for many of us. This is the opportune and crucial time to honour him for his dedication and courage to the cultural renaissance of his beloved country.\\" Husain had such a vast amount of work that spanned over 10 decades producing roughly 40,000 paintings by the end of his lifetime. On his part Husain stated that leading Hindu leaders have not spoken a word against his paintings, and they should have been the first ones to have raised their voice and only people with political intentions created controversy. After Husain's death, Shiv Sena chief Bal Thackeray said, \\"He only slipped up on the depiction of Hindu gods and goddesses. Otherwise, he was happy and content in his field. If his demise is a loss for modern art, then so be it. May Allah give him peace!\\" ==Awards and honours== *Padma Shri in 1966, Government of India. *Padma Bhushan in 1973, Government of India. *Padma Vibhushan in 1991, Government of India. *Raja Ravi Varma Award in 2007, Government of Kerala. *Honorary Doctorates from Banaras Hindu University, Jamia Millia Islamia, University of Calicut (2003) and University of Mysore. *National Art Award in 2004, Lalit Kala Akademi, New Delhi. *Aditya Vikram Birla ‘Kalashikkar’ Award in 1997 for Lifetime Achievement. *National Film Award for Best Experimental Film for Through the Eyes of a Painter, in 1968 India. *Golden Bear short film award for his film Through the Eyes of a Painter at Berlin International Film Festival in 1967 and purchased by Museum of Modern Art (MOMA), New York. *International Biennale Award in 1959, Tokyo. *First Prize at the National Exhibition of Art in 1955, Lalit Kala Akademi, New Delhi. *Bombay Art Society in 1947, Mumbai.https://www.archerindia.com/about-m-f-husain ==Legacy== On 17 September 2015, search engine Google commemorated M.

It currently produces audio amplifiers, preamplifiers, power related products, digital-to-analog converters, streaming audio, music management software and cables. ==Corporate history== PS Audio was founded in 1973 and shipped its first products in 1974. It was started by audio designers Paul McGowan and Stan Warren (with whose initials the company was named). Warren left the company in the early 1980s to form Superphon. His position as audio designer and co-owner was assumed by Dr. Bob Odell, an audio designer who had created notable Harman Kardon designs. McGowan left the company in 1990 to join Arnie Nudell of Infinity Systems to build high-end speakers with Genesis Technologies. PS Audio was purchased in 1990 by Steve Jeffery and Randall Patton, and operated independently until 1998. During this time, the company introduced their Ultra series of products, based on technology developed by the Ultra Analog Corporation, including the UltraLink DAC (Stereophile magazine product of the year) and Lambda transport. Jeffery and Patton later purchased Ultra Analog and Threshold Corporation. In early 1997, PS Audio Inc. ceased operations due to financial problems. Shortly thereafter, Paul McGowan bought back the name 'PS Audio', and has been the CEO and principal designer for new products since then. In December 1997, he left Genesis Technologies to work full-time for PS Audio. In the first quarter of 2000, the new PS Audio International grew quickly, and Peter Rudy was added as president. In 2002, former owner Steve Jeffery became president. In 2009 he retired from the company and James H. Laib assumed the role of general manager. Laib became the company's president in 2015. As of July, 2019, PS Audio employs 51 people, nearly half of whom support its engineering team. Manufacturing takes place at PS Audio's Boulder Colorado facility, and the company ships products worldwide. ==Historic products== ===Pre-1990s=== PS Audio's first product was a standalone phono preamplifier, sold direct to consumers for $59.95. The small unit had a passive RIAA curve sandwiched between two 709C op amps running in class A mode and considered state of the art at the time for solid state. Later iterations of the phono preamplifier were introduced that moved away from the use of integrated IC op amps and moved to discrete high-voltage solid state amplification modules, retaining the passive RIAA curve. Models include the II and the III. To augment the company's standalone phono preamplifiers, standalone line stage preamplifiers were introduced next, known as Linear Control Centers or LCC. One of the innovative features of the LCC was a bypass switch that permitted the user to select the use of an internal amplification module or straight into the potentiometer for volume control. Originally labeled 0 dB (line stage in) or -20 dB (passive only) this feature remained with all future PS Audio line stages and preamplifiers, later becoming labeled Straightwire in or out. With the advent of the III phono stage, the form factor moved from no faceplate to a small 8.5\\" rack style faceplate enabling owners to combine the two chassis into one unit, thus forming the first PS Audio preamplifier with phono input. This series marked the end of the first era of modular chassis approach to preamplification. Later preamplifier offering included the PS IV, the company's first 17\\" full chassis design and featured an external power supply for the first time in the American high-end audio industry. The IV featured a built in phono preamplifier with a novel switch on the bottom of the unit enabling users to select Moving Coil or Moving Magnet cartridges. Instead of adding in another circuit known as a head amp to increase the gain for Moving Coil cartridges, the IV took advantage of its passive RIAA curve design and simply increased the gain of the input amplification stage by an additional 30 dB. All future preamplifiers pre-1997 had this unique circuit that reduced the circuitry in the path of the phono cartridge. During the same era (late 1970s) PS Audio introduced its first power amplifier, the Model One, a solid state design producing 70 watts per channel into 8 Ohms and 140 watts per channel into 4 Ohms. The design was a classic AB amplifier design featuring the company's first full 19\\" chassis design, large power supply, low feedback and minimalist design constraints. The Model One was later followed with the world's first Audiophile integrated amplifier introduced by an American High- End company, the Elite. Based on the Model One architecture, the Elite integrated the Linear Control Center into a Model One amplifier chassis. The Model One was replaced by the Model II, moving back to a smaller modular chassis approach at 8.5\\" with faceplate. The Model II produced 40 watts per channel into 8 Ohms, 70 watts per channel into 4 Ohms and had a Bridging switch enabling the user to bridge the internal stereo amplifiers into one mono amplifier, producing 160 watts into 4 Ohms. The Model II was followed by the IIC, featuring the same circuitry placed into a standard 19\\" rack mount chassis. The IIC introduced a new concept to the Audiophile marketplace, use of a separate external power supply for an amplifier. Users could choose from two models of external power supply, one as standard and an upgrade to a larger High Current version. The concept of an external power supply was first introduced on the PS Audio IV preamplifier and later applied to power amplifiers like the IIC. The concept became known as the High Current Power Supply or HCPS and was popular because improvements to the sound quality were gained by moving to a larger power supply, both in the application of the preamplifier as well as power amplifiers. The model IIC is factory rated at 55 watts into 8 ohms and 200 watts bridged mode (400 watts into 4 ohms bridged). The IIC Plus is rated at 70 watts into 8 ohms. Amplifier successors to the IIC included the 250 Delta monoblock and the 100 Delta amplifier. In the early 1980s and with the advent of the Compact Disc, PS was one of the first American high-end audio manufacturers to modify one of the few CD players of the day by replacing its internal audio amplification stage following the internal D to A player. The first and only modified CD player introduced by the company was the CD-1 based on the Philips Magnavox line of CD players. The company engineers chose the Magnavox unit because the belief at the time was it sounded better to its only rival in the marketplace, the Sony. Inside the CD 1 PS engineers added a discrete high voltage line stage and power supply, replacing the NE 5532 op amps used as the output amplification stage of the Magnavox. This unit was a stopgap product designed to get the company \\"in the game\\" of this new format that would someday challenge vinyl, the company's core products addressed. In the background, PS engineers were working to figure out a way to utilize the CD player's digital output and create a standalone D to A converter. In late 1982, the company succeeded in releasing the first high-end standalone D to A converter known as the Digital Link. Other manufacturers such as Arcam and Theta were also on the same path and both companies released competing D to A processors within several months of the Digital Link's introduction From this point onwards, the company has produced a succession of DACs with the same goal in mind - that of supplanting the built in DAC and line stage of CD players. Later advances in CD technology led the high-end audio industry to release a new category of product called a CD Transport that contained no DAC and meant to use as a pair which became known as a DAC and Transport combination. ===1990–1997=== From 1990 to 1997, co-founder McGowan left the company and joined Infinity founder Arnie Nudell to form Genesis Loudspeakers. During the 7-year period between 1990 and 1997 the company was owned and operated by Steve Jeffery, President and general manager and Randy Patton, VP of sales, marketing and product development. Products during this era of the company took a somewhat different direction under the design guidance of Dr. Robert Odell and product development VP Randy Patton (Sumo). Preamplifiers built during this era included the 6.0 and 6.5 and were IC op amp based rather than discrete high-voltage designs of the past era. It was during this time period the company acquired a more modern look to the industrial design. The biggest contributions to the company product legacy was the line of digital audio products engineered by the outside vendor Ultra Analog located in the Bay Area. Ultra Analog, headed by Dick Powers, was an engineering centric ODM/OEM producing some of the world's first 24 bit DAC modules. These modules were hybrids potted in epoxy and were built around multiple Burr Brown 16 and 18 bit DAC chips. The first products from this partnership were the PS Audio Ultralink DAC, ReferenceLink DAC and A/D converter and Lambda transport. The Ultralink garnered Stereophile magazine's product of the year. The Lambda transport was built around a Marantz CD mechanism. The Ultralink, ReferenceLink and Lambda transport were designed and built by Ultra Analog and marketed under the PS brand for nearly 5 years. PS Audio Inc. acquired Ultra Analog in 1994. In 1995 PS Audio also acquired Hales loudspeakers and the Threshold Corporation. Following the two acquisitions Randy Patton purchased all shares of PS Audio from Steve Jeffery and owned 100% of the corporation. Steve Jeffery went on to be appointed President of the Wadia Corporation, a competing high-end audio DAC manufacturer. Patton ran PS Audio and the Threshold Corporation until 1997 when the entity ceased operations and declared bankruptcy. Steve Jeffery, the primary creditor of the corporation, liquidated the remaining assets of the company and sold the name PS Audio back to McGowan, who restarted operations in 1998. ==Modern products== ===1997–2014=== With the return of co-founder McGowan to PS Audio, the company returned to its roots of high-end audio by producing an entirely new category of product, the AC regenerator. McGowan reasoned that in order to return the company to viability in a very crowded and competitive market it was necessary to take a Blue Ocean Strategy and provide a product that solved a major problem in all high-end systems, the AC power feeding them. Realizing that the (then) infantile power conditioning category consisted only of filters that cleaned power line noise and did not address the larger issues of voltage regulation and sine wave purity, a new type of product called a regenerator was created. The first regenerator prototype was large stereo power amplifier fed by a low distortion Hewlett Packard sine wave oscillator. Each channel of the power amplifier produced 60 volts AC and when a load was placed across the two out of phase channels of the amplifier, the required 120 volts AC was achieved to power products. The research and prototype phase of the regenerator included various listening tests at different frequencies and 400 Hz was found to sound best (50 Hz and 60 Hz is standard) when equipment was powered by the amplifier. Further research negated the use of 400 Hz sine waves because many tube amplification systems were not filtered well enough at higher frequencies and the 400 Hz tone could be heard through the system. 60 Hz was the final design choice and the first product was launched. It was called a Power Plant and the model was the P300, producing up to 300 watts of regenerated, regulated AC power. The P300 was designed to produce up to 300 watts of clean power to connected audio equipment. The P-300 had a digital sine wave stored in memory, which it passed through a digital to analog converter and then amplified to 117V (adjustable) at a frequency of 60 Hz (adjustable). Thus, connected equipment was provided with a precise 117V, 60 Hz power signal (in the US, other countries had units for their specific voltage and frequency) lacking noise from the utility company. The P-300 provided, in theory, perfect noise free power of the same specifications that the power company should be providing. Various additional \\"waves\\" known as \\"multiwave\\" were also provided. The P-300 is a historically important product in high-end audio as it helped redefine and popularize the Power Conditioner product category and spawned imitation. This even though companies such as Accuphase followed with their own concept of power regeneration (though not additional waves, i.e., \\"multiwave\\" which PS audio claims provide additional benefits). More powerful models of the P-300 were introduced including the P600, P1000, P1200 and P1000. The P-500 and P-1000 provided up to 500 and 1000 watts of \\"clean\\" power to connected equipment but with the penalty of generating a tremendous amount of heat in the process. Because Power Plants utilized a traditional analog class A/B stereo power amplifier they were only 50% efficient. This meant that for every watt delivered to the load, an identical watt of heat was generated, thus requiring massive heat sinks to dissipate the heat. On August 21, 2007, US patent 7259705 was issued to PS Audio for the design rights to a new efficient tracking power regenerator that improved efficiency from 50% to 85% based on the same principles of regeneration. That same year, PS Audio introduced the Power Plant Premier, the first of its new AC Regenerator products to utilize this tracking AC technology it patented. In 2010, the current generation of AC regenerators was launched and carry the model PerfectWave. For high end cables, PS audio offered the \\"Lab\\" cable line which was replaced by the \\"Lab II\\" line, which was replaced by the \\"XStream\\" cable line. Currently the power cable line is the PerfectWave Power Cable line. PS audio offered the PCA II preamplifier. This was discontinued and replaced with the GCP-200 preamplifier. Each had an optional phono stage and external power supply option. For amplifiers, PS audio offered the HCA-2 \\"digital\\" amplifier. This was a switching amplifier (many would call this a Class D Amplifier) that provide about 150 watts per channel. A more conventional amplifier, the Classic 250, provided 250 Watts per channel. These amplifiers were discontinued and the follow-on amplifiers were all \\"digital\\" type amplifiers from the GCA line, which had flexibility in the number of channels or number of watts per channel desired. ===2014–present=== In recent years the company has grown dramatically in size, product range, and presence. The DirectStream DAC, launched in 2014, brought unique technologies to a DAC field crowded with similar chip-based solutions. Designer Ted Smith created a DAC based upon an FPGA (field-programmable gate array) which would allow owners to download and install no-cost firmware/OS upgrades which improve the unit's performance over time, and ensure that it does not become obsolete. As of July, 2019, the company has offered nine OS upgrades; recent ones have been named after \\"fourteeners\\", Colorado peaks which top 14,000 feet in height. The most recent of these is \\"Snowmass\\", released in November, 2018. The DirectStream also converts all inputs to DSD for processing; in Snowmass, signals are converted to 20 x the nominal SACD rate (56.338Mhz) and then converted back down to quad rate DSD (11.2896 MHz), with the output stage being a passive low-pass filter. Thousands of DirectStream DACs have been sold, with many in use in recording studios and as reference components by reviewers. Sprout, a compact integrated amplifier featuring a phono stage, Bluetooth, and a headphone amp, was introduced in a Kickstarter campaign in 2014; subsequently, thousands of units were sold. In 2018 a second generation unit, Sprout100, was introduced; the name reflected the increased power output of 100 watts/channel into 4 ohms. Other improvements included a fully asynchronous DAC that can handle 384/24 PCM or double rate DSD; dedicated subwoofer output; optional bass boost; high- quality, metal remote control; analog RCA inputs and outputs; and a TOSLINK optical input. Since 2015, PS has released three amplification products designed by industry veteran Bascom H. King, under the line name of BHK Signature. During more than 40 years in audio, King has designed products for Infinity, Marantz, Conrad Johnson, Constellation, and Audeze, among many others, and the BHK Signature line represents the culmination of all his experience and knowledge. The BHK Signature Preamplifier input stage features two 12AU7 dual triode vacuum tubes, which act as a zero-feedback balanced input amplification pair. Volume is controlled by a combination of an input stepped attenuator, built around the highest quality passive components for coarse volume adjustments, after which the actual gain of the vacuum tube is controlled, for finer steps. The control is designed to have no sonic signature of its own. The unit's output stage is a high-bias class-A MOSFET design that is unaffected by cable and power amplifier interface challenges. The BHK Pre also includes a headphone amp possessing extremely low/near zero output impedance, zero feedback, and featuring discrete MOSFET circuitry. There are two amplifier models in the BHK Signature line: the Stereo 250 and Mono 300. Both utilize vacuum tube input stages and MOSFET outputs; the Stereo 250 produces 250 watts/per channel into an 8Ω loudspeaker, 500 watts/channel into 4Ω, and is stable into 2Ω. The Mono 300 produces 300 watts into 8Ω, 600 into 4Ω and more than 1,000 watts into 2Ω. The Mono 300 doubles the output current with half the impedance of the stereo model, by doubling every internal component of the 250 into one unit: double tubes, double power supplies, transistors, capacitors and resistors. The high-value Stellar line was introduced in 2017, designed to bring PS Audio performance to lower- priced, full-sized components. The line was launched with three products: the Gain Cell DAC/preamp. the S300 stereo amp, and the M700 mono amps. The Gain Cell DAC is a moderately-priced combination DAC and preamp that also incorporates a high-performance headphone amp; the S300 produces 140 watts per channel into 8Ω; 300 watts per channel into 4Ω; and is stable into a 2Ω load. The M700 offers a measurable increase in performance that is immediately audible, is the least-expensive amplifier listed in Class A of Stereophile magazine's Recommended Components list, and is also one of the most powerful. Its 350 watts into 8Ω, 700 watts into 4Ω, and stability into a 2Ω load ensure that the M700 can drive any loudspeaker. In March 2019, the Stellar P3 Power Plant was introduced, bringing PS Power Regenerator power technology to a lower price-point. A Stellar phono preamp will be introduced in Q3 of 2019, and a Stellar integrated amplifier will be released in 2020. The Power Plant line of power regenerators has been periodically improved to ensure its continued superiority over all other power products. The latest generation consists of the P12, P15, amd P20 Power Plants, differing primarily in their power-handling capacity and number of outlets. All three models utilize FPGA- based DSD sine wave generators, which provide the purest AC sinewaves ever attainable, coupled with massive power supplies that allow the Power Plants to control even the most elaborate systems. Both the P12 and P20 are listed in Stereophile's Recommended Components list. At Rocky Mountain Audio Fest in October 2018, PS exhibited the final prototype loudspeakers created by the late Arnie Nudell, founder of both Infinity Systems and Genesis Technologies and longtime friend of and mentor to PS Audio. These speakers featured several characteristic Nudell design features: dual servo-controlled, powered woofers; a cone mid-bass coupler; a ribbon linesource midrange; and a line array of spiral ribbon tweeters. While these design points do not necessarily reflect how future PS Audio loudspeakers will be designed, they do serve as a basis for experimentation and developments. At Axpona in April, 2019, PS showed an initial prototype of the AN3 loudspeaker, intended to be the smallest of the AN line of speakers inspired by Arnie Nudell's work. Development continues in the AN line, which will eventually consist of the AN3, the smallest; the AN2, larger and more elaborate; and the AN1, a full-scale assault upon the state of the art, along the lines of the legendary Infinity IRS V. Less-expensive speakers are intended to be introduced below the AN line: a Stellar line, also consisting of 3 models; and at least one Sprout loudspeaker, designed to be compatible with the Sprout 100 in both appearance and capabilities. The company's outreach has greatly increased in recent years, by way of co- founder/CEO Paul McGowan's Daily Posts; his \\"Ask Paul\\" videos on YouTube; and Copper, a twice-monthly webzine devoted to music and audio that appears on the PS Audio website. PS Audio products have won dozens of awards worldwide, including Editors' Choice awards from Stereophile and The Absolute Sound magazines; since 2017, PS has had more products on Stereophile's Recommended Component lists than any other electronics manufacturer. ==References== * 1995 Review of the 200C Power amplifier from Stereophile Magazine * 1999 Review of the P-300 from \\"Secrets of Home Theater and High Fidelity\\" web magazine * 1999 Review of the P-300 in Stereophile Magazine * 2000 Review of the P-300 and P-600 from \\"Secrets of Home Theater and High Fidelity\\" web magazine * 2002 Review of the HCA-2 Power amplifier from Stereophile Magazine * 2006 Review of the GCC-100 Integrated (Control) Amplifier from Stereophile Magazine * 2007 Review of the Power Plant Premier (AC Regenerator) from 6moons * 2014 Review of the DirectStream DAC from 6moons * 2017 Review of the BHK Signature Preamp from Stereophile Magazine * 2016 Review of the BHK Signature Mono 300 Amplifier from The Absolute Sound Magazine * 2017 Review of the BHK Signature Stereo 250 Amplifier from Hi-Fi+ Magazine * 2017 Review of the Stellar Gain Cell DAC/Preamplifier from Positive Feedback * 2017 Review of the Stellar Gain Cell DAC/Preamplifier and S300 Stereo Amplifier from CNET/the Audiophiliac * 2018 Review of the Stellar Gain Cell DAC/Preamplifier and M700 Mono Amplifiers from AudioStream * 2018 Review of the DirectStream DAC with Snowmass OS from Audiophilia * 2018 Review of Sprout100 from The Absolute Sound Magazine * 2018 Review of Sprout100 with Elac Speakers from Twittering Machines * 2018 Review of Power Plant 20 from Stereophile Magazine * 2019 Review of Power Plant 15 from Tone Audio * 2019 Review of Power Plant 12 from Stereophile Magazine ==External links== * Category:Audio amplifier manufacturers Category:Compact Disc player manufacturers Category:Audio equipment manufacturers of the United States Category:Manufacturing companies based in Colorado ","title":"PS Audio"},{"id":"1280656","text":"The LSE/OS kernel was a research kernel designed by a French research laboratory named Epita System Laboratory.

Classic LRS employment is to infiltrate deep into enemy territory, construct hide and surveillance sites, and provide continuous surveillance/special reconnaissance of an intelligence target of key interest. LRS teams allow 24-hour surveillance and analysis coverage unlike unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), manned aircraft, and most satellites. Assuming there is no mission compromise, these teams typically remain in position for up to 6 days, as determined by the availability of food and water. As a result of an evaluation conducted using computer-modelling the U.S. Army's senior leadership made the decision to deactivate all active-duty and National Guard LRS units. By the end January 2017 the three active-duty LRS companies had ceased to exist, with its personnel being reassigned to other units. All National Guard LRS units followed suit in 2018. Army LRS units are officially a thing of the past. ==Mission== A soldier from Echo Company, 51st Infantry Company, Long-Range Surveillance, V Corps demonstrating a ghillie suit in 2004 Long Range Surveillance Units (LRSU) have four primary missions and five secondary missions as per FM 3-55.93 Long Range Surveillance Unit Operations. The five primary missions are surveillance, zone and area reconnaissance, target acquisition, and target interdiction. Combat assessment/battle damage assessment is mentioned as not a standalone LRSU mission but inherent to all LRSUs. The five secondary missions are able to be completed if given the proper training and time to coordinate. The secondary missions include route reconnaissance, emplacement and recovery of sensors, pathfinder operations, personnel recovery and combat search and rescue, and chemical detection and radiological surveillance and monitoring operations. LRS operations are characterized by the following: # Clandestine LRS operations require operational security (OPSEC) and personnel security (PERSEC) measures and procedures before, during, and after mission employment. This is to protect the individual team members as well as maintain operational integrity of the LRS cell. # Team members depend on stealth, cover, concealment, infantry, and Ranger skills. # Team members avoid contact with enemy forces and local population. # Teams are employed to obtain timely information. # Teams have restricted mobility in the area of operations. # Team members depend on communications, knowing the enemy's order of battle, and equipment identification skills. # The surveillance or reconnaissance area is small, has a specified route, or is a specific location or installation. # Team equipment and supplies are limited to what can be man packed or cached. # Teams require detailed intelligence preparation of the battlefield (IPB) and debriefing from the Intelligence Officer (G2) for employment.US Army Field Manual 7-93 Long- Range Surveillance Unit Operations. (FM 7-93) == Organization == LRS units (LRSU) are infantry company-size elements that are assets within a battlefield surveillance brigade's Reconnaissance & Surveillance Squadron (R&S; Squadron) designated as US Army Cavalry but are functionally Airborne infantry units. The LRSU is structured as an LRS Company comprising three LRS detachments, a communications Platoon, and a Troop Headquarters. Within the LRS company, the LRS detachments typically have designated specialties. Typically, there are three teams, also known as \\"DETs.\\" 1st DET typically specializes in mountainous terrain/ warefare. 2nd DET is HALO (High Altitude, Low Open), specializing in airborne operations. This means jumping from a high- performance military aircraft at an altitude in excess of ten thousand feet and deploying parachutes at one to two thousand feet. 2nd DET can also perform HAHO (High Altitude, High Open) operations. This means jumping from a high- performance military aircraft in excess of ten thousand feet and deploying parachutes shortly after leaving the aircraft. 3rd DET is the dive detachment, specializing in water-borne operations such as scuba diving and infiltrating harbors and ports as well as employing the Zodiac. LRS detachments are organized as five unsupported LRS teams. == LRS Team composition == As with LRRP units of the past each US Army LRS team is composed of six soldiers: * Team Leader (TL) Staff Sergeant (E-6) Preferably Ranger qualified * Assistant Team Leader (ATL) Sergeant (E-5) Preferably Ranger qualified * Senior Scout Observer (SSO) Specialist/Corporal (E-4) * Scout Observer (SO) Specialist/Corporal (E-4) * Radio Telephone Operator (RTO) Specialist (E-4) * Assistant Radio Telephone Operator (ARTO) Specialist (E-4) All positions can be held by (E-1 up) to fill positions (upon meeting unit requirements) == Reconnaissance and surveillance squadrons (R&S; squadrons) == United States Army long-range surveillance units are being reorganized into the recently introduced battlefield surveillance brigades (BfSBs). These brigades contain a brigade headquarters and headquarters company (HHC), two Military Intelligence (MI) battalions, and a reconnaissance and surveillance (R&S;) squadron. The R&S; squadrons conduct the same missions as RSTA units, but the R&S; capabilities are vastly broader and encompass all aspects of ISR. Additionally, LRS units have the added capability of conducting strategic- level long-range surveillance (LRS) missions deep behind enemy lines. Due to this specialized capability, the R&S; capability of LRS units is significantly more comprehensive than that of RSTA units. The missions of RSTA units may require them to make and maintain contact with the enemy, thereby forfeiting their ability to remain concealed and avoid detection and/or engagement. The only units within the United States Army to specialize in the capability and skill of the LRS mission are those of the LRS units within the BfSBs, Special Forces (SF) Operational Detachments-Alpha (SFODAs, ODAs, or A-Teams), and the Ranger Regimental Reconnaissance Company (RRC) of the 75th Ranger Regiment. The BfSB’s R&S; squadron is composed of one LRS unit (i.e., Company C), which contains 15 LRS teams. Additionally, the R&S; squadron also has two Cavalry troops (each containing two platoons) that conduct basic mounted and dismounted operations, and a headquarters and headquarters troop (HHT). For a standard six-soldier LRS team, the primary method of insertion/infiltration behind enemy lines is at night by helicopter (night-time heliborne), while secondary methods include airborne and waterborne operations. In recent low- intensity conflicts, additional covert methods have been added to enable enhanced operational capabilities. Airborne reconnaissance missions are conducted by the three aforementioned types of United States Army units: LRS units, SF ODAs, and the Ranger RRC. == Contrast with Reconnaissance, Surveillance, and Target Acquisition (RSTA) Units == Although both are types of units in the United States Army, LRS units (Airborne Infantry) are not to be confused with the newer concept of RSTA units (non-Airborne Cavalry). As part of the Army-wide transfer to brigade combat teams (BCTs), all combat divisions and separate brigades are transitioning to RSTA units. RSTA units also have added light vehicle support in the form of Humvees (HMMWVs) and M3 Bradley Cavalry Fighting Vehicles (CFVs), due to being commissioned as Cavalry. LRS units, in contrast, do not utilize a larger vehicle support element. As previously stated, RSTA units are not Airborne-capable, whereas most LRS units are. However, exceptions are the RSTA squadrons of the 4th BCT (Airborne), 25th Infantry Division; the 173rd Airborne BCT; and the four RSTA units in the 82nd Airborne Division). By doctrine, RSTA units do not require their leadership positions to be filled by Ranger-qualified commissioned and noncommissioned officers, whereas LRS units desire additional skills and special qualifications. == Equipment == LRS Soldiers typically carry weapons that include the following: M4 carbine, M9 pistol, M249 Squad Automatic Weapon (SAW/LMG), M203 grenade launcher, as well as mission-specific gear, including (but not limited to), optics, A/V recording devices, secure communications gear, etc. == Training == Since LRSUs are Airborne operations capable, the Soldiers serving in these units must be Airborne qualified (i.e., parachutists). Furthermore, many leadership ranks are commanded by both commissioned and noncommissioned officers that are Ranger qualified. LRS leaders typically graduate from the United States Army Reconnaissance and Surveillance Leaders Course (see link and course list below). LRS soldiers are often graduates of other specialized military courses and training, including: * U.S. Army Air Assault Course * U.S. Army Jumpmaster Course * U.S. Army Military Free Fall Parachutist Course * U.S. Army Pathfinder Course * U.S. Army Ranger Course * U.S. Army Reconnaissance and Surveillance Leaders Course (RSLC)1,2 * U.S. Army Special Forces Combat Diver Qualification Course (SFCDQC) * U.S. Army Special Forces Sniper Course (SFSC)3 * U.S. Army Special Forces Waterborne Infiltration Course (SFWIC) * U.S. Army Special Operations Combat Medic (SOCM) * U.S. Army Survival, Evasion, Resistance, and Escape (SERE) * U.S. Army Sniper Course United States Army LRSUs conduct training exercises and exchange programs with various U.S. allies. In recent years these exercises have included deployments to England, Germany, France, Hungary, and Italy. Combined/Joint training exercises have involved units from Britain’s TA SAS, France's 13e RDP, Belgium's ESR, Italy's 9th Parachute Assault Regiment, and Germany's FSLK200. International Special Training Center (ISTC), which trains NATO Special Operations Forces (SOFs) and similar units in advanced individual patrolling, battlefield medicine, close quarter battle (CQB), sniper, survival, planning, and recognition skills. Established in 1979, ISTC was originally named the International Long-Range Reconnaissance Patrol School (ILRRPS), and was formerly located in Weingarten, Germany before later moving to Pfullendorf, Germany. 1\\\\.

Whipple was born to missionary parents Williaam Levi Whipple and Mary Louise Whipple (née Allen), in Urmia, West Azerbaijan, Iran. He attended Princeton University and received his M.D. from the Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons (P&S;) in 1908, and was licensed to practice medicine in the state of New York on February 4, 1910 (NY License #10151). He became a professor of surgery at P&S; and Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center where he served from 1921 to 1946. He began work on the procedure for resection of the pancreas (pancreaticoduodenectomy) in 1935 and his original technique has since been modified greatly. In 1940, he shortened the procedure into a one-stage process. During his lifetime, Whipple performed 37 pancreaticoduodenectomies. He also is known for developing the diagnostic triad for insulinoma known as Whipple's triad. He supervised the surgical residency of Virginia Apgar, later advising her to pursue her medical career in the field of anaesthesiology because he knew that surgery depended on advancements in this field to progress, and he saw in Apgar the 'energy and ability' to make a significant contribution. Apgar later devised the Apgar Score also at Columbia- Presbyterian Medical Center, by which the health of newborns is evaluated to this day. Whipple was instrumental in founding the American Board of Surgery. He also was trustee of Princeton University and was a recipient of the 1958 Woodrow Wilson Award. Though he is not related to George Hoyt Whipple — who named Whipple's disease and discovered Tropheryma whipplei — the two were lifelong friends. The Science Building at Wooster School in Danbury, Connecticut, is named after Whipple, who served as President of Wooster's Board of Trustees when the school's founder, Rev. Aaron Coburn, died. == References == == Sources == *Whipple AO. Observations on radical surgery for lesions of the pancreas.

The blue marker denotes a fire hydrant on the left sidewalk. A raised pavement marker is a safety device used on roads. These devices are usually made with plastic, ceramic, thermoplastic paint, glass or occasionally metal, and come in a variety of shapes and colors. Raised reflective markers, such as plastic, ceramic, metal ones, include a lens or sheeting that enhances their visibility by retroreflecting automotive headlights, while glass road studs gather automotive headlights with a dome shape and reflect the lights with a reflective layer within. Some other names for specific types of raised pavement markers include convex vibration lines, Botts' dots, delineators, cat's eyes, road studs, or road turtles. Sometimes they are simply referred to as \\"reflectors\\". ==Convex vibration marking line== The surface of this type of vibrating coating line is distributed and scattered with raised bumps. Some bumps are coated with high-refractive-index glass beads. When a speeding vehicle runs over the raised road lines, it produces a strong warning vibration to remind the car driver of deviation from the lane. Perpendicular to driving directions, these marking lines are used for settled mainline toll plaza, ramp entrances, mountainous areas, continuous sharp turns, downhill sections and the end of the highway (intersection of highway exit and the plane of the common roadway), gates and entrances of enterprises, institutions, and school. In the same direction of traffic driving direction, they are mainly settled in the median strip, edge lines, and dangerous sections of the road. ==Reflective raised pavement markers== Snowplow- resistant reflective marker In the United States, Canada, and Australia, these plastic devices commonly have two angled edges facing drivers and containing one or more corner reflector strips. In areas where snowplowing is frequent, conventional markers are placed in a shallow groove cut in the pavement, or specially designed markers are used which include a protective metal casting that is embedded in recesses in the pavement, allowing the marker to protrude slightly above the pavement surface for increased visibility, much like a cat's eye. The marker is generally held in place using butyl pads, epoxy glue, or bitumen. In areas with little snowfall, reflective raised pavement markers are applied directly on top of the road surface rather than being embedded in the surface. The device's retroreflective surface enables the device to be clearly visible at long distances at night and in rainy weather. The devices come in multiple colors which vary in usage depending on local traffic marking standards. ===Usage of color in Europe=== M9 motorway in Carlow, Ireland with cat's eyes on the road surface and retroreflectors on barriers In almost all European countries, such markers will include reflective lenses of some kind. Most appear white or gray during daylight; the colors discussed here are the color of light they reflect. Because of their inconspicuousness during the day, they are always used in conjunction with painted retro-reflective lines; they are never seen on their own. *White markers -- for lane markings. When used on dual carriageways, motorways or one-way roads, they may illuminate red on the reverse, to indicate drivers are traveling the wrong way. *Yellow or amber markers -- These are found next to the central reservation (US: median) on motorways and dual carriageways and, in the Republic of Ireland, are also used on hard shoulders. *Red markers -- These are found by the hard shoulder on motorways and at the edge of the running surface on other roads. They are also occasionally used to indicate a no-entry road and when travelling down the wrong way of the motorway/dual carriageway. *Green markers -- These are used where slip-roads (US: off-ramp) leave and join the main carriageway on dual carriageways. In some countries, they are also used across the entrances of minor roads or accesses onto major single carriageway roads or lay-bys. *Blue markers -- Are used to indicate the entrance to police reserved slip- roads (these do not lead anywhere, they are to allow police to park and monitor motorway traffic). The exception to the above rules are: *Fluorescent yellow markers -- These are used to indicate temporary lanes during roadworks on major roads and are glued to the road surface; they are never embedded in it. Any painted markings will be removed from the road surface if they contradict the markers. They are fluorescent yellow in color, so they stand out in the day, but reflect white light at night. Where used, they are much more numerous and dense than standards markers, as they are not used in conjunction with painted lines. They also appear yellowon the edges but reflect red on the left side or amber on the right ===Usage of color in North America=== A white retroreflective raised pavement marker (Stimsonite design) A blue raised pavement marker (for marking the location of fire hydrants) *White markers -- for lane markings or to mark the right pavement edge. *Yellow or orange markers -- These separate traffic moving in opposite directions, or mark the left pavement edge on one-way roadways. *Blue markers -- Usually placed in the center of the roadway to mark the location of fire hydrants on the shoulder or at the curb. *Green markers -- Usually used to indicate that emergency vehicles can open gates to enter a gated community. *Red markers -- Usually indicate areas that are closed to traffic. Colors can also be combined, with a different color facing each direction: *White and red or yellow and red -- white or yellow for normal use in one direction, and red to indicate \\"do not enter\\" or \\"wrong way\\" in the other direction. Red-Clear Markers are primarily used to warn motorists they are going the wrong way; most people have never seen these because they show clear when approached in the correct direction, and only appear red to wrong-way drivers.California Department of Transportation (Caltrans) Standard Plan A20A & A20C *White and black -- white for marking lane restrictions (such as an HOV diamond) in one direction on a roadway that has \\"reversible\\" traffic flow, and black in the other direction when the markings do not apply. The current trend for lane markings is to intersperse retroreflective paint lines with reflectors as seen on the majority of American highways. === Usage of color in Australia === A red raised pavement marker stop valve While Australian designs generally follow those in the US, the colors generally follow European usage. Differences from European usage include: * Blue -- Usually used to mark the location of fire hydrants, as in North America * Yellow -- In addition to marking the median of freeways, in Victoria single yellow reflectors are used with broken yellow lines to denote tram tracks on which motorized traffic can drive, and double yellow reflectors are used with solid yellow lines to denote tram tracks on which motorized traffic may not drive other than to cross. ===History=== Retroreflective spheres set into a cat's eye in the UK Cat's eyes were the earliest form of retroreflective pavement markers, and are in use in the United Kingdom and other parts of the world. They were invented in the United Kingdom in 1933 by Percy Shaw and patented in 1934 (UK patents 436,290 and 457,536), and the United States in 1939 (US patent 2,146,359). On March 15, 1935, Shaw founded Reflecting Roadstuds Ltd, which became the first manufacturer of raised pavement markers. The designs now used widely throughout the United States didn't appear until more than a decade later. They are based on the invention of an engineer Sidney A. Heenan in the course of his employment with the Stimsonite Corporation in Niles, Illinois. Heenan filed an application for a patent on October 23, 1964. Patent No. 3,332,327 was subsequently granted on July 25, 1967. Practical use of Heenan's invention was not realized until an abrasion and impact-resistant coating was invented by engineer Ramon J. Ascencio of the Stimsonite Corporation, working with the original team. Ascencio et al., filed an application for patent April 20, 1977, which was subsequently granted under Patent No. 4,596,622 on June 24, 1986. Stimsonite went on to become the leading manufacturer of raised pavement markers in the United States and was acquired in the mid-1990s by Avery Dennison Corporation. For about a decade, Avery sold Stimsonite's line under its Sun Country brand. In 2006, Avery sold its raised pavement marker division to Ennis Paint, one of the largest manufacturers worldwide of paint for pavement markings (particularly lane markings). The company (based in Ennis, Texas) changed its name to Ennis Traffic Safety Solutions and now markets the Stimsonite product line (and descendants) under the Stimsonite brand. Other manufacturers of retroreflective raised pavement markers sold in the United States under various designs include 3M, Apex Universal, Volume, and Ray-O- Lite. ==Glass road studs== Side view of a glass road stud Glass road studs have a very special shape: the upper half is a dome shape, and the lower half is a base covered with a reflective layer. They come in a variety of colors and sizes to meet the requirements of different applications. Currently they are widely adopted in Taiwan and around the world. ==Cat's eyes== Cat's eyes, in their original form, consist of two pairs of retroreflective glass spheres set into a white rubber dome, mounted in a cast-iron housing. They generally come in a variety of colors. They have enjoyed widespread usage in the British Isles and elsewhere around the world. ==Botts' dots== A round, white Botts' dot Nonreflective raised pavement markers (also known as Botts' dots) are usually round, are white or yellow, and are frequently used on highways and interstates in lieu of painted lines. They are glued to the road surface with epoxy and as such are not suitable in areas where snow plowing is conducted. They are usually made out of plastic or ceramic materials. ==Pedestrian crossing studs== A Toucan crossing with markers visible. In this case thermoplastic paint has been used. In the UK, the area in which pedestrians should cross at pelican crossings is marked out by a series of markers. Usually, these are painted as squares on the road but occasionally a metal stud is used. These are usually square and made from unpainted steel or aluminum. ==Delineator== Delineators are tall pylons (similar to traffic cones or bollards) mounted on the road surface, or along the edge of a road, and are used to channelize traffic. These are a form of raised pavement marker but unlike most such markers, delineators are not supposed to be hit except by out-of-control or drifting vehicles. Unlike their smaller cousins, delineators are tall enough to impact not only a vehicle's tires but the vehicle body itself. They usually contain one or more retroreflective strips. They can be round and open in the center or curved (45-degree sections) of plastic with a reflective strip. They are also used in low reflective markers in a \\"T\\" shape. They can also be used to indicate lane closures as in cases where the number of lanes is reduced. The name \\"delineator\\" is also used for reflective devices attached to other objects which are technically not pavement markers. == See also == *Road surface marking *Rumble strips ==References== ==External links== Category: Road infrastructure Category: Road surface markings ","title":"Raised pavement marker"},{"id":"1280673","text":"Cellarius's illustration of Copernican heliocentrism, from the Harmonia Macrocosmica Andreas Cellarius (–1665) was a Dutch–German cartographer and cosmographer best known for his 1660 Harmonia Macrocosmica, a major star atlas. == Life == He was born in Neuhausen, and was educated in Heidelberg. The Protestant Cellarius may have left Heidelberg at the onset of the Thirty Years' War in 1618 or in 1622, when the city came in Catholic hands. His activities are unclear at this time but based on his later works it is conjectured that he spent time in Poland where he may have worked as a military engineer. In 1625, he married Catharina Eltemans in Amsterdam, where he worked as school master of a Latin school. After a brief stay in The Hague, the family moved to Hoorn. From 1637 until his death, he was rector of the Latin School in Hoorn, where Pieter Anthoniszoon Overtwater was conrector.

His father, Christiaan Willem Hendrik van der Post (1856-1914), a Hollander from Leiden, had emigrated to South Africa with his parents and married Johanna Lubbe in 1889. The van der Posts had a total of 13 children, with Laurens being the 13th. The fifth son. Christiaan was a lawyer and politician, and fought in the Second Boer War against the British. After the Second Boer War he was exiled with his family to Stellenbosch, where Laurens was conceived. They returned to Philippolis in the Orange River Colony, where he was born in 1906. He spent his early childhood years on the family farm, and acquired a taste for reading from his father's extensive library, which included Homer and Shakespeare. His father died in August 1914. In 1918 van der Post went to school at Grey College in Bloemfontein. There, he wrote, it was a great shock to him that he was \\"being educated into something which destroyed the sense of common humanity I shared with the black people\\". In 1925 he took his first job as a reporter in training at The Natal Advertiser in Durban, where his reporting included his own accomplishments playing on the Durban and Natal field hockey teams. In 1926 he and two other rebellious writers, Roy Campbell and William Plomer, published a satirical magazine called Voorslag () which criticised imperialist systems; it lasted for three issues before being forced to shut down because of its controversial views. Later that year he took off for three months with Plomer and sailed to Tokyo and back on a Japanese freighter, the Canada Maru, an experience which produced books by both authors later in life. In 1927 van der Post met Marjorie Edith Wendt (d. 1995), daughter of the founder and conductor of the Cape Town Orchestra. The couple traveled to England and on 8 March 1928, married at Bridport, Dorset. A son was born on 26 December, named Jan Laurens (later known as John). In 1929 van der Post returned to South Africa to work for the Cape Times, a newspaper in Cape Town, where \\"For the time being Marjorie and I are living in the most dire poverty that exists,\\" he wrote in his journal. He began to associate with bohemians and intellectuals who were opposed to James Hertzog (Prime Minister) and the white South African policy. In an article entitled 'South Africa in the Melting Pot', which clarified his views of the South Africa racial problem, he said \\"The white South African has never consciously believed that the native should ever become his equal.\\" But he predicted that \\"the process of leveling up and inter-mixture must accelerate continually ... the future civilization of South Africa is, I believe, neither black or white but brown.\\" ==The Bloomsbury influence== In 1931 van der Post returned to England. His friend Plomer had been published by the Hogarth Press, a business run by Leonard Woolf and his wife, the novelist Virginia Woolf. The Woolfs were members of the literary and artistic Bloomsbury group, and through Plomer's introductions, van der Post also met figures such as Arthur Waley, J. M. Keynes and E. M. Forster. In 1934 the Woolfs published van der Post's first novel. Called In a Province, it portrayed the tragic consequences of a racially and ideologically divided South Africa. Later that year he decided to become a dairy farmer and, possibly with the help of the independently wealthy poet Lilian Bowes Lyon, bought Colley Farm, near Tetbury, Gloucestershire, with Lilian as his neighbor. There he divided his time between the needs of the cows and occasional visits to London, where he was a correspondent to South African newspapers. He considered this a directionless phase in his life which mirrored Europe's slow drift to war. In 1936 he made five trips to South Africa and during one trip he met and fell in love with Ingaret Giffard (1902 – 1997), an English actress and author five years his senior. Later that year his wife Marjorie gave birth to a second child, a daughter named Lucia, and in 1938 he sent his family back to South Africa. When the Second World War started in 1939 he found himself torn between England and South Africa, his new love and his family; his career was at a dead end, and he was in depressed spirits, often drinking heavily. ==War service== In May 1940, van der Post volunteered for the British Army and upon completion of officer training in January 1941 he was sent to East Africa in the Intelligence Corps as a captain. There he took up with General Wingate's Gideon Force which was tasked with restoring the Emperor Haile Selassie to his throne in Abyssinia. His unit led 11,000 camels through difficult mountain terrain and he was remembered for being an excellent caretaker of the animals. In March he came down with malaria and was sent to Palestine to recover. In early 1942, as Japanese forces invaded South East Asia, van der Post was transferred to Allied forces in the Dutch East Indies (Indonesia), because of his Dutch language skills. By his own statement, he was given command of Special Mission 43, the purpose of which was to organise the covert evacuation of as many Allied personnel as possible, after the surrender of Java. On 20 April 1942, he surrendered to the Japanese. He was taken to prison-camps first at Sukabumi and then to Bandung. Van der Post was famous for his work in maintaining the morale of prisoners of many different nationalities. Along with others, he organised a \\"camp university\\" with courses from basic literacy to degree-standard ancient history, and he also organized a camp farm to supplement nutritional needs. He could also speak some basic Japanese, which helped him greatly. Once, depressed, he wrote in his diary: \\"It is one of the hardest things in this prison life: the strain caused by being continually in the power of people who are only half-sane and live in a twilight of reason and humanity.\\" He wrote about his prison experiences in A Bar of Shadow (1954), The Seed and the Sower (1963) and The Night of the New Moon (1970). Japanese film director Nagisa Oshima based his film Merry Christmas, Mr. Lawrence (1982) on the last two of these books. Following the surrender of Japan, while his fellow POWs were repatriated, van der Post chose to remain in Java, and on 15 September 1945, he joined Admiral Wilfrid Patterson on for the official surrender of the Japanese in Java to British forces representing the Allies. Van der Post then spent two years helping to mediate between Indonesian nationalists and members of the Dutch Colonial Government. He had gained trust with the nationalist leaders such as Mohammad Hatta and Sukarno and warned both Prime Minister Clement Attlee and the Allied Supreme Commander in South East Asia, Admiral Lord Louis Mountbatten, whom he met in London in October 1945, that the country was on the verge of blowing up. Van der Post went to The Hague to repeat his warning directly to the Dutch cabinet. In November 1946, British forces withdrew and van der Post became military attaché to the British consulate in Batavia. By 1947, after he had returned to England, the Indonesian Revolution had begun. That same year, van der Post retired from the army and was made a CBE. The events of these early post-war years in Java are examined in his memoir The Admiral's Baby (1996). ==Post-war life== With the war over and his business with the army concluded, van der Post returned to South Africa in late 1947 to work at the Natal Daily News, but with the election victory of the National Party and the onset of apartheid he came back to London. He was later to publish a critique of apartheid (The Dark Eye in Africa, 1955), basing many of his insights on his developing interest in psychology. In May 1949 he was commissioned by the Colonial Development Corporation (CDC) to \\"assess the livestock capacities of the uninhabited Nyika and Mulanje plateaux of Nyasaland\\" (now part of Malawi). Around this time he divorced Marjorie, and on 13 October 1949, married Ingaret Giffard. Before he married Ingaret, he had become engaged to Fleur Kohler-Baker, the daughter of a prominent farmer and businessman, who was 17 years old; they had met on a ship and had had an intense but brief affair of love letters; she was shocked when he broke off the relationship. He went on honeymoon with Ingaret to Switzerland, where his new wife introduced him to Carl Jung. Jung was to have probably a greater influence upon him than anybody else, and he later said that he had never met anyone of Jung's stature. He continued to work on a travel book about his Nyasaland adventures called Venture to the Interior, which became an immediate best-seller in the US and Europe on its publication in 1952. In 1950 Lord Reith (head of the CDC) asked van der Post to head an expedition to Bechuanaland (now part of Botswana), to see the potential of the remote Kalahari Desert for cattle ranching. There van der Post for the first time met the hunter-gatherer bush people known as Bushmen or San. He repeated the journey to the Kalahari in 1952. In 1953 he published his third book, The Face Beside the Fire, a semi-autobiographical novel about a psychologically \\"lost\\" artist in search of his soul and soul-mate, which clearly shows Jung's influence on his thinking and writing. Flamingo Feather (1955) was an anti- communist novel in the guise of a Buchanesque adventure story, about a Soviet plot to take over South Africa. It sold very well. Alfred Hitchcock planned to film the book, but lost support from South African authorities and gave up the idea. Penguin Books kept Flamingo Feather in print until the collapse of the Soviet Union. In 1955 the BBC commissioned van der Post to return to the Kalahari in search of the Bushmen, a journey that turned into a six-part television documentary series in 1956. In 1958 his best known book was published under the same title as the BBC series: The Lost World of the Kalahari. He followed this in 1961 by The Heart of the Hunter, derived from Specimens of Bushman Folklore (1910), collected by Wilhelm Bleek and Lucy Lloyd, and Mantis and His Hunter, collected by Dorothea Bleek. Van der Post described the Bushmen as the original natives of southern Africa, outcast and persecuted by all other races and nationalities. He said they represented the \\"lost soul\\" of all mankind, a type of noble savage myth. This mythos of the Bushmen inspired the colonial government to create the Central Kalahari Game Reserve in 1961 to guarantee their survival, and the reserve became a part of settled law when Botswana was created in 1966. ==Later years== Van der Post had become a respected television personality, had introduced the world to the Kalahari Bushmen, and was considered an authority on Bushman folklore and culture. \\"I was compelled towards the Bushmen,\\" he said, \\"like someone who walks in his sleep, obedient to a dream of finding in the dark what the day has denied him.\\" Over the next fifteen years he had a steady stream of publications, including the two books drawn from his war experiences (see above), a travel book called A Journey into Russia (1964) describing a long trip through the Soviet Union, and two novels of adventure set on the fringes of the Kalarahi desert, A Story Like the Wind (1972) and its sequel A Far-Off Place (1974). The latter volumes, about four young people, two of them San, caught up in violent events on the borders of 1970s Rhodesia, became popular as class readers in secondary schools. In 1972 there was a BBC television series about his 16-year friendship with Jung, who died in 1961, which was followed by the book Jung and the Story of our Time (1976). Ingaret and he moved to Aldeburgh, Suffolk, where they became involved with a circle of friends that included an introduction to Prince Charles, whom he then took on a safari to Kenya in 1977 and with whom he had a close and influential friendship for the rest of his life. Also in 1977, together with Ian Player, a South African conservationist, he created the first World Wilderness Congress in Johannesburg. In 1979 his Chelsea neighbor Margaret Thatcher became Prime Minister and she called on his advice with matters dealing with southern Africa, notably the Rhodesia settlement of 1979-80\\\\. In 1981 he was given a Knighthood. In 1982 he fell and injured his back and used the downtime from tennis and skiing to write an autobiography called Yet Being Someone Other (1982), which discussed his love of the sea and his journey to Japan with Plomer in 1926. (His affection for that country and its people, despite his wartime experiences, had first been explored in 1968 in his Portrait of Japan.) By now Ingaret was slipping into senility, and he spent much time with Frances Baruch, an old friend. In 1984 his son John (who had gone on to be an engineer in London) died, and van der Post spent time with his youngest daughter Lucia and her family. The Laurens van der Post Memorial Centre in Philippolis, South Africa In old age Sir Laurens van der Post was involved with many projects, from the worldwide conservationist movement, to setting up a centre of Jungian studies in Cape Town. A Walk with a White Bushman (1986), the transcript of a series of interviews, gives a taste of his appeal as a conversationalist. In 1996, he tried to prevent the eviction of the Bushmen from their homeland in the Central Kalahari Game Reserve, which had been set up for that purpose, but ironically it was his work in the 1950s to promote the land for cattle ranching that led to their eventual removal. In October 1996 he published The Admiral's Baby, describing the events in Java at the end of the war. His 90th birthday celebration was spread over five days in Colorado, with a \\"this is your life\\" type event with friends from every period of his life. A few days later, on 16 December 1996, after whispering in Afrikaans \\"die sterre\\" (the stars), he died. The funeral took place on 20 December in London, attended by Zulu chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi, Prince Charles, Margaret Thatcher, and many friends and family. His ashes were buried in a special memorial garden at Philippolis on 4 April 1998. Ingaret died five months after him on 5 May 1997. ==Posthumous controversy== After his death a number of writers questioned the accuracy of van der Post's claims about his life. His reputation as a \\"modern sage\\" and \\"guru\\" was questioned, and journalists published examples of van der Post's embellishing the truth in his memoirs and travel books, most notably J.D.F. Jones' who in his authorised biography Teller of Many Tales: The Lives of Laurens van der Post (2001) claimed that van der Post was \\"a fraud, a fantasist, a liar, a serial adulterer and a paternalist. He falsified his Army record and inflated his own importance at every possible opportunity.\\" A rebuttal was published by Christopher Booker (van der Post's ODNB biographer and friend) in The Spectator. ==Selected works== For a complete list see External links. *In a Province; novel (1934; reprinted 1953). *Venture to the Interior; travel (1952). *The Face Beside the Fire; novel (1953). *A Bar of Shadow; novella (1954). *Flamingo Feather; novel (1955). *The Dark Eye in Africa; politics, psychology (1955). *The Lost World of the Kalahari; travel (1958) [BBC 6-part TV series, 1956]. *The Heart of the Hunter; travel, folklore (1961). *The Seed and the Sower; three novellas (1963). *A Journey into Russia (US title: A View of All the Russias); travel (1964). *A Portrait of Japan; travel (1968). *The Night of the New Moon (US title: The Prisoner and the Bomb); wartime memoirs (1970). *A Story Like the Wind; novel (1972). *A Far-Off Place; novel, sequel to the above (1974). *Jung and the Story of Our Time; psychology, memoir (1975). *Yet Being Someone Other; memoir, travel (1982). *A Walk with A White Bushman; interview-transcripts (1986). *The Admiral's Baby; memoir (1996). ==Movies== Film adaptations of his books. * Merry Christmas, Mr. Lawrence (1983)—based on The Seed and the Sower (1963) and The Night of the New Moon (1970), about his experience as a prisoner of war.

The root cause is thought to be loss of soluble proteins within the fluid contained in the disc with resultant reduction of the oncotic pressure, which in turn causes loss of fluid volume. Normal downward forces cause the affected disc to lose height, and the distance between vertebrae is reduced. The anulus fibrosus, the rigid outer shell of a disc, also weakens. This loss of height causes laxity of the longitudinal ligaments, which may allow anterior, posterior, or lateral shifting of the vertebral bodies, causing facet joint malalignment and arthritis; scoliosis; cervical hyperlordosis; thoracic hyperkyphosis; lumbar hyperlordosis; narrowing of the space available for the spinal tract within the vertebra (spinal stenosis); or narrowing of the space through which a spinal nerve exits (vertebral foramen stenosis) with resultant inflammation and impingement of a spinal nerve, causing a radiculopathy. DDD can cause mild to severe pain, either acute or chronic, near the involved disc, as well as neuropathic pain if an adjacent spinal nerve root is involved. Diagnosis is suspected when typical symptoms and physical findings are present; and confirmed by x-rays of the vertebral column. Occasionally the radiologic diagnosis of disc degeneration is made incidentally when a cervical x-ray, chest x-ray, or abdominal x-ray is taken for other reasons, and the abnormalities of the vertebral column are recognized. The diagnosis of DDD is not a radiologic diagnosis, since the interpreting radiologist is not aware whether there are symptoms present or not. Typical radiographic findings include disc space narrowing, displacement of vertebral bodies, fusion of adjacent vertebral bodies, and development of bone in adjacent soft tissue (osteophyte formation). An MRI is typically reserved for those with symptoms, signs, and x-ray findings suggesting the need for surgical intervention. Treatment may include chiropractic to reduce pain and increase any reduced range of motion (ROM) of the spine; Physical Therapy for pain relief, ROM, and appropriate muscle/strength training with emphasis on correcting abnormal posture, assisting the paravertebral (paraspinous) muscles in stabilizing the spine, and core muscle strengthening; stretching exercises; massage therapy; oral analgesia with non-steroidal anti- inflammatory agents (NSAIDS); and topical analgesia with lidocaine, ice and heat. Immediate surgery may be indicated if the symptoms are severe or sudden in onset, or there is a sudden worsening of symptoms. Elective surgery may be indicated after six months of conservative therapy with unsatisfactory relief of symptoms. == Signs and symptoms == Degenerative disc disease can result in lower back or upper neck pain. The amount of degeneration does not correlate well with the amount of pain patients experience. Many people experience no pain while others, with the same amount of damage have severe, chronic pain. Whether a patient experiences pain or not largely depends on the location of the affected disc and the amount of pressure that is being put on the spinal column and surrounding nerve roots. Nevertheless, degenerative disc disease is one of the most common sources of back pain and affects approximately 30 million people every year. With symptomatic degenerative disc disease, the pain can vary depending on the location of the affected disc. A degenerated disc in the lower back can result in lower back pain, sometimes radiating to the hips, as well as pain in the buttocks, thighs or legs. If pressure is being placed on the nerves by exposed nucleus pulposus, sporadic tingling or weakness through the knees and legs can also occur. A degenerated disc in the upper neck will often result in pain to the neck, arm, shoulders and hands; tingling in the fingers may also be evident if nerve impingement is occurring. Pain is most commonly felt or worsened by movements such as sitting, bending, lifting and twisting. After an injury, some discs become painful because of inflammation and the pain comes and goes. Some people have nerve endings that penetrate more deeply into the anulus fibrosus (outer layer of the disc) than others, making discs more likely to generate pain. In the alternative, the healing of trauma to the outer anulus fibrosus may result in the innervation of the scar tissue and pain impulses from the disc, as these nerves become inflamed by nucleus pulposus material. Degenerative disc disease can lead to a chronic debilitating condition and can have a serious negative impact on a person's quality of life. When pain from degenerative disc disease is severe, traditional nonoperative treatment may be ineffective. == Cause == There is a disc between each of the vertebrae in the spine. A healthy, well-hydrated disc will contain a great deal of water in its center, known as the nucleus pulposus, which provides cushioning and flexibility for the spine. Much of the mechanical stress that is caused by everyday movements is transferred to the discs within the spine and the water content within them allows them to effectively absorb the shock. At birth, a typical human nucleus pulposus will contain about 80% water. However natural daily stresses and minor injuries can cause these discs to gradually lose water as the annulus fibrosus, or the rigid outer shell of a disc, weakens. Because degenerative disc disease is largely due to natural daily stresses, the American Academy of Orthopaedic Manual Physical Therapists have suggested it is not truly a \\"disease\\" process. This water loss makes the discs less flexible and results in the gradual collapse and narrowing of the gap in the spinal column. As the space between vertebrae gets smaller, extra pressure can be placed on the discs causing tiny cracks or tears to appear in the annulus. If enough pressure is exerted, it is possible for the nucleus pulposus material to seep out through the tears in the annulus and can cause what is known as a herniated disc. As the two vertebrae above and below the affected disc begin to collapse upon each other, the facet joints at the back of the spine are forced to shift which can affect their function. Additionally, the body can react to the closing gap between vertebrae by creating bone spurs around the disc space in an attempt to stop excess motion. This can cause issues if the bone spurs start to grow into the spinal canal and put pressure on the spinal cord and surrounding nerve roots as it can cause pain and affect nerve function. This condition is called spinal stenosis. For women, there is evidence that menopause and related estrogen-loss are associated with lumbar disc degeneration, usually occurring during the first 15 years of the climacteric. The potential role of sex hormones in the etiology of degenerative skeletal disorders is being discussed for both genders. Mutations in several genes have been implicated in intervertebral disc degeneration. Probable candidate genes include type I collagen (sp1 site), type IX collagen, vitamin D receptor, aggrecan, asporin, MMP3, interleukin-1, and interleukin-6 polymorphisms. Mutation in genes – such as MMP2 and THBS2 – that encode for proteins and enzymes involved in the regulation of the extracellular matrix has been shown to contribute to lumbar disc herniation. == Mechanisms == Micrograph of a fragment of a resected degenerative vertebral disc, showing degenerative fibrocartilage and clusters of chondrocytes. HPS stain. Degenerative discs typically show degenerative fibrocartilage and clusters of chondrocytes, suggestive of repair. Inflammation may or may not be present. Histologic examination of disc fragments resected for presumed DDD is routine to exclude malignancy. Fibrocartilage replaces the gelatinous mucoid material of the nucleus pulposus as the disc changes with age. There may be splits in the anulus fibrosus, permitting herniation of elements of nucleus pulposus. There may also be shrinkage of the nucleus pulposus that produces prolapse or folding of the anulus fibrosus with secondary osteophyte formation at the margins of the adjacent vertebral body. The pathologic findings in DDD include protrusion, spondylolysis, and subluxation of vertebrae (spondylolisthesis) and spinal stenosis. It has been hypothesized that Cutibacterium acnes may play a role. == Diagnosis == Diagnosis of degenerative disc disease will usually consist of an analysis of a patient's individual medical history, a physical exam designed to reveal muscle weakness, tenderness or poor range of motion, and an x-ray to confirm the diagnosis and rule out other causes. == Treatment == Often, degenerative disc disease can be successfully treated without surgery. One or a combination of treatments such as physical therapy, anti-inflammatory medications such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, traction, or epidural steroid injection often provide adequate relief of troubling symptoms. Surgery may be recommended if the conservative treatment options do not provide relief within two to three months. If leg or back pain limits normal activity, if there is weakness or numbness in the legs, if it is difficult to walk or stand, or if medication or physical therapy are ineffective, surgery may be necessary, most often spinal fusion. There are many surgical options for the treatment of degenerative disc disease, including anterior and posterior approaches. The most common surgical treatments include: Traditional approaches in treating patients with DDD- resultant herniated discs oftentimes include discectomy — which, in essence, is a spine-related surgical procedure involving the removal of damaged intervertebral discs (either whole removal, or partially-based). The former of these two discectomy techniques involved in open discectomy is known as Subtotal Discectomy (SD; or, aggressive discectomy) and the latter, Limited Discectomy (LD; or, conservative discectomy). However, with either technique, the probability of post-operative reherniation exists and at a considerably high maximum of 21%, prompting patients to potentially undergo recurrent disk surgery. New treatments are emerging that are still in the beginning clinical trial phases. Glucosamine injections may offer pain relief for some without precluding the use of more aggressive treatment options. In the US, artificial disc replacement is viewed cautiously as a possible alternative to fusion in carefully selected patients, yet it is widely used in a broader range of cases in Europe, where multi-level disc replacement of the cervical and lumbar spine is common. Adult stem cell or cell transplantation therapies for disc regeneration are in their infancy of development, but initial clinical trials have shown cell transplantation to be safe and initial observations suggest some beneficial effects for associated pain and disability. An optimal cell type, transplantation method, cell density, carrier, or patient indication remains to be determined. Investigation into mesenchymal stem cell therapy knife-less fusion of vertebrae in the United States began in 2006 and a DiscGenics nucleus pulposus progenitor cell transplantation clinical trial has started as of 2018 in the USA and Japan. Researchers and surgeons have conducted clinical and basic science studies to uncover the regenerative capacity possessed by the large animal species involved (humans and quadrupeds) for potential therapies to treat the disease. Some therapies, carried out by research laboratories in New York, include introduction of biologically-engineered, injectable riboflavin cross-linked high density collagen (HDC-laden) gels into disease spinal segments to induce regeneration, ultimately restoring functionality and structure to the two main inner and outer components of vertebral discs — anulus fibrosus and the nucleus pulposus. Burgeoning evidence suggests that long-term running may mitigate age-related degeneration within lumbar intervertebral discs. However, a 6-month randomized controlled trial showed that general strength and conditioning exercise training did not benefit the lumbar intervertebral discs of patients with non-specific chronic low back pain. ==Other animals== Degenerative disc disease can occur in other mammals besides humans. It is a common problem in several dog breeds, and attempts to remove this disease from dog populations have led to several hybrid breeds, such as the Chiweenie. == See also == *Failed back syndrome == References == == External links == Category:Chronic pain syndromes Category:Bones of the vertebral column ","title":"Degenerative disc disease"},{"id":"1280781","text":"Paul Smith is probably best known as the founder and manager of Blast First, the British alternative record label that released artists such as Sonic Youth, the Butthole Surfers, Big Black and Dinosaur Jr. in the UK.

His reconstructions of medieval battles from the fragmentary and distorted accounts left by chroniclers were pioneering. Occasionally his interpretations have been challenged, especially his widely copied thesis that British troops defeated their Napoleonic opponents by firepower alone . Paddy Griffith, among modern historians, claims that the British infantry's discipline and willingness to attack were equally important. ==Early life== Oman was born in Muzaffarpur district, India, the son of a British planter, and was educated at Winchester College and at Oxford University, where he studied under William Stubbs. Here, he was invited to become a founding member of the Stubbs Society, which was under the patronage of Oman's don. ==Career== In 1881 he was elected to a Prize Fellowship at All Souls College, where he remained for the rest of his academic career. He was elected the Chichele Professor of Modern History at Oxford in 1905, in succession to Montagu Burrows. He was also elected to the FBA that year, and served as President of the Royal Historical Society (1917–1921), the Numismatic Society and the Royal Archaeological Institute. Oman's academic career was interrupted by the First World War, during which he was employed by the government's Press Bureau and the Foreign Office. Oman was the Conservative Member of Parliament for the University of Oxford constituency from 1919 to 1935, and was knighted KBE in the 1920 civilian war honours list. ==Honours== He became an honorary fellow of New College in 1936, and received the honorary degrees of DCL (Oxford, 1926) and LL.D (Edinburgh, 1911 and Cambridge, 1927). He was awarded the Medal of the Royal Numismatic Society in 1928. He died at Oxford aged 86. ==Children== Two of Oman's children became authors. His daughter Carola Oman CBE was a writer of history, biography, and fiction for adults and children, including a retelling of the Robin Hood legend and biographies of Admiral Lord Nelson and Lieutenant-General Sir John Moore.

On 16 April 1884, he married Amalie (\\"Emma\\") Henriette Jessen (born 18 September 1861 in Hamburg, died 9 July 1945 in Greifswald). They had a daughter and three sons.Staatsarchiv Hamburg, 741-2, Genealogische Sammlung, Bernheim ==Career== Ernst attended the Johanneum from Easter 1862 and graduated with the Abitur on 22 September 1868. From 1868 to 1872, he studied history in Berlin, Heidelberg, and Straßburg He graduated with the grades Dr. phil and Dr jur. in Straßburg (1873, supervised by Georg Waitz) and Dr habil in Göttingen (1874-75, supervised by Julius Weizsäcker). Thereafter, he taught history at the University of Göttingen and at the University of Bonn. In 1883, he was called to the University of Greifswald, Institute for History, where he held the positions of an \\"außerordentlicher Professor\\" (\\"Privatdozent\\") since 1883, and \\"ordentlicher Professor\\" since 1889. In 1899, he was elected rector of the university. His eremitation was in 1921. ==Nazi era== His Jewish descent made Bernheim subject to repressions during the Nazi era. In 1933, he was forbidden to lecture, and an appeal to Adolf Hitler to regain that permission was not successful. On 4 December 1935, with the implementation of the Nuremberg Laws, Berheim lost German citizenship. An appeal to Hitler to regain citizenship, which was backed by a number of scientists from the University of Greifswald was successful, and Bernheim was assigned \\"temporary citizenship\\" on 12 January 1938 and let him avoid deportation in 1940. Yet, just weeks before his death, the deaf-mute foster child of the family, Hetti Meyer, was deported to Theresienstadt and killed. Hetti was raised from her birth by Bernheim and his wife Emma, a special education teacher. From 1939 onwards, Nazi scientists systematically besmirched Bernheim's scientific work, which was not appreciated again until postwar Germany. Bernheim died on 3 March 1942 in Greifswald. His former colleagues managed to circumvent Nazi orders and to get his urn buried in the town's graveyard on 23 July 1943, but an obituary was not permitted. ==Legacy== A memorial plaque was attached to his Greifswald house, at 26 Arndtstraße. Furthermore, a street in Greifswald was named after him. ==References== * Irene Blechle, Entdecker der Hochschulpädagogik. Die Universitätsreformer Ernst Bernheim und Hans Schmidkunz.

He showed an interest in aviation at an early age. He often rode his bike to Floyd Bennett Field where he occasionally got free flights from a family friend. During his teenage years, his family moved to Tampa, Florida, inside the traffic pattern of Drew Army Air Field, so he could see Army Air Corps fighters flying overhead. That hardened his resolve to become a fighter pilot. ==Military career== Lopez learned to fly in college, then volunteered for the Army Air Forces Aviation Cadet Program when the age limit was lowered to 18 in early 1942. ===World War II=== After earning his wings, he saw combat in China as a member of the 75th Fighter Squadron. The unit was part of the 23rd Fighter Group, successor to the famed Flying Tigers. He became an ace, credited with shooting down five Japanese fighters, four in a P-40 Warhawk and one in a P-51 Mustang, while flying 101 missions. ===Post war=== Lopez returned to Florida in 1945 and served as a fighter test pilot at Eglin Field, flying most of the early jet fighters. He served a brief tour of duty in the Korea War in August and September 1950 as an F-86 Sabre pilot with the 4th Fighter-Interceptor Wing. After Korea, he served two tours in the Pentagon, earned a B.S. and M.S. in aeronautical engineering, and was an associate professor of thermodynamics at the United States Air Force Academy, until his retirement from the Air Force on 1964. ==Personal life== In 1948 he married Glindel Barron, sister of Florida State Senator Dempsey Barron. He and Glindel have two children, Joy Lopez and Donald S. Lopez Jr. (currently a professor of Buddhist studies at the University of Michigan), and one grandchild, Laura V. Lopez. ==Later life== Following his retirement from the Air Force in 1964, he spent eight years as an engineer on the Apollo and Skylab programs with Bellcomm, Inc., a subsidiary of Bell Labs. In 1972, he joined the staff of the National Air and Space Museum. He was heavily involved in developing and running the National Air and Space Museum, during his later years. His publications include two memoirs, Into the Teeth of the Tiger (Smithsonian, 1997, ), and Fighter Pilot's Heaven: Flight Testing the Early Jets (Smithsonian, 2001, ).

As of January 2016, Forbes ranked him as 1250th on the list of wealthiest people in the world, with a fortune of US$1.44 billion. Pinchuk is the founder of EastOne Group LLC, an international investing, project funding and financial advisory company based in London, and of Interpipe Group, one of Ukraine's leading pipe, wheel and steel producers. Pinchuk is the owner of four TV channels and a popular tabloid, Fakty i Kommentarii. He has been a member of the Ukrainian parliament, the Verkhovna Rada, for two consecutive terms from 1998 to 2006. He is married to Olena Pinchuk, the daughter of former Ukrainian President Leonid Kuchma. ==Early life and career== Pinchuk was born in 1960 in Kyiv to Jewish parents who moved to the industrial city of Dnipropetrovsk. He graduated from Dnipropetrovsk Metallurgical Institute with a doctorate in industrial engineering in 1987. Three years later, he founded the Interpipe Company on the basis of his patented innovations, which were adopted by leading metallurgical factories in the USSR. Interpipe is a major producer of seamless pipes and railway wheels. In 2004, Pinchuk and Rinat Akhmetov, two of Ukraine's richest men, acquired the Kryvorizhstal steel factory for about $800 million. President Leonid Kuchma, who is Pinchuk's father-in-law, authorized the state asset sale, which competitors complained was far below market rate. Later, the first Tymoshenko government reversed this sale, and held a nationally-televised repeat auction that netted $4.8 billion.Monopolies thrive as toothless state bows to moguls, Kyiv Post (18 March 2010) In 2006, Pinchuk founded an investment advisory company, EastOne. Its portfolio includes industrial assets such as production of pipes and tubes, rail car wheels, specialty steels and alloys, machinery, as well as media. Pinchuk was a member of the Ukrainian Parliament between 1998 and 2006 for Labour Ukraine.Ukraine Political Parties, GlobalSecurity.org He left politics after he came to the conclusion that Ukraine had reached a level of development when business and politics should be separated. Pinchuk is a member of the Board of the Peterson Institute for International Economics, of the International Advisory Council of Brookings Institution and of the Corporate Advisory Board of the Global Business Coalition against HIV/AIDS, TB and Malaria. Pinchuk holds a share of VS Energy International Ukraine together with Mikhail Spektor and Igor Kolomoisky. In 2013, American steel makers filed a case with the United States Department of Commerce alleging that Interpipe Group was illegally dumping steel tubes into the American natural gas market. In November 2013, Fitch Ratings downgraded Interpipe because of the dumping accusations and a missed $106 million debt payment. In 2015, Pinchuk brought a $2 billion civil action against fellow Ukrainian oligarchs Ihor Kolomoyskyi and Gennadiy Bogolyubov in the High Court of Justice in London over the 2004 purchase of a Ukrainian mining company. Allegations made include murder and bribery. In January 2016, an undisclosed out of court settlement was reached just before the trial was due to start. ==Philanthropy== Pinchuk has supported philanthropic projects in Ukraine. In 2006, he consolidated these activities under the Victor Pinchuk Foundation, which is now considered the largest private Ukrainian philanthropic foundation. The foundation is active in the fields of health, education, culture, international affairs, human rights and local communities.Chrystia Freeland, Supper with the FT: Victor Pinchuk,Financial Times, 11 December 2009 The foundation's projects include the largest private scholarship program in Ukraine \\"Zavtra.UA\\", the scholarship program for Ukrainian students studying abroad \\"WorldWideStudies\\", and the annual \\"Ukrainian Lunch\\" and \\"Philanthropic Roundtable\\" on the occasion of the World Economic Forum in Davos. The foundation supports and works with a variety of partners, including the network \\"Yalta European Strategy\\" created to promote Ukraine's European integration, the Clinton Global Initiative, the Kyiv School of Economics, Tony Blair Faith Foundation, the Brookings Institution, the Peterson Institute for International Economics, the Israeli Presidential Conference \\"Facing Tomorrow\\", and the legal clinics/legal aid projects of the Renaissance Foundation.

As an initiative of the Pinchuk Art Center,Carol Vogel, New Prize to Honor Artists Under 35, The New York Times (7 December 2009) in December 2009, Pinchuk announced a new $100,000 prize for artists under the age of 35. The Future Generation Art Prize is awarded every two years and is open to any young artist who applies online. Damien Hirst, Takashi Murakami, Andreas Gursky and Jeff Koons, artists whose work Pinchuk collects, serve as mentors to the finalists and the winner. In February 2013, Pinchuk committed to giving half or more of his fortune during his lifetime and beyond to philanthropic causes, joining the Giving Pledge, a philanthropic initiative founded in 2010 by Bill Gates and Warren Buffett. Pinchuk has donated from $10 to $25 million to the Clinton Foundation between 1994 and 2005. In 2000, Pinchuk hired former Clinton pollster Douglas Schoen on a $40,000 per month retainer. In 2004, Schoen introduced Pinchuk to Hillary Clinton. Between September 2011 and November 2012, Sochen arranged nearly a dozen meetings between Pinchuk and senior State Department officials, including Melanne Verveer. Emails released by Judicial Watch and obtained through FOIA requests showed that Pinchuk had been invited to dine at Hillary Clinton's home during her tenure at the State department, despite her spokesman's previous denial that they had met during that time.Westwood, Sarah.

He was destined for the Lutheran Church, and graduated at the University of Jena in 1718. He returned to Augsburg in 1720, but became parish minister of Kaufbeuren in 1723. In 1731 he was elected a member of the Academy of Sciences at Berlin, and was invited to return again to Augsburg as pastor and senior minister of the Church of St. Ulrich. He died at Augsburg. ==Works== His chief work, Historia Critica Philosophiae (\\"Critical History of Philosophy\\"), appeared at Leipzig (originally 5 vols., 1742–1744). Its success was such that a new edition was published in six volumes (1766–1767; English translation by William Enfield, 1791). It is by this work alone that Brucker is now known. It was the modern era's first complete history of the different philosophical schools. It embodies an ample collection of materials, and contains valuable biographies. Schopenhauer in his advice to read the original writings of philosophers, praised Brucker. He wrote that \\"Their real study demands all of a long and studious life, such as the stout-hearted Brucker formerly devoted to them in the industrious times of old (Parerga and Paralipomena, Volume 1, \\"Fragments for the History of Philosophy,\\" § 1).\\" He also wrote Tentamen Introductionis in Historiam Doctrinae de Ideis, afterwards completed and republished under the title of Historia Philosophicae Doctrinae de Ideis (Augsburg, 1723); Otium Vindelicum (1731); Kurze Fragen aus der philosophischen Historiae (7 vols., Ulm, 1731–1736), a history of philosophy in question and answer, containing many details, especially in the department of literary history, which he omitted in his chief work; Pinacotheca Scriptorum nostra aetate literis illustrium, etc. (Augsburg, 1741–1755); Ehrentempel der deutschen Gelehrsamkeit (Augsburg, 1747–1749); Institutiones Historiae Philosophicae (Leipzig, 1747 and 1756; 3rd ed. with a continuation by F.

The company was founded by Guy Buckingham in 1952. He was an aircraft engineer and used his expertise to build triangulated spaceframed sportscars. Possibly Australia's first space-framed cars. In 1958 the company built a series of all-enveloping aluminium streamlined sports cars. First called \\"Streamliners\\", and later called \\"Mazengarbs\\". Up to 1960 eleven of those were made. In the late 1950s the company produced Formula Junior cars in both front and mid- engined formats. Nota also made a series of specialist monoposto racing cars for the track and hill climbing events. In 1963 the company made a series of Mini powered sports cars. In 1964 they started production of the Nota Sapphire, an alloy bodied sports and coupe designs with Ford Fiat and Coventry Climax engines. In 1965 Nota started producing Formula Vee cars for Warrick Farm race track making 34 in the first year. In the 1960s the company formulated their \\"Sportsman\\", a Lotus 7 lookalike, which they still build today and are now building in a mid-engined version for the modern day transverse engines which the major car manufacturers produce. In 1968 came the Nota Fang Chris Buckinghams first real design, a midengined sports car using a Cooper S engine power plant behind the driver but in front of the rear wheels, their most successful model with over 100 being made. Later the Fang was equipped with Lancia engines, then Toyota engines, finally being fitted with Toyota's V6 Quad cam supercharged engines with over 400BHP. In 1973 Nota started with their Marauder range of cars using the same mechanicals as the Nota Fang. At the same time they were making the Nota Levanti front engine twin cam coupe. In 1975 the supply of Leyland 1275 GT engines started to run out so Nota contacted FIAT and both Marauders and Fangs were made with the 2-litre twin cam FIAT/Lancia engine. Leyland were then approached and the P76 engine was fitted to the Marauders using a Nota made gearbox trans-axle with the gear box next to the driver and the engine behind. In the late 1970s Nota had started on 4WD 351 V8 mid-engined Marauders, but in the 1980s Ford stopped export of the 351 engine to Australia. After a trip to England Chris Buckingham assembled a design team to design a Fang with Fl 3 litre V6 quad cam engine as well as a fully enclosed, similarly specified Chimera. In 2003 Nota developed the Nota Le Mans, powered by either a Suzuki GTi 1300 cc or 1100 cc motor cycle engine. For road use it could also use a Toyota 1800 cc VVTi 6-speed or the 3.5-litre V6 quad cam. By 2012 Nota had decided that due to the lack of front engine rear wheel drive 4 cylinder engine being available they would use an existing front-engined Nota clubman chassis and move the seats forward by 150mm and fit a transverse engine behind the driver. It looks just like their front-engined clubmans but with the advantage of a mid-engined design. == Models == === Older models === * Nota FJ (Formula Junior) * Nota Major * Nota Sapphire * Nota Fang === Current models === * Nota Le Mans * Nota F1 * Nota Fang * Nota Sportsman * Nota Chimera == External links == * https://web.archive.org/web/20050305152311/http://www.notasportscars.com/ Category:Australian racecar constructors Category:Lotus Seven replicas ","title":"Nota"},{"id":"1280830","text":"Brucker is a surname, and may refer to: * Ferdinand Brucker (1858–1904), American politician * Jane Brucker (born 1958), American actress * Johann Jakob Brucker (1696–1770), German historian of philosophy * Roger Brucker (born 1929), American cave explorer and author * Wilber M.

In 1977 the new Government Pavilion was completed, costing $1,800,000 and covering an area of 2,839 square metres. The iconic \\"Pie in the Sky\\" was also built the same year, and was heritage listed in 1999. As well as hosting harness racing, the Melbourne Showground track was a semi regular host of speedway. During the 1980s and early 1990s the showground saw such Motorcycle speedway riders as World Champions Ivan Mauger, Hans Nielsen, Michael Lee, Shawn Moran, Simon Wigg and Tommy Knudsen, as well as Australian's Phil Crump, Rod Hunter, Mark Fiora and Todd Wiltshire. During this time the showground hosted two annual speedway events, the \\"Boxing Day Spectacular\\", and the \\"Mr Melbourne\\" title held in January. Winners of these events included Simon Wigg, Tommy Knudsen and Todd Wiltshire. ===Redevelopment=== By the early 2000s the Royal Melbourne Showgrounds had become dilapidated, especially when compared to other Australian venues such as the Sydney Showgrounds at Homebush. As a result, the State Government announced a redevelopment of the Royal Melbourne Showgrounds site, to be carried out as a joint venture partnership with the Royal Agricultural Society of Victoria and private sector investors, with demolition commencing in June 2002, and all work to be completed by the 2006 Royal Melbourne Show. In March 2004 a list of the three short-listed consortia was announced, with the winning applicant revealed in December that year: PPP Solutions – a consortium of financier Babcock and Brown, Multiplex Constructions, Multiplex Facilities Management, Spotless Services and Daryl Jackson Architects. The contract with PPP Solutions was signed on 22 June 2005, and required the consortium to design, build, finance and maintain the showground facilities for a period of 25 years. Costing $146 million, the government provided $101 million for the project, the Royal Agricultural Society $16 million, and the remaining $29 million will come from lease revenue and management fees. Two-thirds of the 27 hectare site was redeveloped as a venue for the Royal Melbourne Show, while 'non-core' land along Epsom Road and Langs Road to be given over to other uses. The works were completed as planned by the 2006 Royal Melbourne Show, and included the following new works: * An 8,000-square metre Grand Pavilion, * A new 10,000-square metre Exhibition Pavilion, which can house livestock, * A new 4,300-seat outdoor arena, capable of holding two horse competition rings, * A Grand Boulevard linking the grassy spaces and events areas, and * The new headquarters for the Royal Agricultural Society of Victoria. The following heritage buildings were also restored: * Centenary Hall, an art-deco hall built in 1934 and now restored to its original condition, * The heritage-listed Public Grandstand, built in 1915 with new seating, * Pie in the Sky, the heritage-listed and popular meeting point which was built in 1977. Before the redevelopment the main arena had a 15,000 capacity, with the new basic rectangle arena opened for the 2006 Royal Melbourne Show. Around the same time the rest of old arena was demolished. In 2008 the development of the Epsom Road site was announced, with Coles Group building a $40 million neighbourhood shopping centre, featuring a Coles supermarket, 1st Choice Liquor superstore, 30 retail spaces ranging in size from 50 square metres to 600 square metres, and a not-for- profit child care centre able to accommodate up to 120 children. The heritage listed Woodfull Pavilion was also incorporated into the development, which opened in August 2009. ==Film and television productions== The showgrounds have also been used to film numerous television productions including commercials. ===Current=== * MasterChef Australia (Ten Network) (2013-present) * Lego Masters (Australian TV series) (Nine Network) (2019-present) ===Past=== * Pugwall (Nine Network) (1989-1991) * The Librarians (ABC) (2007, 2009-2010) * Rush (Ten Network) (2008-2011) * Thank God You're Here (Seven Network) (2009) * MasterChef Australia: The Professionals (Ten Network) (2013) * AFL commercial shoot * ME Bank commercial shoot * Family Food Fight (Nine Network) (2017) * On The Beach (1959 movie) by Stanley Kramer Productions (All interiors shot in the Government Pavilion) ==Public transport== The showgrounds has its own railway station on the Flemington Racecourse line, only open for the Royal Melbourne Show and other special events.

The two other theorems are Hilbert's basis theorem that asserts that all ideals of polynomial rings over a field are finitely generated, and Hilbert's Nullstellensatz, which establishes a bijective correspondence between affine algebraic varieties and prime ideals of polynomial rings. Hilbert's syzygy theorem concern the relations, or syzygies in Hilbert's terminology, between the generators of an ideal, or, more generally, a module. As the relations form a module, one may consider the relations between the relations; Hilbert's syzygy theorem asserts that, if one continues in this way, starting with a module over a polynomial ring in indeterminates over a field, one eventually finds a zero module of relations, after at most steps. Hilbert's syzygy theorem is now considered to be an early result of homological algebra. It is the starting point of the use of homological methods in commutative algebra and algebraic geometry. ==History== The syzygy theorem first appeared in Hilbert's seminal paper \\"Über die Theorie der algebraischen Formen\\" (1890).D. Hilbert, Über die Theorie der algebraischen Formen, Mathematische Annalen 36, 473–530. The paper is split into five parts: part I proves Hilbert's basis theorem over a field, while part II proves it over the integers. Part III contains the syzygy theorem (Theorem III), which is used in part IV to discuss the Hilbert polynomial. The last part, part V, proves finite generation of certain rings of invariants. Incidentally part III also contains a special case of the Hilbert–Burch theorem. ==Syzygies (relations)== Originally, Hilbert defined syzygies for ideals in polynomial rings, but the concept generalizes trivially to (left) modules over any ring. Given a generating set g_1, \\\\ldots, g_k of a module over a ring , a relation or first syzygy between the generators is a -tuple (a_1, \\\\ldots, a_k) of elements of such thatThe theory is presented for finitely generated modules, but extends easily to arbitrary modules. :a_1g_1 + \\\\cdots + a_kg_k =0. Let L_0 be the free module with basis (G_1, \\\\ldots, G_k), the relation (a_1, \\\\ldots, a_k) may be identified with the element :a_1G_1 + \\\\cdots + a_kG_k, and the relations form the kernel R_1 of the linear map L_0 \\\\to M defined by G_i \\\\mapsto g_i. In other words, one has an exact sequence :0 \\\\to R_1 \\\\to L_0 \\\\to M \\\\to 0. This first syzygy module R_1 depends on the choice of a generating set, but, if S_1 is the module which is obtained with another generating set, there exist two free modules F_1 and F_2 such that :R_1 \\\\oplus F_1 \\\\cong S_1 \\\\oplus F_2 where \\\\oplus denote the direct sum of modules. The second syzygy module is the module of the relations between generators of the first syzygy module. By continuing in this way, one may define the th syzygy module for every positive integer . If the th syzygy module is free for some , then by taking a basis as a generating set, the next syzygy module (and every subsequent one) is the zero module. If one does not take a bases as generating sets, then all subsequent syzygy modules are free. Let be the smallest integer, if any, such that the th syzygy module of a module is free or projective. The above property of invariance, up to the sum direct with free modules, implies that does not depend on the choice of generating sets. The projective dimension of is this integer, if it exists, or if not. This is equivalent with the existence of an exact sequence :0 \\\\longrightarrow R_n \\\\longrightarrow L_{n-1} \\\\longrightarrow \\\\cdots \\\\longrightarrow L_0 \\\\longrightarrow M \\\\longrightarrow 0, where the modules L_i are free and R_n is projective. It can be shown that one may always choose the generating sets for R_n being free, that is for the above exact sequence to be a free resolution. == Statement == Hilbert's syzygy theorem states that, if is a finitely generated module over a polynomial ring k[x_1,\\\\ldots,x_n] in indeterminates over a field , then the th syzygy module of is always a free module. In modern language, this implies that the projective dimension of is at most , and thus that there exists a free resolution :0 \\\\longrightarrow L_k \\\\longrightarrow L_{k-1} \\\\longrightarrow \\\\cdots \\\\longrightarrow L_0 \\\\longrightarrow M \\\\longrightarrow 0 of length . This upper bound on the projective dimension is sharp, that is, there are modules of projective dimension exactly . The standard example is the field , which may be considered as a k[x_1,\\\\ldots,x_n]-module by setting x_i c=0 for every and every . For this module, the th syzygy module is free, but not the th one (for a proof, see , below). The theorem is also true for modules that are not finitely generated. As the global dimension of a ring is the supremum of the projective dimensions of all modules, Hilbert's syzygy theorem may be restated as: the global dimension of k[x_1,\\\\ldots,x_n] is . === Low dimension === In the case of zero indeterminates, Hilbert's syzygy theorem is simply the fact that every vector space has a basis. In the case of a single indeterminate, Hilbert's syzygy theorem is an instance of the theorem asserting that over a principal ideal ring, every submodule of a free module is itself free. == Koszul complex == The Koszul complex, also called \\"complex of exterior algebra\\", allows, in some cases, an explicit description of all syzygy modules. Let g_1, \\\\ldots, g_k be a generating system of an ideal in a polynomial ring R=k[x_1,\\\\ldots,x_n], and let L_1 be a free module of basis G_1, \\\\ldots, G_k. The exterior algebra of L_1 is the direct sum :\\\\Lambda(L_1)=\\\\bigoplus_{t=0}^k L_t, where L_t is the free module, which has, as a basis, the exterior products :G_{i_1} \\\\wedge \\\\cdots \\\\wedge G_{i_t}, such that i_1< i_2<\\\\cdots In particular, one has L_0=R (because of the definition of the empty product), the two definitions of L_1 coincide, and L_t=0 for . For every positive , one may define a linear map L_t\\\\to L_{t-1} by :G_{i_1} \\\\wedge \\\\cdots \\\\wedge G_{i_t} \\\\mapsto \\\\sum_{j=1}^t (-1)^{j+1}g_{i_j}G_{i_1}\\\\wedge \\\\cdots\\\\wedge \\\\widehat{G}_{i_j} \\\\wedge \\\\cdots\\\\wedge G_{i_t}, where the hat means that the factor is omitted. A straightforward computation shows that the composition of two consecutive such maps is zero, and thus that one has a complex :0\\\\to L_t \\\\to L_{t-1} \\\\to \\\\cdots \\\\to L_1 \\\\to L_0 \\\\to R/I. This is the Koszul complex. In general the Koszul complex is not an exact sequence, but it is an exact sequence if one works with a polynomial ring R=k[x_1,\\\\ldots,x_n] and an ideal generated by a regular sequence of homogeneous polynomials. In particular, the sequence x_1,\\\\ldots,x_n is regular, and the Koszul complex is thus a projective resolution of k=R/\\\\langle x_1, \\\\ldots, x_n\\\\rangle. In this case, the th syzygy module is free of dimension one (generated by the product of all G_i); the th syzygy module is thus the quotient of a free module of dimension by the submodule generated by (x_1, -x_2, \\\\ldots, \\\\pm x_n). This quotient may not be a projective module, as otherwise, there would exist polynomials p_i such that p_1x_1 + \\\\cdots +p_nx_n=1, which is impossible (substituting the x_i by 0 in the latter equality provides ). This proves that the projective dimension of k=R/\\\\langle x_1, \\\\ldots, x_n\\\\rangle is exactly . The same proof applies for proving that the projective dimension of k[x_1, \\\\ldots, x_n]/\\\\langle g_1, \\\\ldots, g_t\\\\rangle is exactly if the g_i form a regular sequence of homogeneous polynomials. ==Computation== At Hilbert's time, there were no method available for computing syzygies. It was only known that an algorithm may be deduced from any upper bound of the degree of the generators of the module of syzygies. In fact, the coefficients of the syzygies are unknown polynomials. If the degree of these polynomials is bounded, the number of their monomials is also bounded. Expressing that one has a syzygy provides a system of linear equations whose unknowns are the coefficients of these monomials. Therefore, any algorithm for linear systems implies an algorithm for syzygies, as soon as a bound of the degrees is known. The first bound for syzygies (as well as for ideal membership problem) was given in 1926 by Grete Hermann:Grete Hermann: Die Frage der endlich vielen Schritte in der Theorie der Polynomideale. Unter Benutzung nachgelassener Sätze von K. Hentzelt, Mathematische Annalen, Volume 95, Number 1, 736-788, (abstract in German language) — The question of finitely many steps in polynomial ideal theory (review and English-language translation) Let a submodule of a free module of dimension over k[x_1, \\\\ldots, x_n]; if the coefficients over a basis of of a generating system of have a total degree at most , then there is a constant such that the degrees occurring in a generating system of the first syzygy module is at most (td)^{2^{cn}}. The same bound applies for testing the membership to of an element of .G. Hermann claimed , but did not prove this. On the other hand, there are examples where a double exponential degree necessarily occurs. However such examples are extremely rare, and this sets the question of an algorithm that is efficient when the output is not too large. At the present time, the best algorithms for computing syzygies are Gröbner basis algorithms. They allow the computation of the first syzygy module, and also, with almost no extra cost, all syzygies modules. ==Syzygies and regularity== One might wonder which ring-theoretic property of A=k[x_1,\\\\ldots,x_n] causes the Hilbert syzygy theorem to hold. It turns out that this is regularity, which is an algebraic formulation of the fact that affine -space is a variety without singularities. In fact the following generalization holds: Let A be a Noetherian ring. Then A has finite global dimension if and only if A is regular and the Krull dimension of A is finite; in that case the global dimension of A is equal to the Krull dimension. This result may be proven using Serre's theorem on regular local rings. == See also == * Quillen–Suslin theorem * Hilbert series and Hilbert polynomial == References == * David Eisenbud, Commutative algebra.

There was also a northern Arizona chain of Mexican restaurants using the Casa Bonita name founded in 2003. Locations included Flagstaff, Cottonwood, Lake Havasu, Prescott, Prescott Valley, Sedona, and Paradise Valley. They were not related to the eatertainment franchise, and in 2011 they changed their name to Plaza Bonita. Another unrelated restaurant of the same name is located in Libertyville, Illinois. ==History== Founder Bill Waugh opened the first Casa Bonita restaurant in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, in 1968. By the mid-1970s, the chain had expanded to locations in adjacent states and was known for its \\"all you can eat\\" beef or chicken plates and offering sopapillas—small squares of fried bread served with honey—with every meal. In 1982, the company (including Taco Bueno fast food restaurants) was sold to Unigate (now Uniq plc). In 1992, Unigate sold the restaurants to CKE Restaurants, owners of Carl's Jr. In 1997, the two remaining Casa Bonita restaurants were spun off by CKE as part of Star Buffet. The Tulsa location closed in September 2005, then reopened for a 2-year run under the name Casa Viva, and went out of business in December 2007. Casa Bonita was reopened by Star Buffet under the original name in late July 2008. In March 2015, it was announced that the Lakewood Historical Society decided to make the restaurant a historic landmark of the city. ==Locations== ===Oklahoma City, Oklahoma=== The first Casa Bonita was opened in the summer of 1968 in Oklahoma City, at a time when Mexican food was considered a novelty in the area. The restaurant was located along U.S. Route 66 at the intersection of NW 39th and Portland. On opening, it featured themed rooms, including the Garden Room and El Pokey, a room themed as a Mexican jail. The Oklahoma City location closed in 1993. After housing other businesses, the building was demolished in 2015. ===Tulsa, Oklahoma=== The Tulsa location opened in 1971 near the intersection of 21st and Sheridan. The interior was designed to create the outdoor nighttime atmosphere of a Mexican village. Its various themed dining areas, with seating for over 500, included a village square with fountain, a 2-level lantern-lit cave, a tropical garden with 20-ft waterfall and stream, and a room resembling an aristocratic dining hall with a porch along with strolling mariachis. The Tulsa location also included a puppet and magic show theatre, a video arcade, a working carousel, and a gift shop. It closed on September 30, 2005, due to a reported inability to reach suitable lease terms with the property owner. It was reopened, as Casa Viva, in May 2006 and then closed again in December 2007. In late July 2008, the restaurant, having been sold back to its previous owner group, reopened under the original Casa Bonita name. In February 2011, the restaurant failed to reopen after lengthy snowstorms hit Tulsa, and a sign on the door said it was closed for business. ===Lakewood, Colorado=== Lakewood The Lakewood location was built in 1973 and opened in early 1974 on Colfax Avenue west of Denver, along U.S. Route 40/I-70 Business. Similar in architecture to the Tulsa location (both were previously large retail store locations), the Lakewood restaurant seats over 1000 people at a time, and features strolling mariachis, flame jugglers (No longer allowed in 2019 for violating fire code), and a waterfall with cliff divers. It also has a small puppet theater, a \\"haunted tunnel\\" called Black Bart's Cave, an arcade with a large skee-ball room, and a magic theater. It was designated a historic landmark of the city in March 2015. In March 2020, the Lakewood location closed temporarily due to the COVID-19 pandemic, during which Colorado Governor Jared Polis stopped in- person dining for a two-month span from March 17 to May 26. As of September 2020, the restaurant is still closed \\"due to Colorado-mandated regulations\\" during the pandemic. ===Former locations=== *Hulen Mall, Fort Worth, Texas (1982–1985) *Little Rock, Arkansas (1969–1993) (1995–2005) == Similar restaurants == *Casa Bonita founder Bill Waugh founded a similar restaurant concept, Casa Viva.

Other episodes that mention it briefly are: \\"Quest for Ratings\\" (where a clock is labeled as showing the time at Casa Bonita), \\"You Have 0 Friends\\", \\"201\\" (where the restaurant is reportedly destroyed), and \\"Let Go, Let Gov\\". Additionally, the building that houses South Park Studios was named after the restaurant.Casa Bonita episode for South Park In South Park: The Fractured But Whole, as part of the DLC, the main story is focused on the building. The South Park connection comes about as the creators of the show and several staff of South Park recalled having fond memories frequenting the establishment as children in the Denver suburbs. In Eureka, a reference to \\"Casa Bonita\\" is made, where an \\"artificial intelligent\\" love-struck Andy, who is the deputy of the town Sheriff in the new alternate timeline, regards the sheriff's \\"artificial intelligent\\" house S.A.R.A.H. as his \\"Casa Bonita\\" when stuck on Titan (Saturn's moon) by an accidental journey using the series' fictional \\"faster-than-light\\" technology. In the reboot of Roseanne Casa Bonita is featured as the workplace of Becky Connor in Episode 4. The music video for Collapsing Scenery's \\"Resort Beyond the Last Resort\\", directed by Kansas Bowling and starring Boyd Rice, was partially filmed at Casa Bonita. ==Financial trouble== In April 2020, The Denver Post reported that several employees had their \\"mid-March\\" paychecks bounce due to insufficient funds in the payroll account of Casa Bonita. As late as July 7th, 2020, their website stated they are closed due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

Cardinal Wolsey gave it to Christ Church, Oxford, but it reverted to the Crown, and was acquired by a wool merchant, Anthony Cave, in 1545, who built a manor house in the form of a hollow square.SOE Chichley Hall On his death the house was left to his daughter Judith, who had married her cousin William Chester, son of Sir William Chester. Their only son Anthony was High Sheriff of Buckinghamshire for 1602 and created a baronet in 1620. The house then descended in the Chester family to the time of the English Civil War, when it was shelled by Parliamentary forces and eventually demolished. The present Chicheley Hall was built in the early 1700s on the same site. All that remains of the old manor house is one Jacobean over-mantel with termini caryatids, and some panelling in the new Chicheley Hall. ==Current hall== The present hall was built between 1719 and 1723, with the interior fittings completed in 1725. The house was often attributed to the architect Thomas Archer, but has more recently been attributed to Francis Smith, who is thought to have designed it for Sir John Chester, the 4th baronet.\\"The finest country house on the market\\", Times Online, June 8, 2007 The principal facade of the house is of nine bays on three floors upon a raised basement; the central section of three bays projects. Massive fluted Corinthian pilasters flank the central three bays. These are repeated at each termination of the facade and again divide the second from the third bay of each wing that flanks the central projection. The facade is symmetrical, however the curve-topped windows of the central projection are taller than the flat-topped windows of the wings, thus uniformity at roof level is achieved by an upward curve to the central section from the wings. These motifs, examples of baroque architecture are exceedingly rare in Britain, where baroque was fashionable for a very brief period at the end of the 17th century and beginning of the 18th. The main door opens to a fine panelled Great Hall, in the manner of William Kent with a classical double-height ceiling depicting Herse and her sisters sacrificing to Flora. Through an arcade of marble columns, oak staircases lead to the upper floors. The most remarkable room is the 'secret' library on the upper floor, with all shelving and books concealed behind what appears to be panelling, thus disguising the room's true use. The interior includes some of the finest woodcarving, joinery and plasterwork in any English country house of its period. The house is surrounded by a park of , including a lake, canal, and of gardens, laid out by George London and Henry Wise. An avenue of lime trees leads to the house, past an octagonal Grade II* listed dovecote. The River Ouse lies to the east. ==History== After John Chester's death the house descended to Charles Bagot Chester, the 7th Baronet, a drunk and gambler, who jumped out of a second floor window in a drunken fit. Before dying of his injuries he bequeathed all of his estates, including Chicheley, to a distant relative and school friend, Charles Bagot, on condition he adopted the name of Chester. Charles' son Charles Bagot Chester, a gambler, rake and Member of Parliament, rented out the hall for many years. After his death the estate descended to the unmarried Charles Anthony Chester and from 1883 was again rented out to a series of tenants, among whom Gwen Farrar, for the next 70 years.In English Homes: The Internal Character, Furniture & Adornments of Some of the Most Notable Houses of England, vol. 2, Henry Avray Tipping, 1908, Contents Page and p. 360 ==Recent history== During the Second World War, Chicheley Hall was used by the Special Operations Executive as its Special Training School No. 46. From 1942 until 1943, it was used for training Czechoslovaks for SOE parachute missions. It was later used to train Polish agents, and then became a FANY wireless telegraphy school.S.O.E – Training of the S.O.E Fortunately, the fine interior was protected by hardboard. The house was purchased from the Chester family by David Beatty, 2nd Earl Beatty in 1952, son of First World War Admiral Lord Beatty, who brought memorabilia of his father. Beatty began a large restoration programme and finally employed the renowned interior decorator Felix Harboard, famed for his work at Luttrellstown Castle near Dublin. Harboard's masterful, classical colour schemes accentuating moulding and panelling perfectly suit the house. Chicheley Hall remained the home of the 2nd Earl's fourth wife, Diane, after his death. She remarried, to Sir John Nutting, and was later the chairman of the Georgian Group. Together, they ran the house as a venue for weddings and conferences. The house stood in for Bletchley Park in the 2001 film Enigma. It has also been used as a location in several other films and TV projects, including Pride and Prejudice, The Meaning of Life, The Red Violin, Black Beauty, The Fourth Protocol, A Village Affair (1995 TV Movie), and Separate Lies. In 2007, Grade I listed Chicheley Hall was placed on the market for sale, with a guide price of £9 million.Chicheley Hall  News  Houses for sale, properties for sale – Country Life It was bought by the Royal Society for £6.5 million, funded in part by the Norwegian philanthropist Fred Kavli.

The Large Münsterländer is from the same area, but was developed from different breeding stock and is not related as the names would suggest. Small Münsterländers bear a resemblance to both spaniels and setters but are more versatile while hunting on land and water. The Small Münsterländer is recognized by the Fédération Cynologique Internationale under Group 7, Section 1.2, Continental Pointing Dogs of Spaniel type, by the American Kennel Club as a Foundation Stock Service breed, and by The Kennel Club and the United Kennel Club as a gun dog. It is related to the Epagneul Français and the Drentsche Patrijshond. == Description == === Appearance === Small Münsterländers should have kind, expressive eyes Males should stand between , and females should stand between at the withers. The weight ranges between with the males being the larger of the two. Strong and harmonious build of medium size, showing balanced proportions with a lot of quality and elegance. In upright posture the dog displays flowing outlines with a horizontally carried, well flagged tail. The dog should appear to be strong and balanced with a distinguished head. Its front legs are well feathered, the hind legs with breeches. The coat should be medium length, glossy, dense, and straight or slightly wavy. The dog's movement should be graceful and far reaching. The coloration of the dog is large patches of brown on a ticked or solid white background. === Temperament === Small Münsterländers are extremely intelligent, trainable, and attentive but require gentle and patient training. Coupled with their intelligence, if they determine an owner to be inconsistent or indecisive, the owner might find that the dog will challenge the owner. For training, both voice and hand signals are used, and a Small Münsterländer will routinely look back to check in with the hunter for silent signals at intervals when on hold or pointing. They have a very strong prey drive and enjoy rewarding their owner with productive hunts. They thrive with hunting or comparable challenging exercise for an hour or more every day. They are strong swimmers, especially when compared to other short-haired hunting breeds. Lack of regular and sufficient exercise and mental challenge will likely result in unwanted behavior, which is common in highly intelligent, driven breeds. The Small Münsterländer is a happy, affectionate family pet when in the house, while remaining a keenly focused, even driven, hunter-pointer-retriever when in the field. They are not suited to life in a kennel because of their sociable nature and need to interact with people - they need to live in the home of their family. Small Münsterländers will pick an individual person to bond most closely with, typically the one who hunts with the dog, but will revel in the company of the rest of the family as well. When raised with other pets in the household, such as cats, they can coexist happily though they may enjoy a game of chase and point. Unfamiliar small animals outdoors will not be tolerated in the same way. ===Health=== Due to the breed organizations, responsible kennels, and owners having a strong commitment to the health of the breed, breed programs are overwhelmingly very selective in breeding dogs that are OFA/Penn Hip, CERF, and temperament clear. As a result, instances of congenital diseases and conditions are extremely low and any dog clearly showing physical or behavioral abnormalities shall be disqualified from the breeding program. The breed is robustly healthy with rare issues save dry skin in colder climates and water in its ears after swimming. ==History== Löns Statue Bronze Originally a dog bred exclusively for noble families and to work with their families' falconers before guns were used in bird and small game hunting, ancestors of the Small Münsterländer (formerly the Kleiner Münsterländer Vorstehhund) had to work in upland areas to flush prey for the falcon, then allow the falcon to keep the prey until the falconer could retrieve it while the dog pointed at the catch. To this day the Small Münsterländer has excellent close searching and pointing drive. All privileges and immunities of the German nobility as a legally defined class were abolished on August 11, 1919 with the promulgation of the Weimar Constitution, recognising all Germans as equal before the laws of their country. With wider availability of guns and land use for commoners, hunting became more popular, and the breed was further developed as a retriever that worked equally well in the field and water. The breed is considered to be uniquely effective in working as a team with the huntsman in all phases of the hunt, akin to the close cooperation between a sheep herder and Border Collie. It is an elite hunter within the versatile hunting dog arena and is trained to retrieve, hunt, and track the following: woodcock, rail, grouse, dove, partridge, chukar, quail, pheasant, duck, goose, rabbit, deer and fox. The Small Münsterländer is not a far-ranging dog, usually hunting close in heavier cover and ranging 100-150 yards in light cover, all in an effort to maintain the hunting partnership with its owner. The Small Münsterländer is one of the four oldest versatile breeds and the longhaired versatile hunting dogs evolved from the Small Münsterländer and Flat-Coated Retriever. The Small Münsterländer is thought to be well over 500 years old, originating from the Munster region of Germany but not related to the Large Münsterländer, and documentation of ancestors around the 13th and 14th centuries. By the 1800s the breed had fallen into obscurity. Small Munsterlanders were little known, kept by a few families on farms around Munster. For a half century the few dogs that were bred were primarily companions, and used when hunting to feed the family rather than for sport. It developed a local reputation as the dog to have when a hunter's success or failure determined whether his family would have enough to eat. At the end of the 19th century, a concerted effort was made to re- establish the breed from the remaining lines in the Munster region. The fortunate outcome of the companion phase in the Small Münsterländer history was its excellent in-home personality. Cultural and wildlife use changes slowly put an end to the \\"bread hunting\\" and was replaced by recreational hunting. With the advance in firearms, falconry too became outmoded. At the turn of the century, Edmund Lons, brother of the famous hunting and nature poet Hermann Lons, discovered Small Münsterländers in two towns in Lower Saxony. Lons obtained dogs from two lines. One line consisted of fine boned, agile, lively and intelligent dogs, well known for their \\"track sound\\" on the trail. Dogs of the other line were slow in search, of strong build, and excellent in their use of nose. The background and breeding of these dogs could be traced for several generations. ==International popularity== Small Münsterländer on staunch point The Small Münsterländer is a rare breed in the United States, numbering around 2000, and demand from hunters outstrips the number of available dogs, so breeders typically give preference to hunters. They are especially hard to come by for non-hunters there and regardless are required to have their dog tested in the field and adhere to maintaining an updated health profile. They are more numerous in Germany, Belgium, the Netherlands, Denmark, and the Czech Republic and are bred, trained and tested to high standards to maintain the superior versatility. Due to very low prevalence and high standards of the breed organizations, kennels and owners having a strong commitment to the health of the breed, breed programs are overwhelmingly very selective in breeding dogs and are required to maintain OFA/Penn Hip, CERF and temperament clear. As a result, instances of congenital diseases and conditions are extremely low. In the United Kingdom, the breed is rarer still. Recognized by The Kennel Club as an imported breed in 2006, they are still to be established in the hunting community. ==External links== * Category:FCI breeds Category:Gundogs Category:Pointers Category:Dog breeds originating in Germany Category:Rare dog breeds ","title":"Small Münsterländer"},{"id":"1280855","text":"Langenberg is a quarter in Velbert, a German city.

Charles Pratt and Company was an oil company that was formed in 1867 by Charles Pratt and Henry H. Rogers in Brooklyn, New York. It became part of John D. Rockefeller's Standard Oil organization in 1874. ==History== Pratt, born in Watertown, Massachusetts, had come to New York around 1850-1851, where he worked for a company specializing in paints and whale-oil products. Pratt became a pioneer of the natural oil industry, and established his kerosene refinery Astral Oil Works in Brooklyn. Pratt's product later gave rise to the slogan, \\"The holy lamps of Tibet are primed with Astral Oil.\\" In the mid-1860s, Pratt met two aspiring young men, Charles Ellis and Henry H. Rogers in western Pennsylvania. Pratt had bought whale-oil from Charles Ellis in Fairhaven, Massachusetts, the young men's hometown. He purchased the entire future output of their small venture, Wamsutta Oil Refinery, at McClintocksville, near Oil City at a fixed price. Ellis and Rogers had no wells and were dependent upon purchasing crude oil to refine and sell to Pratt. A few months later, crude oil prices suddenly increased due to manipulation by speculators. The young entrepreneurs and their Wamsutta Oil Refinery struggled to try to live up to their contract with Pratt, but soon their surplus was wiped out. Before long, they were heavily in debt to him. Charles Ellis gave up, but in 1866, Henry Rogers went to Pratt in New York, and told him he would take personal responsibility for the entire debt. This so impressed Pratt that he immediately hired him for his own organization. In the next few years Rogers became, in the words of Elbert Hubbard, Pratt's \\"hands and feet and eyes and ears\\" (Little Journeys to the Homes, 1909). Pratt made Rogers foreman of his Brooklyn refinery, with a promise of a partnership if sales ran over fifty thousand dollars a year. Rogers and his wife Abbie moved to Brooklyn and lived frugally. Abbie brought his meals to the \\"works\\"; often he would sleep three hours a night rolled up in a blanket by the side of a still. Rogers moved steadily from foreman to manager, and then superintendent of Pratt's Astral Oil Refinery. Pratt finally gave Rogers an interest in the business. In 1867, with Henry Rogers as a partner, he established the firm of Charles Pratt and Company. In the early 1870s, Pratt and Rogers became involved in conflicts with John D. Rockefeller's infamous South Improvement Company, which was basically a scheme to obtain favorable net rates from the Pennsylvania Railroad (PRR) and other railroads through a secret system of rebates. Rockefeller and the South Improvement Company scheme outraged independent oil producers in western Pennsylvania and refineries there and afar alike. The opposition to the South Improvement Company scheme among the New York refiners was led by Rogers. The New York interests formed an association, and about the middle of March, 1872, sent a committee of three, with Rogers, of Charles Pratt and Company, as head, to Oil City to consult with the Oil Producers' Union there. Their arrival in the oil regions was a matter of great satisfaction. Working with the Pennsylvania independents, they managed to forge an agreement with the PRR and other railroads whose leaders eventually agreed to open rates to all promised to end their shady dealings with South Improvement. The oil men were most exultant, but their joy was to be short-lived, for Rockefeller had already begun forming his Standard Oil organization and was busy trying another approach, which included frequently buying up opposing interests. Rockefeller approached Charles Pratt with his plans of cooperation and consolidation. Pratt talked it over with Rogers, and they decided that the combination would benefit them. Rogers formulated terms, which guaranteed financial security and jobs for Pratt and himself. John D. Rockefeller quietly accepted the offer on Rogers' exact terms. Charles Pratt and Company (including Astral Oil) became one of the important formerly independent refiners to join Rockefeller's organization, and it was to become part of the Standard Oil Trust in 1874. Pratt's son, Charles Millard Pratt (1858-1913) became Secretary of Standard Oil. Pratts' protégé, Henry H. Rogers soon rose to become one of the key men of Standard Oil, and was a Vice-President by 1890. Rogers, who kept his residence in New York after moving there at Pratt's request, invested outside of Standard Oil and became one of the wealthiest men in the world. He had interests in oil, gas, steel, copper, coal, and railroads, and eventually founded and built the Virginian Railway at the end of his own career. Charles Pratt is credited with recognizing the growing need for trained industrial workers in a changing economy. In 1886, he founded and endowed the Pratt Institute, which opened in Brooklyn, New York in 1887. Pratt settled in Glen Cove, Long Island, New York about 1890. In an effort to keep his family near him, he purchased large tracts of land surrounding his estate, totaling 1,100 acres (4.5 km²). However, he died the next year, 1891, in New York City. At Glen Cove, on Long Island, Pratt's six sons and two daughters later built their homes. As of 2004, most of the extant Pratt mansions along the Gold Coast there are still in use: * Welwyn, originally the home of Harold I. Pratt, is now the Holocaust Memorial and Tolerance Center of Nassau County. * The Braes, originally owned by Herbert L.

It is a right tributary of the Garonne. The Tarn runs in a roughly westerly direction, from its source at an elevation of on Mont Lozère in the Cévennes mountains (part of the Massif Central), through the deep gorges and canyons of the Gorges du Tarn that cuts through the Causse du Larzac, to Moissac in Tarn-et-Garonne, where it joins the Garonne, downstream from the centre of town. Its basin covers approximately , and it has a mean flow of approximately . The Millau Viaduct spans the valley of the Tarn near Millau, and is now one of the area's most popular attractions. ==Main tributaries== The tributaries of the Tarn include: * Agout (in Saint-Sulpice) * Alrance * Aveyron (near Montauban) * Cernon * Dourbie (in Millau) * Dourdou de Camarès * Jonte (in Le Rozier) * Lemboulas * Lumensonesque * Muze * Rance (near Trébas) * Tarnon (in Florac) * Tescou The Tarn separates the Narbonne and Aquitaine basins. ==Departments and cities== A boatman with some tourists begins a ride through the Gorges du Tarn The Tarn passes through the following departments and towns: *Lozère: Le Pont-de- Montvert, Sainte-Enimie *Aveyron: Millau *Tarn: Albi, Gaillac, Lisle-sur-Tarn, Rabastens *Haute-Garonne: Villemur-sur-Tarn *Tarn-et-Garonne: Montauban, Moissac. The Millau Viaduct, the tallest bridge in the world, carrying the A75 autoroute across the Tarn Gorge near Millau, opened in December 2004. The Tarn is famous for its brutal floods, which are the most dangerous in Europe along with the Danube. The floods of March 1930 saw the Tarn rise more than above its normal level in Montauban in just 24 hours, with a discharge of (the average discharge of the Rhine is ; the average discharge of the Nile during the traditional annual flooding before the building of the Aswan Dam was ; the average discharge of the Mississippi River is ). One third of the Tarn-et- Garonne department was flooded, about 300 people died, thousands of houses were destroyed, the low-lying districts of Montauban were destroyed, and the town of Moissac was almost entirely destroyed. ==Navigation== Tarn gorge, seen from the point sublime The Tarn was once navigable from its junction with the Garonne to Corbarieu, near Montauban. This stretch of river included seven river locks over a distance of . The canal was linked to the Canal de Garonne in Moissac by a branch lock upstream of the first river lock, and again, via the Canal de Montech, at Montauban. The two access points from the Canal de Garonne have both been restored, and boats can again access the immediate reaches of the river at these points. Additionally the first river lock, between Moissac and the Garonne itself, has been flooded by the barrage for the Golfech power station on the Garonne, and is permanently open to boats which can thus reach the Garonne and navigate a short distance of that river. The remaining six river locks are disused and unnavigable. A proposal exists to restore the five river locks between Moissac and Montauban, thus creating a waterway ring consisting of the Tarn from Moissac to Montauban, the Canal de Montech to Montech and the Canal de Garonne back to Moissac. ==See also== *Gorges du Tarn *Tourism in Tarn ==References== ===Specific=== ===General=== *http://www.geoportail.fr ==External links== *French Waterways - River Tarn Navigation guide to the lower *http://www.gorgesdutarn.net/?lang=en Category:Rivers of France Category:Rivers of Occitanie Category:Rivers of Lozère Category:Rivers of Aveyron Category:Rivers of Tarn (department) Category:Rivers of Haute-Garonne Category:Rivers of Tarn-et-Garonne ","title":"Tarn (river)"},{"id":"1280877","text":"Boris Christoff (, ; 18 May 1914 - 28 June 1993) was a Bulgarian opera singer, widely considered one of the greatest basses of the 20th century. == Training == Born in Plovdiv, Christoff demonstrated early his singing talent and sang as a boy at the choir of the Alexander Nevsky Cathedral, Sofia. His father had been a very popular cantor at Resen, attracting the faithful to the Bulgarian Exarchist church where he was chanting.*, In the late 1930s he graduated in law and started a career as a magistrate. He continued singing in his spare time in the Gusla Chorus in Sofia, achieving an enormous success as the chorus soloist in 1940. Thanks to a government grant, Christoff left in May 1942 for Italy where he was tutored for two years in the core Italian bass repertoire by the great baritone of an earlier generation, Riccardo Stracciari. == Performance career == After several guest appearances and recitals in Austria in 1944 and 1945, Christoff returned to Italy in December 1945. He made his operatic debut as Colline in La bohème at Reggio Calabria on 12 March 1946. In following years Christoff appeared in a number of roles at Milan's La Scala, Venice's La Fenice, the Rome Opera, Covent Garden in London, the opera theatres in Naples, Barcelona, Lisbon, Rio de Janeiro, etc. In 1950 he was invited to sing at the Metropolitan Opera in New York City but was refused entry into the USA as a result of the McCarran Immigration Act, which banned citizens of Eastern bloc countries from entering the country. The role was instead filled by the young Italian basso, Cesare Siepi. After the restrictions were loosened, Christoff made an operatic debut in the United States in 1956 at the San Francisco Opera. He refused any further invitations to the Metropolitan and never appeared there. After a brief absence from the scene due to brain tumour surgery in 1964, Christoff resumed his career in 1965, though at a much slower pace. In 1967 he was allowed to return to Bulgaria for the first time since 1945, for the funeral of his mother. In the 1970s Christoff on-stage performances were all but frequent. He brought his career to an end with a final concert at the Accademia di Bulgaria in Rome on 22 June 1986. He died in Rome in 1993 and his body was returned to Bulgaria, where he was given a state funeral and buried in Sofia's Alexander Nevsky Cathedral. == Voice, repertoire, character == Christoff had an excellent voice with a distinctive dark tone. Although it was not as large as some other bass voices, he had no trouble making an impact in big auditoria, like the San Francisco Opera. Owing to his stage presence and dramatic temperament, he was a worthy heir to the grand tradition of Slavonic basses exemplified by Fyodor Stravinsky, Lev Sibiriakov, Vladimir Kastorsky, Feodor Chaliapin, Alexander Kipnis and Mark Reizen, among others. He sang mostly in Verdi and the Russian repertoire, and was also a refined performer of vocal chamber music. Among his most famous roles were those of Tsar Boris (Mussorgsky - Boris Godunov), Philip II (Verdi - Don Carlo), Mephistopheles (Gounod - Faust and Boito - Mefistofele), Ivan Susanin (Glinka - A Life for the Tsar), Zaccaria (Verdi - Nabucco), Tsar Ivan (Rimsky-Korsakov - Ivan the Terrible), Dosifei (Mussorgsky - Khovanshchina), Gomez da Silva (Verdi - Ernani), Fiesco (Verdi - Simon Boccanegra), Attila (Verdi - Attila), Padre Guardiano (Verdi - La forza del destino), Galitzky and Kontchak (Borodin - Prince Igor) and others. Christoff made studio recordings of eight operas (Don Carlo, Boris Godunov and Faust twice each) and numerous live recordings (radio or stage performances). He was much admired as song singer and he recorded more than 200 Russian songs by Mussorgsky (he was the first to record all his 63 songs), Tchaikovsky, Rimsky- Korsakov, Glinka, Borodin, Cui, Balakirev as well as traditional songs, mostly with piano accompaniment. He initiated the tradition of making studio recordings of Boris Godunov with the same basso singing three roles (Boris, Varlaam, Pimen). While he was a grand performer on stage, Christoff had difficult off-stage relations with fellow singers and producers, which sometimes grew into public scandals. In 1955 he fell out with Maria Callas during the performances of Medea at the Rome Opera and in 1961 his contract with La Scala was terminated after an open conflict with fellow Bulgarian Nicolai Ghiaurov whom Christoff blamed for collaborating with the Bulgarian communist regime. Herbert von Karajan tried to make him sing the title role in Don Giovanni which would have been inappropriate for his range; this prompted him to sever relations with von Karajan. He was the brother-in-law of the Italian baritone Tito Gobbi. Alexander Nevsky Cathedral in Sofia, Bulgaria ==Recordings== Many recordings are available. The following list contains just a few. * His complete songs by Mussorgsky are available, produced by EMI. * He recorded the Verdi Requiem 3 times, once under Tullio Serafin in Rome 1959, once with Herbert von Karajan and once with Bruno Bartoletti. * Two recordings of Boris Godunov are available with Christoff singing three roles: Boris, Pimen, and Father Varlaam. * Two performances in major Wagner roles are available, both sung in Italian: Gurnemanz in Parsifal conducted in Rome 1950 by Vittorio Gui, and Pogner the goldsmith in Die Meistersinger von Nürnberg, conducted (studio) by Lovro von Matačić in Torino 1962. * Lugano Recital 1976 [DVD] ==Awards== * Sonning Award (1969; Denmark) == Honors == * A rocky cliff forming Aytos Point on the coast of Bransfield Strait, eastern Livingston Island, Antarctica is named after him.Christoff Cliff SCAR Composite Gazetteer of Antarctica == Notes Museum Boris Christoff (Sofia, Bulgaria) * Borischristoff.dir.bg * Discography of opera recordings (Capon's Lists of Opera Recordings) * http://www.boris-christoff.net * Boris Christoff - Life and Creative Work (Film of Ludmil Trifonov) * The Voice That Prays for Bulgaria (Film of BNT on 100 Years From His Birth) * His page on the Stars of Bulgarian Opera site with mp3 audio clips of selected arias * BBC Radio 4 - Desert Island Discs, Boris Christoff, 21 August 1979 * * \\"The Song of the Volga Boatman\\" (YouTube) * Gounod aria from FAUST (YouTube) * * Category:1914 births Category:1993 deaths Category:Operatic basses Category:Bulgarian opera singers Category:Bulgarian male singers Category:20th-century Bulgarian people Category:20th-century opera singers Category:Bulgarian emigrants to Italy Category:Sofia University alumni Category:People from Plovdiv Category:Recipients of the Léonie Sonning Music Prize Category:20th-century Bulgarian singers Category:20th-century male singers ","title":"Boris Christoff"},{"id":"1280878","text":"George Franklin Gilder (; born November 29, 1939) is an American investor, writer, economist, techno-utopian advocate, and co-founder of the Discovery Institute. His 1981 international bestseller Wealth and Poverty advanced a case for supply-side economics and capitalism during the early months of the Reagan administration. He is married to Nini Gilder, and has four children. He is also the chairman of George Gilder Fund Management, LLC. ==Early years== Gilder was born in New York City and raised in New York and Massachusetts. He is a great-grandson of designer Louis Comfort Tiffany. His father, Richard Watson Gilder, was killed flying in the United States Army Air Forces in World War II when Gilder was two years old. He spent most of his childhood with his mother, Anne Spring (Alsop), and his stepfather, Gilder Palmer, on a dairy farm in Tyringham, Massachusetts. Gilder, a college roommate of his father, was deeply involved with his upbringing. ==Education== Gilder attended Hamilton School in New York City, Phillips Exeter Academy, and Harvard University, graduating in 1962. He later returned to Harvard as a fellow at the Harvard Institute of Politics, and edited the Ripon Forum, the newspaper of the liberal Republican Ripon Society. == Marine Corps== Gilder served in the United States Marine Corps.Gilder anecdotally writes about his time in the Marine Corps in this Forbes article. ==Career== ===Speechwriting=== In the 1960s Gilder served as a speechwriter for several prominent officials and candidates, including Nelson Rockefeller, George W. Romney, and Richard Nixon. He worked as a spokesman for the liberal Republican Senator Charles Mathias, as antiwar protesters surrounded the capital; some eventually scared Gilder out of his apartment. Gilder moved to Harvard Square the following year, and he became a writer who modeled himself after Joan Didion. With his college roommate, Bruce Chapman, he wrote an attack on the anti-intellectual policies of the 1964 Republican presidential candidate Barry Goldwater, The Party That Lost Its Head (1966). He later recanted this attack: \\"The far Right — the same men I dismissed as extremists in my youth — turned out to know far more than I did. At least the 'right-wing extremists', as I confidently called them, were right on almost every major policy issue from welfare to Vietnam to Keynesian economics and defense — while I, in my Neo-Conservative sophistication, was nearly always wrong.\\" ===Supply-side economics=== Supply-side economics was formulated in the mid-1970s by Jude Wanniski and Robert L. Bartley at The Wall Street Journal as a counterweight to the reigning \\"demand-side\\" Keynesian economics. At the center of the concept was the Laffer curve, the idea that high tax rates reduce government revenue. Its opponents often refer to it as \\"trickle-down economics\\". Inspired by Wanniski and by the works of free-market economists like Murray Rothbard, Ludwig von Mises, Milton Friedman and Friedrich Hayek and novelist Ayn Rand,Chait, Jonathan (September 14, 2009) Wealthcare, The New Republic Gilder wrote a book extending the ideas of his Visible Man (1978) into the realm of economics, to balance his theory of poverty with a theory of wealth. The book, published as the best-selling Wealth and Poverty in 1981, communicated the ideas of supply-side economics to a wide audience in the United States and the world. Gilder also contributed to the development of supply-side economics when he served as Chairman of the Lehrman Institute's Economic Roundtable, as Program Director for the Manhattan Institute, and as a frequent contributor to Laffer's economic reports and the editorial page of The Wall Street Journal. ===Technology=== In the 1990s, he became an enthusiastic evangelist of technology and the Internet. He uncovered emerging trends in several books and his newsletter, the Gilder Technology Report. The first mention of the word \\"Digerati\\" on USENET occurred in 1992 and referred to an article by Gilder in Upside magazine. His other books include Life After Television, a 1990 book that predicted microchip \\"telecomputers\\" connected by fiberoptic cable would make broadcast-model television obsolete. The book was also notable for being published by the Federal Express company and featuring full-page advertisements for that company on every fifth page.David Foster Wallace, \\"E Unibus Pluram: Television and U.S. Fiction\\", Review of Contemporary Fiction, 185 Gilder wrote the books Microcosm, about Carver Mead and the CMOS microchip revolution; Telecosm, about the promise of fiber optics; and his latest, The Silicon Eye, about the Foveon X3 sensor, a digital camera imager chip. The book cover of the Silicon Eye reads, \\"How a Silicon Valley Company Aims to Make All Current Computers, Cameras, and Cell Phones Obsolete.\\" The Foveon sensor has not achieved this goal and has not yet been used in cell phones. Gilder is an active investor in private companies and serves as the chairman of the advisory board in Israel- based ASOCS that he discovered during his research for Israel Test. ===On women and feminism=== In the early 1970s, Gilder wrote an article in the Ripon Forum defending President Richard Nixon's veto of a day-care bill sponsored by Senator Walter Mondale (D-Minnesota) and Senator Jacob Javits (R-New York). He was fired as editor as a result. To defend himself, he appeared on Firing Line. Gilder moved to New Orleans and worked in the mornings for Ben Toledano, Republican candidate for the United States Senate in 1972 and the party's nominee for mayor of New Orleans in 1970. Also, he wrote Sexual Suicide (1973), revised and reissued as Men and Marriage (1986). The book achieved a succès de scandale and Time made Gilder \\"Male Chauvinist Pig of the Year.\\" ===Support for immigration=== Gilder has praised mass immigration as an economic boon in both the US and Israel. Although Gilder's support for mass immigration is framed by high tech hubs such as Silicon Valley's need for computer programmers, he sees recent American immigration policy as being vital to American prosperity overall. ===The American Spectator=== Gilder bought the conservative political monthly magazine The American Spectator from its founder, Emmett Tyrrell, in the summer of 2000, switching the magazine's focus from politics to technology. Experiencing his own financial problems in 2002, Gilder sold the Spectator back to Tyrrell. ===Speaking engagements and editorial contributions=== For nearly thirty years, he has lectured internationally on economics, technology, education, and social theory. He has addressed audiences from Washington, DC, to the Vatican, and he has appeared at numerous conferences, public policy events, and media outlets. ==Wealth and Poverty== After completing Visible Man in the late 1970s Gilder began writing \\"The Pursuit of Poverty.\\" In early 1981 Basic Books published the result as Wealth and Poverty. It was an analysis of the roots of economic growth. Reviewing it within a month of the inauguration of the Reagan Administration The New York Times reviewer called it \\"A Guide to Capitalism\\". It offered, he wrote, \\"a creed for capitalism worthy of intelligent people.\\" The book was a The New York Times bestseller and eventually sold over a million copies. In Wealth and Poverty Gilder extended the sociological and anthropological analysis of his early books in which he had advocated for the socialization of men into service to women through work and marriage. He wove these sociological themes into the economic policy prescriptions of supply-side economics. In his eyes the breakup of the nuclear family and the policies of demand-side economics led to poverty, while family and supply-side policies led to wealth. In reviewing the problems of the immediate past—the inflation, recession, and urban problems of the 1970s—and proposing his supply-side solutions, Gilder argued not just the practical but the moral superiority of supply-side capitalism over the alternatives. \\"Capitalism begins with giving,\\" he asserted, while New Deal liberalism created moral hazard. It was work, family, and faith that created wealth out of poverty. \\"It is this supply-side moral vision that underlies all the economic arguments of Wealth and Poverty,\\" he wrote. In 1994 Gilder wrote that the poor in America are “ruined by the overflow of American prosperity” and “moral decay” and that they are in need of \\"Christian teaching from the churches.\\" ==The Israel Test== Gilder's 2009 book The Israel Test is partly described as Gilder calling Israel as a leader of civilization. ==Intelligent design== He helped found the Discovery Institute with Bruce Chapman. The organization started as a moderate group that aimed to privatize and modernize Seattle's transit systems. It later became the leading thinktank of the intelligent design movement, with Gilder writing many articles for intelligent design and against the theory of evolution.Chris C.

Clauberg was the founding Rector of the first University of Duisburg, where he taught from 1655 to 1665. He is known as a \\"scholastic cartesian\\". == Biography == He was born in Solingen, and educated in the Aristotelian tradition in Köln, Moers and Bremen, then in Groningen, where he discovered what came to be called the reformed variation of Aristotelianism. He gave his first disputations in Groningen under the supervision of Tobias Andreae. His first treatise in metaphysics was written in those student years: Elementa philosophiae sive Ontosophia (1647). Travelling in France and England, he came to study the Cartesian philosophy under Johannes de Raey at Leiden. In 1649, he became professor of philosophy and theology at Herborn, but subsequently (1651), in consequence of the jealousy of his colleagues, accepted an invitation to a similar post at Duisburg. Clauberg was one of the earliest teachers of the new doctrines in Germany and an exact and methodical commentator on his masters writings. His theory of the connection between the soul and the body is in some respects analogous to that of Malebranche; but he is not therefore to be regarded as a true forerunner of Occasionalism, as he uses Occasion for the stimulus which directly produces a mental phenomenon, without postulating the intervention of God.Cf. H. Müller, J. Clauberg und seine Stellung im Cartesianismus. His view of the relation of God to his creatures is held to foreshadow the pantheism of Spinoza. All creatures exist only through the continuous creative energy of the Divine Being, and are no more independent of his will than are our thoughts independent of us, or rather less, for there are thoughts which force themselves upon us whether we will or not. Metaphysics, in Clauberg's conception, studies not the being (ens), but the intelligible, as in the most general object of the intellect (ens cogitabile). The most high concept is not being, but the object in general as known to the intellect. For metaphysics Clauberg suggested the names ontosophy or ontology, the latter being afterwards adopted by Wolff. In the prolegomena to his Elementa philosophiae sive Ontosophiae (1647), Clauberg says: Étienne Gilson writes:In L'être et l'essence. Paris, Vrin, 1948 (English edition: Being and some philosophers, Toronto, Pontifical Institute for Mediaeval Studies, 1952), p. 112. Clauberg died in Duisburg, and lies buried in the city's cathedral. ==Works== A collected edition of his philosophical works was published at Amsterdam (1691), with life by H. C. Hennin; see also E.

Cooking apples are generally larger, and can be tarter than dessert varieties. Some varieties have a firm flesh that does not break down much when cooked. Culinary varieties with a high acid content produce froth when cooked, which is desirable for some recipes.The new Oxford book of food plantsVaughan & Geissler Britain grows a large range of apples specifically for cooking. Worldwide, dual-purpose varieties (for both cooking and eating raw) are more widely grown. Apples can be cooked down into sauce, apple butter, or fruit preserves. They can be baked in an oven and served with custard, and made into pies or apple crumble. In the UK roast pork is commonly served with cold apple sauce made from boiled and mashed apples. Bramley apple is by far the most popular cooking apple in the United Kingdom, while Granny Smith may be the most popular in the United States and Australia (where it originated).http://dish.allrecipes.com/apples/ A baked apple is baked in an oven until it has become soft. The core is usually removed and the resulting cavity stuffed with fruits, brown sugar, raisins, or cinnamon, and sometimes a liquor such as brandy. An apple dumpling adds a pastry crust.

Translation: You are entering onto the A75 / La Méridienne / Have a good drive The A75 is an autoroute (motorway) in France. Known also as la Méridienne, it is a developmental project with the aim of speeding up and reducing the cost of car travel from Paris southwards, and apart from the Millau Viaduct, it is entirely free for the between Clermont-Ferrand and Béziers. It was due for completion in spring 2011,\\"A75: Le point sur les travaux entre Pézenas et Béziers\\", Midi Libre, 16 June 2008, p 3 but was fully open in December 2010. South of St. Flour there are excellent views of the Garabit viaduct. A large portion of the A75 is also part of the European route E11. ==Engineering achievements== The building of a motorway across the Massif Central is, in itself, a formidable achievement. Much of the motorway runs at an altitude in excess of 800 m (2600 ft) with 50 km in excess of 1000 m (3250 ft). The single most impressive feature is undoubtedly the Millau Viaduct, which carries the road over the Tarn. It was constructed under a government contract with the Eiffage group, effective for 75 years. Eiffage collects tolls at agreed rates making this the only tolled part of the A75.

The final section, a gap between Valros and Servian, was completed in December 2010.

Marijnissen, a welder by occupation, was selected as Leader of the Socialist Party after the death of on 1 October 1986 and became Chairman of the Socialist Party on 20 May 1988. For the election of 1994 Marijnissen was the Lijsttrekker (top candidate) and won two seats in the House of Representatives, the first time the Socialist Party won representation in the States General of the Netherlands. Marijnissen was elected as a Member of the House of Representatives on 17 May 1994 and became the Parliamentary leader of the Socialist Party in the House of Representatives. For the elections of 1998 and 2002 Marijnissen again as Lijsttrekker won three and four seats respectively. For the election of 2006 Marijnissen for the fifth time as Lijsttrekker won sixteen seats and the Socialist Party became the third-largest party in the House of Representatives. On 20 June 2008 Marijnissen announced his retirement as Leader of the Socialist Party and Parliamentary leader of the Socialist Party in the House of Representatives citing health reasons. Marijnissen remained a Member of the House of Representatives until after the 2010 general election. Marijnissen stood down as Chairman of the Socialist Party on 28 November 2015. He is the father of Lilian Marijnissen, the current Leader of the Socialist Party. ==Early life== Johannes Guillaume Christianus Andreas Marijnissen was born on 8 October 1952 in Oss in the Dutch Province of North Brabant in a Roman Catholic family. After leaving secondary school shortly before the exams, he worked in a number of factories in and around Oss. He then trained as a welder, working for ten years in the metal industry. ==Politics== ===Local politics=== Meanwhile, he helped founding the SP in Oss and, in 1975, became the Netherlands' youngest councillor ever. He remained a councillor until 1993, playing a leading role in many campaigns, such as against polluting discharges. The SP's council representation in Oss has grown at every local election and is, as of 2005, the biggest stronghold of the Socialist Party in the Netherlands. Nicknamed \\"The Wizard of Oss\\", after his hometown, he became famous when he turned out to be one of the main architects of the Dutch vote that rejected the European Constitution in June 2005. In 1987 Marijnissen became the party's first ever provincial assembly member, in North Brabant. A year later he became the SP's national president. Under his leadership the party was transformed from \\"a federation of local branches\\" into a party with a clear national programme, nationally-organised activities and a national profile. ===National politics=== Beginning in 1994, when the SP made the breakthrough which brought it into the House of Representatives, Marijnissen was chairman of the party's parliamentary group. After gaining two out of the 150 parliamentary seats during this first breakthrough, support for him and his party rose slowly but continuously. After four years in parliament, his Socialist Party went under his lead from two to five seats during the national elections of 1998, which was followed by a growth towards nine seats in 2002. In 2003, after the 87-day term of Balkenende I, the Socialist Party didn't manage to gain more seats than the year before and stayed at the same level with again 9 out of 150 seats. Although there was a slight rise in number of people who voted for the SP compared to a year before, a few weeks before the elections the polls suggested the SP might double. After the 2004 elections a conflict arose between Jan Marijnissen and Ali Lazrak, when the latter refused to conform to an agreement that required all SP politicians to donate part of their wages. Lazrak accused Marijnissen of dictatorial behavior; an attempt to settle the argument failed and Lazrak left the fraction on 2 February 2004. In February 2006 the party was polled on 9.5% of the electorate in the municipal elections. After the untimely end of Balkenende II and the minority government of Balkenende III, the SP won 16 more seats in the 2006 elections to a total of 25, becoming the third party of the Netherlands. Soon after, the party membership passed 50,000.Jan Marijnissen verwelkomt 50.000ste SP-lid met taart en bloemen . Downloaded November 29, 2005 In 2006 a majority of members of parliament voted for his idea to build a National Historic Museum in the Netherlands. In 2007 the Minister of Culture decided the city Arnhem would be its residence. On 17 June 2008 Marijnissen announced his resignation as chairman of the SP group in the House of Representatives because of health reasons. However, he remains a member of the House of Representatives and chairman of the Socialist Party. Marijnissen was said to appeal to the 'common man' because of his use of simple language. His appeal is also explained by some observers by his capacity of presenting himself as a valid, more social alternative to the PvdA, which moved into a more centrist third way direction by advocating welfare reforms under the leadership of Prime Minister Wim Kok and his so- called Purple Cabinets (1994–2002). Critics of Marijnissen call his leadership style authoritarian, because he is presumed to have a tight grip on his party. ==Bibliography== *Samenleven kan je niet alleen (You can't live together alone), SP, (1993).

Pisgat Ze'ev (, lit. Ze'ev's Peak) is an Israeli settlement in East Jerusalem and the largest residential neighborhood in Jerusalem with a population of over 50,000.Pisgat Ze'ev at GoJerusalem.com Pisgat Ze'ev was established by Israel as one of the city's five Ring Neighborhoods on land effectively annexed after the 1967 Six- Day War. The international community considers Israeli settlements in East Jerusalem illegal under international law, but the Israeli government disputes this. Pisgat Ze'ev is situated east of Shuafat and Beit Hanina, west of Hizma, south of Neve Yaakov, and north of 'Anata and the Shuafat refugee camp. The Israeli West Bank barrier includes Pisgat Ze'ev in the northern section of Jerusalem while excluding Shuafat refugee camp from the city by running in an S-shape here. ==History== Pisgat Ze'ev Jerusalem Light Rail running through Pisgat Ze'ev ===Antiquity=== Archeological evidence shows that in the biblical period, the site encompassed small agricultural villages along routes north from Jerusalem to Nablus and the Galilee. The villages made use of varied water-catchment strategies and served the needs of Israelite Jerusalem, including as a major producer of wine and oil for use in the Temple in Jerusalem.Pisgat Ze'ev Jerusalem Municipality Three ritual baths from the Second Temple period have been excavated in Pisgat Ze'ev.Second Temple Period Ritual Baths Adjacent to Agricultural Installations The Byzantine period saw the villages' primary use shift from agriculture to service religious functions, such as churches and monasteries. A large monastery from the period was located at the site's highest point, Ras at-Tawill. The monastery was likely active from the end of the 5th century to the close of the 8th century, and included a mosaic-floored chapel above a burial cave, as well as an oil press and a cloth bag of 200 coins. An oven and pots from the Iron Age were also found nearby. An archaeological site known as Deir Ghazali (the Deer Monastery) was also excavated in eastern Pisgat Ze’ev.Heritage conservation in Israel:Maintaining Antiquities Sites in the Western Part of the City Overlooking the neighborhood is Tell el-Ful, believed to be the capital of the Tribe of Judah and site of the Israelite King Saul's palace.

Retrieved 23 December 2010. ===Modern era=== In the 1930s, plots of land were purchased near Hizme by European Jews for the establishment of a Jewish farming cooperative, Havatzelet Binyamin. Most of the landowners died in the Holocaust. The land was later expropriated along with Palestinian land to build Pisgat Ze'ev.Much of Pisgat Ze'ev built on land bought by Jews who died in the Holocaust, Haaretz Pisgat Ze'ev was established in 1982 on land annexed to Israel after the 1967 Six-Day War as one of the city's five Ring Neighborhoods, meant to create a contiguous Jewish link with Neve Yaakov in the city's north, which had been isolated from other Jewish areas. The original name proposal was \\"Pisgat Tal,\\" based on the Arabic name of the hilltop where construction was to begin, Ras at-Tawill, but the final choice was Pisgat Ze'ev, after the Revisionist Zionist leader, Ze'ev Jabotinsky. According to ARIJ, Israel confiscated land from several surrounding Palestinian communities in order to construct Pisgat Ze'ev: *1,458 dunams from Beit Hanina,Beit Hanina Town Profile, 2013, pp. 13-14 *686 dunams from Beit Hanina for the Pisgat Amir neighbourhood in Pisgat Ze'ev, *239 dunams from Shuafat,Shu’fat Town Profile, 2013 p. 14 *89 dunams from Hizma.Hizma Village Profile, 2012, p. 17 In May 2003, a public bus leaving the Pisgat Ze'ev terminus was blown up by a Palestinian suicide bomber. Seven people were killed in the attack and dozens were wounded. The police said the bomber boarded the bus disguised as a religious Jew, wearing a kippa and a prayer shawl. One of the victims was a resident of the Shuafat refugee camp, on his way to work at the Hadassah Medical Center in Ein Kerem. ==Geography== Great Synagogue, Pisgat Ze'ev The neighborhood was established on a hilltop known in Arabic as Ras at-Tawill, 772 meters above sea level, and its additional construction phases descend along the ridge and up to a neighboring hill. Pisgat Ze'ev has five districts: Center (1984), West (1988), East and North (1990), and South (1998). Pisgat Ze'ev is situated in north Jerusalem to the east of Shuafat and Beit Hanina, west of Hizma, south of Neve Yaakov, and north of French Hill, 'Anata and the Shuafat refugee camp. It is due east of the watershed on the edge of the Judean Desert. ==Demographics== In 2017, Pisgat Zeev had a population of 42,300. In 2007 it was reported to have about 1,300 of which were Arabs. Holy city twist: Arabs moving into Jewish areas Many residents of Pisgat Ze'ev are Jerusalem families that left the city center in search of more affordable housing. Pisgat Ze'ev has a mixed population of religious and secular Jews. The construction of the Israeli West Bank barrier has also prompted Arabs to move to Pisgat Ze'ev. ==Status under international law== The international community considers Israeli settlements in the Israeli-occupied territories, including East Jerusalem, to violate the Fourth Geneva Convention's prohibition on the transfer of a civilian population into occupied territory and thus illegal under international law, but the Israeli government disputes this.The settlers' struggle BBC News. 19 December 2003 Israel disputes that the Fourth Geneva Convention applies to these territories as they had not been legally held by a sovereign prior to Israel taking control of them.

Many of the street names in Pisgat Ze'ev commemorate leading Israeli personalities such as Simcha Holtzberg, Moshe Rachmilewitz, Eliyahu Meridor and Meir Gershon. In the center of Pisgat Ze'ev, many streets are named for Israel Defense Forces units that fought in the country's wars such as Sayeret Duchifat Blvd., HaSayeret HaYerushalmit St., Sayeret Golani St. and Hel HaAvir St. A memorial for fallen soldiers is located in an archeological park in central Pisgat Ze'ev. ===Street names=== Moshe Dayan Boulevard, beginning at Highway 1 (Israel/Palestine) in the south and ending in Neve Yaakov in the north, is named after the famed Israeli Army general.

Hunter Lovins feebate programs have typically been used to shift buying habits in the transportation and energy sectors. == Examples == California's proposed \\"Clean Car Discount\\" program (AB493-Ruskin)Body of AB 493 Assembly Bill, retrieved 2-28-2008. was designed to help reduce the state's global warming/greenhouse gas emissions by imposing a fee of up to $2,500 on new, high carbon emitting vehicles (starting with 2011 models), and then rebating the fee to buyers of new low emission vehicles, thereby theoretically shifting the social cost of the destruction of public goods by global warming onto those who contribute to global warming. This Bill failed to pass.legis.state.wi.us Supporters point towards what they feel are feebates' tendency to promote personal responsibility by having those responsible for the involuntary expropriation (by means of force and fraud) of public goods from the public—and each and every private individual—by destruction of the environment or other negligent behavior towards private and public property, by having polluters pay for the externalities that they impose upon society. In the case of personal cars, feebates share some of the same aims as fuel taxes, vehicle registration fees, congestion charging, and road pricing. It is claimed feebates are generally a more efficient way of promoting greater fuel efficiency and other socially-desirable outcomes than traditional taxes or quotas. Fuel taxes create important price signals that can make consumers aware of the non-internalized costs of fuel consumption (greenhouse gasses, other pollution)—and raise funds to offset this externality. But retail consumers have very high discount rates, meaning buyers do not take into account the additional cost high gasoline taxes or poor gas mileage when purchasing a car. A feebate internalizes that cost into the initial purchase price, thereby requiring the buyer to prepay for the taking of public and private environmental goods. Another example of a feebate is proposed in the Rocky Mountain Institute's 2004 publication, \\"Winning the Oil Endgame\\". For each class of car and light truck, a feebate mechanism is used to reward buyers of vehicles that are more fuel efficient than the average vehicle in that class and penalize buyers of less fuel efficient vehicles. This feebate is revenue-neutral, meaning that the amount of money collected through fees (surcharges) equals the amount paid out in rebates. ==See also== *Cross subsidization *Ecotax *Green economy *Pigouvian tax *Tax shift ==References== ==External links== * Environment Canada-sponsored study on options for feebate programs in Canada Category:Vehicle taxes ","title":"Feebate"},{"id":"1280943","text":"Kaya may refer to: ==People== *Kaya (given name) *Kaya (surname) ==Places== *Kaya, Burkina Faso, a town in Burkina Faso, capital of the department *Kaya Airport, serving the town *Kaya Department, a department or commune of Sanmatenga Province in central Burkina Faso *Kaya, Fethiye, a village in Muğla Province, Turkey *Kaya, Hopa, a village in Artvin Province, Turkey *Kaya, Kyoto, a town located in Yosa District, Kyoto Prefecture, Japan *Kaya (Mijikenda), a sacred forest site of the Mijikenda peoples in Kenya *Kaya, South Sudan, a town in South Sudan *Skiu-Kaya, adjoining villages in Ladakh, India * Kaya confederacy, an alternate romanization of the ancient Gaya confederacy on the Korean peninsula ==Popular culture== *Kaya (film), a 1969 Yugoslav film *Kaya FM, a radio station in Johannesburg, South Africa *Kaya (TV series), a scripted MTV drama television series ===Anime=== *Kaya (One Piece), a fictional character in the anime and manga One Piece *Kaya (Princess Mononoke), a character from the anime movie Princess Mononoke === Literature === * Kaya Press, an independent publisher ===Music=== *Kaya (album), an album by Bob Marley and the Wailers (1978) **Kaya Tour, a concert tour organised to support the album ** \\"Kaya,\\" the title track of the album *Kaya (Canadian singer) (born 1968), real name Francis Martin Lavergne *Kaya (Japanese musician), former member of Schwarz Stein *Kaya (Mauritian musician) (1960–1999), singer and creator of Seggae *Kaya, a vocal group in the Australian version of The X Factor *Kaya (Bulgarian band) (1999–present) ==Other uses== *Gaya confederacy, a confederacy in southern Korea (42–562 CE) *Kaya Airlines, a Mozambican airline *Kaya F.C., a Filipino association football club *Kaya identity, an equation relating factors that determine the level of human impact on climate, in the form of emissions of the greenhouse gas carbon dioxide *Kaya (jam), a type of coconut egg jam popular in Malaysia, Singapore and Indonesia *Kaya-no-miya, the seventh oldest collateral branch (ōke) of the Japanese Imperial Family *Kaya toast, a popular snack amongst Malaysians and Singaporeans and other SE Asians *Kaya (tree), Torreya nucifera, or Japanese Nutmeg tree *, several ships *Trikaya, the Buddhist doctrine of three kayas (bodies) of Buddha ==See also== * * *Kayah (disambiguation) *Kaia (disambiguation) *Kaja (disambiguation) ","title":"Kaya"},{"id":"1280946","text":"Rox or ROX may refer to: * Rox (album), an album by California punk band Supernova * Rox (singer), London-based singer * Rox (TV series) * ROX (Flemish TV series) * Rox, Nevada, a ghost town * Roxithromycin, sold under the trade name ROX * ROX Desktop, a Unix desktop environment based on the ROX-Filer file manager * Rox II, a blues/rock live album by Max on the Rox * Rox Jewellers (retailer), in the United Kingdom * Brockton Rox, a minor league baseball team in Brockton, Massachusetts * St. Cloud Rox (minor league baseball), a team in St. Cloud, Minnesota, that played from 1946 to 1971 * St. Cloud Rox (collegiate summer baseball), a team in St. Cloud, Minnesota, since 1997 * The Rox, a renamed Ellis Island in the Wild Cards book series * \\"Rox\\", a song by Scottish band The Aliens from the album Astronomy for Dogs * The Rox, a nickname for the Colorado Rockies * The Rox, a nickname for the Houston Rockets * Rox, a model of bicycle computer made by Sigma Sport * Rox, the currency in the children's online game Moshi Monsters * ROX is the ticker symbol and shorthand nomer for Castle Brands * Rox, a main character in the animated television series Sunny Day * Rox, a cosmetic outfit in Fortnite Battle Royale * Rox, a videogame released in 1998 for Sega Saturn and in 2003 for PlayStation ","title":"Rox"},{"id":"1280949","text":"Robert Flint (14 March 1838 – 1910) was a Scottish theologian and philosopher who wrote also on sociology. ==Life== Flint's home at 3 Royal Terrace, Edinburgh The grave of Prof Robert Flint, Liberton Cemetery, Edinburgh Flint was born in Applegarth in Dumfriesshire on 14 March 1838, the son of Grace Johnston (née Paterson) and Robert Flint, a farm overseer. His first school was in Moffat. In 1852, he entered the University of Glasgow where he distinguished himself, without graduating, in arts and divinity. Having been employed as a lay missionary by the 'Elders' Association' of Glasgow, Flint was licensed to preach in 1858, and for a short time acted as assistant to Norman Macleod, at the Barony Church, Glasgow. He was minister of the East Church, Aberdeen from 1859 to 1862, and of Kilconquhar church in Fife from 1862 to 1864, a small country village parish, which gave him leisure for study, improved by visits to Germany. On the death of James Frederick Ferrier in 1864, Flint was elected to succeed him in the moral philosophy chair at the University of St Andrews, among the competing candidates being Thomas Hill Green. This chair he held till 1876, when he succeeded Thomas Jackson Crawford in the divinity chair of the University of Edinburgh. On this appointment he was awarded doctorates by both the University of Glasgow (LLD) and the University of Edinburgh (DD). Thomas Chalmers had similarly migrated from the one chair to the other. Flint was appointed to a number of foundation lectureships. He was Baird lecturer (1876-7); in 1880 he travelled to America, and delivered a course as Stone lecturer at Princeton University; in 1887-8 he was Croall lecturer. He was elected on 21 May 1883 corresponding member of the Institute of France (Académie des sciences morales et politiques), and was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh in 1880. His proposers were Sir Robert Christison, Sir Alexander Grant, Alexander Campbell Fraser and Peter Guthrie Tait. He served as Vice President to the Society for three sessions: 1886–1892; 1893–1899; and 1902–1907. He resigned his chair in 1903 to devote himself to literary work, a purpose hampered by failing health. His post was filled by Rev Prof William Paterson Paterson (later Moderator of the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland. For some time he lived at Musselburgh. He delivered the Gifford lectures in 1908–1909. Flint died, unmarried, at his residence, 5 Royal Terrace, Edinburgh, on 25 November 1910. In 2015 the building was occupied by a restaurant and hotel.

Knies is very important to early American economic thought, as some of its founders studied under him, e.g., John Bates Clark attended from 1872 to 1875 the University of Zurich and the University of Heidelberg where he studied under him; Clark supervised the thesis of Frank Knight, who in turn influenced Paul Samuelson, who was the first to win the John Bates Clark Medal for the best American economist under age forty.

It is based on the novel of the same title by Maurice Gee. The film was released in October 2004 to glowing reviews.In My Father's Den - Movie Reviews, Trailers, Pictures - Rotten Tomatoes == Plot == Following the death of his father Jeff (Matthew Chamberlain), renowned war photographer Paul Prior (Matthew Macfadyen) returns to his hometown in the South Island of New Zealand. Paul also reunites with his younger brother Andrew (Colin Moy), a pious local ostrich farmer, who is married to the very religious Penny (Miranda Otto). Under Andrew's pressure, Paul reluctantly prolongs his stay to help sort out the sale of their father's cottage and the adjoining orchard. Returning to the dilapidated family property, Paul revisits his father's makeshift den in the equipment shed. Jeff, who secretly harboured a love of wine, literature, and free-thinking philosophy, found solace in the den away from his puritanical wife Iris (Vanessa Riddell). When Paul as a child had accidentally stumbled upon this wondrous booklined universe, his father had shared the den with him on the condition that he did not tell anyone else. While back in his hometown, Paul accepts a temporary English teaching position at his old high school. Paul also forges an unlikely friendship with the 16-year old Celia (Emily Barclay), a teenaged misfit who loves writing and dreams of traveling to Spain. Celia is the daughter of Paul's former girlfriend Jackie (Jodie Rimmer), the town's butcher. Believing Celia to be his daughter, Paul becomes a father figure for the teenager. Resenting the unwanted attentions of her mother's boyfriend Gareth (Antony Starr), Celia seeks solace in Paul's den. Paul and Celia's budding friendship eventually comes under scrutiny from the judgemental Andrew and the envious Jackie. After Paul attacks Gareth for beating Celia, Jackie forbids Paul from having contact with her daughter. Despite the warnings, Celia continues to visit and Paul encourages her in her ambitions as a writer. In the middle of winter, Celia goes missing. Due to their close friendship, Paul becomes the prime suspect in her disappearance and endures the hostility of the town including Gareth and his teenage nephew Jonathan (Jimmy Keen), who fancied Celia. The rest of the film is shown in flashbacks of Paul's teenage years interspersed with his interactions with Celia and final confrontation with Andrew. After Jonathan reveals that his father had confiscated his camera for illicitly photographing Celia, Paul confronts Andrew. Jeff is revealed to be Celia's biological father through an affair with Jackie. Grief-stricken and betrayed, Paul's mother Iris (Vanessa Riddell) had committed suicide. Despite the pleas of Andrew, Paul had left the family home at the age of 17. Hating his father, Andrew came to blame Paul for their mother's death. Paul also learns that Andrew had invited Celia to view their late father's will. Jeff had left a third of his estate to Celia. Mistaking Celia for Andrew's mistress after accidentally viewing Jonathan's photos, an enraged Penny had pushed Celia over the balcony, killing her. To protect his wife, Andrew takes the blame for Celia's death. Believing his father killed Celia, Jonathan calls the police who arrest Andrew. Celia's body is later found in a river. Following the funeral, Paul burns the den and reconciles with Jackie. The film closes with a flashback to the last time Paul saw Celia; they openly talk about being siblings, and they say goodbye as she walks down the road to her untimely death. == Cast == * Matthew Macfadyen as Paul Prior * Emily Barclay as Celia * Colin Moy as Andrew * Miranda Otto as Penny * Jodie Rimmer as Jackie * Vanessa Riddell as Iris * Matthew Chamberlain as Jeff * Antony Starr as Gareth * Jimmy Keen as Jonathan * Asher Emanuel as Young Paul == Production == Filming locations were mainly in Central Otago, New Zealand, with the town of Roxburgh standing in for the fictional Rapata Junction.

She was launched on 19 March 1798 from Northfleet, and was eventually broken up in 1826. Superb is mostly associated with Richard Goodwin Keats who commanded her as captain from 1801 until his promotion in 1806. She also served as his flagship from early 1808 until she was paid off in 1809. ==Battle of Algeciras Bay== In July 1801 the Superb was stationed off Cadiz and took part in the second Battle of Algeciras Bay. During the French and Spanish retreat Admiral Sir James Saumarez hailed the Superb and ordered Keats to catch the allied fleet's rear and engage. The Superb was a relatively new ship and had not been long on blockade duty. As a consequence she was the fastest sailing ship-of-the-line in the fleet. As night fell on 12 July, Keats sailed the Superb alongside the 112-gun Real Carlos on her starboard side. Another Spanish ship, the 112-gun San Hermenegildo, was sailing abreast, on the port side, of the Real Carlos. Keats fired into the Real Carlos and some shot passed her and struck the San Hermenegildo. The Real Carlos caught fire and Keats disengaged her to continue up the line. In the darkness the two Spanish ships confused one another for British ships and began a furious duel. With the Real Carlos aflame the captain of the Hermenegildo determined to take advantage and crossed the Real Carlos’ stern in order to deal a fatal broadside that would run the length of the ship through the unprotected stern. A sudden gust of wind brought the two ships together and entangled their rigging. The Hermenegildo also caught fire and the two enormous three-deck ships exploded. The Superb continued on relatively unscathed and engaged the French 74-gun St. Antoine under Commodore Julien le Roy. The St. Antoine struck after a brief exchange of broadsides. ==Battle of San Domingo== She was the flagship of Admiral John Thomas Duckworth in the Battle of San Domingo. ==Copenhagen and the Baltic== On 26 July 1808, Superb, , and captured Falck and Kline Wiloelm. Superb was commissioned in December 1809 under the command of Captain Samuel Jackson. She went out to the Baltic as Keats's flagship, and was part of the squadron there under Admiral Sir James Saumarez. She returned to Portsmouth, and underwent repairs between September 1811 and November 1812, before commissioning in September 1812 under Captain Charles Paget. ==War of 1812== Paget was appointed to command Superb as part of the Channel Fleet, and during a cruise in the Bay of Biscay he took several prizes. On 13 February 1813 , which had been sailing from New York to Bordeaux, arrived at Bideford. She was a prize to Superb. Captain Paget described the prize as \\"the fine American brig Star, of three hundred and fifty tons, six guns, and thirty-five men.\\" In 1814 Superb was employed on the coast of North America under the orders of Sir Alexander Cochrane and took part in an attack upon Wareham, Massachusetts during the War of 1812.Obituary of Vice Admiral Sir Charles Paget in The Gentleman's Magazine 1839, p 657-8, accessed 28 October 2007 ==Citations== ==References== *Lavery, Brian (2003) The Ship of the Line - Volume 1: The development of the battlefleet 1650-1850.

He then went to France to study engineering at École Centrale Paris from 1886 to 1890. After returning to Romania, he entered politics. From 1907 to 1911 he was Mayor of Bucharest. During World War I, he was Minister of War (15 August 1916–19 July 1917) and then Minister for War Munitions. After the war, he served as Finance Minister (19 January 1922–9 March 1926) in the Liberal government led by his brother, Ion. After his brother died on 24 November 1927, he assumed the post of Prime Minister of Romania until he was forced to resign a year later to allow the new National Peasants' Party government of Iuliu Maniu to take office. In November 1927 he had also assumed the presidency of the National Liberal Party; he remained in that position until the end of his life. On 22 December 1930 Brătianu was at his estate in Mihăești, Vâlcea, when he had a stroke of apoplexy which paralyzed his left side; he died that evening at the hospital in nearby Râmnicu Vâlcea. He is buried at the family estate, Florica, in a crypt where also lie his father Ion C. Brătianu and his brother Ion I. C. Brătianu, as well as his other brother, Dinu Brătianu, and his nephew, Gheorghe I. Brătianu, both of whom died in the early 1950s at Sighet Prison. ==References== ==Gallery== File:Vintilă Brătianu voluntar, 1885.JPG File:1887 - Vintilă Brătianu la vârsta de douăzeci de ani.PNG File:1910 - Vintilă Brătianu - primarul Bucureştilor.PNG File:1910 - Vintilă Brătianu Portret.PNG File:1858 - Ion C Brătianu).PNG File:Vintila Bratianu - Foto01.jpg == See also == * Brătianu family ==External links== *Rulers.org Category:1867 births Category:1930 deaths Vintila Bratianu Category:People from Ștefănești, Argeș Category:Members of the Chamber of Deputies (Romania) Category:Romanian Ministers of Defence Category:Romanian Ministers of Finance Category:Chairpersons of the National Liberal Party (Romania) Category:Mayors of Bucharest Category:Prime Ministers of Romania Category:Children of national leaders Category:Saint Sava National College alumni Category:École Centrale Paris alumni Category:Deaths from cerebral infarction ","title":"Vintilă Brătianu"},{"id":"1281005","text":"Pinelli is an Italian surname, and may refer to: *Giuseppe Pinelli (1928–1969), anarchist *Antonia Bertucci-Pinelli (died c. 1640), Italian painter of the Baroque *Babe Pinelli (1895–1984), American baseball umpire *Bartolomeo Pinelli (1771–1835), illustrator and engraver *Dario Pinelli (born 1982), jazz guitarist *German Pinelli (1907–1996), Cuban journalist and actor *Gian Vincenzo Pinelli, 16th-century Italian humanist and botanist *Tullio Pinelli (1908–2009), screenwriter It could also be a reference to: * the Pinelli–Walckenaer Atlas, a 14th-century atlas. ==See also== *Prince of Belmonte *Penale Category:Surnames ","title":"Pinelli"},{"id":"1281011","text":"Ludewa District, United States National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency is one of six districts in the Njombe Region in Tanzania, East Africa.

This species is commonly called crayfish or crays in both Australia and New Zealand and ' in Māori. They resemble lobsters, but lack the large characteristic pincers on the first pair of walking legs. Spiny rock lobsters are carnivorous, leaving their rock cover to venture out to feed during the night. They live in and around reefs at depths ranging from deep at the continental shelf. They can be dark red and orange above with paler yellowish abdomens or grey-green brown with the paler underside. The more tropical animals tend to have the brighter colours. Adult carapaces can grow up to in length and can often exceed in underfished areas. ==Distribution== Jasus edwardsii is found around most of the coast of New Zealand, including the three main islands, the Three Kings Islands, the Chatham Islands, the Snares Islands, the Bounty Islands, the Antipodes Islands and the Auckland Islands. This last locality is the southernmost place where spiny lobsters occur in the world. In Australia, J. edwardsii is found around the southern coast, from central New South Wales to southern Western Australia, including Tasmania. ==Life cycle== Adults are sexually mature at between 7 and 11 years, mating occurs during late summer and autumn. Eggs develop on females, which carry between 100,000 and 500,000 eggs which are fertilised and held below the tail on hairs on the female's abdomen. The eggs develop here for 3 to 5 months. Eggs then metamorphose into naupliosoma larva which leave the female and are free swimming plankton which migrate towards the surface where they moult into a phyllosoma larva. The rock lobster has among the longest larval development known for any marine creature. The phyllosoma (Greek for \\"leaf-like\\") larvae spend between 9 months to 2 years in oceanic waters before metamorphosing to the post larval stage, known as the puerulus, which then swims towards the coast to settle. ==Size== Maximum total body length is 58 cm (males), and 43 cm (females); maximum carapace lengths 23.5 cm (males), 18 cm (females); minimum legal carapace lengths 10 cm (males), and 9 cm (females). ==Aquaculture== The potential for Jasus edwardsii to become an aquaculture species in New Zealand is high. Although not commercially farmed yet, this species of lobster has a wild seed stock available and already some commercial companies are harvesting and on growing this seed stock. The National Institute of Water and Atmospheric Research (NIWA) has reared individuals from egg to adult, showing that it is possible to grow this species in captivity, although it takes between 200–400 days to reach maturity. This species is also a potential aquaculture species in Australia. There is already a well established export of wild rock lobster from Australia, especially Southern Australia which currently lands just over 3000 tonnes a year. An aquaculture of this species would serve to bulk up the wild catch and add value with high quality grown lobsters. South Australia currently does have limited aquaculture of Jasus edwardsii, keeping legal sized individuals from the fishery in cages in Kangaroo Island to make them available in the off season, ensuring a year-round supply to market, although no aquaculture from juveniles or eggs is done yet. ===Food=== NIWA used primarily brine shrimp to feed the juvenile lobsters, but little is known about a preferred food source. Chopped up mussel flesh has been used previously in Japan. Both these techniques carry some potential disadvantages – brine shrimp can introduce disease, and mussels deteriorate once introduced to the water, giving bacteria an environment to grow on. A study has shown that mussels provide the best food along with a carbohydrate source in the form of agar, allowing faster grow rates in the lobster. ===Techniques=== The most promising technique for aquaculture in New Zealand is sea cages. These have been successfully used internationally to grow similar species. In Vietnam sea cages are used to grow large amounts of Panulirus ornatus (ornate spiny lobster) in excess of 1,500 t valued at US$90 million. This species is also commercially cultured in Indonesia and the Philippines. There are three main types of sea cage – floating, wooden fixed, and submerged. *Floating cages as the name suggests are floating, nets are supported by floating buoys which are connected using a frame. They are often far above the seabed in waters deep in calm bays. This type of cage is used in Nga Trang Bay in Vietnam. Wooden fixed cages are near the bottom, or on the bottom of the sea and each net is attached to salt resistant wooden stakes driven into the ground in squares with nets between them. These may be on the seabed with sand covering the bottom of the cage. These cages are used in Van Phong Bay in Vietnam. *Submerged cages are sealed cubic cages with feeding holes in one end that are attached to the seabed. Similar to crab and crayfish pots used to catch adults. These cages are used in Cam Ranh Bay, Vietnam. Often the materials used to make these cages are sourced locally, in the form of nets from fishing, wood and other framing materials and floats. *There has been experimental work done in New Zealand with suspended cages which resulted in good grow rates and survivability as long as suitable sites are picked. ===Sites=== The sites for lobster farms should be in shallow water (not exceeding 20 m) and sheltered from currents and swell as well as potential strong winds. Often behind islands and in sheltered bays are the best sites as the sea cages are easily damaged by swell and high winds. Also the type of sea cage affects the site, floating and submerged cages can be in deeper water, and wooden fixed cages have to be in water only a few metres deep. ===Seed stock=== Due to the time it takes larva to develop (up to two years) the most cost-effective method of lobster aquaculture is to harvest wild pueruli. This has been done in Vietnam and has been done previously in New Zealand. This would allow a faster grow time to adults as the caught juvenile will have already had months of growth before being put in cages for aquaculture. There is a good source of pueruli in New Zealand (in places like Gisborne) and research into effective catching of pueruli is currently being done. Research suggests a 'bottle brush' collector as the most effective way, a mesh material attached to a PVC core resembling a bottle brush. The maximum sustainable yield of this seed stock is unknown and research will have to be carried out to determine this before an industry can be founded. ===Market=== This species provides New Zealand with a high price point aquaculture species in an industry dominated by low price species. New Zealand baited pot wild lobsters earn approximately $180 million per annum which is limited by the Quota Management System to a total allowable commercial catch (TACC) of 2,981 metric tonnes. An aquaculture industry has the potential to be large-scale and extremely profitable. ==See also== *Western rock lobster *Kaikoura *Sagmariasus ==References== Category:Achelata Category:Edible crustaceans Category:Commercial crustaceans Category:Crustaceans described in 1875 Category:Marine crustaceans of New Zealand Category:Taxa named by Frederick Wollaston Hutton Category:New Zealand seafood Category:Māori cuisine ","title":"Jasus edwardsii"},{"id":"1281033","text":"Madunda is a small settlement in the Ludewa District, Njombe region, Tanzania.

While a version was approved in the House, it failed to reach a vote in the Senate. ==Definition== The bill offered Puerto Ricans four options for their political future: statehood, independence, associated republic, or the current commonwealth status. The project proposed to carry out a referendum in which the people of Puerto Rico could choose the option they preferred. ==Controversy== The proposal was controversial in Puerto Rican politics for several reasons. Governor Pedro Rosselló and Resident Commissioner Carlos Romero Barceló, two avid supporters of statehood, were advocates of the legislation, and thus the bill was seen with suspicion by non-statehooders. Second, the legislation seemed to favor unchangeable status choices over commonwealth status, and the Commonwealth option in the bill defined Puerto Rico as a \\"territory subject to the supreme powers of the U.S. Congress.\\" The Popular Democratic Party of Puerto Rico (PPD) disagreed with this definition, stating that it portrayed the island as a colony of the United States, and not as a true commonwealth or free associated state (estado libre associado) between two nations. The PPD opposed the bill. The positions regarding Puerto Rican status within the U.S. National Parties are not monolithic. Overall, the national Democratic Party identifies mostly with Commonwealth supporters, with minorities favoring statehood or independence. The Republican Party are also conflicted. Nearly every presidential candidate for the Republican party has endorsed statehood; but many legislators worry about the potential for a Spanish-speaking majority state of Puerto Rico to tip the balance of power in congress. Some welcome the fiscal benefits of detaching the island from the U.S. The travails of H.R. 856 in the House of Representatives exemplifies the hurdles from conservative and liberal members that any status choice by Puerto Rico will face in Congress. The bill was introduced by conservative representative Gerald Solomon (Republican – New York or R-NY). The following amendments, many by liberal NY and IL congressman were debated: * Solomon: sought English be declared the official language of U.S. Substituted by Burton (R-IN) which encouraged English proficiency for all Puerto Ricans by age 10. Passed 240–177. * Gutierrez (Democrat- Illinois or D-IL); made Spanish official language of Puerto Rico. Failed 13–406. * Serrano (D-NY); allow U.S. citizens born in island but residing outside of Puerto Rico to vote in referendums; failed 57–356. * Serrano (D-NY): allow persons with one parent born in Puerto Rico to vote in referendum; failed by voice vote. * Gutierrez (D-NY): Congress recognizes Puerto Rico is sociologically and culturally a Caribbean and Latin American nation with a distinctive culture that has Spanish as a common language; failed by voice vote. * Stearns (R-FL): required a run-off referendum within 90 days between 2 options which received most votes; failed: 28–384 * Gutierrez (D-IL): delete language in the findings section of the bill which references the Treaty of Paris; Failed by voice vote. * Barr (R-GA): require the approval of statehood by a super-majority of 75% of the valid votes cast. failed: 131–282 * Velazquez (D-NY): add language to the findings section of the bill recognizing the separate and distinct nature of Puerto Rican citizenship in relation to U.S. citizenship. Failed by voice vote. * Gutierrez (D-IL): allow Puerto Rico to retain its separate Olympic Committee and to compete under its own flag and national anthem in international athletic competitions; failed: 2–413Bill Summary & Status. 105th Congress (1997 - 1998). H.AMDT.512 * Gutierrez (D-IL): retain certain corporate tax provisions for Puerto Rico for 20 years after statehood and exempt Puerto Ricans from U.S. federal tax until the State of Puerto Rico achieves same per capita income as the State with next lowest per capita income. Failed by voice vote. Ultimately, Puerto Rico, while under the PNP leadership of Governor Rosselló, held a status referendum on December, 1998, using criteria from the Bill, despite the lack of a Bill's approval. The PPD opposed the referendum unless different wording was used for the Commonwealth option. The PNP pointed out that any such status change would require congressional approval, and at least the Bill's terminology had mustered House support. In response, the PPD urged Puerto Ricans to choose the None of the Above option, as a means to reject the offered status choices. The success of this option in the polls while expressing disapproval, does not express a preference among the Bill's options. ==See also== *Government of Puerto Rico * United States politics and the political status of Puerto Rico ==Notes== Category:Political history of Puerto Rico ","title":"United States-Puerto Rico Political Status Act"},{"id":"1281059","text":"Dosso is a city in the south-west corner of Niger.

He has been the Member of Parliament (MP) for Surrey Heath since 2005. A member of the Conservative Party, Gove served as Education Secretary from 2010 to 2014, Chief Whip from 2014 to 2015, Justice Secretary from 2015 to 2016 and Environment Secretary from 2017 to 2019. He has twice run to become Leader of the Conservative Party, in 2016 and 2019, finishing in third place on both occasions. Gove attended the independent Robert Gordon's College and Lady Margaret Hall, Oxford. Gove then began a career as an author and journalist for The Times before entering the House of Commons in 2005. He was appointed to the Shadow Cabinet by David Cameron in 2007 as Shadow Secretary of State for Children, Schools and Families and was appointed Education Secretary in the Cameron-Clegg coalition. During his tenure as Education Secretary, he terminated the previous Labour government's Building Schools for the Future programme; reformed A-Level and GCSE qualifications, abolishing modular units and coursework in most subjects, in favour of final examinations, and responded to the Trojan Horse scandal. The National Association of Head Teachers, the Association of Teachers and Lecturers, the National Union of Teachers and the NASUWT passed motions of no confidence in Gove's policies at their conferences in 2013. In a 2014 Cabinet reshuffle, Gove was moved to the post of Chief Whip. Following the 2015 general election and the formation of the majority Cameron government, Gove was promoted to the office of Justice Secretary and Lord Chancellor. In 2016, Gove played a major role in the UK's referendum on EU membership as the co-convenor of Vote Leave. Along with fellow Conservative MP Boris Johnson, Gove was seen as one of the most prominent figures of the Vote Leave campaign. In June 2016, Gove, who was campaign manager for Boris Johnson's leadership bid to become Prime Minister, withdrew his support on the morning that Johnson was due to declare, and announced his own candidacy in the leadership election, finishing third behind Theresa May and Andrea Leadsom. Following Theresa May’s appointment as Prime Minister he was sacked from the Cabinet; however, following the 2017 general election he was appointed to the Second May government as Environment Secretary. He launched a second Conservative Party leadership bid in 2019 although eventually came third behind Johnson and Jeremy Hunt. Upon the appointment of Johnson as Prime Minister, Gove was appointed Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, with responsibilities including preparations for a no-deal Brexit. He took on the additional role of Minister for the Cabinet Office in the cabinet reshuffle post-Brexit. ==Early life== Graeme Andrew Logan was born on 26 August 1967. His biological mother, whom he originally believed to have been an unmarried Edinburgh student, was in fact a 23-year-old cookery demonstrator. Gove regarded his birthplace as Edinburgh until it was revealed in a biography in 2019 that he was born in a maternity hospital in Fonthill Road, Aberdeen. Logan was put into care soon after he was born. At the age of four months he was adopted by a Labour-supporting couple in Aberdeen, Ernest and Christine Gove, by whom he was brought up.Johnston, Simon (16 May 2010).\\"Teenage Michael Gove supported Labour\\". The Sunday Telegraph. After he joined the Gove family, Logan's name was changed to Michael Andrew Gove. His adoptive father, Ernest, ran a fish processing business and his adoptive mother, Christine, was a lab assistant at the University of Aberdeen, before working at the Aberdeen School for the Deaf. Gove, his adoptive parents and his sister Angela lived in a small property in the Kittybrewster area of Aberdeen. He was educated at two state schools (Sunnybank Primary School and Kittybrewster Primary School), and later, on the recommendation of his primary school teacher, he sat and passed the entrance exam for the independent Robert Gordon's College. Later, as he entered sixth year he had to apply for a scholarship as his family fell on difficult economic circumstances. In October 2012, he wrote an apology letter to his former French teacher for misbehaving in class. From 1985 to 1988 he read English at Lady Margaret Hall, Oxford, graduating with an upper second. During his first year, he met future Prime Minister Boris Johnson and helped him become elected President of the Oxford Union. In an interview with Andrew Gimson, Gove remarked that at Oxford, Johnson was \\"quite the most brilliant extempore speaker of his generation.\\" Gove was elected as President of the Oxford Union a year after Johnson.Class list published in The Times, 29 July 1988; p. 33 == Journalism career == Gove became a trainee reporter at The Press and Journal in Aberdeen, where he spent several months on strike in the 1989–1990 dispute over union recognition and representation. He joined The Times in 1996 as a leader writer and assumed posts as its comment editor, news editor, Saturday editor and assistant editor. He has also written a weekly column on politics and current affairs for the newspaper and contributed to The Times Literary Supplement, Prospect magazine and The Spectator. He remains on good terms with Rupert Murdoch, whom Gove described in evidence before the Leveson Inquiry as \\"one of the most impressive and significant figures of the last 50 years\\". He wrote a sympathetic biography of Michael Portillo and a highly critical study of the Northern Ireland peace process (The Price of Peace), where he compared the Good Friday Agreement to appeasement of the Nazis in the 1930s. He has worked for the BBC's Today programme, On The Record, Scottish Television and the Channel 4 current affairs programme A Stab in the Dark, alongside David Baddiel and Tracey MacLeod, and was a regular panellist on BBC Radio 4's The Moral Maze and Newsnight Review on BBC Two. == Political career == Gove outside the Palace of Westminster, December 2008 He briefly joined the Labour Party in 1983 in Aberdeen, but has stated that by the time he left to go to Oxford University he was a Conservative. Gove joined the Oxford University Conservative Association and was secretary of Aberdeen South Young Conservatives. He helped to write speeches for Cabinet and Shadow Cabinet ministers, including Peter Lilley and Michael Howard. When applying for a job at the Conservative Research Department he was told he was \\"insufficiently political\\" and \\"insufficiently Conservative\\", so he turned to journalism. Gove had been chairman of Policy Exchange, a conservative think tank launched in 2002. He was involved in founding the right-leaning magazine Standpoint, to which he occasionally contributes. Gove expressed admiration in late-February 2003 for New Labour Prime Minister Tony Blair because of the way he was handling the crisis in Iraq: \\"As a right-wing polemicist, all I can say looking at Mr Blair now is, what's not to like?\\" Blair, he thought, was \\"behaving like a true Thatcherite\\". === Member of Parliament === Gove speaking at the Conservative Party \\"Big Society, Not Big Government\\" policy launch Gove first entered the House of Commons after the 2005 general election having been elected as the Conservative Member of Parliament for Surrey Heath, after the sitting Conservative MP Nick Hawkins was deselected by the local Conservative Association. When David Cameron was first elected as Leader of the Conservative Party in December 2005, he appointed Gove as Shadow Housing Spokesman. Gove is seen as part of an influential set of Conservatives, sometimes referred to as the Notting Hill Set, which includes Cameron, former Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne, Ed Vaizey, Nick Boles and Rachel Whetstone. On 2 July 2007, Gove was promoted to the Shadow Cabinet as Shadow Secretary of State for Children, Schools and Families (a newly created department set up by Gordon Brown), shadowing Ed Balls. In the role he advocated the introduction of a Swedish-style education voucher system, whereby parents would choose where their child would be educated, with the state paying what they would have cost in a state-school. He also advocated Swedish-style free schools, to be managed by parents and funded by the state, with the possibility that such schools would be allowed to be run on a for- profit model. Prior to the 2010 general election, most of Gove's questions in Commons debates concerned children, schools and families, education, local government, council tax, foreign affairs, and the environment. In June 2012, Michael Portillo backed Gove to be a serious contender in a future race for the Conservative Party leadership, though Gove had said in an interview a few months before that \\"I'm constitutionally incapable of it. There's a special extra quality you need that is indefinable, and I know I don't have it. There's an equanimity, an impermeability and a courage that you need. There are some things in life you know it's better not to try.\\" === Secretary of State for Education (2010–2014) === Gove as Secretary of State for Education, c. 2012 With the formation of the Conservative-Liberal Democrat coalition government following the hung parliament after the 2010 general election, Gove became Secretary of State for Education. His first moves included reorganising his department, announcing plans to allow schools rated as Outstanding by Ofsted to become academies, and cutting the previous government's school- building programme. He apologised, however, when the list of terminated school-building projects he had released was found to be inaccurate; the list was reannounced several times before it was finally accurately published. In July 2010, Gove said that Labour had failed in their attempt to break the link between social class and school achievement despite spending billions of pounds: quoting research, he indicated that by the age of six years, children of low ability from affluent homes were still out-performing brighter children from poorer backgrounds. At a House of Commons Education Select Committee he said that this separation of achievement grew larger throughout pupils' school careers, stating, \\"In effect, rich thick kids do better than poor clever children when they arrive at school [and] the situation as they go through gets worse\\". In March 2011, Gove was criticised for not understanding the importance of school architecture and accused of having misrepresented the cost. In February 2011, he told parliament that one individual made £1,000,000 in one year when the true figure was £700,000 for five advisers at different times over a four-year period. During the 2010 Conservative Party Conference, Gove announced that the primary and secondary-school national curricula for England would be restructured, and that study of authors such as Byron, Keats, Jane Austen, Dickens and Thomas Hardy would be reinstated in English lessons as part of a plan to improve children's grasp of English literature and language. Academies were not required to follow the national curriculum, and so weren't affected by the reforms. Children who failed to write coherently and grammatically, or who were weak in spelling, were penalised in the new examinations. Standards in mathematics and science were also strengthened. Gove was criticised by teachers unions for his attempts to overhaul English education. At the Association of Teachers and Lecturers (ATL) Annual Conference in March 2013 a motion of no-confidence in Gove was passed. The next month the National Union of Teachers (NUT) passed a vote of no confidence in Gove at their annual conference and called for his resignation. The National Association of Head Teachers and NASUWT also passed motions of no confidence at their conferences that year. === Chief Whip of the House of Commons (2014–2015) === On 15 July 2014, Gove's four-year stint in charge of the Department for Education came to an end when he was replaced as Secretary of State for Education by former Treasury Minister Nicky Morgan in a wide- ranging cabinet reshuffle. Gove was moved to the post of Government Chief Whip, which was portrayed as a demotion by his detractors; Prime Minister David Cameron denied this was the case. Gove told BBC News that he had mixed emotions about starting the new role, saying it was a privilege to become Chief Whip but that leaving the Department for Education was \\"a wrench\\".\\"Michael Gove: 'It's a wrench but a privilege changing job'\\", BBC News, 15 July 2014; retrieved 16 July 2014. The position came with a £30,000 pay cut, and a specific media role saw Gove on television and radio \\"more than a traditional Chief Whip would be\\". He missed his first House of Commons vote in the new role, as explained by Shadow Commons Leader Angela Eagle; \\"Gove not only lost his first vote but managed to get stuck in the toilet in the wrong lobby\\". Gove remained in the post of Chief Whip until May 2015, when the role was taken over by Mark Harper. === Secretary of State for Justice (2015–2016) === After the 2015 general election, Prime Minister David Cameron promoted Gove as Lord Chancellor and Justice Secretary in his newly formed Cabinet. He was praised in December 2015 for scrapping the courts fee introduced by his predecessor, Chris Grayling. The fee had been heavily criticised for, among other things, causing innocent people to plead guilty out of financial concerns. Gove removed the 12-book limit on prison books introduced by Grayling, arguing that books increased literacy and numeracy, skills needed for making prisoners a \\"potential asset to society\\". The move, effective from September 2015, was welcomed by Frances Cook of the Howard League for Penal Reform. Gove was also praised for his prominent role in scrapping a British bid for a Saudi prison contract. Within three months of his taking office, the Criminal Bar Association (CBA) voted to stop taking new work in protest at Gove's insistence that they work for lower fees. The CBA subsequently praised his \\"courage\\" in reversing the proposed cuts. On 14 July 2016 Gove was removed from the position of Justice Secretary by the new Prime Minister, Theresa May. === European Union membership referendum (2016) === Gove was a prominent figure in the campaign for Britain to leave the EU in the 2016 referendum and described his decision to take that side as \\"the most difficult decision of my political life\\". He and his family spent Christmas with the Camerons at Chequers where, according to Craig Oliver, Cameron was under the impression that Gove would support remaining in the EU. He argued Britain would be \\"freer, fairer and better off\\" for leaving. When in an interview it was claimed that there was no expert opinion to support this, Gove remarked that \\"the people of this country have had enough of experts from organisations with acronyms saying they know what is best and getting it consistently wrong.\\" However, interviewer Faisal Islam interrupted Gove after the word \\"experts\\", causing some sources to report that he had made a general statement that \\"the people... have had enough of experts\\". In December 2016 Gove repeated the controversial Vote Leave claim that an additional £350 million a week could be spent on the NHS when Britain left the EU but said it was up to the Government to decide how to spend it. In his memoir For the Record, David Cameron described Gove during this period as \\"mendacious\\", adding: \\"One quality shone through, disloyalty. Disloyalty to me and, later, disloyalty to Boris [Johnson]\\". In the aftermath of the referendum, Gove was accused by Nick Clegg of being the source of a claim by The Sun that Queen Elizabeth II made comments supportive of Brexit in a private lunch at Windsor Castle. Clegg told a BBC documentary that Gove \\"obviously communicated it – well, I know he did\\". Gove declined to deny leaking the Queen's comments. ===Conservative Party leadership candidate (2016)=== After David Cameron announced his intention to resign as Prime Minister, with his successor now likely to be in office by September 2016, Gove was not a candidate, having said in the past that he had no interest in becoming Prime Minister. Instead, he was seen as a strong, highly influential supporter of Boris Johnson for that role. In a move that surprised most political analysts, Gove withdrew his support for Johnson on 30 June 2016, hours before the deadline, without any previous notice to Johnson and announced his own candidacy in the leadership election. Subsequently, Johnson declined to run. The Daily Telegraph opined that Gove's actions in undermining Johnson's leadership aspirations constituted \\"the most spectacular political assassination in a generation\\" while The Guardian labelled it as a \\"Machiavellian move\\". Gove said: \\"I wanted to help build a team behind Boris Johnson so that a politician who argued for leaving the European Union could lead us to a better future. But I have come, reluctantly, to the conclusion that Boris cannot provide the leadership or build the team for the task ahead. I have, therefore, decided to put my name forward for the leadership. I want there to be an open and positive debate about the path the country will now take. Whatever the verdict of that debate I will respect it. In the next few days I will lay out my plan for the United Kingdom which I hope can provide unity and change.\\" By 5 July 2016, Gove was in third place in the leadership election, behind Theresa May and Andrea Leadsom; the latter had gained an endorsement from Boris Johnson. Some political analysts predicted that Gove might quit the race if he was unable to beat Leadsom in the first round of voting. Later that day, it was announced that Theresa May had won the first round of voting, with support from 165 MPs, while Andrea Leadsom received 66 votes and Gove trailed with 48.{{cite news title=Conservative leadership election: poopooed to the Cabinet following the 2017 general election as Environment Secretary. Gove was eliminated in the second ballot after receiving 46 votes, compared to 199 for May and 84 for Leadsom. He subsequently told the media that he was \\"naturally disappointed\\" and described his two opponents as \\"formidable politicians\\", welcoming the fact that the next PM would be female. He also encouraged a \\"civilised, inclusive, positive and optimistic debate\\". === Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (2017–2019) === In May 2016, Gove voted not to reduce the permitted carbon dioxide emission rate of new homes. After the 2017 general election, Gove was promoted to Environment Secretary by Prime Minister Theresa May during a reshuffle. Gove said he \\"was quite surprised\\" to be asked to join the cabinet after May sacked him in 2016 after she became Prime Minister. After his appointment, Gove announced that a microbead ban would be put into place by the end of 2017. The ban arrived in early 2018. It meant that manufacturers could no longer produce the tiny beads used in cosmetics and care products. Another ban came in June 2018 which stopped shops from selling products that contained the beads. The reasoning behind the ban was to stop the beads harming marine life. In 2017 after being appointed to Environment Secretary, Gove announced that a fuel combustion vehicle ban will be put into place due to air pollution. He said that the ban would take effect by 2040 and end the sales of new fuel combustion cars, trucks, vans, and buses that have petrol and diesel engines in the UK. The ban does not include plug-in hybrid vehicles. Gove introduced a ban on bee-harming pesticides like neonicotinoids. Gove was praised by Greenpeace UK executive director John Sauven for his strong stance on issues like bee-harming pesticides, single-use plastic bottles and the future of the internal combustion engine\\", adding \\"Gove has defied many people's expectations on the environment\\". Gove faced criticism over the appointment of Ben Goldsmith to the role of non-executive director at the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs as Goldsmith had previously donated cash to Gove's Surrey Heath constituency. Concerns were also raised about the selection process for the job, which was overseen by Sir Ian Cheshire, the chairman of Goldsmith's investment firm, Menhaden Capital Management. An important aspect of Gove's tenure was the introduction of laws concerning animal welfare. Maximum sentences for the crime of animal cruelty increased, as did protection for animals used by government services, such as police dogs and horses. One of the \\"toughest worldwide bans\\" on ivory trade was also introduced in 2018. In January 2019, Theresa May survived a vote of no confidence in her government, after a \\"barnstorming\\" speech from Gove directed towards the Leader of the Labour Party, Jeremy Corbyn. The speech, which gained significant media attention, attacked Corbyn for his foreign policy record, with Tom Rogan of the Washington Examiner describing it as \\"A tour de force. It was angry but not fanatical, passionate but not somber, and intellectual but simply put\\". In March 2019, Gove argued that \\"we didn't vote to leave without a deal. That wasn't the message of the campaign I helped lead. During that campaign, we said we should do a deal with the EU and be part of the network of free trade deals that covers all Europe, from Iceland to Turkey\\". In April 2019, Gove refused to declare a climate emergency in the United Kingdom after having a meeting with Extinction Rebellion. Despite Gove's refusal, Parliament passed a motion to declare a climate emergency. ===Conservative Party leadership candidate (2019)=== On 26 May 2019, Gove announced he would stand for the Conservative leadership following Theresa May's resignation, becoming the eighth candidate to enter the contest. He promised to remove the charge for UK citizenship applications from EU nationals if elected, and to replace VAT with a \\"simpler sales tax\\".Tory leadership contest: Michael Gove 'would scrap VAT', BBC News, 9 June 2019. Retrieved 10 June 2019. He also planned to scrap the High Speed 2 rail project and increase school funding by £1 billion. By 5 June, Boris Johnson became the clear frontrunner with the bookmakers, with Gove second favourite, followed closely by Jeremy Hunt. Gove progressed following the first ballot, having received 37 votes and seen off the two women in the contest. He received 41 votes in the second ballot, and by the third ballot had 51 MPs backing him. The fourth ballot saw him gain 61 votes, moving him into second position. In the last ballot, he had 75 votes and was voted out – losing by only two to eventual runner-up Jeremy Hunt. === Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster (2019–present) === White House National Security Advisor John Bolton in August 2019 Upon the election of Boris Johnson as Prime Minister, Gove was appointed Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, legally representing the Crown as Duke of Lancaster. His otherwise non-portfolio role includes responsibility for no-deal Brexit preparations, as well as overseeing constitutional affairs, maintaining the integrity of the Union and having oversight over all Cabinet Office policy. Gove was excluded from a place on the National Security Council committee as Johnson pursued a slimming down of Cabinet operations. He became a central figure in the conduction of Operation Yellowhammer, the civil contingency planning for the possibility of a no-deal Brexit. Writing in The Sunday Times on 28 July 2019, Gove said that a no-deal Brexit is \\"now a very real prospect\\" and one that the government is \\"working on the assumption of\\". He said in August that it was \\"wrong and sad\\" that the EU was \\"refusing to negotiate\\" over a new withdrawal agreement. That month, an official cabinet Yellowhammer document leaked, predicting that a no-deal Brexit would lead to food, medicine and petrol shortages. Gove said the leaked dossier outlined a \\"worst-case scenario\\". Interviewed in September 2019, Gove declined to say whether the government would abide by legislation designed to stop a no-deal Brexit. A portrait of Gove was installed by the anti-Brexit campaign group Led by Donkeys on a beach in Redcar, North Yorkshire. The drawing featured a quote from Gove in which he said the UK \\"didn't vote to leave without a deal\\" in the 2016 referendum. During the 2019 Speaker of the House of Commons election, Gove nominated the Labour MP Chris Bryant to replace John Bercow. Gove helped to prepare Johnson for the 2019 general election debates by playing the role of the Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn. He offered to stand in for Johnson during a Channel 4 debate on environmental issues but the editor of Channel 4 News said the debate was only open to party leaders. In February 2020, Gove took on additional responsibilities as the Minister for the Cabinet Office, succeeding Oliver Dowden, who had been appointed Secretary of State for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport, in Johnson's first large reshuffle of his government. During the coronavirus pandemic in the United Kingdom, Gove generated confusion after saying on ITV's Good Morning Britain that children with separated parents were not allowed to move between their parents' homes. He later apologised and clarified that what he said was not the case. When Boris Johnson was self- isolating after having been tested positive for COVID-19, Gove stood in for Johnson briefly from 27 March 2020 at the daily briefings of the pandemic, until Gove self-isolated himself after a family member developed Coronavirus symptoms. After Johnson said that the UK had ended trade talks with the EU in October 2020, Gove said that the door was \\"still ajar\\" if the EU made changes over issues including fishing access and that \\"We hope the EU will change their position and we are certainly not saying if they do change their position we can't talk to them\\". ==Controversies== ===Expenses claims=== Over a five-month period between December 2005 and April 2006, Gove claimed more than £7,000 on a house bought with his wife Sarah Vine, in 2002. Around a third of the money was spent at OKA, an upmarket interior design company established by Viscountess Astor, PM David Cameron's mother-in-law. Shortly afterwards he reportedly 'flipped' his designated second home, a property for which he claimed around £13,000 to cover stamp duty. Gove also claimed for a cot mattress, despite children's items being banned under updated Commons rules. Gove said he would repay the claim for the cot mattress, but maintained that his other claims were \\"below the acceptable threshold costs for furniture\\" and that moving house was necessary \\"to effectively discharge my parliamentary duties\\". While he was moving between homes, on one occasion he stayed at the Pennyhill Park Hotel and Spa in Bagshot, Surrey following a constituency engagement, charging the taxpayer more than £500 per night's stay. Gove's second home was not in his constituency, but in Elstead, in the South West Surrey constituency. Gove sold the house and began to commute to his constituency. === Freedom of Information and email === During the Cameron–Clegg ministry, Gove was the subject of repeated criticism for alleged attempts to avoid the provisions of the Freedom of Information Act. The criticism surrounds Gove's use of various private email accounts to send emails that allegedly relate to his departmental responsibilities. The allegations suggest that Gove and his advisers believed they could avoid their correspondence being subject to Freedom of Information requests, as they believed that their private email accounts were not subject to the Freedom of Information Act. In September 2011, the Financial Times reported that Gove had used an undisclosed private email account – called ‘Mrs Blurt’ – to discuss government business with advisers. In March 2012 the Information Commissioner ruled that because emails the Financial Times had requested contained public information they could be the subject of a Freedom of Information request and ordered the information requested by the paper to be disclosed. Gove was also advised to cease the practice of using private email accounts to conduct government business. He disputed the Information Commissioner's ruling and proceeded to tribunal, costing taxpayers £12,540 in fees for legal advice, but the appeal was withdrawn. It was also alleged by the Financial Times that Gove and his advisors had destroyed email correspondence in order to avoid Freedom of Information requests. The allegation was denied by Gove's department who stated that deleting email was simply part of good computer housekeeping. === First World War centenary === In a controversial article about the First World War centenary in January 2014, Gove criticised academic and television interpretations of World War I as \\"left-wing versions of the past designed to belittle Britain and its leaders.\\" Some of Gove's key points were rebuffed by the academics that Gove had used to support his thesis. Gove had criticised Cambridge professor Sir Richard Evans saying his views were more like that of an undergraduate cynic in a Footlights review. Instead he urged people to listen to Margaret MacMillan of Oxford University. MacMillan responded, saying: \\"I agree with some of what Mr Gove says, but he is mistaking myths for rival interpretations of history. I did not say, as Mr Gove suggests, that British soldiers in the First World War were consciously fighting for a western liberal order. They were just defending their homeland and fighting what they saw as German militarism.\\" Evans said Gove's attack was \\"ignorant\\" and asked how anyone could possibly say Britons were fighting for freedom given their country's main ally was Tsarist Russia. Jeremy Paxman said Gove had \\"wilfully misquoted\\" Evans on the subject of the First World War. ===Trump interview=== In his capacity as a writer for The Times, Gove gave the first British post-election interview to Donald Trump in January 2017, along with Kai Diekmann from Bild, making him the second British politician to meet Trump as President-elect of the United States after Nigel Farage. Despite preferring Hillary Clinton to Trump as President of the United States, Gove's interview and consequent defence of it has been seen by some as praising the President- elect unduly, and a photograph of Gove giving a \\"thumbs-up\\" to Trump was widely mocked on social media. ===Harvey Weinstein joke=== In October 2017, Gove issued an apology for a joke which compared going on the Today programme to a sexual encounter with Harvey Weinstein. He was criticised by MPs of all parties who felt allegations of sexual abuse were not a suitable subject for jokes. === Cocaine === In June 2019, reports emerged that Gove had taken cocaine as a journalist in his twenties. Gove stated that he regretted having done so, and regarded it as having been a mistake. In an article for The Times in December 1999, Gove argued against the legalisation of drugs, criticising members of the middle classes for their hypocrisy in doing so. This was a key component of his 2019 bid to be Leader of the Conservative Party. In reaction, Craig Oliver said it would have a negative impact on his run whereas fellow candidate for leadership Dominic Raab said that he \\"admires [Gove's] honesty\\". === Bookcase photograph === In May 2020, Gove was criticised after his wife Sarah Vine shared a bookcase picture \\"as a very special treat for my trolls\\" which featured a book by the Holocaust denier David Irving, and a copy of The Bell Curve, which controversially claims that intelligence is highly heritable and that median IQ varies among races. Another book in the photograph was The Strange Death of Europe by Douglas Murray, which, according to The Guardian, cites Enoch Powell and argues for protecting white Christian Europe from \\"outsiders\\". Beyond Human Rights: Defending Freedom by Alain de Benoist, leader of ethno-nationalist think tank GRECE, and Why We Fight: Manifesto of the European Resistance and Archeofuturism - European Visions of the Post- Catastrophic Age by Guillaume Faye were also featured, both published by European New Right Arktos Media, known for translating far-right material into English. One other book was Leo Strauss and the American Conservative Movement by paleoconservative Paul Gottfried, who coined the term 'Alternative Right' (often shortened to 'Alt-Right') whilst working alongside Richard B. Spencer. === Dominic Cummings === In May 2020 Gove was criticised after defending Dominic Cummings for making a 260-mile trip to Durham with his wife who was ill with COVID-19 at the time. == Political stances == Gove is generally considered as combining socially liberal views — for example, on gay marriage — with a harder Eurosceptic and neoconservative position on foreign affairs. He has expressed his view that the state should generally not interfere in domestic affairs and attests to have campaigned for economic freedom in certain matters. Gove has argued that \\"the only sustainable ethical foundation for society is a belief in the innate worth and dignity of every individual.\\" Giving evidence before the Leveson Inquiry in May 2012, Gove said he was \\"unashamedly on the side of those who say that we should think very carefully before legislation and regulation because the cry 'Something must be done' often leads to people doing something which isn't always wise.\\" During the 2008 Conservative Party Conference, Gove argued that Edmund Burke, an 18th- century philosopher who commented on organic society and the French Revolution, was the greatest conservative ever. When asked about those who believe \\"Marx was right all along\\", he responded that they were guilty of ignoring the systematic abuses and poverty of centrally planned economies, and criticised the historian Eric Hobsbawm, saying that \\"only when Hobsbawm weeps hot tears for a life spent serving an ideology of wickedness will he ever be worth listening to.\\" In remarks prepared for the 2020 Ditchley Lecture, Gove portrayed what he saw as the malaise of modern society as leading to populism, because the non-intellectual classes \\"chose to opt for polarised identity politics rather than stay with broad-based national political movements\\" instead of choosing to follow the politics of diversity, inclusion and identity politics they were force-fed by the elites. He praised Franklin D. Roosevelt as a model for his renewal of capitalism and he imagined the construction of inclusive societies with the deconstruction of Whitehall. Gove stressed \\"basic writing, meeting chairing and time management skills\\" for all policy civil servants. He ended with a paean to his purpose in public service: \\"to tackle inequality\\". === Capital punishment === In 1997, Gove wrote in support of the restoration of hanging as capital punishment, which was abolished in the UK in 1965. Gove argued in The Times that \\"Were I ever alone in the dock I would not want to be arraigned before our flawed tribunals, knowing my freedom could be forfeited as a result of political pressures. I would prefer a fair trial, under the shadow of the noose.\\" === Foreign policy === The Financial Times describes Gove as having \\"strong neoconservative convictions\\". In 2003, he stated that he did not believe the United States' \\"current position in the world [was] analogous to that of an Imperial power, as we have come to understand imperial powers\\". William Dalrymple, reviewing Gove's book Celsius 7/7 in The Times, dismissed Gove's knowledge of the Middle East as being derivative and based on the views of Bernard Lewis. ====Iraq==== Gove proposed that the 2003 invasion of Iraq would bring peace and democracy both to Iraq and the wider Middle East. In December 2008, he wrote that declarations of either victory or defeat in Iraq in 2003 were premature, and that the liberation of Iraq was a foreign policy success. Tariq Ali once recalled how, at the time of the Iraq War, he \\"debat[ed] the ghastly Gove on television [... and found him] worse than most Bush apologists in the United States.\\" ====Intervention in Syria==== Gove had to be calmed by parliamentary colleagues in August 2013 after shouting, \\"A disgrace, you're a disgrace!\\" at various Conservative and Liberal Democrat rebels who contributed to defeating the coalition government's motion to attack Syria in retaliation for the 2013 Ghouta attacks. He later stated he was reacting to the manner in which Labour MPs celebrated the outcome of the vote. ====Saudi Arabian prisons==== In 2015, Gove cancelled a £5.9 million contract to provide services for prisons in Saudi Arabia, according to The Guardian, because it was thought \\"the British government should not be assisting a regime that uses beheadings, stoning, crucifixions and lashings as forms of punishment.\\" Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond was reported to have accused Gove of being naive. === Health === Gove is one of several Conservative MPs who co-authored Direct Democracy: An Agenda for a New Model Party (2005). The book says the NHS \\"fails to meet public expectations\\" and calls for it to be dismantled and replaced with personal health accounts. Gove fractured his foot in July 2015. His wife Sarah Vine (somewhat inaccurately) complained in her Daily Mail column that he could not have his foot X-rayed by the NHS because the minor injuries unit the couple visited did not provide the facility at weekends. === Scottish independence === Gove believes that Scotland should remain part of the United Kingdom, arguing that Scotland's strengths complement those of other parts of the UK. He has expressed interest in the idea of, in a second Scottish independence referendum, letting Scottish people living in the other countries of the UK vote. ===Israel and Jewish people=== Gove has described himself as \\"a proud Zionist\\", and supports the United Jewish Israel Appeal's fundraising activities. In 2019, he reiterated \\"One thing I have always been since I was a boy is a Zionist\\" and spoke of his desire to \\"celebrate everything that Israel and the Jewish people have brought to the life of this world and hold it dear to our hearts\\" and that \\"For as long as I have breath in my body and a platform on which to argue I shall be on your side, by your side and delighted and honoured to argue, powerfully I hope, on behalf of people who have contributed so powerfully to the life of this nation\\". Gove is, like the great majority of UK Conservative Party MPs, a member of Conservative Friends of Israel. He has said that the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions movement against Israel is anti-Semitic. Gove said that jihadist terrorists \\"hate Israel, and they wish to wipe out the Jewish people's home, not because of what Israel does but because of what Israel is – free, democratic, liberal and western.\\" === Religion === In 2012, Gove was behind plans to provide schools throughout England and Wales with a copy of the King James Bible (inscribed \\"presented by the Secretary of State for Education\\") to celebrate the 400th anniversary of its translation into English, though he said he backed the scheme because of the historical and cultural significance of that translation rather than on purely religious grounds. In 2013, while noting the singing of the \\"deliberately anti-Catholic rant\\" (the Famine Song at Rangers-Celtic matches) Gove credited Cardinal Keith O'Brien with using his intellect to protect the vulnerable in Scotland whilst regretting the absence of a similar figure in the Kirk. In April 2015, he described his faith in an article for The Spectator magazine. In widely reported remarks, he complained that \\"to call yourself a Christian in contemporary Britain is to invite pity, condescension or cool dismissal.\\" In 2016, he credited his Christian faith for his focus as Justice Minister on redemption and rehabilitation. === Other views === Gove's proposal for a new Royal Yacht costing £60 million was made public in January 2012. Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg criticised the idea, calling it \\"a case of the haves and the have yachts\\". While deeply critical of Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union, Gove believes that \\"there have also been more benign empires, and in that I would include, almost pre-eminently, the British.\\" In March 2014, he described the concentration of Old Etonians at the top of the Conservative coalition as \\"ridiculous. I don't know where you can find a similar situation in any other developed economy.\\" ==In popular culture== Gove was a member of the winning team in Grampian Television's quiz show Top Club, and played the school chaplain in the 1995 family comedy A Feast at Midnight. Gove was portrayed by actor Oliver Maltman in the 2019 HBO and Channel 4 produced drama entitled Brexit: The Uncivil War. == Personal life == Gove married the journalist Sarah Vine in 2001, who formerly wrote for The Times and in 2013 became a Daily Mail columnist. They have two children and reside in Earl's Court. Gove contracted H1N1 swine flu during the 2009 influenza pandemic. Gove is a supporter of Queens Park Rangers Football Club. == Honours == * 2010: Appointed to the Privy Council of the United Kingdom, giving him the honorific title \\"The Right Honourable\\" for life. === Awards === In 2019, LBC's Iain Dale and a \\"panel of experts\\" placed Gove third in a list of that year's 'Top 100 Most Influential Conservatives'. == Bibliography == *Michael Portillo: The Future of the Right (London: Fourth Estate, 1995) *The Price of Peace: an analysis of British policy in Northern Ireland (London: Centre for Policy Studies, 2000) *Celsius 7/7 (London: Weidenfeld & Nicolson, 2006) *A Blue Tomorrow: New Visions for Modern Conservatives (London: Politico's, 2001; ed. with Edward Vaizey and Nicholas Boles) == Further reading == * * Bennett, Owen (2019).

She specializes in the study of Andean indigenous cultures. == Family and education == === Early life === Eliane Chantal Karp-Toledo was born on September 24, 1953 in Paris to Charles Karp (Polish) and Eva Rose Fernenburg (Belgian).Don’t cry for me, Peru – Israel News, Ynetnews. Ynetnews.com (1995-06-20). Retrieved on 2013-02-15. Her father, Charles Karp (a Jewish descendant) was persecuted by Gestapo and then he became part of the French resistance. She completed her baccalaureate at the Lycée Français in Brussels. === Education === Karp earned her Bachelor of Arts in anthropology at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, specializing in Latin American studies. She also holds a Master of Arts in anthropology from Stanford University. Karp also completed doctoral studies in anthropology at Stanford. Karp has taken courses on indigenous communities at the National Autonomous University of Mexico, and has done graduate work on anthropology and economic development at the Pontifical Catholic University of Peru. === Family life === At Stanford, she met Alejandro Toledo, whom she married in 1972. Karp first came to Peru in the late 1970s to study its indigenous communities. In 1992 Karp and Toledo divorced and she returned to Israel with their daughter. The couple remarried and returned to Peru before her husband's 1995 campaign. == Career == In 1980, she began working for international organizations such as OAS, UNICEF and UNDP where she conducted impact measurement studies for development projects on indigenous populations. In 1982 she served at the Agency for International Development (USAID) based in Lima, where she was a consultant until 1987. Since November 1987 she started working at the World Bank in Washington D.C. as a project officer for Latin America and Africa until 1992. Karp also served as an officer for Middle East in European Investment Bank. Karp returned to Israel, and worked at Bank Leumi, where she was in charge of developing relationships with foreign banks. === Academic career === Karp recently served as an adjunct professor at the Elliott School of International Affairs at the George Washington University. She is also a former Visiting Professor and Visiting Scholar at Stanford University department of Anthropology. Karp was a distinguished fellow in residence at Center for Advanced Study in the Behavioral Sciences at Stanford University and has also been a visiting professor at Salamanca University - Instituto de Iberoamérica. ==Political contributions== During her husband's 2001 presidential bid, Karp contributed to a campaign which drew deeply on Toledo's indigenous heritage. She donned traditional Andean costume, rallied voters in Quechua, and demonstrated the couple's commitment to indigenous issues. According to The New York Times, \\"her flaming red hair and fiery speeches made her a popular and controversial fixture at campaign rallies.\\" In 2001, Karp became the first lady of the Republic of Peru when Toledo was elected president, a position she held until 2006. While in office, Karp became the honorary president of the Fund for the Development of Indigenous Communities of Latin America and the Caribbean.Latin America and the Caribbean's Indigenous People and Afro-descendents: Sociodemographic Information, Retrieved May 25, 2012 === CONAPA === Shortly after Toledo's inauguration, his administration created the National Commission on Andean, Amazon and Afro-Peruvian Communities (CONAPA) of Peru, of which Karp served as president. The agency was meant to establish a development agenda for indigenous communities, provide representation of indigenous interests within the government, and lead the way to constitutional reforms that benefit indigenous peoples. Others lamented the commission's ineffectiveness. Noting its lack of funding and of implementing powers, Diana Vindling called it \\"no more than a space for dialogue.\\"The Indigenous World 2002–2003, Diana Vinding, Retrieved May 30, 2011 On the other hand, Oxfam's Martin Scurrah points out that the agency did good work. Noting that in addition to promoting a chapter on indigenous rights in the new constitution, Eliane Karp \\"intervened on numerous occasions in support of or in defense of indigenous initiatives.\\"Making Indigenous Citizens, Maria Elena Garcia, 2005, Retrieved May 30, 2011 Some critics viewed the very creation of the commission as a step backwards for indigenous Peruvians, noting its leadership by a person with no official government position rather than a ministry head. The commission also absorbed the former SETAI (office of indigenous affairs), which reportedly led to a loss of autonomy and dynamism for that agency. Others complained that Karp's leadership of the commission represented a conflict of interest, given her involvement in her own private NGO, Fundación Pacha. In 2003, partly in response to these criticisms, Karp resigned from CONAPA, which was subsequently restructured as a national institute rather than a commission.Beyond Neoliberalism in Latin America? John Burdich et al, Retrieved June 1, 2011 === Machu Picchu Artifacts === Throughout Toledo's presidency, Karp participated in negotiations with Yale University for the return to Peru of over 350 indigenous artifacts. The museum pieces were excavated from Machu Picchu around 1915 and sent to Yale on a twelve-month loan. On this matter, Peru had the support of the National Geographic Society and Senator Christopher Dodd of Connecticut. Negotiations stalled when the university refused to acknowledge Peru as the sole owner of the artifacts, but resumed under the García presidency. In a New York Times op-ed, Karp accused Yale of waiting out \\"Peru’s first elected indigenous president, until Peru had a new leader who is frankly hostile to indigenous matters.\\" She also criticized the agreement between Peru and Yale that was finally arrived at in 2008. Under the terms of this agreement, Peru would have to build a museum and research center near Machu Picchu to Yale's specifications before it could receive a portion of the articles for display and study. Most of the artifacts would remain with Yale. === Pacha Foundation for a Change === In 2001, Karp started Fundación Pacha, a non-profit organization that oversees development projects for indigenous Peruvians. The foundation \\"places special emphasis on the design of sustainable development projects based on traditional and communal organizations and the development of productive skills to promote the comparative economic advantages of the Peruvian biodiversity and its rich potential for ecotourism.\\" Karp remained the head of the organization until 2006. Pacha's micro projects have included giving Amazonian peoples vaccinations against yellow fever, hepatitis B and malaria, building basic community institutions, and providing equipment for basic medical care centers in rural areas with indigenous populations.:. Eliane Karp – Toledo . Elianekarptoledo.com. Retrieved on 2013-02-15. In 2002 Karp reached out to billionaire philanthropist Bill Gates in order to fund a vaccination program for the Candoshi tribes people. Gates was unwilling to help, and instead began humanitarian aid efforts in Africa and China. Since then Karp has criticized Gates for his unwillingness to help and acknowledges she felt it unfair to ignore Peru when conditions in rural Peru are just as dire as in other impoverished areas. ==Current activities== Karp has publicly opposed the Garcia administration for its failure to uphold Indepa, and its continued alienation of the indigenous people. She has also shown support in favor of a push for more women in the Peruvian congress, and she acknowledges quotas as a means of achieving this. In March 2012 Karp returned to Peru to pursue a teaching position at the Pontifical Catholic University of Peru, and in the fall she returned to teach anthropology in the Andean studies postgraduate program. She has also announced she will undertake a book which examines the role of indigenous populations as they integrate into the democratic political process. In May 2012 Karp participated in a human rights conference organized by the Program on Human Rights and the Center for Latin American Studies of Stanford University, in which she called for a debate about the rights of indigenous peoples in Peru. Karp expressed \\"We propose that social inclusion and equal citizenship are key factors for good governance... The indigenous worldview has to be respected and integrated in public policies.\\" In October 2012 Karp recounted her meeting with Aung San Suu Kyi, saying that it was inspiring and that she was impressed that Suu Kyi was able to stay so calm while being imprisoned for 15 years. Karp likened the situation to when she met the Dalai Lama, who is living in exile, and urged support for a petition going through the United Nations to help combat human rights violations. == Publications == ===Books=== *Karp de Toledo, Eliane.

It has a primary school, hotel (Uplawmoor Hotel), village hall (Mure Hall), sports ground for tennis and football (including a playpark) and a golf club (Caldwell Golf Club). Nearby is the extensive Caldwell Estate with the roofless 18th century Caldwell House, which was designed by Robert Adam. The separate Caldwell Tower, of probable 16th century origin, is visible from the village. Several farms surround the village, as agriculture has always been of importance locally. Historically the village was served by two railway lines - Lanarkshire and Ayrshire and Glasgow, Barrhead and Kilmarnock Joint Railway Uplawmoor has a rural setting, with farmland on one side and mainly beech woodland (Pollick Glen and Shillford Woods, with numerous paths) on the other.

Hushi was one of the founders and activists of Hashomer Hatzair movement in Poland. In July 1920, he immigrated to then British Mandate of Palestine (now Israel) with a group of 130 Jewish pioneers. There he took the Hebrew surname \\"Hushi\\" [\\"speedy\\"], a translation of his original name, Schneller. He built roads and drained swamps, and helped to found kibbutz Beit Alfa. He was one of the founding members of the Histadrut labor federation. In 1927, he settled in Haifa and joined the Ahdut HaAvoda party, which later merged with Mapai. He was secretary of the Haifa Workers Council from 1931 to 1951. Hushi was elected to Israel's first Knesset in 1949 as a member of Mapai. Before the 1951 elections, he left the government to become mayor of Haifa. As mayor, he helped to found the University of Haifa, the Haifa Theatre, the Tikotin Museum of Japanese Art, the Mane-Katz Museum and the Carmelit (Haifa's funicular railway). Abba Hushi was the father-in-law of Knesset member Amnon Linn. ==Biography== ===Childhood and Aliyah=== Abba Hushi at age 18 ====Family-background==== Abba Hushi was born in 1898 in Turka, Galicia, then part of Austria-Hungary (today in Ukraine). His mother, Liba, ran a small farm, where she grew fruits and vegetables. After divorcing her first husband, Liba moved to Turka and married Zisha, a haberdasher. To avoid the draft, Zisha changed his name to Alexander, took Liba's surname, \\"Schneller,\\" and hid in the attic of Liba's farmhouse. Abba and two of his sisters The Schnellers had seven children: Ettia, Abba, Hinda, Ya'akov, Rosa, Malka and Harry from Liba's first marriage. ====Education==== After attending a heder, Hushi studied at the local gymnasium. He spoke Yiddish, German, Hebrew, Ukrainian and Polish, and knew some Greek and Latin. He planned to study medicine and even wrote \\"Property of Medical Student Abba Schneller\\" on his notebooks, but his plans were disrupted by the outbreak of World War I in 1914. The Schneller family fled to Bohemia. ====Involvement in Hashomer Hatzair==== Hachshara soon after his Aliyah After the family's return to Turka in 1918, the city fell under Polish rule. Antisemitism was on the rise, so a group of members of Hashomer Hatzair organized into an independent Jewish protection force. They were successful in Turka and stopped pogroms and other attacks, although in other cities throughout Poland these attacks continued. On 4 and 5 August 1918, a Hashomer Hatzair conference was held in Turka. Hushi was one of the chairs of the conference, and there he called for immigration to the land of Israel. In the spring of 1920, at another Hashomer Hatzair conference in Lviv, Abba read publicly for the first time the words to his poem \\"In the Galil, at Tel Hai\\" inspired by the courage of Joseph Trumpeldor at Tel Hai. Indeed, the decisions made at the conference mirrored the spirit at Tel Hai: it was decided that the graduating group of Hashomer Hatzair would make Aliyah, and the workers of the movement would assist in the realization of this decision. ===Israeli Pioneer=== ====Road Worker==== Hushi in the period when he has working near Rosh Pina The work office of the Hapoel Hatzair movement took responsibility for finding employment for its members of who had recently arrived in Palestine. Hushi's group found work in paving roads, a project initiated by the first High Commissioner of Palestine, Herbert Samuel. Hushi worked on roads around Rosh Pinna, and in 1920 and 1921, Hushi was the head of the \\"Shomria Unit,\\" the group that paved the Haifa-J'da (a.k.a. Ramat Yishai) road. ====Haifa Port==== Abba Hushi and the other members of his group volunteered to unload coal at the Port of Haifa. The \\"Workers of Israel\\" fund received the contract to unload the coal, but the Haifa workers refused to unload the coal. Hushi and his co-workers volunteered for the difficult work, which left them covered in soot and often led to eye infections. ====Founding the Histadrut==== In December 1920, the \\"Shomria Unit\\" send two representatives, one of them Abba Hushi, to the \\"First General Conference of the Workers of Israel.\\" By the end of the conference, the delegates decided to establish a union for the Hebrew workers in the land of Israel; the Histadrut. ====Drying swamps and founding Beit Alfa==== In 1921, the members of the group transferred to Nahalal, where they paved the entrance road to the moshav and also worked in drying and draining the surrounding swamps. Abba Hushi petitioned on behalf of the entire group, for land in order to establish a settlement in the Jezreel Valley. In 1922, the request was approved and Hushi was among the founding members of kibbutz Beit Alfa. ====Delegate in the Diaspora==== After the establishment of the Kibbutz, Abba was sent by the Jewish National Fund to raise funds in Poland. The money would be used to buy land and establish settlements. Hushi was accompanied by Meir Ya'ari. In 1924, Ya'ari and Hushi arrived in Danzig, where they attended two conferences; the Hashomer Hatzair conference and the \\"Youth Covenant\\" movement conference (which David Ben-Gurion also attended). At the Hashomer Hatzair conference, Hushi was chosen for the board of the world Hashomer Hatzair movement. After the conferences, Hushi and Ya'ari continued their fund-raising efforts on behalf of the JNF. They also visited local branches of, and summer camps run by Hashomer Hatzair throughout Poland in order to encourage the youths to make aliyah. Throughout the entire trip, Hushi corresponded with his girl friend Hannah, who remained in Beit Alfa. As part of his travels, Abba arrived in Turka, where, in February 1925, he convinced his family to make aliyah. ====Moving to Haifa==== In 1925, Hushi took a year off from the kibbutz to help his family settle in Haifa, and become acclimated with Israeli life. Hushi initiated the creation of a working-class restaurant that his family would own and operate, thereby earning a living. While in Haifa he continued his public service: on 19 April 1925, Hushi hosted a meeting of representatives from Kibbutzim that had foreign youths. ====Additional delegation abroad==== Following his great success on his previous trip to Poland, the Zionist committee asked Hushi to go abroad again. This time, he requested to travel with his girlfriend Hanna. The members of the kibbutz argued against his and Hanna's departures. Hushi wrote to Hanna: ====Marriage to Hannah==== Hushi's relationship with Hannah grew closer while they were in Turka, although Hannah's father was not happy with the match. On Lag Ba'omer 1926, the Chief Rabbi of Haifa, Rabbi Kaniel, officiated at their wedding. On 29 March 1927, their daughter Ruth was born. Hannah remained in Beit Alfa while Hushi went to Haifa to help his family run the restaurant and continue his activities on behalf of the Histadrut. Hannah joined him in June. In September 1930, their son, Gadi, was born. Gadi died in an accident on 12 January 1932. Another son, Dan, was born the following year. ===Activity for the Histadrut in Haifa=== In 1925 Hushi moved to Haifa in order to assist his parents, but he continued being politically active. In 1926 he began to work for the Histadrut in Haifa, and would eventually become a central activist in the Ahdut HaAvoda and then Mapai parties. ====Treatment of the workers in the Port of Haifa==== In his first position in the Histadrut, Hushi substituted for Yaacov Razili, who failed to settle to confrontation between the longtime laborers in the port, and the new immigrants who were sent to work in the port by the Histadrut. After much hard work and tremendous effort, Hushi convinced the port workers to sign an agreement with the Histadrut. ====Secretary of the Haifa Workers Council==== In 1932, Hushi was chosen chairman of the Haifa Workers Council (a position that he held until 1951). He believed that it was upon the Council to create a connection with every worker in its jurisdiction (the city of Haifa). He also saw to it that in every workplace a \\"worker's committee\\" was established (in workplaces where only a few people worked \\"trustees\\" were appointed) that would maintain contact between the workers and the Histadrut. Hushi's actions caused a great increase in the number or workers who were associated with different labor organizations. Building controversy Abba & Hannah on their way to a protest. In 1934, Jewish contractors experimented with Arab workers, who were less expensive to employ than Jewish workers. The Histadrut responded with strikes and protests. The height of the controversy was in the Borovsky House construction site, where the contractor employed exclusively Arab workers, and didn't \\"reserve\\" any jobs for Jewish workers. As a reaction, Hushi sent workers to picket the site, who disturbed the building process. The contractor complained to the police, and the picketing workers were arrested. Nevertheless, Hushi continued to send workers to protest. The protests continued for 684 days, and a total of 2259 days of jail time were served by workers who had picketed. By the end of the conflict, the contractor gave in and was forced to employ Jewish workers who were members of the Workers Council. Assisting the unemployed Due to the great stress that existed in Israel in the 1930s, Hushi worried about the unemployed workers in his city. As the secretary of the council, Hushi persuaded the other members to establish a staff that would look after the unemployed workers, and provide them with temporary work. The staff would find places of employment and divide the work among the unemployed workers, meaning that full-time workers had to give up on some work time to allow the unemployed people to come in and work. This style of distributing work differed from that practiced in other workers councils throughout Palestine. Among other things, the organization forced young workers and workers having other alternatives to relinquish their jobs to older, more seasoned workers, who had lost their places of employment. \\"Hapoel\\" Organization Abba Hushi with members of \\"The Organizer's Division.\\" One of the first organizations that Hushi supported in Haifa was the Hapoel sports club. He was assisted by members of the organization \\"The Organizer's Division,\\" in order to protect the institution of, and obedience to, the Histadrut and the Workers Council. Bringing Thessaloniki port workers to Haifa With the founding of the port of Haifa, Baruch Uziel, who had made Aliyah from Thessaloniki, Greece, convinced the Workers Council to bring on Aliyah Thessalonikian port workers, in order to guarantee a majority of Jewish port workers. As a result of Uziel's request, Hushi traveled to Thessaloniki, where he successfully convinced the Jewish port workers to make Aliya with their families. Following his success in Thessaloniki, Hushi traveled to Poland and managed to convince Jewish porters there also to make Aliya. The Aliya of the Thessaloniki port workers caused there to be a majority of Jewish workers in the port. This allowed operation of the port and the un-interrupted export of Jewish goods during the 1936–1939 Arab revolt in Palestine. On May Day 1936, since there was a fear that the port workers would strike, Hushi ordered them to work, despite the fact that it was Workers' Day, and the port-workers strike was avoided. On 8 August 1936, the Arab workers ceased to come to the port to work, and the port was operated solely by Jewish workers for a number of months. Boycott of German ships, Haifa 1938 On 29 December 1938, while loading citrus fruits onto the German ship Bamburg in the Port of Haifa, the second officer of the ship said to the port worker in charge of loading the fruits that \\"the Jews have no place in the world, not even at the North Pole, [...] the only option was to send all of the Jews to 'the second world.'\\" The Jewish workers who heard the officer's words informed other workers, and word reached the administration of the Haifa Workers Council, who decided to stop loading the ship. The administration of the Council also instructed the Arab workers not to work, and the port stopped servicing German ships. Hushi informed Dov Hoz, the chairman of the State Committee of the Jewish Agency, of the decision. David Hacohen informed Hushi of his disapproval of the decision, since it had not been approved by the official organizations of the Yishuv, despite the fact that the Workers Council of the Histadrut had approved the new policy. On the following day, 30 September, the German consul in Haifa turned to influential Olim from Germany to have them convince Hushi to call off the new policy. The consul announced that the Second Officer would apologize and would be punished for his offensive remarks, but Hushi did not relent, and the Bamburg returned to Germany empty. In order not to hurt the interests of the Jewish Yishuv, Hushi contacted \\"Citrus Center\\" in Jaffa with a request to find other ships with which to send their produce to Europe. He wrote to them: \\"We do not want to cause you [financial] loss, and therefore we are giving you options and time to organize the matter. We are not able to overcome our emotions, and the emotions of our workers, to continue to load German ships.\\" ==References== ==Published works== *In the House of the Workers of Israel (1943) ==External links== * Category:1898 births Category:1969 deaths Category:People from Turka Raion Category:People from the Kingdom of Galicia and Lodomeria Category:Jews from Galicia (Eastern Europe) Category:Austro-Hungarian Jews Category:Ukrainian Jews Category:Polish Jews Category:Polish emigrants to Mandatory Palestine Category:Jews in Mandatory Palestine Category:Israeli Jews Category:Members of the 1st Knesset (1949–1951) Category:Mayors of Haifa Category:Ahdut HaAvoda politicians Category:Mapai politicians Category:Jewish socialists Category:Hashomer Hatzair members Category:Recipients of the Order of the Equatorial Star ","title":"Abba Hushi"},{"id":"1281127","text":"An artistic interpretation of Praxilla's appearance by John William Godward, painted in 1922.

Her poetry was still remembered many centuries after her death: in the second century AD, her name was remembered in the proverb \\"sillier than Praxilla's Adonis\\", and the author Tatian cites her in his oration Against the Greeks. Because three of the works attributed to Praxilla are drinking songs, and respectable women in classical Greece would normally have been excluded from the parties where such songs were performed, there has been some scholarly debate about Praxila's social position. Martin West suggests that there were two Praxillas, one writing the skolia; the other, the more \\"respectable\\" choral songs and hymns.West, M.L., Greek Lyric Poetry: A new translation. Oxford University Press 1993 p.xix Other scholars have argued that, based on the attribution of skolia to Praxilla, she must have been a hetaira (a type of prostitute), though there is no external evidence for this thesis.Snyder, Jane McIntosh The Woman and the Lyre: Women Writers in Classical Greece and Rome. Southern Illinois University Press, 1989 p.56 Ian Plant suggests the alternative hypothesis that she was a professional musician, composing songs for symposia because there was a market for such works. Alternatively, West suggests that the skolia were not written by Praxilla at all.West, M.L., Greek Lyric Poetry: A new translation. Oxford University Press 1993 p.xix Gregory Jones agrees, and argues that all of the surviving skolia attributed to particular poets are in fact derived from a non-elite oral literary tradition.Jones, Gregory S., \\"Voice of the People: Popular Symposia and the Non-Elite Origins of the Attic Skolia\\". Transactions of the American Philological Association, vol.144 issue 2, Autumn 2014. p.234. Marchinus Van der Valk, who also endorses this theory, allows for the possibility that some skolia were \\"derived from\\" Praxilla's poetry and published in antiquity attributed to her.Van der Valk, Marchinus, \\"On the Composition of the Attic Skolia\\", Hermes Vol.102, Issue 1, 1974. p.7 ==References== ==External links== *Project Continua: Biography of Praxilla Project Continua is a web-based multimedia resource dedicated to the creation and preservation of women’s intellectual history from the earliest surviving evidence into the 21st Century.

As determined by a border survey expedition in 1962, its summit lies just within Brazilian territory, at a horizontal distance of only from the Venezuelan border at Pico 31 de Março. As the peak's name suggests, it is shrouded in dense clouds most of the time.https://www.meteoblue.com/en/weather/forecast/modelclimate/pico-da- neblina_venezuela_3631575 It was first ascended in 1965 by members of a Brazilian Army expedition. ==Location== Officially, Pico da Neblina is located in the municipality of Santa Isabel do Rio Negro, state of Amazonas. However, the mountain is not directly accessible from the urban seat of the municipality, which is about away, and federal authority over the national park, the Yanomami reservation and the border security area supersedes municipal authority in all practical respects. The nearest city is actually São Gabriel da Cachoeira, about in a straight line, from where virtually all climbing expeditions depart. The mountain is contained in the Brazilian Pico da Neblina National Park; its northern slopes are also protected in Venezuela's Serranía de la Neblina National Park. The twin parks, together with the neighbouring Parima Tapirapecó National Park (Venezuela), form a protected area complex of about 80,000 km², possibly the largest national park system in tropical rainforests in the world. Pico da Neblina is also located within the territory of the Yanomami people's reservation. ==Common misconceptions== Pico da Neblina is often mentioned as being on the exact border between Brazil and Venezuela. This is true for its massif as a whole, but the main summit is wholly in Brazil, 687 metres from the actual border.http://www.summitpost.org/neblina-peak/663648 It is also sometimes mentioned as being the highest point in South America outside of the Andes, but this is not correct either: the title belongs to Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta in Colombia, which is almost twice the height of Pico da Neblina and completely detached from the Andes. However, Pico da Neblina is indeed the highest point east of the Andes range, and therefore of a large portion of the continent. Neighbouring Pico 31 de Março, which is on the precise international border, is also the highest point in Venezuela outside of the Andes. ==Elevation measurements== For 39 years, based on an uncontested measurement performed in 1965 by topographer José Ambrósio de Miranda Pombo, using a theodolite, the elevation of Pico da Neblina was thought to be , but a much more accurate measurement performed in 2004 with state-of-the-art GPS equipment by cartographer Marco Aurélio de Almeida Lima, a member of a Brazilian Army expedition, put it at . This was then officially recognised by the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics (IBGE), the federal government's official geographic survey and census agency, which jointly organised the expedition. In February 2016, IBGE slightly revised again the official altitude of Pico da Neblina to , a 1.52-metre difference. There was no new expedition or field measurement at the time; the new value is simply a mathematical recalculation of the altitude, based on the previously obtained GPS field data, taking into account a newly available, more precise mapping of the Brazilian territory regarding the geoid (the imaginary surface based on the Earth's gravitational field that is the reference for altitudes). This explains why Pico da Neblina and Pico 31 de Março, which are next to each other, had both exactly the same altitude correction. ==Geology and topography== The Neblina Massif is composed of a tilted block of sandstone overlying Precambrian metamorphic rocks. The peak is an impressive sharp rock pyramid or tooth, towering high (when the peak is visible) over the nearby lowlands on the Brazilian side, as the Imeri range quickly rises from only about 100 metres above sea level to about 2,000 metres at the base of the peak in just a few kilometres; from there the peak rises sharply. The Venezuelan side of the massif is hillier and the altitude gradient to the northern plains is less abrupt, although deep chasms and high walls still exist. Neighbouring Pico 31 de Março can be considered a secondary summit of Pico da Neblina; it has a smoother, rounder shape and is sometimes difficult to be clearly distinguished from Pico da Neblina on photographs, depending on angle and distance. Due to Pico da Neblina's equatorial latitude, while it can be cold on top, sub-freezing temperatures and frost appear to be rare (no permanent measurements are undertaken), and there is no snow. One non-authoritative source gives an average temperature of during the day and at night. ==Discovery== Pico da Neblina in 1998 seen from the distance, without the usual clouds. The round blue-shaded secondary peak just behind it is Pico 31 de Março. There is little documentation available today on the peak's discovery, and virtually none of it is authoritative, even though Brazilians only discovered the mountain fairly recently, in the mid-20th century. This late discovery can be understood if one remembers how extremely remote, inaccessible and uninhabited that part of the Amazon region is even today, and that it could hardly be expected that such a high mountain (by Brazilian standards) could be found standing next to the vast, low-lying Amazon Basin, even though it was known that there were mountains in that area. Moreover, as its own name states, Pico da Neblina is clouded and hidden from view most of the time. All this led to it only being discovered in the 1950s. The exact date and circumstances are obscure and not documented, but a popular story often heard in Brazil says that it was supposedly seen and reported by an airline pilot who overflew it at a luckily cloudless moment. However, the massif was known well before that on the Venezuelan side, where it was called Cerro Jimé. In 1954, eight years before the Pico da Neblina was successfully climbed, the area was visited from the north by an expedition led by botanist Bassett Maguire, who reached the northern summit plateau of the massif and observed the highest peak, then unnamed, estimating it to be between \\"8,000-9,000 feet\\". The whole massif was named Cerro de la Neblina, since Maguire and Reynolds considered at the time that the massif constituted a separate formation from the Imeri range to the southeast. Soon after the expedition, the highest peak, although unclimbed, was named Pico Phelps in honour of eminent ornithologist William H. Phelps, Jr. At that time, the peak was thought to lie entirely within Venezuelan territory. During the 1962 Brazilian expedition, it was determined that the highest summit lies entirely in Brazil. The Brazilian expedition renamed the summit peak to Pico da Neblina, causing some confusion with the name Cerro de la Neblina, which is used in Venezuela to refer to the whole massif. The subsidiary summit on the Venezuelan-Brazilian border was named Pico 31 de Março in Brazil, but it is now known as Pico Phelps in Venezuela. In the 1950s, it was not yet clear whether Pico da Neblina was in Brazilian or Venezuelan territory, and its precise elevation was not yet known. Therefore, it was still widely held for many years after the peak's discovery that Brazil's highest mountain was Pico da Bandeira (2,891 m or 9,486 ft), between the southeastern states of Minas Gerais and Espírito Santo, in a much more populated, developed and easily accessible region. Only in 1965 it was found and became widely known that Pico da Neblina was the country's highest mountain. Pico da Bandeira remains the highest Brazilian mountain outside of the Amazon region, and the third-highest overall, after Pico da Neblina and 31 de Março. ==Access== Due to its location in a national park in a border area that is also part of Yanomami territory, access to the area is restricted and depends on a special permit by the Chico Mendes Institute for Biodiversity Conservation (ICMBio), the Brazilian government organisation responsible for national parks. The permit can be obtained at ICMBio's office in São Gabriel da Cachoeira, but all climbers must take an accredited local guide. A four-day trek each way should be expected, three of which consisting of a jungle trek in the rainforest that can be as hard and challenging as the climb itself. Rescue is close to impossible in the area. Onchocerciasis or \\"river blindness,\\" a parasitic disease that can cause permanent blindness and is transmitted by a black fly, is endemic in the area, albeit with a low incidence; malaria and yellow fever transmission are also possible. Therefore, climbers are advised not only to take the utmost precaution in avoiding insect bites but also to discuss preventive and/or therapeutic strategies with qualified physicians who are familiar with tropical diseases. Robson Czaban, a Brazilian photographer who climbed Pico da Neblina in 1998, reports on his adventure account (in Portuguese) that there are always some gold panners on a small plateau just below the peak, at about , called Garimpo do Tucano, which serves as the base camp for the last and steepest part of the climb. While the panners' presence there is technically illegal, they are widely tolerated by Brazilian authorities, and Czaban speculates that this would be because in such a remote area, they are believed to watch the border and nature better than the park rangers and the army would have the means to do. Czaban reports them to be very friendly and helpful. ==See also== * Pico 31 de Março * Pico da Neblina National Park * Guiana Highlands ==References== * Maguire, Bassett and Reynolds, Charles D.

Before its organization and recognition as a town by means of a decree promulgated during the Spanish regime, this was a barangay of Gapan and was known as Barrio Delinquente. San Antonio was previously called as the barrio of Delinquente as old residents claimed that the name Delinquente originated by the sinking of a Casco (big boat / banca) fully loaded with palay in Pampanga River. It was partitioned from the town of Gapan in 1843 by the order of Governor-General Marcelino Oraa, along with the town of San Isidro. The movement of the separation of Barrio Delinquente from the town of Gapan, and its organization as an independent municipality was ignited in 1839. The petition of the residents of Barrio Delinquente was finally approved in November 1842 but the definite separation from the town of Gapan took place in 1843. It is bounded by the towns of Jaen to its eastern side, Zaragosa is to the north, Cabiao and San Isidro, and Concepcion in the Province of Tarlac is at its western border. From Manila the popular route going to San Antonio is via the North Luzon Expressway (NLEX), exiting at San Simon and head on to Jose Abad Santos Avenue turning right towards Arayat, Pampanga. Reaching the town of San Isidro, turn left to the road leading to San Antonio. The other route is to exit the NLEX at Santa Rita and traverse the Pan-Philippine Highway across the length of the Province of Bulacan up to Gapan City in Nueva Ecija and turning left on the Gapan-Olongapo Road. ==Barangays== San Antonio is politically divided into 16 barangays. * Buliran * Cama Juan * Julo * Lawang Kupang * Luyos * Maugat * Panabingan * Papaya * Poblacion * San Francisco * San Jose * San Mariano * Santa Barbara * Santa Cruz * Santo Cristo * Tikiw ==Climate== ==Demographics== ==Local government== Municipal elected official (2016–present): *Mayor **Arvin Salonga *Vice Mayor **Julie Maxwell *Councilors: **Renan P.

Kalinjar is located in Banda District of Uttar Pradesh state, near the temple- city and World Heritage Site of Khajuraho. The fortress is strategically located on an isolated rocky hill at the end the Vindhya Range, at an elevation of and overlooks the plains of Bundelkhand. It served several of Bundelkhand's ruling dynasties, including the Chandela dynasty of Rajputs , Bhar shiva in the 10th century, and the Solankis of Rewa under a purchase agreement with Akabar . The fortress contains several temples dating as far back as the Gupta dynasty of the 3rd–5th centuries. In 17th century the fort was captured by the Peshwa Bajirao after defeating the Mughal garrison. He established a Marattha light infantry garrison of 5000 under the command of Shrimant RamSingh Bhatt and Yashwant Rao. After the defeat of Rani Laxmibai, the fort came under the management of jhijhotiya Chaubes who struck a deal with the British. The Raos and Bhatts were expelled to Panna and Rewa states, and the Chaubes were granted the state of Kamta Rajaula. The fort was decommissioned and its buildings were demolished, to prevent any further garrisoning at Kalinjar. The last usage of fort wain and around 18th centaury which was used by marathas to collect chauth from Bundelkhand and Vindhyachal amounting to 40 lakh shahi muhars under the comaandership of Bhatta mansingh . The Naukahai campaign of Rewa was launched from this fort in which the sohagpur and shahdol paragana were attached to Peshwa territories. Almost all the occupants of fort were moon worshipers and are called as chandravanshi clans of Kshatriya , Brahmanas and Yadavas . ==History== Kalinjar means The destroyer of time in Sanskrit. 'Kal' is time and 'jar' destruction. Legend says that after manthan Hindu God, Lord Shiva, drank the poison and His throat became blue (hence the name Neel (blue) Kantha (throat)) and He came to Kalinjar and overcome the 'Kal' i.e. He achieved victory over death. This is the reason the Shiva temple at Kalinjar is called Neelkanth. Since then, the hill has been considered a holy site, casting its shadow across the patches of grasslands as well as the densely forested valley. The natural splendor of the surroundings makes it an ideal place for penance and meditation and, surprisingly, a strange mystique still pervades all over the hill. The term \\"Kalinjar\\" (as \\"Kalanjara\\") appears in ancient Hindu mythology, but the exact origins of the fort itself are uncertain. According to the 16th century Persian historian Firishta, the town of Kalinjar was established by one Kedar Raja in 7th century. The fort came to prominence during the Chandela rule. According to Chandela-era legends, the fort was built by a Chandela ruler. The Chandela rulers used the title Kalanjaradhipati (\\"Lord of Kalanjara\\"), which shows the importance they attached to the fort. Its historical background is replete with numerous battles and invasions. The Hindu princes of different dynasties as well as the Muslim rulers fought hard to conquer it and the fort continued to pass from one ruler to another. But, except the Mughals, no other ruler could reign over it for long. In 1023 Mahmud of Ghazni attacked and received a tribute from Kalinjar,Iqtidar Alam Khan, Ganda Chandella, Historical Dictionary of Medieval India, (Scarecrow Press, 2007), 66.Raj Kumar, History Of The Chamar Dynasty : (From 6th Century A.D. To 12th Century A.D.), (Kalpaz Publications, 2008), 127. Mughal Emperor Babur was the only commander in history to have captured the fort in 1526 when driving away Raja Hasan Khan Mewattpati. It was also the place where Sher Shah Suri met his death in 1545 when he was killed either in the fort or nearby on the grounds. In 1569 Akbar captured the fort and it was under Mughal Rule till the British occupation. Kalinjar played a prominent part in history down to the time of the Revolt of 1857, when it was held by a small British garrison. Both the fort and the town, which stands at the foot of the hill, are of interest to the antiquary on account of the remains of temples, sculptures, inscriptions and caves. In 1812, the British troops marched into Bundelkhand. After a long battle they were able to annex the fort. The British seizure of Kalinjar proved to be a great watershed, transferring the legacy of the old aristocracy into the hands of the new bureaucracy of officials who showed their loyalty to British imperialism by damaging the captured fort. The damages caused to the fort can still be seen on its walls and open spaces. ==Transport links== ;Air The nearest airport is at Khajuraho, away but has limited connectivity.

Viking Press) Quiet as a Nun is a thriller novel, written by Antonia Fraser. First published in 1977, it features Fraser's sleuthing heroine Jemima Shore as she revisits the convent school where she was educated following the mysterious death of one of the nuns. A six-part television dramatisation of the book (written by Julia Jones) was part of ITV's anthology series Armchair Thriller in 1978. ==Plot summary== The novel begins with the death of a nun, Sister Miriam, who apparently starved herself to death in a ruined tower, known as the 'Tower of Ivory', which adjoins the grounds of the Convent of the Blessed Eleanor, a nunnery and a girls' school. The tower has specific significance to the Order, as it was the original convent building. The tower and the ancient history of the Order are recorded in the Treasury of the Blessed Eleanor, a manuscript that is referenced throughout the story. Though it is never stated explicitly, Blessed Eleanor is presumed to be Eleanor of Aquitaine, who was once Queen of England. Television reporter Jemima Shore is a former schoolfriend of Sister Miriam, who was also known as Rosabelle Powerstock and was heiress to \\"the Powers fortune\\", one of the largest fortunes in Britain. Jemima is invited back to the convent by Reverend Mother Ancilla, where she uncovers a number of mysteries, including the suggestion that Miriam, whose family owned the convent lands, may have written a second will bequeathing them away from the Order, and into the hands of another charity. The tension builds when the girls at the convent school tell Jemima that the Black Nun, a malevolent faceless spectre reputed to appear whenever a death is about to take place within the grounds, was seen just prior to Sister Miriam's death, and has been sighted again. ==Television adaptation== Quiet as a Nun was adapted for television by ITV in 1978, as part of the Armchair Thriller series. The adaptation starred Maria Aitken as Jemima Shore, along with Renée Asherson (Mother Ancilla), Brenda Bruce (Sister Elizabeth) and Sylvia Coleridge (Sister Boniface). Patsy Kensit, then a young child, plays one of the convent schoolgirls, Tessa Justin, who has a significant role in the final two episodes. In the final minutes of the third episode, aired on 18 April 1978, Jemima Shore goes alone into the Tower at night. As she climbs into the attic, she encounters the faceless Black Nun sitting in a rocking chair. Jemima screams as the Black Nun advances towards her, at which point the episode ends.

The Schwalm flows through Wegberg and Brüggen before flowing into the Meuse across the border with the Netherlands, in Swalmen. Its total length is 45 km. == Sources == The original source region has since become an area of carr with poor water quality. The water of the Schwalm comes mainly from Rheinbraun's waste water pits. This brown coal open cast mine is required to feed the waste water into the surface water. Otherwise it would fill the mine, which is up to 230 metres deep.This is achieved by means of shafts (Schlitzschächten) through which the water flows back into the groundwater. If it were not for these shafts, the rivers Niers and Schwalm would long since have dried up. This would also destroy the mixed alder and ash wet woodland typical of the region. == Course == The source of the Schwalm The source of the Schwalm is in a wetland area south of the German village of Wegberg- Tüschenbroich at an elevation of about .

It was produced by Alderac Entertainment Group since its introduction in April 2001 until January 2008, when they announced they were ceasing its production. In place of AEG, German company Phoenix Interactive has licensed the rights to produce the game and printed their first set, Fourth Edition, in July 2008. The longer official name is almost always shortened to Warlord and the subtitle \\"Saga of the Storm\\" is often used informally to refer to the original base set of cards. The game is unrelated to an earlier, similarly named CCG, Warlords. Warlord is based on the Rank & File system which in turn borrows basic elements from the d20 system. Originally intended as an easy-to-learn second game for players already familiar with d20 fantasy role-playing games, Warlord is often marketed with the tagline, \\"The game you already know how to play\\". Warlord was permanently discontinued by AEG and Phoenix Interactive in early 2012, approximately one decade after its initial release. ==Introduction== Warlord differs from many other Collectible/Customizable card games in that, in gameplay, there is no specific \\"resource\\" required to bring cards into the playing field. In order to balance the gameplay, instead of separate \\"resources\\" being required, the game relies on its \\"Rank and File\\" system, using character level and location to determine whether items of a given level may be equipped, character level and class to determine whether a given action may be performed, and the number of \\"ranks\\" present in the player's formation to determine whether a given character can be brought in to play. Furthermore, characters themselves are often used as \\"resources\\" to perform certain actions in the game. Warlord's first reset was near the beginning of 2004, and was called Campaign Edition. The limited format was introduced in an attempt to bring more balance to the environment. The next reset, called Epic Edition, was released in August 2006. The card pool for Warlord currently has more than 2000 unique cards. Warlord was officially discontinued by Alderac in mid-January, 2008 and ownership was transferred to Phoenix Interactive later that year. Fourth Edition was released in late July 2008, followed by the first expansion for the new edition \\"Shattered Empires\\" in late 2008/ early 2009. ==Game play== In Warlord every player takes control of an army with the single objective of killing all the opposing leaders or Warlords. Once that is achieved, the game is won. The simplicity of Warlord comes from the fact that most everything is tested with a single d20 roll. Every check has a target number (TN) which defines how easy the task is to succeed. The player must surpass that TN with a single die roll plus any modifiers. ===Terms=== *Faction: All armies are aligned with one of the 7 factions. Factions define which warlords can use which characters and usually have a specific play style. The Factions are Elf, Dwarf, Deverenian, Free Kingdoms, Nothrog, The Chosen, and Mercenary. Mercenaries have the unique characteristic of being able to be recruited in to any army. The Chosen were not introduced until the release of 4th Edition. *Warlord: The leader and most important character in your army. He defines your faction and you lose the game if he or she dies. *Ranks: Warlord is based on a Rank & File system. That means that your army must follow some simple guidelines to stay in formation. This is created by building ranks. *Order: An Order is the action of the player for his turn. Orders may be either those allowed by the rulebook (attack, maneuver) or special Orders printed on a card. *React: Separate from Orders, Reacts are played in response to a particular occurrence within the game. Reacts will state when and under what conditions they can be played. *Spend: When a card is used up for this turn, it is turned sideways and is considered spent. Spent cards cannot spend again. A card that is spent becomes ready at the beginning of the next turn. *Stun: Sometimes a card is pushed beyond the spent limits, either by your own actions or by an opponent's. Stunned cards cannot perform actions. A card that is stunned becomes spent at the beginning of the next turn. *Wounds: Wounds are a measure of the damage a character has suffered. Whenever a character is suffering a number of wounds equal to or greater than its hit points, it is removed from the playing area and placed in the discard pile. *Trait: A bold faced word at the start of a text-box classifying a card as something specific (monster, paladin, etc.) or giving it an ability. Factions are specified as traits. ===Types of Cards=== Warlord uses just four types of cards. Characters, Items, Dungeons and Actions. ;Characters Characters are the basic building blocks in Warlord. Their main function is to attack your opponents and use the cards in your hand and sometimes they may be used just as expendable meat to slow your opponents down. Players usually place the maximum number of characters allowed in their decks. Characters have a colored border depending on their faction and all five stat slots filled out. Each character has some statistics which are based on D20 system's terms. Players of Dungeons and Dragons may find them familiar. *Attack (ATK): How easily this character may hit with a melee strike and how many melee strikes he may perform. *Armor Class (AC): How difficult it is for a melee or ranged strike to hit this character. *Level: This is a generic rating of a card's power. Level start from 1 and have no upper limit, though there have been only a few cards that exceed level 9, most of which are related to a special tiered challenge system. Warlords are usually level 5 and cards over level 5 are usually reserved for very powerful characters like Dragons or Overlords. *Alignment: Shows whether a character is good or evil (there is no neutral alignment). Alignment is only used as a restriction or target clause. *Class: There are 4 main classes in Warlord: Fighter, Rogue, Wizard and Cleric. Each class has a specific symbol (Gauntlet, Glove, Scroll and Starburst, respectively) along with the simple circle of the classless characters. Classes are used to define what cards a character can use. *Skill: This is a measure of a character's non-combat abilities. Skill is used to perform feats and succeed at saves and checks. *Hit Points (HP): All characters have a damage threshold. Once a character has a number of wounds equal to or higher than his HP he is killed. Additionally, all characters have a number of traits. The most basic is their Faction but many characters have more traits. The most common traits are: *Feats: Feats are special skills the character is trained in (Stealth, Marksmanship). These are described in the rulebook. *Subclass: Each class has 3 subclasses that are aligned to it. Characters possessing these subclasses gain access to more cards. Example subclasses are Necromancer, Ranger, and Seer. There are also two subclasses (Monk and Mentalist) that are common to all classes. \\"Subclass\\", as of the expansion Hero's Gambit, has become an official term of the game. Before it was just unofficially used by the fans of the game to refer to these types of traits. *Unique: Most cards in Warlord allow for multiple copies in play. Players may only bring one copy of a card with the Unique trait into play. *Epic: Warlord allows players to include up to three copies of most cards in their decks. A card with the Epic trait may only be included in a deck once. *Planar: Planar characters can only be hit if the die roll is even. In Fourth Edition Planar replaced Astral and Ethereal. All characters or cards that give either of those traits now have or give Planar. All characters in the later sets have some kind of ability. These abilities allow for a wide range of strategies, but some are very common. *Ranged Strike: Ranged strikes are the second type of attack available in Warlord. Characters with the ranged strike ability can either attack from the safety of the second rank, or bypass the opponent's defense and strike in his more vulnerable second rank. Many Warlords, especially wizards, rely heavily on ranged strikes. *Movement: Many characters, especially dragons, have some kind of movement ability. Due to the game's rank and file system, innate movement can be very helpful. *Bonus Granting: Bonuses boost the stats of characters in your army in some way. *Entering play effect: These characters have a once per game effect that activates as soon as they enter play. This kind of ability became mainstream with the Sneak Attack expansion. *Leaving play effect: Leaving play effects activate as soon as the character dies. They become common with the Counter Attack expansion. ;Items These cards are used to enhance your characters. As the game does not use a resource, items can only be equipped by characters with a sufficient level and rank. Items usually give some kind of stat boost but they are not restricted to just that. Items have a grey border. Items always have a level and a class. The item's level is its relative power while the class restricts who can use it. Classless items can be used by anyone unless they have restrictions in their text box (such as a specific trait only). Items usually have the Attack or AC stat slots filled out with any bonus (or penalty) they may give. Characters can equip any number of items with two exceptions: he cannot equip two copies of the same item and, when equipping an item with a trait, he must discard any items with the same trait. Traits on items classify them and define what kind of bonuses (if any) they will provide. That is, a Weapon is expected to grant an Attack bonus but AC bonuses, if any are given, will be low. These are the basic item traits: *Weapon: These items usually provide an Attack bonus and usually some kind of offensive ability. Lately, Weapons that provide extra melee strikes have been made common for the fighter class. *Shield: Shields provide low AC bonuses and some kind of defensive special ability. Original Shields had bug restrictions and as a result players just ignored them. Fortunately, Shields have been fixed in later sets. Shields are commonly combined with weapons to form Two- Handed Weapons. Due to this combination of traits, weapon-shields are usually more powerful. *Armor: Armor gives an AC bonus and usually some kind of protective ability. *Helmet: These items provide low AC bonuses and their abilities may vary depending on the class of the helmet. *Steed: Steeds are the standard way to give movement to characters. Steeds are most common for the Fighter and Rogue classes. *Gauntlet: This is a newer trait of items. Gauntlets may grant a stat bonus but it is not expected. Gauntlets usually grant abilities such as feats. *Bow: Bows are usually used to provide ranged strikes to characters without the ability. *Arrow: Arrows are only used during ranged strikes, enhancing their effect. *Trap Traps are used in reaction mostly to targeting. Their effects usually, spend stun or wound the target of the trap. These are so far exclusive to the Rogue class. *Stance: Stance is a new item trait. The only one so far is represents the Fighter class ability to make extra melee strikes. *Potion Potion is a new item trait. The potion is a disposable item that gives bonuses and temporary use of a feat. ;Actions These represent the surprise element of the game. Most actions have restrictions on who may play them (by level and class or trait) which usually gives them focus. For example, fighter actions are usually enhancing reacts to melee strikes while wizard actions are destructive orders. Actions come in two types: Orders and Reacts. Order actions take an entire turn and usually have a more full effect. Reacts are played on specific triggers, such as attacking, moving, or equipping. Actions usually do not occupy a large percentage of the deck because they tend to clutter the hand. However, an action's power is usually greater than a comparable item's or character's because they are use and discard. ;Dungeons Introduced in the Temple of Lore expansion in late 2006, these cards represent various locations which have a global effect on the game. Dungeons are put into play as an order by any player. Each dungeon has a challenge rating. Any player can defeat a dungeon (discard it from play) by spending a number of character levels equal to or greater than the challenge rating of the dungeon. Dungeons typically have challenge ratings between 4 and 10. Dungeons did not return to Warlord in 4th Edition and remain a feature unique to Epic Edition. ==Deck Construction== As in most CCGs, a good deck construction is halfway to victory. Warlord has several restrictions on deck construction to ensure balance. ;Restrictions *Each deck must have a minimum of 50 cards. *Each deck must have a Warlord and a legal starting formation of the same faction as the Warlord. *There may be no more than 3 copies of a single card. *There may be no more than a single copy of an Epic card. *Any Type of card (Character, Item, Action, Dungeon) may comprise no more than 50% of the deck. *There may be no more than one Warlord and Overlord in each deck. ==References== ==External links== *PHOENIX Interactive's Official Warlord Site *The Temple of Lore - the unOfficial Warlord Forum *The Accordlands - Warlord in Europe Site and Forum *Alderac Entertainment Group - the original publisher of Warlord CCG Category:Card games introduced in 2001 Category:Collectible card games Category:Alderac Entertainment Group games ","title":"Warlord (card game)"},{"id":"1281208","text":"Highland English (, ) or Highland and Island EnglishTrudgill, Peter (1984). Language in the British Isles. Cambridge University Press. p. 152. is the variety of Scottish English spoken by many in the Scottish Highlands and the Hebrides. It is more strongly influenced by Gaelic than other forms of Scottish English. ==Phonology== * The more distinctive varieties of Highland English show the influence of Gaelic most clearly in pronunciation, but also in grammar. For example, voiceless stops are realised with preaspiration, that is as , and or , I whereas voiced consonants tend to be de-voiced. Examples; that \\"whatever\\" becomes pronounced as \\"whateffer\\" and the English \\"j\\" as in \\"just\\" sound is often turned into a \\"tch\\" sound e.g. \\"chust\\". English may be realised as , giving \\"chisas\\" (\\"Jesus\\").McArthur, Tom (1998). The English Languages. Cambridge University Press. p. 172. Some speakers insert a \\"sh\\" sound in English \\"rst\\" clusters, so that Eng. \\"first\\" gives \\"firsht\\". The lack of in Gaelic may have led to its realisation in Highland English as , as in (\\"Swansea\\"). *Similarly, the svarabhakti (\\"helping vowel\\") that is used in some consonant combinations in Gaelic and Scots is sometimes used, so that \\"film\\" may be pronounced \\"fillum\\".Filppula, Markku et al. (2008). English and Celtic in Contact. Routledge. p. 206. * Many older speakers employ a very distinctive affirmative or backchannel item taken from Scottish Gaelic which involves an ingress of breathRobert Eklund (2008): Pulmonic ingressive phonation: Diachronic and synchronic characteristics, distribution and function in animal and human sound production and in human speech, Journal of the International Phonetic Association, vol. 38, no. 3, pp. 235–324. with clearly audible friction and whose function to indicate agreement with what a speaker has just said or is saying or to indicate continuing agreement or comprehension. This phenomenon has been termed by some \\"the Gaelic Gasp\\".The Gaelic Gasp* and its North Atlantic Cousins, Eleanor Josette Thom, A study of Ingressive Pulmonic Speech in Scotland. A dissertation submitted in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the MA in Linguistics, University College London. September 2005 This linguistic feature is not found in the other Gaelic languages (Irish and Manx), but is present in some Scandinavian languages.Trudgill, Peter (1984). Language in the British Isles. Cambridge University Press. p. 321. (Similarly, in France people often whisper the word \\"oui\\" while inhaling.) *Lack of the wine–whine merger. *H-dropping, not generally found in Scots or Scottish English dialects, has been reported to be a standard speech feature in the Black Isle, near Inverness.Wells, John Christopher (1982). Accents of English 2 : The British Isles Cambridge University Press. p. 412. ==Grammar== The grammatical influence of Gaelic syntax is most apparent with verbal constructions, as Scottish Gaelic uses the verb to be with the active participle of the verb to indicate a continuous action as in English, but also uses this construction for iterative meanings; therefore \\"I go to Stornoway on Mondays\\" becomes \\"I am going to Stornoway on Mondays\\". Occasionally older speakers use -ing constructions where Standard English would use a simple verb form, example \\"I'm seeing you!\\" meaning \\"I can see you!\\". The past tense in Highland English may use the verb to be followed by \\"after\\" followed by the participle: \\"I am after buying a newspaper\\" to mean \\"I have [just] bought a newspaper\\", although this construction is more common in Irish English. Some speakers use the simple past in situations where standard English would require \\"have\\" plus verb constructions, for example \\"France? I was never there\\" rather than \\"I have never been there\\". The diminutive -ag is sometimes added to words and names, and is a direct lift from Gaelic, e.g. Johnag, Jeanag. It is still used in Caithness as well. A great variety of distinctive female names are formed using the -ina suffix appended to male names, examples: Murdina ( < Murdo), Dolina, Calumina, Angusina, and Neilina. ==Relationship to other languages== Discourse markers taken directly from Gaelic are used habitually by some speakers in English, such as ending a narrative with \\"S(h)in a(g)ad-s' e\\" or \\"Sin agad e\\" (trans. \\"there you have it\\" = Std Eng. \\"So there you are/so that's it\\"), or ending a conversation with \\"Right, ma-thà\\" or \\"Okay ma-thà\\" meaning \\"then\\". ==Vocabulary== A list of words that appear in Highland English, although these are sometimes shared with Scottish English in general, as well as Lowland Scots, and to other areas where Highlanders have emigrated in large numbers. *Aye - Meaning 'yes' *Blone - Meaning 'woman'- particularly in the Hebrides *Bodach - A Gaelic word for an old man. *Bothan - a hut, often an illegal drinking den. *Bourach - a mess, a muddle, from the Gaelic bùrach *Bothy - A mountain refuge. *Cailleach - A Gaelic word for an old woman. *Cèilidh - A 'Social gathering' or, more recently, a formal evening of traditional Scottish Social Dancing. *Clearances or more commonly The Clearances, referring to the Highland Clearances *Cove - a man or boy, mostly heard in Stornoway *Deoch-an- dorais (various spellings), meaning a \\"drink at the door\\". Translated as \\"one for the road\\", i.e. \\"one more drink before you leave\\". *Fear an taighe an MC (master of ceremonies), Gaelic lit. \\"the man of the house\\" *Firth - an estuary *Gàidhealtachd - A Gaelic term for Gaelic-speaking areas, sometimes extended to the Highlands in general *Glen - A valley, usually deep and narrow, from Gaelic gleann. *Inversneckie, a nickname for Inverness. Also \\"Sneck\\", \\"Shneck\\" or \\"The Shneck\\". *Jamp - Usually used in sentences instead of 'jumped' *Keesch- Usually used as an insult. Refers to faeces. *Kyle or Kyles - Straits from Gaelic Caol & Caolais. 'Kyle' is related to this meaning and is also the local name for the more specific Kyle of Lochalsh. *Loch - A Gaelic word meaning a lake or a fjord. *Machair - A Gaelic word referring to a grassy coastal plain, with typical flora, usually in the Outer Hebrides ('Links' in Lowland Scotland). *Mach à Seo! - Let's go, literally \\"out of here!\\".

For example, 'Och aye' translates to 'oh yes' in English *Ochone ochone - An expression of regret or commiseration, from Gaelic. *Piece - packed lunch *Skimler - A parasite, a scrounge. From the Gaelic Sgimilear. *Strath - A wide river valley, usually shallow and wide, from Gaelic srath. *Stroupach - A cup of tea, Gaelic ‘srùbag’. *Tack & Tacksman (historical) - A piece of land and its tenant. *Teuchter - a derogatory term applied mainly to Northern Scots and Highlanders, but also to rural Scots in general. It is sometimes used ironically by the \\"teuchters\\" themselves. *The Wee Frees - A nickname used, generally by outsiders and with some resulting confusion, for more than one Scottish and predominantly Highland church denomination. It has been used for the continuing post-1900 Free Church of Scotland after the union of the majority with the United Presbyterian Church of Scotland to form the United Free Church of Scotland, and for the Free Presbyterian Church of Scotland as opposed to the Free Kirk (Free Church of Scotland). Some view its origin as being even older, referring to the \\"free kirk/wee kirk/auld kirk/cauld kirk\\" rhyme about the churches after the Disruption of 1843. The Free Presbyterian Church of Scotland is sometimes colloquially known as the Wee Wee Frees, and in a similar way Wee Piskies can refer to the Episcopal Church and Wee Papes to the Roman Catholic Church. *The Wee Paper - A nickname for the West Highland Free Press published in Skye. *Westie - West Highland Terrier (now a general term for this dog breed throughout the UK). *White Settlers, or Incomers - a derogatory term for migrants to the Highlands and Islands, often from England, but also from elsewhere in the UK or Europe.Watson (2003) p. 11.Jedrej and Nuttal (1996) p. 16-17. ==See also== * Gallo (Brittany) * Lowland Scots ;Other English dialects heavily influenced by Celtic languages * Anglo-Cornish * Anglo-Manx * Bungi creole * Hiberno-English * Welsh English ==References== ==Sources== * Sabban, Annette (1982), Sprachkontakt: zur Variabilität des Englischen im gälischsprachigen Gebiet Schottlands ; eine empirische Studie, Heidelberg: Groos. * Jedrej, Charles and Nuttall, Mark (1996) White Settlers: The Impact of Rural Repopulation on Scotland.

The site is composed of news, editorials, and synopses of the Harry Potter books and films, an encyclopedia of the books, an IRC network, in which the fans of Harry Potter can discuss predictions and share thoughts, a discussion forum, and media such as screenshots, theatrical trailers, and book covers. There is also a fan fiction section, a weekly caption contest, and other occasional contests and polls. On August 9, 2005, it launched a podcast, dubbed MuggleCast, as well as its own line of clothing, toy wands, and other merchandise. In 2006, MuggleNet released a best-selling reference book on Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, the final book in the series. As of 2008, MuggleNet is owned by Spartz, Inc., an Indiana corporation registered by Emerson Spartz in 2007. On May 29, 2010, MuggleNet 2.0, an updated version of the site, went live. On April 1, 2014, MuggleNet 3.0 was launched to the public. ==Founder== Emerson Spartz founded the site at the age of twelve, a month after reading Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone. He served as owner and webmaster for several years before selling the site. He has also founded websites such as OMG Facts, GivesMeHope, and LoveGivesMeHope through his company, Spartz Media. ==Author and corporate relations== MuggleNet once benefitted from friendly relations with J.K. Rowling, the author of the Harry Potter books, and the producers of the films. She has praised MuggleNet on her website and has awarded it her Fan Site Award. Rowling recounts on her website that she occasionally visits the site and sometimes reads the comments left by visitors although never comments herself. The author also stated that she visited the site's chat room and was snubbed when she anonymously joined in a conversation about Harry Potter theories. In July 2005, Rowling invited Spartz and Melissa Anelli, of The Leaky Cauldron, to Edinburgh, Scotland, for an interview at her home on the release of Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince. A transcript of the interview was posted on MuggleNet. Most recently, J.K. Rowling mentioned MuggleNet through the interactive Harry Potter website Pottermore in September 2013, saying how proud she was to own the key to La Porte, Indiana, hometown of MuggleNet founder Emerson Spartz. Warner Bros., the producers of the Harry Potter movies, regularly sent MuggleNet stills taken from the upcoming movies before they were released. The studio also provided MuggleNet staff with advance views of the new official website designs, as well as included staff in a video conference to discuss the Harry Potter theme park at Universal Orlando. In July 2020, MuggleNet, together with The Leaky Cauldron, took several steps to distance themselves from Rowling due to comments she made the previous month that were considered transphobic. In a joint statement the sites wrote that her views were \\"out of step with the message of acceptance and empowerment we find in her books and celebrated by the Harry Potter community.\\" They announced that they would no longer use photos of author, provide links to her website, or write about achievements unrelated to the Potterverse. ==Podcasts== ===Current podcasts=== ====Accio Politics==== Accio Politics launched on July 31, 2017, as an independent podcast dedicated to the chapter-by-chapter analysis of politics in the wizarding world. From government to patriarchy to friendship to legacy, host Adriana Wilson and her weekly guest cover a myriad of topics, seeking to deconstruct the political implications behind the characters and story. On March 3, 2019, Accio Politics joined forces with MuggleNet. The podcast is produced and as of May 2020, cohosted by MuggleNet staff member Helene Karp. ====Alohomora!==== Founded in April 2012 by Noah Fried and Kat Miller, Alohomora! aims to rekindle the excitement of when the Harry Potter series was new, fresh, and unknown. Its slogan, \\"Open the Dumbledore\\", refers to the nature of the podcast, which is to open doors and thoughts that had previously been locked or untouched. It focuses on the original text of the books and takes segments or passages and analyzes them to a depth that has never been done before. At first, the initiative included not only forums, visitor essays (“Quibbles”), and thousands of daily debates but also a podcast. The six lead hosts, Beth Warsaw, Katy Cartee Haile, Michael Harle, Kat Miller, Alison Siggard, and Rosie Morris, release shows every other week to a global audience of tens of thousands. A highlight of the show is that the hosts are joined by a fan guest on almost every episode – occasionally a leading fandom guest such as Lev Grossman, Steve Vander Ark, or Warwick Davis. The podcast itself includes in-depth analysis of chapters from the Harry Potter series, often paired with analysis of material from J.K. Rowling's Pottermore, a reading and discussion of listener comments, and various special features created by the hosts. Once a book of the series is finished, the podcast hosts celebrate with a live show and global viewing of the corresponding Warner Bros. film adaptation. Since its launch, Alohomora! at one time had a store, at which various merchandise could be purchased (most directly related to theories spawned on the podcast), as well as an iPhone and Android app that included extra content directly from the hosts. After finishing the first reread of the Harry Potter books, the show now releases biweekly episodes alternating between topics suggested by listeners and revisits of specific chapters from the Potter books in no particular order. ====Beyond the Veil==== Premiering March 8, 2019, Beyond the Veil, hosted by former MuggleNet staff member Madison Ford, discusses the deeper impacts the Harry Potter series has had on fans. Focusing on themes such as overcoming obstacles, creating positive change, and mental health crises allows for a safe space to explore and share trials, tribulations, and triumphs. Each episode, Madison is joined by a guest who shares their own personal journey, including how Harry Potter and the wizarding world were there for them. Guests have included some of MuggleNet's own contributors and staff and guest Dr. Janina Scarlet, host of Harry Potter Therapy. Listeners can submit a request to be on the show and share their story, or write in anonymously and have their story shared. ====MuggleCast==== MuggleCast launched in August 2005 when podcasts were still up and coming. Inspired by the passion within the Harry Potter community, MuggleNet staff members Andrew Sims, Ben Schoen, and Kevin Steck created a short podcast to discuss some of the recent Harry Potter news and the just-released Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince. The reception from MuggleNet's audience was great, so the team expanded the shows with a wealth of new co-hosts and content. MuggleCast now discusses the Fantastic Beasts films, theme parks, and fandom news, along with continued in depth discussion of the original Harry Potter series. MuggleCast recorded what it announced would be its final regular episode on August 26, 2013. However, on December 27, 2014, it was announced that they would be returning to regular episodes. MuggleCast began posting weekly podcasts again April 2017. It is currently hosted by Andrew Sims, Eric Scull, Micah Tannenbaum, and Laura Tee and is enjoyed by over 50,000 listeners a week. Andrew and Laura also host a weekly current affairs podcast called #Millienial. The show has interviewed many big names in Harry Potter including David Heyman, David Yates, Oliver Phelps, Evanna Lynch, Warwick Davis, Arthur Bowen, Will Dunn, Patrick Doyle, Mary Grandpre, Jim Dale, and Arthur Parsons (Lego Harry Potter). In September 2019, MuggleCast was featured in The Oprah Magazine article, \\"21 Best Books Podcasts to Listen to When You're Not Reading.\\" ====Reading, Writing, Rowling==== Hosted by Katy McDaniel, a history professor at Marietta College in Marietta, Ohio, and the Hogwarts Professor, John Granger, Reading, Writing, Rowling had its first episode on August 14, 2017. This monthly podcast is dedicated to discussing literary and other scholarly topics surrounding the Harry Potter books, as well as J.K. Rowling's other works. Each episode focuses on a different topic and features a guest who is a prominent researcher, teacher, scholar, or writer. ====SpeakBeasty==== On December 20, 2015, MuggleNet premiered its new podcast, SpeakBeasty, a podcast entirely dedicated to the Fantastic Beasts film series. The biweekly podcast is hosted by Michael Harle, Eleanor Harrison-Dengate, Amy Hogan, Megan Kelly, Aurelia Lieb, Shannen Michaelson, Lizzie Sudlow, and Ariel Taranski. The show has since grown to host special guests, including actors Dan Fogler, who portrays Jacob Kowalski in the films, and Mitchell Thornton, who also appears in the series. SpeakBeasty hosted a live show at New York Comic Con in 2016 and attended the premiere of Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them in New York City on November 10, 2016. ===Former podcasts=== ====MuggleNet Academia==== MuggleNet Academia was a podcast hosted and produced by former MuggleNet managing editor Keith Hawk and the Hogwarts Professor, John Granger, revolving around a particular aspect of literature found within the Harry Potter book series. The idea for the show was presented to the staff of MuggleNet by co-host John Granger to revive the \\"Potter Pundit\\" section that was originally held on several episodes of PotterCast, the Leaky Cauldron website's podcast. However, MuggleNet Academia created an entire show dedicated to one theoretical discussion topic as opposed to just a segment. Each show featured a special guest speaker, usually a professor or other academic specialist, as well as a student guest, usually an undergraduate, graduate student, or recent graduate who excels in the field of each particular lesson. The first episode was released in April 2012, and the show has quickly climbed to be the second highest educational podcast on iTunes. An iOS and Amazon mobile app were also available, providing access to all of the normal episodes as well as periodic bonus material, typically in the format of an interview of a college or university professor who teaches a particular Harry Potter-themed course at their school. In January 2017, MuggleNet Academia was discontinued following Hawk's departure from the site. Its last episode was released December 12, 2016. ====MuggleNet Fan Fiction's AudioFictions==== MuggleNet Fan Fiction's AudioFictions ran for nearly six years with a total of 200 episodes (January 3, 2009-December 28, 2014). It was founded by MuggleNet Fan Fiction (MNFF) staff member Rosie Morris (known by her MNFF username, Roxy Black). The podcast's goal was to bring Harry Potter fan fiction to fans around the globe in a new way, with recorded readings by the AudioFictions readers, known as “MerMuggles” (a portmanteau of \\"Merpeople\\" and \\"Muggle\\", in reference to the podcast's operations being centered in the MuggleNet Fan Fiction Beta Board's Black Lake thread). The original team, led by Morris, consisted of Clare Mansfield, Equinox Chick, Jessie Lights, kiley, MuggleNet staff member Michael Harle (known by his MNFF username, Lupinpatronus), Nixemus (who composed the show's original music), Schmerg_the_Impaler, Weasleykitty, and Nixemus. Other MerMuggles who joined the show later include coolh5000, Eratosthenese, Faerie Dust, Finest Firewhisky, sajomn, and type-n-shadow. The podcast strove to ensure that, as its slogan states, \\"the magic lives beyond the books\\". The show's readers brought to life the stories written by Harry Potter fans and posted to MuggleNet Fan Fiction, with original, character-based interstitials to interlock the fictions. The show invited listeners to participate in creating its content by nominating fictions and participating in contests. AudioFictions experienced a low-key revision in early 2010, with Nixemus stepping into the role of project manager. Nixemus also created and filled the new host role and brought the show closer to its most recent format. In late 2010, Harle was promoted to project manager and host, adding new MerMuggle readers Apollonious, Chadadada17, and theGreatOm to the lineup. Harle also created the editor role for AudioFictions, bringing Granger7, pinkdude64, and stevenrankin onto the team. Under Harle's direction, and following a lengthy absence and revision, AudioFictions was quietly relaunched in 2011 with a new format and release schedule. This format was, again, modified before the show's major relaunch in 2012. ==Features== ===MuggleNet Interactive=== MuggleNet Interactive (often shortened to MNI) was a website spin-off of MuggleNet. It was an online forum where users could interact with each other in a Hogwarts-style setting. In addition to the general chat areas, the site was known for its diverse offerings, including the roleplaying area, the blog- style Chamber of Secrets, the high-speed trivia games of the Quidditch pitch, and the professor-led classes taught in a Socratic method. Semiannual House Cup competitions encouraged House unity and often allowed members to compete for honors in contests with essays, graphics, or other media. The MNI community also celebrated many holidays, as well as the shared birthday of Harry Potter and J.K. Rowling, with a \\"ball\\" in the otherwise closed Great Hall. Many site secrets were hidden throughout MNI's pages and were often sought for their Galleon rewards, but speaking of them on the site itself was forbidden. The many distinct components of the site contributed to the diverse community that it attracted. The site was originally formed from a personality quiz made in 2000, which was later adapted for the fuller version of the site as a Sorting Hat. Over the years, sections such as a Diagon Alley shopping area, a dueling game, Flourish and Blotts fan fiction library, quizzes, Quidditch, and other subsections outside of the forum structure were incorporated into the site. The staff hierarchy was originally modeled after the faculty structure at Hogwarts with a Headmaster/Headmistress as the main site administrator overseeing moderating prefects and class-leading professors, but over time, non-canon positions, such as programmers, artists, and quiz masters, were added in addition to other Harry Potter-themed appointments. Due to lack of server space and low traffic volumes, the site was shut down on August 1, 2016, after 13 years of operation. ===MuggleNet Fan Fiction=== On November 14, 2004, MuggleNet opened its fan fiction subsite, MuggleNet Fan Fiction (often shortened to MNFF), following in the footsteps of other Potter-specific fan fiction sites. In 2006, the site began its annual Quick Silver Quill Awards, in which authors and readers could nominate their favorite fictions from various categories to receive recognition. Its forums house discussion groups aimed at improving reading and writing skills, as well as community building within the membership of the site. Popular areas include the Susan Bones Book Club (SBBC), where members are encouraged to share and discuss their favorite fictions from the site; Society for the Promotion of Evaluations for Writers (SPEW), where members can improve their critical review writing skills; the Three Broomsticks (TTB), where members can partake in writing challenges; and the Bannermakers Association and Dean's Corner, where members can stretch their artistic muscles and create banners and fan art that complement the site's fictions. MuggleNet Fan Fiction also hosts its own version of Hogwarts within its forums, offering classes to new authors who wish to learn more about writing. These are run by members of the site who volunteer to teach a subject that interests them. The classes are very popular, with more authors taking part each term (run in trimesters). The classes are run in levels: first years, OWLs, and NEWTs, getting progressively more in-depth and allowing authors to choose at which level they wish to participate. ===MuggleSpace=== Launched during the Christmas holidays of 2008, MuggleSpace was a fan-based social network designed to provide a live online community for Harry Potter fans all over the world. The site contained a number of features, including a live group and private chat (monitored and participated in frequently by site moderators); blogs where users could share their personal creations and comment on the works of others such as novels, poems, fan fiction, or their own thoughts on the Potter world; and groups where users actively role-played or showed support for their favorite fandoms, causes, or fellow members. Other features included photos, videos, and discussion forums. For many, the site was a sanctuary for discussing problems and connecting with like-minded people. Unfortunately, the site was forced to close its doors in November 2013 due to lack of participation. ==Published works== In 2006, in advance of the arrival of Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, five MuggleNet staff members (Andy Gordon, Jamie Lawrence, Ben Schoen, Emerson Spartz, and Gretchen Stull) co-authored the reference book What Will Happen in Harry Potter 7: Who Lives, Who Dies, Who Falls in Love, and How Will the Adventure Finally End, which was a published collection of unofficial fan predictions. As of July 21, 2007, the book has sold 335,000 copies and reached #2 on the New York Times Children's Bestseller List, where it spent six months. Spartz and his co-authors launched a marketing campaign in June 2007 to promote their work. This included a tour of the United States where they stopped at many bookstores and discussed their various theories and revelations. In 2009, Emerson Spartz and Ben Schoen penned another book, MuggleNet.com's Harry Potter Should Have Died: Controversial Views from the #1 Fan Site. A cross-country book tour took place in the summer of 2009. In March 2009, MuggleNet Fan Fiction released a self-help guide to creative writing entitled Sharpen Your Quill. The book offers advice on writing plot, characterization, poetry, specific genres, and other useful information, including grammar and fluent style. As a self-published book, the release made little revenue, but the proceeds were used to fund AudioFictions, the site's former audiobook-style podcast. ==MuggleNet Live!== ===MuggleNet Live! 2015: Expo Patronum=== On October 31, 2014, the site announced MuggleNet Live! 2015: Expo Patronum. It was described as The convention was held on April 18, 2015, in London, England, and featured several special guests from the films, including Afshan Azad (Padma Patil), Jon Campling (unnamed Death Eater), Jessie Cave (Lavender Brown), Warwick Davis (Professor Filius Flitwick & Griphook), Alfred Enoch (Dean Thomas), Rohan Gotobed (young Sirius Black), wand combat choreographer Paul Harris, Robbie Jarvis (teenage James Potter), Georgina Leonidas (Katie Bell), Harry Melling (Dudley Dursley), graphic design team MinaLima (Miraphora Mina and Eduardo Lima), Nick Moran (Scabior), Chris Rankin (Percy Weasley), Anna Shaffer (Romilda Vane), Nick Shirm (Zacharias Smith), Natalia Tena (Nymphadora Tonks), and art director Gary Tomkins. ===MuggleNet Live! 2017: Nineteen Years Later=== On September 1, 2017, MuggleNet hosted MuggleNet Live! 2017: Nineteen Years Later at the Wizarding World of Harry Potter at Universal Studios Florida to celebrate the date on which Harry Potter would have sent his son Albus Severus to Hogwarts for the first time, according to the epilogue of Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows. The event began with panels of actors from the Potter films. Special guests included Chris Rankin (Percy Weasley), Christian Coulson (Tom Marvolo Riddle), Luke Youngblood (Lee Jordan), Sean Biggerstaff (Oliver Wood), Ellie Darcey- Alden (young Lily Evans), Rohan Gotobed (young Sirius Black), and Ryan Turner (Hugo Weasley). After the panels, attendees were invited to walk the streets of the Diagon Alley section of the theme park after hours. Guests could ride Harry Potter and the Escape from Gringotts and the Hogwarts Express, eat at the Leaky Cauldron, and freely interact with the actors the throughout the evening. Attendees also enjoyed the Olivanders wand experience and watched performances of Celestina Warbeck and the Banshees and the Tales of Beedle the Bard. The event was sponsored by Funko, Tervis Tumbler, Candlewick Press, Hogwarts Running Club, and Insight Editions. ===MuggleNet Live! 2019: Into the Pensieve=== On October 4 and 5, MuggleNet hosted MuggleNet Live! 2019: Into the Pensieve at New York Comic Con 2019. Friday evening's variety show panel, MuggleNet: Harry Potter Journeys into the Pensieve, was emceed by Eric Scull, a longtime MuggleNet staff member. The event included a brief history of MuggleNet, an on-the-spot Crazy Caption Contest, a re-creation of a book-only scene, a Mad Libs morality tale, staff member improvs, and more. The whole audience participated in the singing of the Hogwarts school song and later a synchronized rendition of Potter Puppet Pals' \\"The Mysterious Ticking Noise\\". Special guests included Fantastic Beasts series actor Dan Fogler (Jacob Kowalski), who jumped in on the Erumpent dance contest, and Off-Broadway Puffs performer Andy Miller (Leanne), who joined contestants in charades. Video messages from Harry Potter actors Warwick Davis (Professor Filius Flitwick/Griphook) and Evanna Lynch (Luna Lovegood) and Wizarding World of Harry Potter art director Alan Gilmore were played. On Saturday, MuggleNet hosted an in-person component of its MuggleNet 20th Anniversary Virtual 20K run. Whether you could make it in person or not, everyone who registered received a personalized digital running bib and a 3\\" platinum running medal featuring a spinning Time-Turner. This event was in partnership with Potterhead Running Club. Participants were asked to come dressed in their best cosplay or magical Muggle clothes. A bonus 20-year charm was given to those who showed up for the event in person. Saturday evening, MuggleNet hosted a dance party at the Hard Rock Cafe in Times Square. Entertainment and excitement included Harry Potter-themed drinks, amazing cosplay, and classic songs from 1999 to 2019. ==In popular culture== In October 2007, Jimmy Kimmel Live! did a parody of Emerson Spartz's recent interview on the \\"Geraldo\\" segment of Fox News. Both the original interview and the parody discussed J.K. Rowling's recent outing of Headmaster of Hogwarts Albus Dumbledore. MuggleNet was featured on an episode of UK game show The Chase on January 14, 2014. The question asked was \\"MuggleNet.com is a website dedicated to what fictional character?\\" The contestant chose to pass rather than answer the question. In February 2014, fact-checking website Snopes published an article debunking the rumor that actress Emma Watson would be playing Ariel in a live-action version of The Little Mermaid. The source of this rumor was a 2013 April Fools' Day article published by MuggleNet. MuggleNet was featured in the Los Angeles Times crossword puzzle on March 12, 2015. The clue for 9 down was \\"story you might find on MuggleNet.com, briefly\\", with the answer \\"fanfic\\". MuggleNet was featured in the New York Times crossword puzzle on May 1, 2019. The clue for 18 down was \\"MuggleNet or the Leaky Cauldron, for Harry Potter readers\\", with the answer \\"fansite\\". On August 6, 2020, MuggleNet was again featured in the New York Times crossword puzzle. This time, the clue for 14 down was \\"MuggleNet for Harry Potter devotees\\", with the answer again \\"fansite\\". ==See also== * Harry Potter fandom ==References== ==External links== * MuggleNet * Alohomora! * MuggleCast * SpeakBeasty * MuggleNet Fan Fiction * Chamber of Secrets forums (Official MuggleNet forums) * MuggleNet Live!

The source of the Geul is at about above sea level in northeastern Belgium near the German border, south of the German town of Aachen. From there, after flowing some in a northwestern direction, it leaves Belgium and enters the Netherlands at Cotessen in the Vaals municipality. After a further in a west-northwestern direction through the most southern part of Limburg, which in its turn is the most southern province of the Netherlands, it flows into the Meuse, north of the city of Maastricht. A tributary of the Geul is the Gulp. Places through which the Geul passes are among others Kelmis (Belgium), Valkenburg aan de Geul and Meerssen (Netherlands). ==Pollution== The water of the Geul is polluted seriously with heavy metals zinc and lead and as a result also is a serious source of heavy metal inflow into the Meuse. This pollution is a result of former zinc and lead mining activities near the Belgian towns of Kelmis (La Calamine) and Plombières (formerly named Bleiberg). The last ones of these mines have closed early in the 20th century. One of the reasons for giving up mining activities in Plombières was the occasional flooding of the mine by the Geul, as the bedrock (mainly Carboniferous limestone) contains many faults and fissures. Although mine factory buildings have been demolished, old railway dikes still are abundantly present in the area. They provide ideal hiking routes, that are known for the presence of so-called \\"zinc flora\\" (zinc-tolerant plants, such as yellow calamine violet and Viola calaminaria). ==Gallery== File:Kelmis Tueljebach - Geul.jpgAt Kelmis Tueljebach File:Schin op Geul-Geul- Schoonbron-1.JPGAt Schin op Geul File:Geul bij Strabeek Limburg.jpgAt Strabeek File:Geul voulwammes.jpgEstuary at Voulwammes ==References== Category:International rivers of Europe Category:Rivers of the Ardennes (Belgium) Category:Rivers of Belgium Category:Rivers of the Netherlands Category:Rivers of Liège (province) Category:Rivers of South Limburg (Netherlands) Category:Gulpen-Wittem Category:Kelmis Category:Meerssen Category:Plombières Category:Raeren Category:Valkenburg aan de Geul ","title":"Geul"},{"id":"1281221","text":"An artist's representation of the Fluid Science Laboratory as it appears in the European Space Agency's Columbus module on the International Space Station. The Fluid Science Laboratory is a European (ESA's) science payload designed for use in Columbus built by Alenia Spazio, OHB-System and Verhaert Design and Development. It is a multi-user facility for conducting fluid physics research in microgravity conditions. It can be operated in fully or in semi-automatic mode and can be controlled on board by the ISS astronauts, or from the ground in the so-called telescience mode. The major objective of performing fluid science experiments in space is to study dynamic phenomena in the absence of gravitational forces. Under microgravity such forces are almost entirely eliminated thereby significantly reducing gravity-driven convection, sedimentation and stratification and fluid static pressure, allowing the study of fluid dynamic effects normally masked by gravity. These effects include diffusion-controlled heat and mass transfer. The absence of gravity-driven convection eliminates the negative effects of density gradients (inhomogeneous mass distribution) that arise in processes involving heat treatment, phase transitions, diffusive transport or chemical reaction. Convection in terrestrial processes is a strong perturbing factor, the effects of which are seldom predictable with great accuracy and which dominate heat and mass transfer in fluids. The ability to accurately control such processes remains limited, and their full understanding requires further fundamental research by conducting well-defined model experiments for developing and testing related theories under microgravity. This should facilitate the optimisation of manufacturing processes here on Earth and improve the quality of high value products, such as semiconductors. The Fluid Science Laboratory fully occupies one International Standard Payload Rack. The Facility Core Element consists of the Optical Diagnostics Module and Central Experiment Module into which the experiment containers are sequentially inserted and operated. The Optical Diagnostics Module houses the equipment for visual and interferometric observation, their related control electronics and the attachment points and interfaces for Front Mounted Cameras. The Central Experiment Module is divided into two parts: * The first part contains the suspension structure for the Experiment Containers, including all the functional interfaces and optical equipment, and is designed to be pulled out from the rack to allow insertion and removal of the Experiment Container. * The second part contains all the diagnostic and illumination equipment and its control electronics to command and monitor the electromechanical and opto-mechanical components. The Facility Core Element is complemented by the functional sub-systems for power distribution, environmental conditioning and data processing and management. Experiments must be integrated in an FSL Experiment Container (FSL EC). With a typical mass of , a maximum mass of , and standard dimensions of 400x270x280 mm (15.7x10.6x11.0 in), the EC provides ample space to accommodate the fluid cell assembly, including any necessary process stimuli and dedicated electronics. For observation of experiments the Fluid Science Laboratory includes: * Two-axis visual observation with electronic imaging and photographic back-up via Front Mounted Cameras which provide high speed imaging together with high resolution and colour recording; * Background, sheet and volume illumination with white light and monochromatic (laser) light sources; * Particle image velocimetry, including liquid crystal tracers for simultaneous velocimetry and thermometry; * Thermographic (infrared) mapping of free liquid surfaces; * Interferometric observation in two axes by convertible interferometers with active alignment: ** Holographic interferometer; ** Wollaston - shearing interferometer; ** Schlieren mode combined with shearing mode; ** Electronic Speckle Pattern Interferometer. Flight Support Equipment such as spare parts, special tools and consumables (e.g. cleaning agents), Front Mounted Cameras and Optical Reference Targets for experiment and diagnostic calibration will also be available on board to support customer experiments. A number of upgrades, partly resulting from new technological developments, have been implemented recently into the Fluid Science Laboratory. Most notable among these are a new Video Managgement Unit (VMU) and the Microgravity Vibration Isolation Subsystem (MVIS) developed by the Canadian Space Agency. Scientists may choose to activate MVIS to isolate (via magnetic levitation) the experiment and optical diagnostics from space station g-jitter perturbations. The VMU has already provided remarkable good scientific data during the recent CompGran Mission, installed by Alexander Gerst in June 2018. The MVIS system will first be exploited with the upcoming Reference Multiscale Boiling Mission starting in August 2019. FSL is operated according to ESA's decentralised payload operation concept. The Facility Responsible Centre (FRC) for FSL was MARS, located in Naples, Italy and now is BUSOC Belgian User Support and Operations Centre, located in Brussels, Belgium.https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/research/experiments/265.htmlhttp://www.busoc.be/projects/fsl/ ==Related publications== * Dewandre T, Mundorf H, Tacconi M, Allegra A, Pensavalle E, Winter J.

The group were founded by three DJs, Aaron Lubinski (a.k.a. Xylocaine), David Melo (a.k.a. Disassembler) and Mark Newlands (a.k.a. Mark N, Overcast). They have first pioneered hardcore techno, gabber, amigacore and cheapcore music in the Australian market, releasing the six studio albums before disbanding in 2001. ==History== They are an Australian recording and performance group formed in Newcastle in 1992, consisting of Aaron Lubinski (a.k.a. Xylocaine), David Melo (a.k.a. Disassembler) and Mark Newlands (a.k.a. Mark N, Overcast); and took their name from the German word Nasenbluten, which translates as nosebleed. This refers to the phrase \\"nosebleed techno\\" as used to describe the harder and faster variants of the techno genre. Early in 1993 Lubinski founded the Dead Girl Records label (initially typset as dEAdGirL) in Swansea. They have first created music on the Amiga personal computers using tracker software in the MOD format and started playing house parties in Newcastle. They self-released a number of cassettes on the Dead Girl label starting with their debut album, Transient Ischemic Attack, which appeared in March 1993. On 31 July that year they recorded as a gig, which was released as Live at Wobble. In late October they recorded another album, You're Going to Die. In mid-1994 following their Dead Girl cassettes they signed to New York City-based hardcore techno label, Industrial Strength Records. In August that year, the Newlands founded Bloody Fist Records for any local releases. Shortly after their debut LP, a sampler for Bloody Fist released internationally by other record labels, like Industrial Strength that featured two tracks from Nasenbluten. Nasenbluten inspired local musicians, leading to a thriving hardcore techno scene in Newcastle. In February 2005 Luke Collison (a.k.a. Dsico) acknowledged his major influences were \\"probably Nasenbluten and the Newcastle Hardcore scene. I grew up around there ... the radio show that Mark N used to do on 2NUR. Amiga 500 Hardcore was probably what got me into electronic music and especially making it\\". United Kingdom DJ, Loftgroover declared \\"there's too much niceness in the rave scene ... Gabba is how I really feel – hard, angry\\". He described \\"Nasenbluten-style extreme noise terror: 'punkcore', 'scarecore' and 'doomtrooper'\\". The band's emphasis on breakbeats, ironic audio samples and gangster rap samples became influential in the hardcore scene, most prominently with Australian artists signed to Bloody Fist. Due to their influence and the relatively small numbers of records that were pressed for earlier releases (including limited self-distributed cassettes), they have become popular with collectors. Bloody Fist Records provided \\"horrifically high-tempo electronic music that quickly became a thing of international legend. Specialising in breakcore, gabba and referential sample alchemy/exploitation\\". According to Shaun Prescott at Mess+Noise, the band's 2× LP 100% No Soul Guaranteed (1995) showcased a \\"nasty marriage of power electronics shock tactics with vaguely danceable and purely psychotic electronic beats is one of the few genuinely sickening music experiences you're likely to have in your life\\". In 1996, Nasenbluten released a limited edition single, \\"Show Us Yor Tits\\" (often referred to as \\"Anna Wood\\" or \\"Fuck Anna Wood\\", from its sampled lyrics), on the Dead Girl label, which is the label they have first released the debut album. In October the previous year a schoolgirl of that name died after using ecstasy at dance club; she was given copious amounts of water upon her collapse and later lapsed into a coma. Media reports sparked a moral panic surrounding rave parties and drug use at venues. This brought about a hard-line approach from governments to rave and dance parties in Australia. Jack Marx of The Age described how Wood's friends may have been influenced by the prevailing zero tolerance attitude and hence they were too afraid to take her directly to hospital. \\"Show Us Yor Tits\\" was not commercially available but only distributed by the band at gigs; they provided 50 vinyl copies, each individually numbered. The label had a picture of Wood with the phrase \\"I'm having the best night of my life!\\" and a picture of Dutch DJ Paul Elstak on the B-side with the words \\"I wanna see the rainbow high in the sky\\", a reference to the happy hardcore scene, its links to ecstasy, and to the song \\"Rainbow in the Sky\\" by Elstak. Cat Hope described \\"Fuck Anna Wood\\" as featuring \\"controversial, sampled snippets from current affairs programs composed to form conversations, laid over with a gabba-style hard beat\\". As \\"Show Us Yor Tits\\" it appeared on Nasenbluten's next album for Bloody Fist, N Of Terror, a 2× cassette, which had been recorded in April 1996. Nasenbluten continued to issue material and toured Europe from November 1996 to February 1997 on their Christ This Is Dragging On A Bit Tour. While in Germany they recorded an EP, Cheapcore, for the local Strike Records label, which was issued in 1997. The group played their last gig on 30 September 2001, they issued a 3× LP album, Dog Control, in November and disbanded as the three musicians pursued their own projects. ===Side and later projects=== One of Aaron Lubinski's side projects was working as Xylocaine: he provided several releases on the Dead Girl and Bloody Fist imprints. David Melo created several tracks as Disassembler, including one record on the Bloody Fist label that was mis-pressed and was not commercially available. Mark Newlands recorded under the alias Overcast, also on the Bloody Fist. The Overcast album, 3PM Eternal was the last 2x12\\" album release from the label. The 1994-2004 12\\" split album by Aftermath / Epsilon is the final vinyl release by Bloody Fist before shutdown. ==Discography== ===Albums=== * Transient Ischemic Attack – dEAdGirL Records (cassette DG001) (March 1993) * Live at Wobble – dEAdGirL Records (live album, cassette DG002) (1993) * You're Going to Die – dEAdGirL Records (cassette DG003) (1993) * I'll Make Them Pay – dEAdGirL Records (2× LP DG004) (May 1994) * We've Got the Balls – Bloody Fist Records (2× LP FISTC-04 ) (February 1995) * 100% No Soul Guaranteed – Industrial Strength Records (IS030) (1995) * N Of Terror – Bloody Fist Records (2× cassette FISTC-12) (April 1996) * Dog Control – Bloody Fist Records (3× LP FIST27) (November 2001) ===Extended plays=== * Football – dEAdGirL Records (cassette DGL002) (1993) * The Nihilist – Mouse Records (TRAP 2) (1994) * 500 / 600 / 1200 – Bloody Fist Records (FISTC-03 ) (November 1994) * Really Nasty Violent Sex – Storm Records Scotland (WAR 001) (1995) * Brick Shithouse – Industrial Strength Records (IS038) (1996) * Cheapcore – Strike Records (STRIKE 020) (1997) * Not as Good as 100% No Soul Guaranteed – Industrial Strength Records (IS044) (1997) * Nightsoil – Atomic Hardcore Recordings (AR005) (1998) ==References== ==External links== * Bloody Fist Records Category:Breakcore Category:Musical groups established in 1992 Category:Musical groups disestablished in 2001 Category:New South Wales musical groups Category:1992 establishments in Australia Category:2001 disestablishments in Australia Category:Tracker musicians ","title":"Nasenbluten"},{"id":"1281229","text":"Göhl is a municipality in the district of Ostholstein, in Schleswig-Holstein, Germany. ==References== Category:Municipalities in Schleswig-Holstein Category:Ostholstein ","title":"Göhl"},{"id":"1281239","text":"Ștefan Golescu (1809 - 1874) was a Wallachian Romanian politician who served as the Minister of Foreign Affairs for two terms from 1 March 1867 to 5 August 1867 and from 13 November 1867 to 30 April 1868, and as Prime Minister of Romania between 26 November 1867 and 12 May 1868. ==Biography== Ștefan Golescu was the son of the great patriot scholar Dinicu Golescu.

During the writing of the new constitution, Ștefan Golescu supported Nicolae Bălcescu's idea of universal suffrage, while his brother, Nicolae, favoured less expansive participation. Ștefan was part of the delegation sent by the revolutionaries to Istanbul to negotiate the new constitution with the Ottoman Empire, Wallachia's overlord. Ștefan Golescu was a member of the Wallachian assembly that elected Alexandru Ioan Cuza as prince of both Wallachia and Moldavia (1859).

Web Access 28 October 2016. http://www.ferris.edu/htmls/news/jimcrow/witnesses/orangeburg.htm The next night more students led by John Stroman returned and entered the bowling alley. This time there were police waiting for them and several students were arrested, including Stroman. After the arrests, more students began showing up, angry that protesters were being arrested. Next the crowd broke a window of the bowling alley and chaos ensued. Police began beating student protesters (both men and women) with billy clubs. That night, eight students were sent to the hospital.Shuler, Jack. Blood & Bone, pp. 75–78. Over the next couple of days the tension in Orangeburg escalated. Student protesters submitted a list of demands that consisted of integration and the elimination of discrimination within the community. The Governor of South Carolina at the time, Robert E. McNair, responded by calling in the National Guard after commenting that black power advocates were running amok in the community.Shuler, Jack. Blood & Bone, p. 81. Over the next two days, about 200 mostly student protesters gathered on the campus of South Carolina State University, a historically black college in Orangeburg, to demonstrate against the continued segregation at the bowling alley. ==Conflict== 261x261px On the night of February 8, 1968, students started a bonfire at the front of the campus of South Carolina State University. As police and firefighters attempted to put out the fire, officer David Shealy was injured by a heavy wooden banister taken from a nearby unoccupied house and thrown in his direction. Shortly thereafter (around 10:30 p.m.) South Carolina Highway Patrol officers began firing into the crowd of around 200 protesters. Eight patrol officers fired carbines, shotguns, and revolvers at the protesters, firing for around 10 to 15 seconds. Twenty-seven people were injured in the shooting, most of whom were shot in the back as they were running away, and three African-American men were killed.Shuler, Jack. Blood & Bone, p. 18. The three men killed were Samuel Hammond Jr., Henry Smith (both SCSU students), and Delano Middleton, a student at the local Wilkinson High School. Middleton was shot while simply sitting on the steps of the freshman dormitory awaiting the end of his mother's work shift. The police later said that they believed they were under attack by small arms fire. A newspaper reported: \\"About 200 Negros [sic] gathered and began sniping with what sounded like 'at least one automatic, a shotgun and other small caliber weapons' and throwing bricks and bottles at the patrolmen.\\" Similarly, a North Carolina newspaper reported that week that students threw firebombs at buildings and that the sound of apparent sniper fire was heard. Protesters insisted that they did not fire at police officers, but threw objects and insulted the men. Evidence that police were being fired upon at the time of the incident was inconclusive, and no evidence was presented in court, as a result of investigations, that protesters were armed or had fired on officers. ==Aftermath== alt= Old Orangeburg County jail at southeast corner of St. John and Meeting Streets in Orangeburg, South Carolina; seen from the southwest At a press conference the following day, Governor Robert E. McNair said the event was \\"...one of the saddest days in the history of South Carolina\\". McNair blamed the deaths on Black Power outside agitators and said the incident took place off campus, contrary to the evidence. The federal government brought charges against the state patrolmen in the first federal trial of police officers for using excessive force at a campus protest. The state patrol officers' defense was that they felt they were in danger and protesters had shot at the officers first. All nine defendants were acquitted although 36 witnesses stated that they did not hear gunfire coming from the protesters on the campus before the shooting and no students were found to be carrying guns.Shuler, Jack. Blood & Bone, pp. 19, 84. In a state trial in 1970, the activist Cleveland Sellers was convicted of a charge of riot related to the events on February 6 at the bowling alley. He served seven months in state prison, getting time off for good behavior. He was the national program director of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC). In 1973, he wrote The River of No Return: The Autobiography of a Black Militant and the Life and Death of SNCC. Sellers was officially pardoned by the governor of South Carolina in 1993. The Smith–Hammond–Middleton Memorial Center, South Carolina State's on-campus arena, was renamed in honor of the three victims, opening the same year as the massacre. ==List of those involved == ===Deaths=== * Samuel Ephesians Hammond Jr., 18sciway.net * Delano Herman Middleton, 17 * Henry Ezekial Smith, 19 ===Injuries=== * Herman Boller Jr., 19 * Johnny Bookhart, 19 * Thompson Braddy, 20 * Bobby K.

He was shot in the stomach but did not go to the hospital for treatment. ==Media coverage== This was the first incident of its kind on a United States university campus. The Orangeburg killings received relatively little media coverage. The events predated the 1970 Kent State shootings and Jackson State killings, in which protesters against the Vietnam War were killed by the National Guard, and by the local and state highway patrol, respectively. The perceived overreaction by law enforcement helped galvanize public opinion against the war as well. The historian Jack Bass attributed the discrepancy in media coverage in part due to the Orangeburg incident occurring after large-scale urban riots, which made it seem small by comparison. It may not have been considered as newsworthy, especially since the shootings occurred at night, when media coverage, especially any television news, was less. In addition, the victims at Orangeburg were mostly young black men protesting against local segregation. Linda Meggett Brown wrote that subsequent events in the spring of 1968the assassination of Martin Luther King Jr., followed shortly by the assassination of Robert F. Kennedy, and the Tet Offensive in Vietnam Warovershadowed the events at Orangeburg. Linda Meggett Brown, \\"Remembering the Orangeburg Massacre\\", Black Issues in Higher Education, March 1, 2001. Accessed April 1, 2005. At Kent State, by contrast, Bass noted that the victims were young white students protesting against the U.S. war in Vietnam, which had become increasingly unpopular and a highly politicized, national issue. They were attacked by members of the National Guard, which the media may have judged was a more inflammatory aspect of the shootings. The black students at Jackson State were also protesting against the war, and the killings there took place shortly after those at Kent State. It appeared that law enforcement and university administrations had no idea about how to handle campus unrest. There was widespread public outrage over the events. ==Legacy== *South Carolina State University's gymnasium is named in memory of the three men who were killed. A monument was erected on campus in their honor and the site has been marked. All-Star Triangle Bowl became integrated. * On August 9, 2013, a work crew fixed a spelling error on the Orangeburg Massacre Monument. Delano H. Middleton's name was mistakenly listed as Delano B. Middleton. One theory for the incorrect initial is that it was pulled from Middleton's nickname \\"Bump\\". The error went unnoticed for over 40 years. *In 2001 Governor Jim Hodges attended the university's annual memorial of the event, the first governor to do so. That same year, on the 33rd anniversary of the killings, an oral history project featured eight survivors telling their stories at a memorial service. It was the first time that survivors had been recognized at the memorial event. Robert Lee Davis told an interviewer, \\"One thing I can say is that I'm glad you all are letting us do the talking, the ones that were actually involved, instead of outsiders that weren't there, to tell you exactly what happened.\\" *A joint resolution was introduced in the South Carolina state general assembly in 2003, and re- introduced in each of the next three sessions of the legislature, to establish an official investigation of the events of February 8, 1968, and to establish February 8 as a day of remembrance for the students killed and wounded in the protest. However, the legislature never voted on the resolution.South Carolina General Assembly, S. 377, introduced in the Senate on February 18, 2003.South Carolina General Assembly, S. 215, introduced in the Senate on January 12, 2005.South Carolina General Assembly, H. 3824, introduced in the House on March 29, 2007.South Carolina General Assembly, S. 35, introduced in the Senate on January 9, 2009. *The Orangeburg massacre was the subject of two films released on the 40th anniversary of the massacre, in April 2008: Scarred Justice: The Orangeburg Massacre, 1968 by documentary filmmakers Bestor Cram and Judy Richardson; and Black Magic by Dan Klores. ==See also== *Protests of 1968 *Greensboro massacre *List of killings by law enforcement officers in the United States *List of incidents of civil unrest in the United States ==Notes== ==References== ==Bibliography== * Shuler, Jack.

It was based on the true story of the controversial trial of a black man accused of raping a white woman in Dallas, Texas in the 1960s. The title is a version of the archaic American idiomatic phrase \\"free, white, and twenty-one\\", which means \\"beholden to no one\\". ==Plot== The central conflict in this film is whether African-American businessman Ernie Jones (played by Frederick O'Neal) raped Swedish immigrant and civil rights Freedom Rider Greta Mae Hansen (played by Annalena Lund). Jones was the proprietor of the hotel at which Hansen decided to stay during her time in Dallas. The movie is primarily a courtroom drama, with many of the key events portrayed in flashback sequences as Jones and Hansen testify. ==Production== The movie was based on a true story about an English girl who stayed at a motel owned by a black man, Tony Davis, who was a disc jockey. She later claimed Davis raped her and he was arrested. Davis was a friend of Buchanan and agreed to work with him on the film even before the trial finished.Goodsell, Greg, \\"The Weird and Wacky World of Larry Buchanan\\", Filmfax, No. 38 April/May 1993 p 63 Before the film was finished, Buchanan showed an assembly cut to James H.

The movie was successful at the box office and led to a series of collaborations between Buchanan and AIP. ==See also== *List of American films of 1963 ==References== ==External links== * Category:1963 films Category:1963 drama films Category:American films Category:American drama films Category:American International Pictures films Category:American black-and-white films Category:American courtroom films Category:English-language films Category:American exploitation films Category:Films about racism Category:Films set in Texas Category:Films shot in Texas Category:Films about rape Category:Films directed by Larry Buchanan ","title":"Free, White and 21"},{"id":"1281275","text":"Ravens may refer to: * Raven, a species of the genus Corvus ==Sports== * Anderson Ravens, the intercollegiate athletic program of Anderson University in Indiana * Baltimore Ravens, a professional American football franchise * Benedictine Ravens, the official mascot of Benedictine College * Carleton Ravens, the intercollegiate athletic program of Carleton University in Canada * Quincy Ravens, an 1890s minor league baseball team in Illinois * Vancouver Ravens, a team that used to play in the National Lacrosse League ==Other uses== * Ravens (film), a 2017 Swedish thriller film * The Ravens, an American R&B; music band * \\"Ravens\\", a song by Patti Smith from Gone Again * Ravens, a 2009 novel by George Dawes Green ==People with the surname== * Jan Ravens (born 1958), an English actress and impressionist ==See also== * Raven (disambiguation) * Raven's Progressive Matrices, an intelligence test ","title":"Ravens"},{"id":"1281283","text":"Petre S.

In Germany, the brand is considered closely associated to neo-Nazism by the Verfassungschutz of the state of Brandenburg.Scene costumes for right- wing extremists, from the official Web pages of the state of Brandenburg (in German). In German media, the brand is most often discussed in the light of this association. Wearing Thor Steinar clothes is expressly forbidden in the Bundestag, in the Landtage of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern and Saxony and in several football stadiums. ==History== The brand was registered as a trademark by Axel Kopelke in October 2002 and was manufactured by Mediatex GmbH. In March 2009, Mediatex sold the brand to International Brands General Trading, a Dubai-based company. == Controversy == Tønsberg store in Berlin Mitte: The façade shows marks from paint bomb attacks and is protected by acrylic glass Since the inception of Thor Steinar, the company has used two logos. Much of the controversy regarding the clothing label revolves around their first logo, featuring a combination of a *tiwaz rune and a *sowilo rune: the runes were so combined that a part of the logo became very similar to the wolfsangel which is used by some organisations with neo-nazi connections. It was also used by the nazis as exemplified by the insignia of the 2nd SS Panzer Division Das Reich. In addition there is some similarity to the insignia of the Schutzstaffel. The manufacturers of the Thor Steinar brand rejected this interpretation of the former logo. Their second logo is a Gyfu rune, similar in appearance to a Saltire, and has not caused controversy. This rune is known as an apolitical symbol given its historical relationship to pre-Christian mythology. On occasions Thor Steinar shops have been attacked with stones or paint bombs. ===Germany=== In Germany, public display of Nazi-associated symbols, denial of the Holocaust, and glorification of Adolf Hitler are illegal. Despite that, the Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution, which collects domestic intelligence for the government, appraises the number of active participants of the far right movement at around 40,000.Rachel Nolan.

Various authorities and organizations, including Brandenburg Verfassungsschutz,Verfassungsschutz Brandenburg: „Thor Steinar“ scheitert mit neuem Vertriebsweg, 2008Verfassungsschutzbericht Brandenburg 2007 , p. 162 have identified the wearing of Thor Steinar clothes as one of the indications of membership in the far right subculture. Wearing the label is prohibited in the German Bundestag and in the Landtags of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern and Saxony. In addition several football clubs including Tennis Borussia Berlin, Borussia Dortmund, Werder Bremen, Hamburger Sport Verein and Hertha BSC prohibit wearing the label in their stadiums.HSV-Presseservice (September 28, 2007). \\"Thor Steinar\\" und \\"Consdaple\\"-Kleidung in der HSH Nordbank Arena ab sofort verboten. The online retailer Amazon stopped selling the brand in 2009. Despite this, Amazon have since been criticised for employing internal security guards with far-right connections, who wore the same clothing. ===Norway=== Various designs by Thor Steinar have had Norwegian flags and Norwegian names, such as Trondheim, Nordfjord, Nordstrand or Bergen. The official stores selling the clothes are also named after the oldest Norwegian city, Tønsberg. The government filed a complaint against the use of the Norwegian flag in February 2008. The legal complaint however failed and it is unlikely that a second attempt will be made. The Norwegian Embassy, the Norwegian Office for Foreign Affairs were informed by Mediatex – the company behind the Thor Steinar brand – on the 6th of December 2007 that future collections starting and including the spring and summer 2008 collection will no longer use the national symbol of Norway. The company issued a statement in response to the issue. ===Brevik store=== Until 2008, the chain operated a store named Brevik, for the town Brevik in Telemark. In February 2012 Thor Steinar opened a new store in Chemnitz also with the name Brevik. Its similarity to the last name of Anders Behring Breivik (who committed the 22 July 2011 Norway attacks) in conjunction with his far-right politics led to public outcry and local authorities are seeking to have the store closed. The store was eventually renamed.„Brevik“ heißt jetzt „Tonsberg“, Taz.de, 7 March 2012. ==See also== * Nazi chic ==References== ==External links== * Official website Category:Clothing brands of Germany Category:Products introduced in 2002 Category:Neo-Nazism ","title":"Thor Steinar"},{"id":"1281302","text":"Benjamin Bagby (born February 20, 1950) is an American singer, composer, harpist, and performer of medieval music. ==Biography== Born in Evanston, Illinois, Bagby was educated at Oberlin College, Ohio, and the Schola Cantorum in Basel, Bagby founded the ensemble Sequentia with Barbara Thornton in 1977. This group takes an innovative approach to medieval repertoires, especially with respect to their treatment of mode: they rely on the harmonic qualities of their voices to guide them through the different modes. Sequentia has released many fine recordings, most of them on Deutsche Harmonia Mundi. During the 1980s and 1990s, the group specialized in the music of Hildegard of Bingen; many of their most famous recordings are from this period. The group has also performed music written in the 12th century from the musical centers Santiago de Compostela, Aquitaine, and Notre Dame. Benjamin Bagby's work as a composer also contributes to his recreations of the ancient epics, such as Beowulf, the Icelandic Edda and German music from the 10th and 11th centuries on their recent recording Lost Songs of a Rhineland Harper. His version of Beowulf, which he has been touring around the world since the 1990s, is available on DVD (from a show in Copenhagen); his performance on May 9, 2003 at the International Congress on Medieval Studies is documented and discussed in, and was an impetus for, the 2012 anthology Beowulf at Kalamazoo. He gave presentations internationally including at the University of Chicago Laboratory Schools. Bagby (widowed from his longtime collaborator Barbara Thornton) married Croatian chant scholar Katarina Livljanić. == Discography == * Spielmann und Kleriker, Deutsche Harmonia Mundi 1981, EMI 1988 * Hildegard von Bingen: Ordo virtutum, Deutsche Harmonia Mundi 1982, EMI 1987 * Spruchdichtung des 13.

While the machine achieved a measure of popularity, its security was relatively weak; US cryptanalyst William Friedman reported that he solved the device within 2 hours and 41 minutes. In the history of cryptography, the Kryha machine was a device for encryption and decryption, appearing in the early 1920s and used until the 1950s. The machine was the invention of Alexander von Kryha (born 31.10.1891 in Charkow, Russian Empire, committed suicide in Baden-Baden in 1955). During the Second World War, Kryha worked as an officer for the German Wehrmacht. There were several versions; the standard Kryha machine weighed around five kilograms, and was totally mechanical. A scaled down pocket version was introduced later on, termed the \\"Lilliput\\" model. There was also a more bulky electrical version. The machine was used for a time by the German Diplomatic Corps, and was adopted by Marconi in England. ==Operation== The inner ring stepped an irregular number of places with each lever press, changing the encryption in a complex manner. The machine consisted of two concentric rings each containing an alphabet. The inner alphabet was stepped a variable number of places by pushing a lever. In operation, the user would encrypt by finding the plaintext letter on one ring (usually the outer ring), and reading the corresponding letter on the other ring; this was then used as the ciphertext letter. When the lever was pressed, the inner ring would step, causing the relationship between the two alphabets to change. The stepping was irregular and governed by the use of a disk with a number of sectors, each containing a number of teeth. ==Cryptanalysis== The Kryha machine was patented in the US in 1930; the design shows two concentric discs labelled with the alphabet. The security of the machine was evaluated by the mathematician Georg Hamel, who calculated the size of the key space. The US Army was also contacted to see if they would be interested in using the machine, and were persuaded to accept a challenge message to evaluate the security of the device. The challenge message, 1135 characters long, was solved by William Friedman, assisted by Solomon Kullback, Frank Rowlett and Abraham Sinkov, in 2 hours and 41 minutes. ==References== * Alexander von Kryha, \\"Coding machine\\", * Alan G.

In 1960 she graduated from the University of Illinois, where she was a member of the Gamma Phi Beta sorority. After becoming a teacher in the Rockford Public School District, she continued in that job after being elected to public office, serving as a member of the Winnebago County board from 1972 to 1976 before being elected to the Illinois House of Representatives (1977-79), Illinois Senate (1979-80), and U.S. House of Representatives (1981-91). In the U.S. House, she was vice chair of the House Republican Conference. A loyalist to the Reagan Administration, she assisted then-Vice President George H.W. Bush with his preparation for the 1984 Vice Presidential debate against Geraldine Ferraro. Bush touted her as a possible running mate in his 1988 presidential campaign, though he eventually selected Indiana Senator Dan Quayle. Martin's official U.S. Department of Labor portrait, by artist Peter Egeli Martin ran for the U.S. Senate in 1990 against Democratic incumbent Paul Simon. She was considered a formidable challenger, but her campaign floundered — in ads, Martin poked fun at Simon's signature bow tie, but the humorous ad campaign was seen by some as petty and mean-spirited. Simon's popularity proved too much to overcome, and he won with 65 percent of the vote, carrying all but two counties in the state; Edwards County in the southeast and McHenry County outside Chicago, in the heart of the district Martin represented for most of the 1980s. George H.W. Bush tapped Martin to be U.S. Secretary of Labor in his Cabinet when Elizabeth Dole resigned to become president of the American Red Cross. From 1993 to 1999, Martin was a professor at the Kellogg School of Management at Northwestern University, and chair of the Council for the Advancement of Women and advisor to the firm of Deloitte & Touche LLP, for Deloitte's internal human resources and minority advancement matters. Martin also served together with British politician Shirley Williams (Baroness Williams of Crosby) as a U.N. Special Representative to the Former Yugoslavia during the Yugoslav Wars. In 1995, she tested the waters to run for the 1996 Republican presidential nomination, but decided against it after concluding there was insufficient support for her candidacy.

The town has a population of 2,171 (in 2011)Census of Scotland 2011, Table KS101SC – Usually Resident Population, publ. by National Records of Scotland. Web site http://www.scotlandscensus.gov.uk/ retrieved March 2016. See “Standard Outputs”, Table KS101SC, Area type: Civil Parish 1930, which constitutes a 10% increase since 1901 when the population was counted at 1904 persons. The city has a long history of fishing and industrial heritage. Lindores Abbey lies at the eastern edge of the town. ==History== Newburgh's high street in the 19th century. The North British Hotel (later the Tayview Bar; today's number 230) is on the left. Built around 1840, the building is now considered at-riskTayview Bar, 230, High Street, Newburgh - Buildings at Risk Register for Scotland In 1266 Newburgh was granted burgh status by King Alexander III of Scotland, as a burgh belonging to the Abbot of Lindores. In 1600, Newburgh was given to Patrick Leslie, 1st Lord Lindores, son of the Earl of Rothes. In 1631, Newburgh was made a Royal Burgh by King Charles I. Since the Second World War many new houses have been built in Newburgh but the population has only increased by about 10%, partly due to lower average occupancy rates. For some time, Newburgh's industries chiefly consisted of the making of linen, linoleum floorcloth, oilskin fabric and quarrying. There was for many years a net and coble fishery on the Firth Of Tay, mainly for salmon and sea trout. The harbour area was used originally for boatbuilding and the transshipment of cargoes to Perth for vessels of over 200 tons. Raw materials for making linoleum such as cork and linseed oil were also imported at the \\"Factory Pier\\". Aggregates from the Whin Stone quarry were also shipped from Bell's Pier. The main employer from the early 1920s was the linoleum factory known locally as the \\"Tayside\\", operated by the Tayside Floorcloth Company. In the subsequent decades, Newburgh was a prosperous industrial town pulling in workers for the factories from surrounding towns and villages. As linoleum fell out of fashion in the late 1960s and 1970s, attempts were made to produce vinyl flooring and tiles but the factory was no longer profitable. After several changes in ownership it finally closed in 1980 after a large fire destroyed much of the building. Situated to the East of the linoleum factory was another factory known locally as \\"The Oilskin\\". Since before the First World War, its mostly female workers produced oilskin fabric for waterproof clothing such as fishermen's suits and Sou'westers. The factory was taken over by textiles giant Courtaulds in the 1960s but it also closed some years later as demand for the product declined. As of 2020, most industries in Newburgh have closed except for quarrying, which is now the town's biggest single employer. It is mainly a dormitory town with many of those of working age commuting for work to Perth, Dundee, and Glenrothes. Local trades and services include a health centre, nursing home, and supermarket on the site of the former Ship Inn. In 2017 a new whisky distillery opened on the site of Lindores Abbey at the east end of Newburgh. This produces Lindores Abbey whisky on the site where \\"Aqua vitae\\"—an early form of whisky—was produced by the monks. The distillery incorporates an event venue and offers catering and tours of the distillery and Abbey ruins. After many years of lying derelict, the linoleum factory was demolished and cleared and its site is now a recreational waterfront linked to the Mugdrum Park and the Fife Coastal Path. ==Local structures== ===Town house=== The plain Georgian town house, with central tower and spire, was built on the south side of the High Street in 1808. It forms a continuous block with the other houses. The Laing Museum and Library was added to the north side of the street in 1894-96. ===Macduff's Cross=== On high ground, about a mile southwest of the town (at ) stand the remains of Macduff's Cross, of which only the pedestal survives.Macduff's Cross in the Gazetteer for Scotland In legend, it marks the spot where clan Macduff was granted rights of sanctuary and composition for murder, in return for its chief's services against Macbeth. ===Denmylne Castle=== Denmylne Castle Denmylne CastleDenmylne Castle in the Gazetteer for Scotland, about a mile south-east of Newburgh oon the Cupar road, was the home for more than 250 years of the Balfour of Denmylne family, of which the brother, James and Andrew were the most distinguished members. The castle was abandoned in 1772 when the estate was sold and now stands within a 19th- century steading whose construction will have necessitated the removal of the castle's subsidiary buildings. It has been unroofed for at least 200 years and is in a state of disrepair. A lintel dated 1620 has been re-used in one of the steading's building. It is a scheduled ancient monument. ===Lindores Abbey=== Lindores Abbey Lindores Abbey is situated near the Tay, on the East side of the town. Only fragments remain of the Tironensian (reformed Benedictine) abbey, founded about 1190 by David, Earl of Huntingdon, brother of William the Lion. Nonetheless, the ground plan of the whole structure can still be traced. Best preserved are the south-west gateway through the precinct wall, various remains of the wall itself, and part of the east cloister range, including the still-vaulted slype, all built of local red sandstone. The monastic church itself had a single aisle on the north side, with aisled north and south transepts, a central tower and a detached western tower or campanile, similar to Cambuskenneth Abbey. It is a scheduled ancient monument. The monks were noted agriculturists and oversaw famous orchards. Some houses in Newburgh's High Street are said to have orchards with trees descended from the original plantings, although many plots have now been sold and developed for housing. Numerous architectural fragments from the Abbey are built into buildings in the town. Lindores Abbey is also famous as the birthplace of Scotch Whisky owing to its links to Friar John Cor and the Exchequer Rolls of 1494. The Abbey is now home to the McKenzie Smith family and has been for 100 years. The site is being preserved, and saw a new distillery opened in 2017. ===Clatchard Craig Hill fort=== The multi-walled Pictish hill fort of Clatchard Craig once stood to the south of the town.The site record for Clatchard Craig at RCAHMSExcavation Summary by the Society of Antiquaries of Scotland Archeological excavations have shown that the fort was occupied between the sixth and eighth centuries AD, as a site of high status. The fort was destroyed by quarrying during the late twentieth century. ==Natural areas nearby== Lochmill Loch Nearby Lochmill Loch has been dammed to provide the town with a water supply and fishing. At Blackearnside, a forest of alders, to the east of the village, William Wallace defeated Aymer de Valence, 2nd Earl of Pembroke in 1298. Mugdrum Island, opposite the large Mugdrum estate from which it takes its name, (\\"ridge of the pig[s]\\" in Gaelic), is offshore in the Firth dividing it into 'North Deep' and 'South Deep' channels. For many years cattle were ferried over to the island for summer grazing, but this is no longer practised. ==Sport== Newburgh is home to the junior football club Newburgh and an active sailing club. ==Transportation== Newburgh is situated on the Firth of Tay, northwest of Ladybank Junction alongside the Edinburgh to Aberdeen railway line (between Perth and Ladybank). Newburgh railway station served the town from 1848 to 1955. There is an active campaign to reopen the station. Fife Scottish (now Stagecoach in Fife) used to have a bus depot at East Shore Road however this was closed in 1991. No buses are now based in Newburgh although the Perth to Glenrothes and Newburgh to St Andrews via Ladybank station still serve the town. The town lies on the A913. ==Notable people== *Samuel Amess (1826-1898), 25th Mayor of Melbourne. *Robert Hunter (1823-1897), lexicographer and encyclopaedist. *Betty Law (1928-2001), curler. *Robert Lawson (1833-1902), architect. ==References== * ==External links== * Newburgh Bear * Newburgh station campaign Category:Towns in Fife Category:Parishes in Fife ","title":"Newburgh, Fife"},{"id":"1281327","text":"Gheorghe Grigore Cantacuzino Gheorghe Grigore Cantacuzino (22 September 1833 – 22 March 1913), was a Romanian politician and lawyer, one of the leading Conservative Party policymakers.

Her father was a blacksmith. In 1924, she moved to Mülheim and married Wilhelm Langefeld, who died in 1926 of lung disease. In 1928, Langefeld fell pregnant with another man, left him soon afterward, and moved to Düsseldorf, where her son was born that August. Langefeld was unemployed until age 34, when she began to teach domestic economy in an establishment of the city of Neuss. From 1935 onwards, she worked as a guard in a so-called Arbeitsanstalt (working institution) in Brauweiler, which was, in fact, a prison for prostitutes, unemployed and homeless women, and other so called \\"antisocial\\" women, who were then later imprisoned in concentration camps. From 1937 on, Langefeld was a member of the Nazi party. ==Camp work== In March 1938, Langefeld applied for a job as a camp guard in the first SS concentration camp for women in Lichtenburg. After one year, she became the female superintendent of this camp, where she stayed until the camp population was transferred to Ravensbrück in May 1939. She was in charge of the selections in Ravensbrück during the so-called \\"14f13” murder campaign. In March 1942, Langefeld was assigned to build a new women's camp in Auschwitz. There, she selected prisoners for the gas chamber. Rudolf Höss, the Commandant of the Auschwitz concentration camp, recalled his contact with Johanna Langefeld as follows: > The chief female supervisor of the period, Frau Langefeld, was in no way > capable of coping with the situation, yet she refused to accept any > instructions given her by the leader of the protective custody camp. Acting > on my own initiative, I simply put the women's camp under his jurisdiction. During the visit of Heinrich Himmler on 18 July 1942, Langefeld tried to get him to annul this order. In fact, Rudolf Höss admitted after the war that “the Reichsführer SS absolutely refused” his order and that he wished “a women's camp to be commanded by a woman”. Himmler ordered that Langefeld should stay in charge of the women's camp and that in the future, no SS man should enter the female camp. That month, the Auschwitz women's camp was moved to Auschwitz-Birkenau camp three km away. Two weeks later, Langefeld sustained an injury of her meniscus and required a cartilage operation in the Hohenlychen SS Sanatorium near Ravensbrück. During her stay there, she went to see Oswald Pohl, the chief of the SS Economy and Administration Head Office, in Berlin- Lichterfelde, and convinced him to transfer her back to Ravensbrück. Maria Mandl became the new Oberaufseherin of the women's prisoner camp in Auschwitz. Oswald Pohl instructed the Chief of Department D of his SS Economy and Administration Head Office, Richard Glücks, to order that duties of protective custody camp leaders in the Women's Camps be executed thereafter by the female superintendents, the Oberaufseherinnen. Margarete Buber-Neumann, who became Langefeld's prisoner assistant in Ravensbrück, recorded that Langefeld was dismissed for excessive sympathy with Polish prisoners; she was separated from her son, taken under arrest to Breslau, where an SS tribunal prepared a trial against her. Langefeld never went to trial, and was released from her camp duties. She then moved to Munich and started to work for BMW.Albert Langen—Georg Müller, Milena—Kafkas Freundin, Verlag, Munich, 1977 ==Arrest and death== On 20 December 1945, Langefeld was arrested by the U.S. Army, and in September 1946, was extradited to the Polish judiciary preparing a trial in Kraków against SS personnel in Auschwitz. On 23 December 1946, she escaped from prison. Given her prior relatively positive treatment of inmates in this German Nazi concentration camp located on occupied Polish soil, the escape was assisted by Polish staff of the prison where she was held.Langefeld escape info, wysokieobcasy.pl; accessed 2 September 2017. After the escape she hid in a convent, working in a private home. Sometime around 1957, she returned illegally to live with her sister in Munich. She died in Augsburg, Germany on 26 January 1974, aged 73. ==Further reading== *Johannes Schwartz, Das Selbstverständnis Johanna Langefelds als SS-Oberaufseherin, in: Ulrich Fritz, Silvija Kavčič, Nicole Warmbold (ed.): Tatort KZ, Neue Beiträge zur Geschichte der Konzentrationslager, Ulm 2003, pp. 71–95. *Johannes Schwartz, Geschlechterspezifischer Eigensinn von NS-Täterinnen am Beispiel der KZ- Oberaufseherin Johanna Langefeld, in: Viola Schubert-Lehnhardt (ed.),Frauen als Täterinnen im Nationalsozialismus, Protokollband der Fachtagung vom 17.-18.

He was: Doctor of Medicine in Paris, Plenipotentiary Minister in the United States (1917–1918), Minister of Public Works and Communications, of the Instruction and Cults several times, Prime Minister after the death of I.G. Duca, professor and director of the surgical clinic at the Faculty of Medicine in Bucharest.Dr. Constantin Angelescu (1869–1947), doctor în Medicină la Paris, ministru plenipotenţiar în S.U.A. (1917–1918), ministru al Lucrărilor Publice şi al Comunicaţiilor, al Instrucţiunii şi Cultelor de mai multe ori, prim-ministru după moartea lui I.G. Duca; profesor şi director al clinicii chirurgicale de la Facultatea de Medicină din București. Emanoil Hagi-Mosco, Mihai Sorin Rădulescu, București, Editura Fundației Culturale Române, 1995 – 326 p., p. 169 ==Early years== Constantin Angelescu was born in 1869 in the family of Dumitru Angelescu (father), a merchant from Craiova, and of Theodore (mother), maiden name Geblescu, whose family was related to the Craiovești family. After the years of education at Obedeanu primary school and at Carol I National College, he studied medicine in Paris. In 1897, in France, he has had his specialization in surgery. He came back to the country, worked in surgery department of Brincovenesc Hospital, then, at Philanthropy, becoming professor (1903) and director of the University of Surgery Clinic. By marrying Virginia Constantinescu-Monteoru, the daughter of millionaire Grigore Monteoru, he became the owner of the Sărata Monteoru spas, some of petroleum land and real estate in the Buzău area. ==Political activity== Dr. Angelescu has started his political career within the National Liberal Party. In 1901, Dr. Angelescu became an MP and senator, and later, the minister of public works (1914–1916) and minister of public guidance. As Minister of Public Works in the Government of Ion I.C. Brătianu, was especially charged with the organization of the Romanian military service, with Romania's entry into the global conflagration. The supporter for the accession to the Triple Entente caused the annoyance of the prime minister who had dismissed him during the establishing of the national union coalition. In 1917, during the evacuation of the government and king to Iasi, Angelescu lived for a short time in Odessa, and then returned to the country. In January – March 1918 he was appointed the Romania's first plenipotentiary minister in Washington. Then in 1918, he was the Deputy Chairman of the National Council for the Romanian Unity established by Take Ionescu in Paris. Later he was the Minister of Public Guidance in Governments chaired by Ion I.C. Bratianu, and then by I. Duca, during which he made important reforms of modernizing education in Romania, as a continuation of those launched in the previous century and in the beginning of the 20th century by his mentor and uncle, within the alliance, Spiru Haret . His motto was: \\"School as much as possible! School as good as possible!\\" The constitutional text on education, as it was formulated on March 29, 1923 was based on the principles of freedom of education, compulsory primary education and free primary education. He contributed to the adoption of the Law on the state primary education and of the normal-primary education of June 26, 1924, to the uniformity of the education system in Romania. In 1925, he established baccalaureate examinations. Over time, relations with Ion I.C. Bratianu improved, and Dr. Angelescu was next to him in the moments after the assassination attempt in 1904 and in the last hours of his life in 1927, when he closely supervised the medical-surgical treatment he had given. After the assassination of Prime Minister Ion G. Duca, he was for four days interim prime minister, forced to give way to Gheorghe Tătărescu. He eventually accepted to be the minister of national education in the cabinet headed by Tatarescu. In 1938–1940, during the royal dictatorship of Carol II of Romania, Dr. Angelescu served as State Secretary (in the government chaired by Patriarch Miron of Romania) and then a royal counselor. He is one of the members of the Crown Council chaired by Carol II who voted for the cession of Bessarabia and northern Bucovina to the Soviet Union following the ultimatum given to Romania on June 26, 1940. Together with Dinu Brătianu, he was against the Second Vienna Award. Over 24 years, Dr. Constantin Angelescu was the president of the Romanian Athenaeum (1923–1947), and between 1941–1947 he was president of the Cultural League. On 24 May 1934 he was elected honorary member of the Romanian Academy. He was a founding member of the Romanian Academy of Sciences. According to some sources, in 1943, together with Dr. Nicolae Lupu, he proposed to re-establish the right of the Jews to free practice, as it had been taken by the Antisemitism legislation of 1940. In September 1948 he died at the French hospital Vincent de Paul in Bucharest. Death freed him from arrest and detention in communist prisons. ==The family== He had three daughters: Elizabeth, Ioana and Elena, and three sons: Grigore, Alexander and Constantine. His daughter, Elisabeth Angelescu, married mathematician Alexandru Ghika – the son of Grigore Ghika – a physicist. His daughter Ioana (Jeanne) Angelescu married Stefan Ghika – Budesti, geologist, correspondent member of the Romanian Academy, the son of the architect Nicolae Ghika Budesti. And his third daughter Elena, was married with diplomat George Valimarescu. His son, Constantin C. Angelescu Monteoru (1905–2000), was a professor of constitutional law, dean of the law faculty at the University of Iasi. In the years of Stalinist repression, he was deported to the Danube- Black Sea Canal. His daughter Ioana Angelescu, employed by Radio Free Europe, married to George Angelescu, musician. ==In memoriam== * The interdepartamental hospital \\"Al Sahia\\" of Bucharest has been renamed into \\"Dr. Constantin Angelescu\\". * A theoretical high school in Bucharest and the college in Buzău were named in honor of Constantin Angelescu. *His family set up a foundation called the Romanian School of Constantin Angelescu == References == Category:1869 births Category:1948 deaths Category:People from Craiova Category:National Liberal Party (Romania, 1875) politicians Category:Prime Ministers of Romania Category:Romanian Ministers of Communications Category:Romanian Ministers of Culture Category:Romanian Ministers of Education Category:Romanian Ministers of Public Works Category:Members of the Chamber of Deputies (Romania) Category:Members of the Senate of Romania Category:Governors of the National Bank of Romania Category:Ambassadors of Romania to the United States Category:Honorary members of the Romanian Academy Category:Members of the Romanian Academy of Sciences ","title":"Constantin Angelescu"},{"id":"1281344","text":"Myeongjong may refer to: * Myeongjong of Goryeo (r. 1170-1197) * Myeongjong of Joseon (r. 1545-1567) ==See also== * Mingzong (disambiguation) Category:Temple name disambiguation pages ","title":"Myeongjong"},{"id":"1281349","text":"Adelard (also spelled Adelhard, Adalhard or Adalard) may refer to: ==People in the Middle Ages== *Adelard, father of the Frankish saint Herlindis of Maaseik (died 745) *Adalard of Corbie (751–827), Frankish abbot *Adelard of Spoleto (died 824), Italian nobleman *Adalard the Seneschal, 9th-century Frankish nobleman *Adalhard of Metz (c. 840–890), Frankish nobleman *Adalard of Paris (c. 830–890), Frankish nobleman *Adalhard von Babenberg (died 903), Frankish nobleman *Adelard of Ghent, 11th-century biographer of Saint Dunstan *Adelard of Bath, 12th century English scholar ==Canadians since the 19th century== *Adélard Godbout (1892–1956), Canadian politician *Adélard Turgeon (1863–1930), Canadian lawyer and politician *Adélard Langevin (1855–1915), Canadian archbishop and priest *Louis-Adélard Senécal (1829–1889), Canadian businessman and politician *Adélard Bellemare (1871-1933), Canadian politician *Adélard Lafrance (1912–1995), Canadian ice hockey player *Adélard Laurendeau (1883-1968), Canadian politician *Joseph Adélard Descarries, (1853-1927), Canadian lawyer and politician *Joseph Adélard Dubeau (1873–1937), Canadian politician *Marc-Adélard Tremblay (born 1922), Canadian anthropologist *Charles Ignace Adélard Gill (1871-1918), Canadian artist ==Places== *Adelard, Ontario ==See also== *Adelardo (disambiguation) ","title":"Adelard"},{"id":"1281351","text":"Liberian may refer to: * Something of, from, or related to Liberia, a country on the west coast of Africa * A person from Liberia, or of Liberian descent, see Demographics of Liberia **Americo-Liberians * Liberian culture * Liberian cuisine * Liberian English == See also == * *List of Liberians *Languages of Liberia Category:Language and nationality disambiguation pages ","title":"Liberian"},{"id":"1281365","text":"Waters is a surname, derived from \\"Wat\\", or \\"Wa'ter\\", an old pronunciation of Gaultier or Walter, and similarly derived from the surname Watson (\\"Wat's son\\").J.O.

A tiple player is called a tiplista. The first mention of the tiple comes from musicologist Pablo Minguet e Irol in 1752. Although many variations of the instrument exist, the tiple is mostly associated with Colombia, and is considered the national instrument. ==Tiple family== ===Colombian tiple=== The Colombian tiple (in Spanish: tiple) is an instrument of the guitar family, similar in appearance although slightly smaller (about 18%) than a standard classical guitar. The typical fretboard scale is about 530 mm (just under 21 inches), and the neck joins the body at the 12th fret. There are 12 strings, grouped in four tripled courses. Traditional tuning from lowest to highest course is C E A D, although many modern players tune the instrument like the upper four strings of the modern guitar: D G B E. The outer two strings of each of the three lowest triple courses is tuned an octave higher than the middle string in the course (giving C4 C3 C4 • E4 E3 E4 • A4 A3 A4 • D4 D4 D4 in traditional tuning, or D4 D3 D4 • G4 G3 G4 • B4 B3 B4 • E4 E4 E4 in modern tuning). An 18 or 19 fret fingerboard give the tiple Colombiano a range of about 2-2/3 octaves, from C3 - G#5 (or A5). The tiple is used for many traditional Colombian music including bambucos and pasillos. It serves both as an accompanying instrument and for soloing.Zuluanga, David Puerta; Los Caminos del Tiple [The Evolution of the Tiple]; DamelPublishers; Bogota, Colombia: 1988. 208pp. One of the main composers of tiple music is Pacho Benavides. David Pelham says of the Colombian tiple: \\"The tiple is a Colombian adaptation of the Renaissance Spanish vihuela brought to the New World in the 16th century by the Spanish conquistadors. At the end of the 19th century, it evolved to its present shape. Its twelve strings are arranged in four groups of three: the first group consists of three steel strings tuned to E, the second, third and fourth groups have a copper string in the middle of two steel strings. The central ones are tuned one octave lower than the surrounding strings of the group. This arrangement produces the set of harmonics that gives the instrument its unique voice.Morales, Abadia; Instrumentos Musicales del Folklore Colombiano [Musical Instruments of Colombian Folklore]; Banco Popular; Bogota, Colombia: 1991. Outside of Colombia the \\"copper\\" strings are more often standard brass or bronze wound steel guitar strings. Another variant, the tiple Colombiano requinto, is often simply called tiple requinto. This instrument is about 10-15% smaller than the tiple Colombiano, and the central octave strings of the larger instrument are tuned in unisions, giving either a C4 C4 C4 • E4 E4 E4 • A4 A4 A4 • D4 D4 D4 tuning (traditional), or a D4 D4 D4 • G4 G4 G4 • B4 B4 B4 • E4 E4 E4 tuning (modern). The tiple requinto is sometimes made in more of a violin or \\"hourglass\\" shape, than a guitar shape. These differences give it a generally thinner, higher-pitched sound than the tiple Colombiano, even though most of its tuning is in the same range as the larger instrument.Davison, Harry C.; Diccionario Folklorico de Colombia: Musica, Instrumentos y Danza [Dictionary of Folklore in Colombia: Music, Instruments, and Dance]; Banco de Republica; Bogoto, Colombia: 1970. ===Puerto Rican tiples=== The tiple is the smallest of the three string instruments of Puerto Rico that make up the orquesta jibara (i.e., the Cuatro, the tiple and the Bordonua). According to investigations made by Jose Reyes Zamora, the tiple in Puerto Rico dates back to the 18th century. It is believed to have evolved from the Spanish guitarrillo. There was never a standard for the tiple and as a result there are many variations throughout the island of Puerto Rico. Most tiples have four or five strings and most tiple requintos have three strings. Some tiples have as many as 6 strings and as few as a single string, though these types are rare. The main types of tiple in Puerto Rico are: *Tiple requinto de la montaña - a tiny version of the tiple doliente with only three strings. It is usually smaller than 12 inches. *Tiple requinto costanero - a smaller version of the tiplón with only three strings. It is usually about 15 inches in length. *Tiple doliente - this tiple has 5 single strings and is the most common used today. It is usually about 15 inches in length. *Tiplón or tiple con macho - a larger version of the tiple with a fifth string peg like an American banjo, located on its neck. It is usually about 21 inches in length. *Tiple grande de Ponce - the largest version (about 21 inches in length) with 5 strings. It is considered a link between tiples and bordonuas. It is sometimes also called \\"bordonua chiquita\\" (small bordonua). Puerto Rican Tiple Doliente The tiple that is now most often played in Puerto Rico is the tiple doliente. It has recently acquired a more or less fixed body shape narrowing at the top and having 5 metal strings (see the accompanying photo). It is usually made like the cuatro, so either constructed like a guitar, or from one piece of wood hollowed out. The bottom half of the body is rounded like a guitar, however the top half is square, or triangular. All other features (like neck and bridge) resemble the construction of a normal Spanish guitar. The peghead has tuning machines either from the side or from the back. The strings of the tiple doliente are tuned: E3 A3 D4 G4 C5. ===Tiple Venezolano=== This tiple from Venezuela, looks like a smaller version of the Colombian Tiple. It has 4 sets of triple strings and is also known as the Guitarro, Guitarro Segundo, and the Segunda Guitarra. There is another tiple played in Venezuela but is a member of the Venezuelan Cuatro family of instruments, also called a tiple and known as the Cinco y Medio or Cinco. It is very much like the Cuatro but it has 5 strings instead of four. ===Tiple de Menorca=== On the Spanish Balearic island of Menorca, a tiple is an instrument with five single nylon strings. ===Tiple Cubano=== A tiple Cubano, has five doubled courses of strings, ten in total. ===Tiple de Santo Domingo=== The tiple de Santo Domingo, also known as tiple Dominicano or tiple, also has five doubled courses, for ten in total. The strings are steel. It is tuned C4, F4, A#4, D5, G5. All of the courses are tuned in unison. ===Tiple Peruano=== Peru has a tiple with four single or doubled steel strings. It is tuned A3, E4, B4, F#5. ===Tiples in Uruguay and Argentina=== In Uruguay and Argentina, sometimes the requinto guitar is called a tiple. ==Other versions== ===U.S. / N. American / Martin tiple=== The North American tiple was designed in 1919 by the Pennsylvania guitar company C.F. Martin & Co. for the William J. Smith Co. in New York and was most popular through the 1920s-1940s ukulele craze. This tiple is close in length to a tenor ukulele, but with a deeper body. Unlike a ukulele, it has ten steel strings in four mixed-octave courses of 2, 3, 3, and 2 strings. Manufactured for a half century, the Martin tiple was used in jazz, blues and old-time country bands, and as a louder-volume ukulele. It was tuned similarly to a D-tuned ukulele: :A4 A3 • D4 D3 D4 • F#4 F#3 F#4 • B3 B3 (wound octave-lower strings are A3, D3, and F#3). A more recent manufacturer of similar instruments recommends tuning a full tone lower, as mentioned below, similar to contemporary ukuleles. Martin produced mahogany and rosewood bodied tiples, following a model-identification system similar to its guitars: T-15 and T-17, mahogany top, back and sides; T-18, spruce top, mahogany back and sides; T-28, spruce top, rosewood back and sides; T-45, spruce top, rosewood back and sides, fancy abalone inlay. Martin's tiple production continued off-and-on into the 1970s. Martin tiple Similar instruments were made by Regal, Harmony, Lyon & Healy, Oscar Schmidt, D'Angelico and other companies during the early decades of Martin production. In the 21st century, the Ohana ukulele company began manufacturing an all-mahogany tiple similar to the Martin, but calling it \\"a vintage ukulele inspired by the Columbian Tiple.\\" The company recommended tuning with the lowest note a C. (G3 G4 – C4 C3 C4 – E4 E3 E4 – A4 A4) In addition to its original ukulele-style tuning (above), the American tiple sometimes has been tuned like the upper four courses of the guitar, presumably with special sets of strings. ;Martin tiple dimensions: :Overall length: ″ :Body length: ″ :Bout width, upper: ″ :Bout width, lower: ″ :Body depth, upper: ″ :Body depth, lower: ″ :Neck width at nut: ″ :Fingerboard width: ″ at 12th fret :Sound hole diameter: ″ :Scale length: 17″ **North American tiple performers** : *Four Virginians *Cats and the Fiddle *Spirits of Rhythm *Timmie Rogers *Ed Askew ===Electric tiples=== Electric tiples usually follow either the Colombian (12-string) or \\"Martin\\" (10-string) tuning and string arrangement. ==Related instruments== ===Spanish tiples=== In Spain there are similar instruments. This tiny guitar has four strings and is found in Menorca. Other types of small guitars in Spain are the guitarra, guitarro and guitarrico. ===Portuguese tiples=== Related Portuguese instruments are the cavaquinho or braguinha and the rajâo. The braguinha and the rajâo taken to Hawai'i by Portuguese immigrants from Madeira are the forerunners of the ukulele. ===Canary Island timple=== Timple seen from front Timple seen from side Migrating from North Africa in the 16th century to the Canary Islands and then on to Murcia, the timple has become the traditional instrument of the Canaries. In La Palma and in the north of the island of Tenerife some players omit the fifth string, tuning the timple like a ukulele, though nowadays this is often seen as non-standard by players in other regions where five strings are preferred. The popular tiple tuning is GCEAD. ==Other instruments== The word \\"tiple\\" basically means \\"treble\\" or \\"high pitched\\", and has been used occasionally for the names of other instruments not directly members of the tiple-family proper. One such is the Marxochime Hawaiian tiple, which bears no resemblance to the traditional tiples, but looks like (and is) a variety of zither. It is played with a combination of plucking, strumming, and playing with a slide similar to a lap steel guitar. The instrument is one of many zither variants marketed within the United States during the early 20th century, of which only the autoharp ever achieved lasting popularity. The instrument, also known as the \\"Tremola\\", carries the \\"Hawaiian tiple\\" name solely for marketing purposes, as interest in Hawaiian music and culture was high in mainland America during the period when the instrument was marketed. ==Resources and sources== Colombian tiple: *Puerta's tremendous tiple touch *Colombian luthier Alberto Paredes *Paredes, A., Mottola, R.M. “Construction of the Colombian Tiple”, American Lutherie #90, 2007, p. 40\\\\.

Retrieved on August 27, 2007 The early chiefs of Clan MacDuff were the original Earls of Fife, although this title went to the Stewarts of Albany in the late fourteenth century. The title returned to the MacDuff chief when William Duff was made Earl Fife in 1759. His descendant Alexander Duff was made Duke of Fife in 1889. ==History== ===Origins of the clan=== Macduff's Castle, in Fife, Scotland. The site is associated with the MacDuff Earls of Fife The Clan Duff claims descent from the original Royal Scoto-Pictish line of which Queen Gruoch of Scotland, wife of Macbeth, King of Scotland was the senior representative. After the death of MacBeth, Malcolm III of Scotland seized the Crown and his son, Aedh, married the daughter of Queen Gruoch. Aedh was created Earl of Fife and abbot of Abernethy. The early chiefs of Clan MacDuff were the Earls of Fife. Sir Iain Moncreiffe wrote that the Clan MacDuff was the premier clan among the Scottish Gaels. Today, the Earls of Wemyss are thought to be the descendants in the male line of Gille Míchéil, Earl of Fife, thought to be one of the first Clan MacDuff chiefs. Gille-michael MacDuff was one of the witnesses to the great charter of David I of Scotland to Dunfermline Abbey. round tower of Abernethy, built for the Celtic abbey of which a branch of Clan MacDuff were hereditary Abbots. ===14th and 15th centuries=== In 1306 during the Wars of Scottish Independence, Duncan MacDuff, Earl of Fife was as a minor, held by Edward I of England at the coronation of Robert the Bruce as his ward while Duncan's sister, Isabella MacDuff, placed the golden circlet upon King Robert's head. As a result, when she fell into the hands of King Edward's army, she was imprisoned in a cage which was suspended from the walls of Berwick Castle. Duncan MacDuff later married Mary, the niece of King Edward, and threw in his lot against the Bruce. However, he was captured and imprisoned in Kildrummy Castle where he died in 1336. The Earldom later fell into the hands of Robert Stewart, Duke of Albany, however, although the MacDuff family lost their rank, they continued to prosper. In 1384, the earl of Fife was described as capitalis legis de Clenmcduffe, meaning chief of the law of Clan MacDuff.Grant, Alexander & Stringer, Keith J. (1998). Medieval Scotland: Crown, Lordship and Community. pp. 21 - 22. . In 1404, David Duff received a charter from Robert III of Scotland for lands in Banffshire. ===17th, 18th and 19th centuries=== In 1626, John Duff sold the lands in Bannfshire which his ancestor had acquired in 1404. The title of The Fife returned with William Duff, 1st Earl Fife and Viscount Macduff in 1759. The 1st Earl of Fife's cousin, Captain Robert Duff of the Royal Navy supported the British-Hanoverian Government during the Jacobite rising of 1745 and was involved in the Skirmish of Arisaig.Duffy, Christopher.

Alexander Duff, 6th Earl of Fife married Louise, Princess Royal, eldest daughter of Edward VII. Alexander was advanced to the rank of Duke of Fife in July 1889. ===20th and 21st centuries=== With the death of the 1st Duke of Fife, the Clan MacDuff had its last Chief. As of 2014, the representative that should eventually succeed to its Headship is, according to thepeerage.com, James Richard Valentine Duff, born on 19 October 1941. ==Law of Clan MacDuff== Clan Macduff was the first Scottish clan to be recognized as a clan by the Scottish Parliament, by legislation dated November 1384.The Records of the Parliaments of Scotland to 1707 (RPS) rps.ac.uk. Retrieved 30 April 2013. The Earl of Fife and the Abbot of Abernethy were both \\"Capitals of Law of the Clan MacDuff\\". The law protected all murderers within ninth degree of kin to the Earl of Fife, as they could claim sanctuary at the Cross of MacDuff near Abernethy, and could find remission by paying compensation to the victim's family.Moncreiffe of that Ilk, p.135-136. The chiefs of the clan had the right to enthrone the King on the Stone of Scone. When the Stone of Scone was taken to England by Edward I of England, Robert I of Scotland had himself crowned King of Scots a second time, in order to be crowned by a member of clan MacDuff, in that case the Earl of Fife's sister. In 1425, the last Earl of Fife, Murdoch Stewart, Duke of Albany, was beheaded. The Clan MacDuff's hereditary right of bearing the Crown of Scotland then passed to the Lord Abernethy. The current Lord Abernethy, who is consequently bearer of the Scottish Crown, is Alexander Douglas-Hamilton, 16th Duke of Hamilton. \\"Clan Makduffe\\" tartan as published in 1842 in the Vestiarium Scoticum. ==Clan Castles== *Macduff's Castle in East Wemyss, Fife is now a ruinous castle that was once held by the MacDuff Earls of Fife.

His economic thinking was highly critical of classical economists, especially of David Ricardo. His magnum opus was Economics of the Present and the Future (1848). The basic aim of this work was to establish laws of economic development. Hildebrand also stated that economic development was linear not cyclical. He supported socialist theory on the basis of religion, basic morals, and his beliefs of the negative effect of property on economic behavior. Like many other representatives of the German Historical School such as Friedrich List, Karl Knies, and Karl Bücher, Hildebrand was a political liberal who advocated liberal institutions and a constitutional state, and participated in the Frankfurt Parliament of 1848. An economics professor in Marburg, he was accused of high treason with respect to the turmoil of 1848 and condemned to death. He avoided the execution of this sentence by escaping to Switzerland, where he served as an associate professor at the University of Zurich. Together with Alfred Escher he was a co-founder and CEO of the Swiss Northeastern Railway and also was the founder of the Swiss National Bureau Federal Statistical Office. Hildebrand also created and directed the publication 'Jahrbücher für Nationalökonomie und Statistik'; for his contributions he was granted honorary Swiss citizenship. He became a professor at the University of Bern. Hildebrand returned then to Germany, where he was a professor at the University of Jena. His son was the artist and sculptor Adolf von Hildebrand.

Following a takeover by the HMV Group in 2006, the chain was merged into the Waterstone's brand. ==History== Ottakar's renamed its stores for the Harry Potter launch. James Heneage established the Ottakar's chain in 1987, taking inspiration from The Adventures of Tintin book King Ottokar's Sceptre. He saw a lucrative market in small towns that lacked a Waterstones branch and opened stores in Loughborough, Brighton, Banbury, Salisbury and Trowbridge. A number of Ottakar's stores drew on the Tintin connection and had walls painted with scenes from the series. The Ottakar store in Bromley, London had a large rocket taken from the Tintin novels so that children could play inside it. Above the rocket was a cartoon picture of the night sky to add to the effect. The company was listed on the London Stock Exchange in 1998 and expanded rapidly, making a number of acquisitions including small bookstores in the West Country, eight branches of James Thin Booksellers in 2002, and twenty-four branches of Hammicks Bookshops Ltd, a company with 35 years of bookselling history, in April 2003. By mid-2006, the chain had shops in 141 locations throughout the United Kingdom. In an attempt to compete with online booksellers, Ottakar's established an online ordering service. After turning a loss, the service was withdrawn in 2001, but by 2006, the company had hoped to relaunch their internet arm before the takeover by HMV. Ottakar's was well known in the book trade for the exceptionally high morale and commitment of its staff. Damien Horner, from the advertising agency Mustoes commented that Ottakar's \\"was more like a religious cult than a business\\". Ottakar's was also very popular with book buyers. A customer survey in 2004 revealed that many people believed that their local branch of Ottakar's was an independent bookshop. This was viewed as a vindication of the Ottakar's head office policy of giving branches as much local autonomy as possible. However, some suggested that Ottakar's had a weak national brand, which was vulnerable to changing market conditions. ===Children's Book Prize=== The Ottakar's Children's Book Prize was an annual award given to a work of children's literature published during the previous year. First awarded in 2005, the purpose of the prize was \\"to uncover hidden talent in children's writing\\" and was therefore open only to authors who have published no more than three books. When all Ottakar's stores were rebranded as Waterstone's following the HMV Group takeover of the Ottakar's chain, the prize also changed its name to become the Waterstone's Children's Book Prize. ==Takeover== In August 2005, amid rumours of a forthcoming takeover attempt by HMV Group plc, the owners of Ottakar's (founders James Heneage and Philip Dunne backed by private equity firm Phoenix Equity Partners) made a management buyout offer which was initially accepted by Ottakar's independent directors, some of whom had only recently joined the company. When a higher offer was made by HMV, the owners switched their recommendation to accept the HMV bid. The Office of Fair Trading was due to decide whether to approve the buyout of Ottakar's by Waterstone's on 2 December 2005. On 6 December the OFT referred the case to the Competition Commission. The Competition Commission provisionally cleared HMV Group, through Waterstone's, for takeover of the Ottakar's group on 30 March 2006. The Commission stated that the takeover would \\"not result in a substantial lessening of competition\\", and was \\"not likely to affect book prices, range of titles offered or quality of service.\\" Through extensive research they also found that \\"contrary to widespread perception, Waterstone's, like Ottakar's, operates a book-buying system which mixes central and local input on stock selection.\\" Forbes: UK Competition Commission gives green light to HMV takeover of Ottakar's Waterstone's then announced that it had successfully negotiated a takeover of Ottakar's on 31 May 2006. HMV chief executive Alan Giles said in a statement: \\"A combined Waterstone's and Ottakar's business will create an exciting, quality bookseller, able to respond better to the increasingly competitive pressures of the retail market.\\" Ottakar's chairman Philip Dunne said: \\"Over the last year the book market has undergone a significant change with new levels of competition from the supermarkets and online retailers impacting all specialist booksellers and in particular those with insufficient scale to compete on equal terms.\\" The Telegraph: Ottakar's falls to Waterstone By Christmas 2006, all stores were converted, meaning the end of Ottakar's. ==See also== * Books in the United Kingdom ==References== ==External links== *Ottakar's official site (Archived from the original on 4 July 2006) *Office of Fair Trading Category:Companies formerly listed on the London Stock Exchange Category:Defunct retail companies of the United Kingdom Category:Retail companies disestablished in 2006 Category:Retail companies established in 1987 Category:Bookshops of the United Kingdom Category:1987 establishments in the United Kingdom Category:2006 disestablishments in the United Kingdom ","title":"Ottakar's"},{"id":"1281440","text":"Santa Luzia (Portuguese for Saint Lucy) is a parish in the municipality of Angra do Heroísmo on the island of Terceira, in the Azores.

Because many signals have a very wide dynamic range, PSNR is usually expressed in terms of the logarithmic decibel scale. == Definition == PSNR is most easily defined via the mean squared error (MSE). Given a noise-free m×n monochrome image I and its noisy approximation K, MSE is defined as: :\\\\mathit{MSE} = \\\\frac{1}{m\\\\,n}\\\\sum_{i=0}^{m-1}\\\\sum_{j=0}^{n-1} [I(i,j) - K(i,j)]^2 The PSNR (in dB) is defined as: :\\\\begin{align}\\\\mathit{PSNR} &= 10 \\\\cdot \\\\log_{10} \\\\left( \\\\frac{\\\\mathit{MAX}_I^2}{\\\\mathit{MSE}} \\\\right)\\\\\\\\\\\\ &= 20 \\\\cdot \\\\log_{10} \\\\left( \\\\frac{\\\\mathit{MAX}_I}{\\\\sqrt{\\\\mathit{MSE}}} \\\\right)\\\\\\\\\\\\ &= 20 \\\\cdot \\\\log_{10} \\\\left( {\\\\mathit{MAX}_I} \\\\right) - 10 \\\\cdot \\\\log_{10} \\\\left( {{\\\\mathit{MSE}}} \\\\right)\\\\end{align} Here, MAXI is the maximum possible pixel value of the image. When the pixels are represented using 8 bits per sample, this is 255. More generally, when samples are represented using linear PCM with B bits per sample, MAXI is 2B−1. === Application in color images === For color images with three RGB values per pixel, the definition of PSNR is the same except the MSE is the sum over all squared value differences (now for each color, i.e. three times as many differences as in a monochrome image) divided by image size and by three. Alternately, for color images the image is converted to a different color space and PSNR is reported against each channel of that color space, e.g., YCbCr or HSL. == Quality estimation with PSNR == PSNR is most commonly used to measure the quality of reconstruction of lossy compression codecs (e.g., for image compression). The signal in this case is the original data, and the noise is the error introduced by compression. When comparing compression codecs, PSNR is an approximation to human perception of reconstruction quality. Typical values for the PSNR in lossy image and video compression are between 30 and 50 dB, provided the bit depth is 8 bits, where higher is better. For 16-bit data typical values for the PSNR are between 60 and 80 dB. Acceptable values for wireless transmission quality loss are considered to be about 20 dB to 25 dB.Thomos, N., Boulgouris, N. V., & Strintzis, M. G. (2006, January). Optimized Transmission of JPEG2000 Streams Over Wireless Channels. IEEE Transactions on Image Processing , 15 (1).Xiangjun, L., & Jianfei, C. Robust transmission of JPEG2000 encoded images over packet loss channels. ICME 2007 (pp. 947-950). School of Computer Engineering, Nanyang Technological University. In the absence of noise, the two images I and K are identical, and thus the MSE is zero. In this case the PSNR is infinite (or undefined, see Division by zero). == Performance comparison == Although a higher PSNR generally indicates that the reconstruction is of higher quality, in some cases it may not. One has to be extremely careful with the range of validity of this metric; it is only conclusively valid when it is used to compare results from the same codec (or codec type) and same content.MIT.edu Generally, PSNR has been shown to perform poorly compared to other quality metrics when it comes to estimating the quality of images and particularly videos as perceived by humans. == Variants == PSNR-HVSEgiazarian, Karen, Jaakko Astola, Nikolay Ponomarenko, Vladimir Lukin, Federica Battisti, and Marco Carli (2006). \\"New full-reference quality metrics based on HVS.\\" In Proceedings of the Second International Workshop on Video Processing and Quality Metrics, vol. 4. is an extension of PSNR that incorporates properties of the human visual system such as contrast perception. PSNR-HVS-M improves on PSNR-HVS by additionally taking into account visual masking. In a 2007 study, it delivered better approximations of human visual quality judgements than PSNR and SSIM by large margin. It was also shown to have a distinct advantage over DCTune and PSNR-HVS. ==See also== * Data compression ratio * Perceptual Evaluation of Video Quality (PEVQ) * Signal-to-noise ratio * Structural similarity (SSIM) index * Subjective video quality * Video quality ==References== Category:Image compression Category:Noise (graphics) Category:Film and video technology Category:Digital television Category:Engineering ratios vi:PSNR ","title":"Peak signal-to-noise ratio"},{"id":"1281456","text":"Town class may refer to: * Town Class (sailboat), a class of American dory * , a group of 21 British and Australian light cruisers * , a group of 10 British light cruisers * , a group of American destroyers transferred to other navies ==See also== * City class (disambiguation) * Province class (disambiguation) ","title":"Town class"},{"id":"1281464","text":"Umberto is a masculine Italian given name.

His father was a Communist Party veteran from Ploiești, who in the early 1920s supported the transformation of the Socialist Party into the Romanian Communist Party (PCR). Mănescu joined the PCR in 1938, while he was a student at the Academy of Economic Studies in Bucharest. In 1944, after King Michael's Coup, he worked together with Nicolae Ceaușescu, his future brother-in-law, in the Union of Communist Youth.

The first use of the word dualism is attributed to him, in 1700.HYDE, Thomas. Veterum Persarum et Parthorum et Medorum Religionis Historia. Editio Secunda, MDCCLX. ==Life== He was born at Billingsley, near Bridgnorth in Shropshire, on 29 June 1636. He inherited his taste for linguistic studies, and received his first lessons in some of the Eastern tongues, from his father, who was rector of the parish. Hyde was educated at Eton College, and in his sixteenth year entered King's College, Cambridge. There, under Abraham Wheelock, professor of Arabic, he made rapid progress in Oriental languages, so that, after only one year of residence, he was invited to London to assist Brian Walton in his edition of the Polyglott Bible. Besides correcting the Arabic, Persic and Syriac texts for that work, Hyde transcribed into Persic characters the Persian translation of the Pentateuch, which had been printed in Hebrew letters at Constantinople in 1546. To this work, which Archbishop Ussher had thought well-nigh impossible even for a native of Persia, Hyde appended the Latin version which accompanies it in the Polyglott. In 1658 he was chosen Hebrew reader at Queen's College, Oxford, and in 1659, in consideration of his erudition in Oriental tongues, he was admitted to the degree of M.A.Alumni Oxonienses 1500-1714, Horrobin-Hyte In the same year he was appointed under- keeper of the Bodleian Library, and in 1665 librarian-in-chief. Next year he was collated to a prebend at Salisbury, and in 1673 to the archdeaconry of Gloucester, receiving the degree of D.D. shortly afterwards. As librarian, Hyde was responsible for the publication of the Catalogus impressorum Librorum Bibliothecae Bodleianae (1674) [Catalog of the Printed Books in the Bodleian Library], the third published catalogue of the Bodleian collections. In 1691 the death of Edward Pococke opened up to Hyde the Laudian professorship of Arabic; and in 1697, on the deprivation of Roger Altham, he succeeded to the Regius chair of Hebrew and a canonry of Christ Church. Under Charles II, James II and William III, Hyde discharged the duties of Eastern interpreter to the court. He resigned his librarianship in 1701, giving as a reason, \\"my feet being left weak by the gout, I am weary of the toil and drudgery of daily attendance all times and weathers.\\"William D. Macray, Annals of the Bodleian Library (1868) p. 121-122. He died at Oxford on 18 February 1703, aged 66. ==Works== Hyde, who was one of the first to direct attention to the vast treasures of Oriental antiquity, was an excellent classical scholar, and there was hardly an Eastern tongue accessible to foreigners with which he was not familiar.

In his chief work, Historia religionis veterum Persarum (1700) [The History of the religion of ancient Persia], he made the first attempt to correct from Oriental sources the errors of the Greek and Roman historians who had described the religion of the ancient Persians. He identified Zoroaster as a religious reformer.Iranica.Com – Zoroaster – As Perceived In Western Europe After Antiquity In this book, Hyde also coined the word \\"cuneiform\\".See: * On pages 526–527, Hyde discusses the cuneiform found at Persepolis. From p. 526: \\"Istiusmodi enim ductuli pyramidales seu Cuneiformes non veniunt in Gavrorum literis, nec in Telesmaticis, nec in Hieroglyphicis Ægypti; sed tales ductus (tam inter seinvicem juxta positi quam per seinvicem transmissi) sunt peculiares Persepoli, … \\" (For such kinds of thin pyramidal or wedge forms do not occur in the letters of the Gavres [also spelled Gaures; this was an old English name for Zoroastrians, an ancient cult of fire worshippers], nor in talismans, nor in Egyptian hieroglyphs; but such drawings (so closely placed among each other as [intended to] be conveyed by means of each other) are peculiar to Persepolis, … ) * Online Etymology Dictionary attributes cuneiform to Engelbert Kaempfer His other writings and translations comprise Tabulae longitudinum et latitudinum stellarum fixarum ex observatione principis Ulugh Beighi (1665) [Tables of the longitudes and latitudes of the fixed stars from the main observatory of Ulugh Beg], to which his notes have given additional value; Quatuor evangelia et acta apostolorum lingua Malaica, characteribus Europaeis (1677) [The four Gospels and Acts of the Apostles in the Malay language, [written with] European characters]; Epistola de mensuris et ponderibus serum sive sinensium (1688) [Letter on the measures and weights of the northern Chinese or the southern Chinese], appended to Edward Bernard's De mensuris et ponderibus antiquis [On ancient measures and weights]; Abraham Farissol's Itinera mundi (1691) [World journeys]; and De ludis orientalibus libri II (1694) [On oriental games, book II] in which he described various Chinese games including Coan ki and where he gave a confused and inadequate account of the game of Go, or weiqiDe Ludis Orientalibus Libri Duo: Historia Nerdiludii, hoc est dicere, Trunculorum : cum quibuidam aliis Arabum, Persarum ... & aliarum Gentium Ludis tam Politicis quam Bellicis ... additis omnium Nominibus in dictarum Gentium Linguis.

Originally a goal- kicking half-back, in his career he played for and captained the Penrith Panthers and the Auckland Warriors clubs and also represented his country and state on several occasions. Alexander's position for the majority of his career was at half-back, however early in his career – particularly in representative sides – he was moved to . It was this ability to play different positions with great success that saw Alexander make both the 1986 and the 1990 Kangaroo Tours. Alexander actually played a test on the 1990 Tour against France on the , scoring a try and capping it off with a memorable gymnastics style backflip in celebration.1990 Kangaroo tour - French leg highlights This was also his last test appearance. ==Junior career== Alexander began his career at schoolboy level where he quickly established himself as a star player for his side. He attended Patrician Brothers' College, Fairfield he played for the Australian Schoolboys rugby league team in 1983. He was later signed on as a junior to his local club side the Penrith Panthers. ==Professional career== ===Penrith Panthers=== Alexander made his first grade debut for the Panthers in the 1984 season as a half-back. His talent quickly became clear and by the end of the season he took out the Rookie of the Year award. The following year Greg continued his good form throughout the season tallying up 194 points (a club record at the time) and earning himself the 1985 Dally M. player of the year award. Greg continued playing with the Panthers for the next several years and become known for his unique ability to score and set up tries, his excellent attacking kicking and his solid defence. At the end of the 1986 NSWRL season, he went on the 1986 Kangaroo tour, gaining selection after Parramatta winger Eric Grothe was controversially ruled out with a knee injury. Alexander would go on to play in 10 matches on tour with the Kangaroos, scoring 10 tries and kicking 5 goals. Alexander and test hooker Royce Simmons became the first Panthers selected for a Kangaroo Tour. 1989 saw him rise to selection for New South Wales in the 1989 State of Origin series, being one of the few Blues players regarded as playing well in a series won 3-0 by Queensland, before being selected as the first choice halfback for Australia's mid-season tour of New Zealand. After making his test debut in the 26-6 first test win against New Zealand at the Queen Elizabeth II Park in Christchurch, and playing in the 8-0 second test win at Rotorua, Alexander lost his place in the side with coach Bob Fulton preferring his 1987 premiership winning halfback from Manly-Warringah, Des Hasler, in the position for the third and final test. During the 1989 NSWRL season, his pace and skill had made Penrith the second most dangerous attacking team in the competition behind the eventual premiers, the Canberra Raiders and Alexander was the Panthers leading try and point scorer and for much of the year led the league in try scoring – scoring ten tries in eight games at one point, eventually finishing with 15 tries from 18 games for the season.1989 Penrith Panthers at Rugby League Project Alexander would eventually finish second on the try scoring list finishing behind Canberra fullback Gary Belcher who scored 17 tries. Alexander finished ahead of other noted try scorers including Andrew Ettingshausen (Cronulla), Ricky Walford (St George) and Phil Blake (South Sydney).1989 NSWRL season at Rugby League Project Penrith's form saw them reach the finals for the first time since his rookie year in 1984, reaching the knockout Minor Semi-Final before ending their season with a 27–18 loss to Canberra. With Alexander in great form at both halfback and fullback for the Panthers, the club made it to their first ever Grand Final in 1990 against the defending premiers Canberra. The Panthers went down 18–14 to the Raiders and despite a solid performance, Alexander's goal kicking let him down on the day, only kicking one of his four attempts compared to Canberra captain Mal Meninga who landed all three of his attempts. Despite his good form, Alexander was only selected to the bench for game 3 of the 1990 State of Origin series and missed selection in Australia's mid-season tests against France and New Zealand.1990 State of Origin at Rugby League Project At the end of the season he was selected for his second Kangaroo Tour as the back up fullback to Canberra and Queensland custodian Gary Belcher and went on to be selected for every game on tour, although unlike Terry Lamb who played in every game on the 1986 tour, Alexander, along with the Kangaroo's other replacements that day (David Gillespie, Des Hasler and Mark Sargent), did not get off the bench in the 14–10 second test win against Great Britain at Old Trafford that kept The Ashes series alive. He also failed to get off the bench in the third game of the tour against Wigan. Alexander was the leading point scorer for the Kangaroos on tour, playing 17 games (4 tests but selected for all 5 tests), scoring 14 tries and kicking 50 goals for a total of 156 points. The closest a teammate got in points was team captain Mal Meninga who scored 64 points (8 tries, 16 goals) from his 11 games. He scored a record 46 points in the tour match against France B (5 tries, 13 goals) in Lyon and continued that form into the first test against France 3 days later in Avignon when after coming on to replace an ill Ricky Stuart at halfback early in the game he went on to score 3 tries and kick 7/8 goals in the Kangaroos 60–4 win giving him a personal haul of 28 points.1990 Kangaroo tour - France vs Australia 1st Test1990 Kangaroo tour - France B vs Australia In the 34–10 second test win a week later at the Stade Gilbert Brutus in Perpignan, a hamstring injury ruled out Laurie Daley. This saw Dale Shearer move from the wing to the centres and Brandy was selected on the wing where he kicked 3 goals to go along with his memorable try which resulted in his gymnastics style backflip celebration. He had performed the backflip several times at training while in England (claiming it was something he had learned in gymnastics while still in school) and had wanted to do it after scoring a try in a game, but with Australia in a battle to retain The Ashes he felt the circumstances were never right. However, as the second test against the French was also the final game of the Kangaroo tour, he allowed himself the luxury of the backflip in front of the TV camera's. Alexander captained the Panthers to their maiden premiership in 1991, the Panthers reversing the result of the 1990 Grand Final with a 19–12 win over Canberra. From halfback, Alexander took control of the game in the 2nd half with his kicking game which included a 38-metre field goal to give Penrith a 13–12 lead following a Brad Izzard try under the posts which was converted by Alexander. Later a majestic sideline conversion of Royce Simmons' 2nd try of the game sealed the win for the Panthers. The Phil Gould coached Panthers never fell below 4th on the ladder for the season (Round 2) and never lost the competition lead after regaining it following Round 14 of the 22 round season. From Round 14 the Panthers only loss of the season was a 14–12 away loss to Cronulla-Sutherland in Round 20.1990 Penrith Panthers at Rugby League Project During the season he was selected at fullback for NSW in Games I and III of the 1991 State of Origin series, only missing Game II at the Sydney Football Stadium through injury. Despite his good form for Penrith and NSW and the absence of Gary Belcher through injury, Alexander was overlooked for the first test of mid-season Trans-Tasman Test series against New Zealand in favour of boom Brisbane and Qld fullback Paul Hauff, while he also missed selection in the final two games when selectors chose Andrew Ettingshausen. With Origin halfbacks Ricky Stuart and Allan Langer also in good form (Langer played) and Des Hasler in the team as a utility reserve, Alexander was only considered a chance of playing fullback in the tests. Following the Panthers Grand Final win over Canberra, Alexander was selected for Australia's 5 game tour to Papua New Guinea but withdrew through injury. He recovered from injury in time to lead the Panthers to England in October for the 1991 World Club Challenge, which was lost to Wigan 21–4 at the Anfield Stadium. 1992 was a year of huge expectation for Alexander and the reigning premiers Penrith. Whilst the Panthers form was up and down at the beginning of the season, Alexander was named as captain and fullback of the City Origin side, ahead of incumbent NSW captain Benny Elias. This led to Alexander being the favourite to take over the Blues captaincy for that year's State of Origin series against Queensland. However, a knee injury lead to Alexander being withdrawn from the match, and Country Origin captain Laurie Daley would go on to successfully captain the NSW side to a 2–1 series win, with Alexander missing all three games due to his knee injury. Selectors stuck with Stuart at half and Ettingshausen at the back. ====Ben Alexander's death==== On 21 June 1992, his younger brother and fellow Panthers teammate Ben Alexander was killed in a car accident. The tragic loss of the younger Alexander had an adverse effect on the close-knit Panthers club and the team's form dropped off in the second half of the year which saw them miss the finals. Greg Alexander missed the majority of fixtures that year, playing only 9 games for the season (including two from the bench) and following his brother's death would not return to the side until their Round 20 match against Manly-Warringah at Brookvale Oval in August. After his return he continually fell below his usual playing weight of 84 kg and ended the season ten kilograms lighter than usual. ===Auckland Warriors=== At the end of the 1994 season after playing in just 13 games for the Panthers (mostly at fullback as the club had signed New Zealand test halfback Gary Freeman from Easts), Alexander, seeking a change and to just get away from Sydney following the death of his brother Ben in 1992, joined the Auckland Warriors, one of four new teams introduced for the 1995 season. He spent most of the first half of his first season for the Warriors at halfback, and began to recapture some of his previous form. In the latter half of the season he moved between fullback, halfback and five-eighth due to the depth the Warriors had in the halves - with Gene Ngamu, Stacey Jones, Phil Blake and Frano Botica all spending some time at halfback or five-eighth. In his second season with the club, he was awarded the captaincy after Dean Bell retired, and again began the season at halfback. However, after he was injured in Round 10, New Zealand halfback Stacey Jones regained the half back role, and upon returning to the side Alexander was moved to the fullback position - where he would remain for most of the remaining season. ===Return to the Panthers=== Alexander eventually returned to Penrith in 1997 after his stint in New Zealand and stayed on until his retirement in 1999. His early season form for the Panthers in the new Super League competition saw him selected at halfback for his first game for NSW since 1991 in the Super League Tri-series. After starring in NSW's 38–10 win over Queensland in the first game of the series. In total, Alexander played 228 games for the Panthers, scored 100 tries, kicked 343 goals and 14 field goals, tallying 1,100 career points for the club. To date, he is one of only seven players ever score over 100 tries and over 1,000 points for a single club in top grade Australian rugby league. The others being Terry Lamb (Canterbury-Bankstown), Ryan Girdler (Penrith Panthers), Hazem El Masri (Canterbury-Bankstown Bulldogs), Darren Lockyer (Brisbane Broncos), Luke Burt (Parramatta Eels) and Jarrod Croker (Canberra Raiders). ==Life after football== After his retirement from football in 1999, Alexander embarked on a media career in both radio and television. He currently works as a host and commentator for Foxtel's Fox Sports station. He also hosts the nightly Sports Today program with John Gibbs on Sydney radio station 2UE.Brandy's happy to man the mike St Mary-Mt Druitt Star, 25 May 2010 On 24 October 2000, he was awarded the Australian Sports Medal for his rugby league achievements. On 25 June 2016, he was inducted into the Penrith Panthers hall of fame alongside Grahame Moran, Royce Simmons, and Craig Gower. ==Personal life== Alexander is the brother-in-law of fellow former Penrith, NSW and Australian teammate Mark Geyer, and of former Penrith, Western Reds and Newcastle second rower, Peter Shiels, both of whom married his sisters. He is also the brother-in-law of former St. George Illawarra Dragons hooker Cameron King, who is the younger brother of his wife Tanya. ==References== ==Further reading== * ==External links== * Fox Sports NRL team profiles * Penrith Panthers Board of Directors * State of Origin Official website Rugby League Player Stats Category:1965 births Category:Australian rugby league players Category:Penrith Panthers players Category:New Zealand Warriors players Category:New South Wales Rugby League State of Origin players Category:New South Wales City Origin rugby league team players Category:Australia national rugby league team players Category:Living people Category:Australian rugby league commentators Category:Rugby league halfbacks Category:New Zealand Warriors captains Category:Recipients of the Australian Sports Medal Category:Rugby league fullbacks ","title":"Greg Alexander"},{"id":"1281480","text":"Dunes adjacent to Newburgh on south bank of Ythan Estuary Newburgh is a coastal village in Aberdeenshire, Scotland. The village dates to 1261 AD, when Lord Sinclair wanted to establish a chapel in the area.Profile of Newburgh, Aberdeenshire Originally built as a school, somewhat later the chapel of Holy Rood was established. ==Geography== Video of a seal at Newburgh beach, Aberdeenshire. Newburgh is on the Ythan Estuary and near the Sands of Forvie. Near the estuary mouth, the presence of tern colonies is notable, since there are several distinct species that utilise the north banks of the Ythan Estuary, and comprise a meaningful percentage of the breeding pairs of terns in the United Kingdom. In the summer terns can be observed feeding in their characteristic diving patterns approximately 600 to 900 metres inland from the estuary.C. Michael Hogan, Ythan Estuary, Aberdeenshire, Lumina Technologies, Aberdeen Library archives, June, 2004 The Forvie Nature Reserve is very near and to the north, where there is said to be the largest eider duck colony in the world. Beside the beach is an eighteen-hole golf course with its bird shaped clubhouse and the Udny Arms restaurant. Holy Rood Chapel in Newburgh Ythan Estuary ==History== During the nineteenth century, Newburgh was a main sea port for the nearby town of Ellon. A number of clipper ships sailed to destinations all over the globe to deliver tea and other cargoes and coal barges sailed up the east coast to offload at the quayside. Several of the wealthier clipper sea captains built houses in the village and named them after their most frequent ports of call. Hence several imposing properties exist in the village such as Shanghai house, Santa Cruz and Sydney house. Newburgh was a victim of bombing in World War 2. Just past the eastern end of the Ythan Bridge, is a bomb crater left by an attacking German aircraft, the bomb, aimed at the wharf, skipped over the bridge and exploded on the embankment beside the Cruden Bay Road. Other bombs fell beside a mill at the south of the village (12th Jan 1942) and several dropped in the estuary whilst trying to attack buildings on the quayside. A pillbox was located at the Ythan bridge; although this bridge has been demolished, the pillbox remains. Pillbox and anti-invasion polesThe beach was classed as a high invasion threat from German units based on Norway. A number of pillboxes along with barbed wire, anti-tank blocks and scaffolding poles (that ran almost to Aberdeen along the coast) were installed. Landmines were also planted in areas between Newburgh estuary and Aberdeen, in December 2012 a landmine was found in the dunes. It's unclear how it got there, as the listed minefield were at Forvie and Menie. Mines have been known to be dragged along the coast by currents. Newburgh Landmine 2005 saw a sudden expansion in housing in the village, with houses being built just west of the local school, and near the Ythan Hotel, at the southernmost point of the village. Whilst the houses at the west end of Newburgh were a marketing success, residents were fairly critical of the properties going up next to the Ythan, dubbing the area too swampy for the foundations. ==Local information== Public Transport providing services to Aberdeen, Peterhead, Ellon and Dyce Airport are presently run by Stagecoach North Scotland. Also, not a quarter of a mile out of Newburgh is the aptly named Newburgh Motors garage. Education is served by Newburgh Mathers School, named after John Mathers who, just before his death, left the residents of Newburgh enough money to set up a school in the local area for, as he put it, the education and clothing of twenty poor fishermen's sons of Newburgh. In terms of secondary education, Newburgh is within the catchment area for Ellon Academy.The tallest point of Newburgh is the knoll Gallows Hill. The police station in Newburgh no longer exists: in its place stands a house. However, the presence of a cell, in the past, is given away by the bars in one of the windows. Also, in the front of the house are the words police station engraved in the stone.

They are a supplementary list of characters that can legally be used in registered personal names in Japan, despite not being in the official list of \\"commonly used characters\\" (jōyō kanji). \\"Jinmeiyō kanji\\" is sometimes used to refer to the characters in both the jinmeiyō and jōyō lists. A ministerial decree of 1946 limited the number of officially sanctioned kanji for public use to the 1850 tōyō kanji. Only kanji on this list were acceptable as registered names, despite the fact that the list excluded many kanji frequently used in names up to that point. However, on May 25, 1951, the cabinet extended the set of characters usable in names by specifying the first 90 jinmeiyō kanji. Over the years, the Minister of Justice has increased the number of name kanji, and has a plan for further addition in response to requests from parents. As of April 30, 2009, there were 985 jinmeiyō kanji, but this number was reduced to 861 in late 2010 when 129 jinmeiyō characters were transferred to the jōyō kanji list, and 5 characters were transferred from the jōyō kanji list to jinmeiyō characters. In 2015 and 2017, 2 kanji in total were added to the jinmeiyō list, making the total number 863.

A Norwegian native, he later became a U.S. citizen, and was a recipient of the Distinguished Flying Cross. His service in the U.S. Army Air Forces during World War II made use of his Arctic exploration expertise to help the Allies over Scandinavia and Northern Europe. After the war, Balchen continued to be an influential leader with the U.S. Air Force, as well as a highly regarded private consultant in projects involving the Arctic and aviation.Glines 1999, pp. 268–273. ==Early years== The son of a country doctor, Balchen was born at the farm Myren in Tveit, just outside Kristiansand, Norway. After having finished Norwegian middle school in 1916, he attended a Forestry School from 1917–1918.Henriksen, Vera. \\"Bernt Balchen.\\" Store Norske Leksikon. Retrieved: 28 January 2013. Next he enrolled in the French Foreign Legion, and his unit was assigned to the Verdun front in World War I.Glines 1999, p. 21. In 1918, before seeing action, Balchen was recalled to Norway. He transferred to the Norwegian Army, and was sent to an artillery school, where he graduated shortly after. Under an assumed name, Balchen fought as a cavalryman with the White Guards in the Finnish Civil War that followed the end of major hostilities. During a cavalry charge, his horse was shot from under him and he was left for dead on the battlefield.Simmons 1965, p. 27. Having received serious wounds that required a lengthy convalescence, Balchen turned to an early interest in athletics and trained strenuously as a boxer to represent Norway in the 1920 Olympics. Besides being a championship boxer, he was also an expert marksman and an accomplished skier.Simmons 1965, p. 31. Balchen was very knowledgeable about wilderness and northern survival, skills that he would later exploit. While waiting for his acceptance as an Olympian, Balchen received word that he also qualified for flight training, resulting in his decision to become a pilot in the Royal Norwegian Navy Air Service in 1921.\\"Bernt Balchen Bio.\\" snowsymposium.org. Retrieved: 8 September 2010. ==Aviation== ===Amundsen-Ellsworth Relief Expedition=== Gaining recognition as an accomplished pilot, the Norwegian Defense Department selected Balchen in 1925 to become part of the Amundsen-Ellsworth Relief Expedition, a rescue mission for the missing explorer Roald Amundsen under the command of Flight Lieutenant Lützow-Holm. The expedition consisting of two seaplanes, was sent to Spitsbergen on the Svalbard archipelago.Simmons 1965, p. 56. This assignment would make Amundsen, already a family friend, a lifelong friend and confidant.Glines 199, p. 19. During the next year, Balchen became part of a ground party led by Lieutenant J. Höver, providing technical services for the Roald Amundsen, Lincoln Ellsworth and Umberto Nobile Arctic Expedition, ultimately a successful attempt to fly the lighter-than-air airship, Norge, over the North Pole from Svalbard to Teller, Alaska. Although he was a highly regarded mechanic, Balchen's main role was to provide survival training to the Italian crew members as well as to teach them to ski. In a last-minute decision by Amundsen, he was not chosen to be on the record-breaking dirigible flight as Nobile was in charge of picking the crew, which already had a complement of 23. ===Support of Byrd's North Pole flight=== After observing the crash of the Fokker trimotor, Josephine Ford, belonging to one of his competitors, Lieutenant Commander Richard E. Byrd of the U.S. Navy, Amundsen asked Balchen to help in preparing the airplane for a flight to the North Pole. Under Balchen's supervision, the damaged aircraft skis were repaired with improvised wooden supports from a lifeboat's oars and some survival gear was loaned to Byrd for the flight.Simmons 1965, p. 87. This enabled Byrd and his pilot, Floyd Bennett to continue with their attempt to fly to the North Pole and back on 9 May 1926. In 1926, under the sponsorship of Joseph Wanamaker, Balchen officially joined the Byrd party, as the co-pilot and navigator, with the pilot Floyd Bennett, flying the Josephine Ford on a tour to more than 50 American cities, thereby promoting commercial aviation as a safe, reliable and practical means of transportation. Following this tour Balchen was hired by Anthony Fokker as a test pilot for the Fokker Aircraft Company at the Teterboro Airport, New Jersey. ===Trans-Atlantic Flight=== On 29 June 1927, Balchen, as the co-pilot with the chief pilot Bert Acosta; the flight engineer, George Otto Noville and the navigator and air flight organizer, Commander Byrd, flew a U.S. Post Office airmail aircraft, Fokker trimotor America, across the Atlantic Ocean from Roosevelt Field on Long Island. Due to Acosta's reported lack of ability to successfully fly via aircraft instruments, and the foul weather for most of this flight, Balchen did most of the flying. Bad weather and low visibility over France made landing at the Paris airport impractical, despite their repeated attempts. When their aircraft was running low on aviation gasoline, Balchen decided to fly back to the western coast of France, and there he landed the Fokker Trimotor that was not designed to land on the water, on the ocean just off the coast of France, and without any injury to the occupants.Simmons 1965, pp. 107–108. ===Bremen rescue=== In late April 1928 the three-man crew of the aircraft Bremen was stranded on Greenly Island, Canada following the first east to west non-stop flight across the Atlantic Ocean from Europe. Balchen and Floyd Bennett flew a Ford Trimotor to provide relief to the downed pilots. Bennett had developed pneumonia following a previous crash. Bennett succumbed to his fever while in flight on 25 April. Balchen flew the remaining eight hours, and he was paid $10,000 for the effort. Balchen donated the money to Bennett's widow. ===South Pole flight=== A Ford Trimotor once flown by Balchen On 28–29 November 1929, as the pilot of a modified Ford 4-AT Trimotor named Floyd Bennett, Balchen became one of the first four men to fly over the South Pole. Balchen was the chief pilot, and he was accompanied by Harold June, his co-pilot and radio operator; Ashley McKinley, the flight's photographer; and Commander Richard E. Byrd, the plane's navigator and leader of the Antarctic expedition. The flight was considered one of the greatest aviation achievements in history. ===Amelia Earhart=== Due to his reputation as a polar, transatlantic and aviation expert, Balchen was hired in 1931 by Amelia Earhart as a technical adviser for a planned solo transatlantic flight. In an attempt to throw off the press, Earhart turned over her repaired Lockheed Vega to Balchen who was assumed to be planning an Antarctic flight. Balchen flew the Vega to the Fokker Aircraft Company plant at Hasbrouck Heights, New Jersey. There, he and the mechanics Frank Nagle and Eddie Gorski reconditioned the Vega for the upcoming record flight. Its fuselage was strengthened to carry extra fuel tanks that were added to provide a 420-gallon capacity, and some additional flight instruments were also installed. After modifications had been made, Earhart flew this Lockheed Vega across the Atlantic Ocean on 20 May 1932, landing in Ireland.Butler 1997, p. 263. ===Norway=== In the mid-1930s, Balchen returned to Norway to work with the Norwegian Airlines. Later, he was part of a team to create a Nordic Postal Union, and as war seemed inevitable in Europe, Balchen helped negotiate an aviation treaty with the United States. Balchen also worked with the airplane, The Valkyrien. Image of Balchen's plane ==World War II== In 1939, Balchen was in Helsinki, working on a contract to provide U.S. fighter aircraft to Finland, when the Soviet attack on Finland took place. Enlisting with the Norwegian Air Force, he made his way to the United States on a crucial mission to negotiate \\"matters pertaining to aircraft ordnance and ammunition with the question of the Norwegian Government's possible purchase of such materials in the United States of America.\\"Glines 1999, p. 127. With his status of holding dual Norwegian and American citizenship and his extensive contacts in the aviation industry, his instruction from the Norwegian Government-in-exile in London changed to a new directive: to set up a training camp and school for expatriate Norwegian airmen and soldiers in Canada.\\"Bernt Balchen\\". National Aviation Hall of Fame. Retrieved: 9 September 2010. Balchen negotiated directly with Canadian government officials to obtain an agreement to use available airport facilities at the Toronto Island airport on Lake Ontario known as \\"Little Norway\\". During the war, over 2,500 Norwegian aviators of all categories: pilots, navigators and mechanics, were trained in the various bases of \\"Little Norway\\".Wiig 2009, p. 57. During 1940, with the \\"Little Norway\\" facilities under construction and his administrative duties taken over by others, Balchen requested permission from the Norwegian Air Force to fly ferrying missions for the British, teaming with Clyde Pangborn, a contemporary record-breaking pilot of the era.Glines 1999, pp. 128–129. In early 1941, while engaged in a ferrying mission, and on a layover in the Philippines, a representative of General Henry \\"Hap\\" Arnold sought out Balchen.Glines 1999, p. 129. Arnold asked Balchen to join the US Army Air Forces as a colonel to oversee the establishment of the USAAF polar airfields at Qaanaaq, and Sondre Stromfjord Greenland. These highly secretive bases would serve to ferry fighter aircraft across the Atlantic by air, rather than having to disassemble them and send them overseas by cargo ship. The airfields also served as bases from which long-range Consolidated B-24 Liberator patrol aircraft could fly far out over the North Atlantic Ocean in search of the German Kriegsmarine U-boats that were menacing American, British, and Canadian ships taking war supplies and troops across the ocean in preparation for the then undecided location of the cross-channel invasion of Europe. This latter air base had the code name \\"Bluie West Eight\\" during its operational life. Consolidated OA-10 Catalina on the ice in Greenland after a rescue Between September 1941 and November 1943, Balchen trained his personnel in cold weather survival skills and rescue techniques which enabled them to carry out many rescues of downed airmen on the Greenland icecap.Balchen 1944, pp. 4–5. On 25 May 1943, flying in a Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress, Balchen led a bombing raid that destroyed the only German outpost remaining on Greenland, a forward station at Sabine Island on the eastern coast of that island.Glines 1999, p. 163 This destruction hindered the ability of the German armed forces to maintain a presence on Greenland that not only had been used to send deceptive radio messages to Allied aircraft as well as establishing a weather station required to provide accurate weather reports for the German forces operating in the North Atlantic.Balchen 1944, p. 21. Balchen then was posted to the European Theatre to run \\"Operation Where and When\\", based at Luleå-Kallax Air Base in northern Sweden.Balchen 1944, p. 4. Balchen commanded a clandestine air transport operation, using 10 Douglas C-47s and helped to set up an escape route between the United Kingdom and Sweden that enabled numerous important diplomats and others to flee the Nazis. From March to December 1944, Balchen's \\"Operation Balder\\" using six B-24s manned with OSS crews, safely evacuated at least 2,000 Norwegians, 900 American internees and 150 internees of other nationalities from Sweden. Norwegian police troops were also airlifted from Sweden to Finnmark. The air operation also shipped strategic freight; from July to October 1944, 64 tons of operational supplies such as ammunition were transported from Scotland to the underground in occupied Norway. Life necessities like bales of hay and fodder for livestock were brought to areas in the north of Sweden and Norway, once even paradropping a hospital complete with a doctor and nurse. Between November 1944 and April 1945, Balchen also transported 200 tons of Arctic equipment and operational supplies from England to Sweden that were used to make secret overland transport from Sweden to Norway possible. During winter 1945, Balchen shipped communications equipment into northern Norway that was of inestimable value to the Allied Expeditionary Force's intelligence operations. The leading Norwegian wartime ace Sven Heglund was acting military attaché and served with Balchen, later writing about his time at Kallax.\\" 'Høk over høk'.\\" (in Norwegian) nb.no. Retrieved: 9 September 2010. Another Norwegian at Kallax during the same period, who became a good friend, was marine biologist and explorer-to-be Thor Heyerdahl, later of Ra I and II and Kon-Tiki fame. ==Postwar activities== 1954 interview From November 1948 to January 1951, Balchen commanded the 10th Rescue Squadron of the U.S. Air Force, which was located in southern Alaska but which operated across all of Alaska and northern Canada rescuing crashed airmen. Balchen led this squadron in the development of the techniques that became widely used in cold weather search and rescues. He was also directly responsible for persuading the U.S. Air Force to purchase the de Havilland Canada DHC-2 Beaver bush aircraft, one that became an important search and rescue aircraft for the Arctic.Rossiter 1999, pp. 86–87. On 23 May 1949, while commanding the 10th Rescue Squadron, Balchen flew a Douglas C-54 Skymaster from Fairbanks, Alaska, via the North Pole to Thule Air Base, Greenland. Balchen was primarily responsible for the pioneering and development of the strategic air base at Thule, Greenland, built secretly on his recommendation, in 1951 under severe weather conditions which, by extending the range of the Strategic Air Command, increased the capabilities that made the SAC a significant deterrent to Soviet aggression during the Cold War.Glines 1999, p. 212. ==Post retirement== After retiring from the U.S. Air Force in 1956, Colonel Balchen continued to serve the Air Force on special assignments and aviation and energy industries as a consultant. He joined General Precision Laboratories as a consultant in 1959, as well as working with a host of other companies including Hughes Aircraft, General Dynamics, Canadair and the Electric Boat Company. Working for Canadair in 1966, then the parent company, General Dynamics, from 1966–1971, Balchen had authority over projects as diverse as ice-breakers, tankers, new epoxy materials for submarine construction, seagoing electronic weather systems and over-snow vehicles. In 1962, he also worked with the USAF presenting a proposal on the Apogee Intercept Defense System (AIDS) in 1962 and later, was the leading advocate for \\"Project Iceman\\", a proposed system of intermediate range ballistic missiles (IRBMs) stationed in Greenland.Glines 1999, pp. 268–270. As one of the world's foremost Arctic experts, Balchen was sought out by numerous companies and government agencies including Canada and Norway. Balchen was hired as a consultant by Hercules Oil, then Phillips Petroleum and Moran Towing on plans to extract oil from Alaska using pipelines.Glines 1999, p. 271. According to a 1972 article in The Christian Science Monitor, Balchen asserted that \\"a general warming trend over the North Pole is melting the polar ice cap and may produce an ice-free Arctic Ocean by the year 2000.\\"\\"Ice- free Arctic Ocean near?\\" The Christian Science Monitor, 8 June 1972. Retrieved: 31 December 2010. In his native Norway, Balchen was a driving force in the establishment of Det Norske Luftfartselskap (D.N.L.) (\\"The Norwegian Airline Company\\"), with which he pioneered commercial Europe–US airline flights across the North Pole. D.N.L. later merged with Danish and Swedish airlines into the major carrier Scandinavian Airlines. ==Death and burial== Balchen continued to work in consultancy until his death. In his final year, he was diagnosed with bone cancer, and he died at Mount Kisco, New York in 1973.Glines 1999, p. 275. Balchen was buried at the Arlington National Cemetery in Virginia. He is buried in Section 2, Grave 4969, next to Admiral Richard E. Byrd. ==Honors and tributes== Balchen was a winner of the Harmon Trophy in aviation. The annual \\"International Aviation Snow Symposium\\", sponsored by the Northeast (U.S.) Chapter of the American Association of Airport Executives, created the Bernt Balchen Award in his memory in 1976 to recognize airports excelling in snow and ice control. In 1976, Balchen was inducted into the International Air & Space Hall of Fame.Sprekelmeyer, Linda, editor. These We Honor: The International Aerospace Hall of Fame. Donning Co. Publishers, 2006. .

After the confluence of the two Ourthes near Nisramont, the Ourthe flows roughly in north-west and later in northern direction. Near Noiseux it flows for a short distance through the province of Namur. After the municipality of Durbuy it flows in the province of Liège. Eventually it flows into the river Meuse in the city of Liège. The most important tributaries of the river Ourthe are the Amblève and the Vesdre. Towns along the Ourthe are Houffalize (Ourthe Orientale), La Roche-en-Ardenne, Hotton, Durbuy, Hamoir and Esneux. ==See also== * Département de l'Ourthe == Gallery == Confluence of the two ourthes.JPGConfluence of the Ourthe Occidentale (Western Ourthe) and the Ourthe Orientale (Eastern Ourthe) La_Roche.jpgThe river in La Roche-en-Ardenne Ourthe333.JPGThe Ourthe near Beffe in autumn Ourthe beffe.JPGAgain the Ourthe near Beffe in autumn Taxodium distichum (Rendeux) JPG1.jpgThe Robert Lenoir Arboretum near Rendeux alongside the Ourthe Hotton JPG01.jpgThe river at Hotton, and a view of the city church Sy2.jpgRocks at the Ourthe near Sy 0 Hamoir - L'Ourthe (2).jpgBridge across the river at Hamoir 20100705 combain pont02.JPGThe Ourthe flowing through Comblain-au-Pont Esneux JPG01.jpgView at Esneux and its bridge across the river Lock on Ourthe canal, Liège.jpgLock on the Ourthe canal that runs parallel to the lower part of the river, Liège Category:Rivers of the Ardennes (Belgium) Category:Rivers of Belgium Category:Rivers of Wallonia Category:Rivers of Liège (province) Category:Rivers of Luxembourg (Belgium) Category:Rivers of Namur (province) Category:Geography of Liège ","title":"Ourthe"},{"id":"1281512","text":"Buckhorn may refer to: In Canada: * Buckhorn, Ontario In Germany: * Buckhorn (Hamburg U-Bahn station) in Hamburg-Volksdorf, see U1 (Hamburg U-Bahn) In the United Kingdom: * Buckhorn, Devon, a United Kingdom location In the United States: * Buckhorn, Amador County, California * Buckhorn, Ventura County, California * Buckhorn, Illinois * Buckhorn Corners, Illinois * Buckhorn Township, Brown County, Illinois * Buckhorn, Kentucky * Buckhorn, Michigan * Buckhorn, Madison County, Missouri * Buckhorn, Pulaski County, Missouri * Buckhorn, North Carolina * Buckhorn Township, Harnett County, North Carolina * Buckhorn Township, Wake County, North Carolina * Buckhorn, Pennsylvania In other uses: * Buckhorn Lake (disambiguation), several lakes in the United States and Canada * Buckhorn High School (disambiguation), several high schools in the United States * Buckhorn sights, a type of iron sight on a firearm * Buckhorn, a common name of Plantago lanceolata ","title":"Buckhorn"},{"id":"1281514","text":"La Cenicienta (Cinderella) is an opera in three acts composed by Chilean artist Jorge Peña Hen (1928-1973), to a libretto by the Chilean author, Oscar Jara Azocar (1910-1988). This opera is one of the few operas in the world composed with the aim to be sung, acted and played exclusively by children. It was written in 1966 and played by Jorge Peña Hen's first Symphonic Orchestra of Children at the Theater of the Girls Public School in La Serena, a city in the northern region of Coquimbo. In 1967, a production of La Cenicienta went on a tour through several cities in Chile: Valparaíso, Viña del Mar, Concepción and Santiago, the capital. Its debut was considered a great success. In 1986, a new version of this children's opera was played in Colombia. In 1998, 25 years after Jorge Peña Hen's assassination by Chile's military coup officials, another version was re-made in La Serena. In 2004, a new staging by Fondazione Teatro La Fenice, and in 2005 by University of Chile's Theatre in Santiago, Chile.

He attended Gray's School of Art in Aberdeen and earned a postgraduate degree in teaching at Moray House in Edinburgh. ==Music career== He first saw Runrig play in 1973 and was approached one year later to become a member of the band. As lead singer of Runrig, Munro became established as a Gaelic music performer of the 1980s and 1990s. Munro left Runrig in 1997 to pursue a career in politics. His final performance was a farewell concert at Stirling Castle on 29 August. Munro released a solo album, Heart of America, done in collaboration with fellow Skye songwriters Blair Douglas and Richard Macintyre, and wo Album of the Year in the Scottish TradMusic Awards 2006. He continues to work as the Director of Development at Sabhal Mòr Ostaig, Scotland's National Centre for the Gaelic Language and Culture on Skye.

Eventually, 74 women were pressed together in cell 115, which had a floor area of 9m2 and hardly any ventilation. After 14 hours of confinement, the inmates were released from the cell. Ten women did not survive the night. The incident soon became known outside the camp and was written about in resistance newspapers. The occupying power was not pleased with the fact that the news had leaked. The commander was demoted to the ranks and was sent to the Eastern front, where he was killed in combat. , one of the bunker victims, wrote: 'When the lights went off, a great panic rose among the women. It was a strange swelling sound, which sometimes would diminish, but soon swell up again. It was caused by praying, screaming and yelling women.

This has encouraged developers to develop kludges to overcome this limitation. This pseudo-transparency, so called as the background pixmap of the root window is visible (analogous to desktop wallpaper) rather than any obscured windows, allows users to make windows look less imposing (such as Terminal emulators, which usually comprise large chunks of text), and to integrate the appearance of windows with their desktop themes. ==Implementation== There are three common methods for achieving pseudo-transparency using Xlib, each with its own advantages and drawbacks. ===Parental-relative=== The \\"parental-relative\\" method uses \`XSetWindowBackgroundPixmap()\` to inherit the parent window's background image. Unfortunately, using this method, the X server permits very few operations to be performed on the background pixmap (such as XOR), preventing clients from implementing any sort of advanced image filtering. ===_XROOTPMAP_ID and ESETROOT_PMAP_ID properties=== These properties are used to inform the window where it can find the pixmap used on the root window. Using this information, a client can paint a section of the image (corresponding to the size and position of the window) onto its background, achieving the effect of transparency. This method uses the most memory, but has the advantage of allowing clients to perform any operation, such as tinting or shading, on the image data. ===XCopyArea=== XCopyArea can achieve a more realistic transparency effect in that it can include obscured windows, but with the significant disadvantage that it is only usable with modal windows. This method simply uses the \`XCopyArea()\` function to take a partial screenshot for use as the window's background pixmap. ==Future== Recent technologies such as DirectFB, Direct Rendering Infrastructure, and hardware compositing via OpenGL allow X client applications to utilize true alpha transparency. ==References== Category:X Window System ","title":"Pseudo-transparency"},{"id":"1281576","text":"1969 Chevrolet Camaro SS with distinctive \\"SS\\" badge on the grille in place of the \\"bowtie\\" Super Sport, or SS, is the signature performance option package offered by Chevrolet on a limited number of its vehicles.

In early 1957, the Chevrolet Corvette SS debuted — a custom built racing sports car that was the first Chevrolet to wear the SS badge. In 1961, the SS \\"kit\\" (known as a sport and appearance package) was offered on any Impala for just $53.80. The package included Super Sport trim for both the interior and exterior, chassis reinforcements, stronger springs and shocks, power brakes, spinner wheel covers, and narrow-band whitewall tires. The car's dashboard received a Corvette style passenger hand bar and a steering column mounted 7000-rpm tachometer. Chevrolet built 491,000 Impalas that year and 453 had the SS package, of which 311 received the 348 cid and 142 received the 409 cid.http://musclecars.howstuffworks.com/classic-muscle-cars/1961-chevrolet- impala-ss-409.htm Since 1994, the SS package has been used on a variety of GM vehicles, including pickup trucks, four-door sedans, and front wheel drive cars. Both historically and today, the Super Sport package has typically included high-performance tires, heavy-duty suspension, and increased power, along with a variety of other performance and appearance upgrades.

A rear wheel drive sports car with a modern 430 hp small-block V8 engine and race-tuned suspension, it was billed as \\"a modern interpretation of Chevrolet's Super Sport heritage\\". Though never intended for production, the vehicle was used as a show car and to hint at what was ahead for Chevrolet sports car design. ==Collectors market== It is usually easy to visually differentiate an SS from a \\"plain- Jane\\" model. However, it is more difficult to tell the difference between a genuine SS and a \\"clone\\", a non-SS vehicle that has been altered to look like an SS. Because of the number of SS clones in the marketplace, potential buyers are advised to do their research and contact their local car clubs for help to ensure that the vehicle is a true SS by running the VIN codes and casting numbers on the engine (this also includes the vehicle's build sheet especially if the SS package was a factory option). Other non-SS vehicles altered to appear like them only use trim panels rather than aftermarket mechanical parts. ==References== ==External links== * RSportsCars: Chevrolet SS Concept Car * Super Sport Camaros Category:Chevrolet Category:Muscle cars Category:Official motorsports and performance division of automakers ","title":"Super Sport (Chevrolet)"},{"id":"1281578","text":"The Semois (Simwès in Walloon, often under elided form Smwès; Semoy, Sesbach in German, Setzbaach in Luxemburgish of Arlon; and known as the Semoy in France) is a river flowing from the Ardennes uplands of Belgium and France towards the Meuse, of which it is a right tributary.

A member of the Conservative Party, he was Member of Parliament (MP) for Wantage from 2005 to 2019. ==Early life== Vaizey is the son of the late John Vaizey, a Labour life peer, and the art historian Marina Vaizey (The Lady Vaizey CBE). His father's family is from South London. He spent part of his childhood growing up in Berkshire. He was educated at St Paul's School, London, before reading History at Merton College, Oxford. Elected Librarian (Vice-President) of the Oxford Union, he graduated with an upper second class degree. After leaving Oxford, he worked for the Conservative parliamentarians Kenneth Clarke and Michael Howard as an adviser on employment and education issues. He then practised as a barrister for several years, specialising in family law and child care.Debrett's People of Today ==Politics== Vaizey first stood for Parliament at the 1997 general election, when he was the candidate for Bristol East. In the 2001 UK general election, he acted as an election aide to Iain Duncan Smith. He stood at the 2002 local elections for the safe Labour ward of Harrow Road in the City of Westminster. He is regarded as a moderniser within the Conservative Party, contributing in both policy and image terms. He was a speechwriter for Michael Howard, Leader of the Conservative Party until December 2004, and editor of the Blue Books series which looked into new approaches to Conservative policy in areas such as health and transport. Vaizey was one of Michael Howard's inner circle of advisers and a member of a group of Young Conservatives somewhat disparagingly referred to as the \\"Notting Hill Set\\" along with David Cameron—elected party leader in December 2005—George Osborne, Michael Gove, Nicholas Boles and Rachel Whetstone. Like Gove and Boles, he is a fellow of the Henry Jackson Society, and is also a vice-chairman of Conservative Friends of Poland.Conservative Friends of Poland website ===Member of Parliament=== In 2002, Vaizey was selected by Wantage Conservative Association to be its candidate for the 2005 general election to succeed the sitting MP, Robert Jackson, who subsequently crossed the floor to Labour. Vaizey won a two-thirds majority in the final ballot of members and was elected as Member of Parliament in that election, receiving 22,394 votes. His majority was 8,017 over the Liberal Democrats, this represented 43% of the voters and a 1.9% swing from the Liberal Democrats to the Conservatives. When first elected to the House of Commons, Vaizey became a member of the Standing Committee on the Consumer Credit Bill. Before being appointed to the Opposition frontbench he was a member of the Modernisation and Environmental Audit Select Committees and was Deputy Chairman of the Conservative's Globalisation and Global Poverty Policy Group. In November 2006, Vaizey was appointed to the Conservative frontbench as a Shadow Minister for Culture, overseeing Arts and Broadcasting policy. In the 2010 general election he received a vote of 29,284, which was 52% of the votes cast, winning an increased majority of 13,457. While the Conservative Party was in negotiations with the Lib Dems in the days after 6 May 2010, Vaizey was appearing regularly on television putting forward the Conservative viewpoint. In the 2015 general election Vaizey increased his majority to 21,749. In the 2017 general election Vaizey's majority was reduced but his share of the vote increased to 54.2%. Vaizey was one of the group of 21 MPs who had the Conservative Whip removed in September 2019, sitting as an independent politician until having the whip restored on 29 October 2019.

Vaizey was the longest serving Minister of Culture since the post was created in 1964, serving a total of 2,255 days, exceeding the total set by the first incumbent, Jennie Lee, by 186 days. Upon leaving office, over 150 senior figures from the arts and creative industries wrote to the Daily Telegraph to express their thanks for his service as Minister for Culture and the Digital Economy. In 2011 he was mistakenly informed that he was to be Trade Minister, a post actually intended for Ed Davey. Vaizey supported continued membership of the European Union in the 2016 referendum and is supportive of the European Atomic Energy Community (Euratom). As a Minister, Vaizey upheld the policy of free entry to the UK's national museums. Towards the end of his tenure, the Treasury introduced tax credits for theatre, orchestras and museums. Vaizey also secured £150 million in capital funding from the Treasury to help reform museum storage. He oversaw the separation of English Heritage into two arms – a regulator, now known as Historic England, and a charity, English Heritage. Vaizey also held responsibility for the creative industries, and ensured the continuance of the film tax credits, as well as the introduction of tax credits for video games, television and visual effects. As a result, the film industry became the second highest contributor to growth in the service sector in 2017, growing by 72.4% since 2014, compared to European growth of 8.5%. During his tenure, the creative industries grew at three times the rate of the UK economy as a whole. He was dismissed as a Minister by Theresa May on 14 July 2016, and returned to the backbenches. He was appointed a member of the Privy Council in July 2016. ===Expense claims=== The Hon. Ed Vaizey MP in 2013 On 18 May 2009, The Daily Telegraph reported that receipts submitted by Vaizey show that he ordered a £467 sofa, a £544 chair, a £280.50 low table and a £671 table in February 2007 from Oka, a furniture shop run by Annabel Astor. The Commons Fees Office initially rejected the claim as the receipt said that the furniture was due to be delivered to Vaizey's home address in West London, but was later paid when Vaizey advised the Fees Office that the furniture was intended for his second home at his Wantage constituency. Vaizey told The Daily Telegraph that he and his wife \\"had it delivered to London because we would be in to collect it and we were driving down with it\\". When these claims became public, Vaizey said that he had repaid the cost of the Oka furniture and the antique chair which he had bought with taxpayers' money: \\"I accept that the £300 armchair was an antique item and therefore that claim should not have been made. I also accept that the Oka items could be deemed as being of higher quality than necessary. I have paid back both these claims. I have not claimed for any other furniture bought for my constituency home at any time before or since.\\" Vaizey has described himself as \\"relatively affluent\\". In November 2011, it was further reported that Vaizey had submitted expenses claims of 8p for a 350-yard car journey and 16p for a 700-yard journey. === Peerage === It was announced on 31 July 2020, that Vaizey was to be raised to the peerage in the 2019 Dissolution Honours. He was created Baron Vaizey of Didcot, of Wantage in the County of Oxfordshire in the afternoon of 1 September. He made his maiden speech in House of Lords on 21st September 2020. ==Media career== Vaizey has been a regular commentator for the Conservative Party in the broadcast and news media.

On 24 September 2010, Vaizey was named tenth in the 2010 Guardian Film Power 100 list. He played a cameo role as an Oxfordshire MP in the 2012 film Tortoise in Love. ==Other work== Subsequent to leaving office as Minister for Culture, Communications and Creative Industries, Vaizey became a trustee of the National Youth Theatre and the international charity BritDoc, which supports long-form documentary making, both of which roles are unpaid. Vaizey is also a trustee of London Music Masters, a charity which provides children from disadvantaged backgrounds access to a high quality music education. He was appointed the unpaid chairman of Creative Fuse NE, a programme overseen by five universities in the north east of England to look at the importance of fusing creativity and technology. Vaizey took a role with LionTree Advisors who paid a salary of £50,000 for one day's work per week. The Advisory Committee on Business Appointments approved his application to work for the investment bank, which specialises in media and technology mergers and acquisitions, despite Vaizey's having met the firm on \\"official business\\" three times in his final months as minister. ==Bibliography== *A Blue Tomorrow – New Visions for Modern Conservatives (2001) (ed. with Michael Gove and Nicholas Boles). *Blue Book on Health: Conservative Visions for Health Policy (2002) *Blue Book on Transport: Conservative Visions for Transport Policy (ed with Michael McManus) (2002) *Blue Book on Education (ed with Michael McManus) (2003) ==Titles and Styles== * 5 June 1968 — 22 June 1976: Mr. Edward Henry Butler Vaizey * 23 June 1976 – 4 May 2005: The Honourable Edward Henry Butler Vaizey * 5 May 2005 — July 2016: The Honourable Edward Henry Butler Vaizey, M.P. * July 2016 — November 2019: The Right Honourable Edward Henry Butler Vaizey, M.P. * November 2019 — August 2020: The Right Honourable Edward Henry Butler Vaizey * September 2020 onwards The Right Honourable The Lord Vaizey of Didcot, P.C. ==Arms== == See also == * John Vaizey, Baron Vaizey ==References== ==External links== *Official website *Profile at the Conservative Party *Wantage and Didcot Conservatives * * * Video game industry interview with Ed Vaizey, Bruceongames, 27 July 2009 *Art interview with Ed Vaizey, Artforums.co.uk, 15 December 2009 Category:1968 births Category:Alumni of Merton College, Oxford Category:British male journalists Category:British special advisers Category:Conservative Party (UK) life peers Category:Conservative Party (UK) MPs for English constituencies Category:Eldest sons of barons Category:English barristers Category:English people of American descent Category:English people of Jewish descent Category:Government ministers of the United Kingdom Category:Living people Category:Members of the Middle Temple Category:Members of the Privy Council of the United Kingdom Category:People from Berkshire Category:People from Wantage Category:People from Essex Category:People educated at Colet Court Category:People educated at St Paul's School, London Category:The Guardian journalists Category:The Sunday Times people Category:The Times people Category:UK MPs 2005–2010 Category:UK MPs 2010–2015 Category:UK MPs 2015–2017 Category:UK MPs 2017–2019 ","title":"Ed Vaizey"},{"id":"1281614","text":"Andrew Voss (born 7 September 1966) is an Australian rugby league commentator who works for Fox League.

The area corresponds roughly to the upland area called Elenydd in Welsh and also referred to locally as the Cambrian Mountains. ==Extent== In this case the word \\"desert\\" is used in the sense of an area uninhabited by humans (as in \\"desert island\\"), not in the sense of an arid desert. The area has high rainfall and much of it is covered by peat overlain with purple moor grass and heather moorland, or by plantations of non-native conifers. The soil tends to be acidic.Ceredigion, A Wealth of History by Gerald Morgan There is no exact definition of the extent of the Desert of Wales, but it is bordered to the east by the A470 and the town of Rhayader, to the south by the A483 from Builth Wells to Llanwrda, to the west by the A482 from Llanwrda to Pumpsaint, and from there northwards by a series of country roads up to Tregaron. The northern boundary is generally taken to be the A44 between Ponterwyd and Llangurig, although the substantial area of moorland to the north of this road, including the reservoirs of Nant y Moch and Llyn Clywedog, has similar topography. ==History== The term Desert of Wales has been used to describe the area since before 1860 when the following was written by John Henry Cliffe: > The locality we were now traversing is one of the most untamed and desolate > in either division of the Principality; it has indeed with perfect truth > been called the \\"great desert of Wales.\\" Vast sweeping ranges of hills with > round tops, add to the dreary aspect of this nearly unpeopled > region...Solitudes of Wales Travel is limited to narrow roads, forestry tracks, footpaths and bridleways.

Accessed 21 June 2017. ;Academic career In 1873 Kurth became the first person to be awarded the \\"special doctorate in historical sciences\\", for a dissertation on Cato the Elder. The same year, he became chair of Medieval History and Belgian History at the University of Liège. One of his students, Henri Pirenne, became a noted historian. Léon-Ernest Halkin considered them the founders of the scientific method of history in Belgium. Kurth modelled his pedagogy on that instituted by the German historian Leopold von Ranke at the University of Berlin. On 7 May 1894 he was elected a member of the Royal Academy of Science, Letters and Fine Arts of Belgium.Godefroid Joseph François Kurth, website of the Royal Academy of Belgium.

He was a member of the committee that organised the Exposition de l'art ancien au Pays de Liége for the 1905 International exposition in Liège.Preliminary matter, in Exposition de l'art ancien au pays de Liège : catalogue général (Liège, Aug. Bénard, 1905). In 1906 Kurth was promoted to emeritus status and left the university to take up the position of director of the Belgian Historical Institute in Rome. In 1908 a Festschrift was published in his honour, Mélanges Godefriod Kurth (Université de Liége, 1908).Available online through the Internet Archive. Accessed 24 June 2017. Halkin said of him, \\"Godefroid Kurth [was] the last of the romantic historians and the first of the 'technical' historians in Belgium\\".Quoted in Jean-Louis Kupper, Godefroid Kurth and Henri Pirenne: An improbable friendship, Journal of Belgian History, 41:3–4 (2011), pp. 411–426. ;Political and social thought In Liège, Kurth encountered difficulties because of his strongly held Catholic views, which were considered ultramontane by his contemporaries. He was an active member of the Society of Saint Vincent de Paul. In 1873 he was elected president of the Cercle catholique de l'Est, one of the predecessor bodies to the Catholic Party, which Kurth played a role in founding. He was also a pioneer of Christian democracy, helping organise the Social Congresses held in Liège in 1886, 1887 and 1890 that gave shape to Catholic social teaching. His study of the medieval guild system brought an increased appreciation of the principles of charity. brotherhood and justice. Published in 1886, Les Origines de la civilisation moderne brought him an international reputation but was controversial in drawing a direct connection between the \\"civilizing principle\\" of Christianity and the development of modern civilization. ;Death Kurth, who had strong links with the German Centre Party and with German colleagues, was repulsed by the German invasion of Belgium and the accompanying atrocities. Over the summer and autumn of 1915 he gathered testimony of the atrocities, including the killings at Aarschot, but was placed in detention by the Germans in an unheated location. He contracted pneumonia, and died at Asse on 4 January 1916. He was provisionally buried in Asse, and later exhumed and reburied in Arlon. There are streets named after him in both Arlon, Asse and Liège. His work on the atrocities was published posthumously as Le Guet-apens prussien en Belgique (\\"The Prussian Ambush in Belgium\\"). Cardinal Désiré-Joseph Mercier wrote in the preface that Kurth, whose family origins were German, was \\"overwhelmed by the invasion, its iniquity, its atrocities, its sham\\". ==Honours and awards== * Prix quinquennal des Sciences historiques (1891) * Commander in the Order of St Gregory the Great (1906) * Commander in the Order of Leopold (1907) * Honorary Doctorate of the Catholic University of Leuven (1912) ==Works== Godefroid Kurth wrote over 500 books and journal articles, including contributions to the Catholic Encyclopedia.

They were the kanji declared \\"official\\", i.e. characters that could be used in official government documents, by the Japanese on November 16, 1946. The 1,850-character list was not meant to be exhaustive, as many characters that were in common use at the time, and are today, were not included. It was meant as a baseline for satisfactory functional literacy in Japanese at a secondary education level, as all of the listed characters were to be taught nationwide in compulsory education. They were replaced in 1981 by the Jōyō kanji, which initially included 1,945 characters, but was expanded to 2,136 characters in 2010 following several revisions. ==Reform== Thousands of kanji characters were in use in various writing systems, leading to great difficulties for those learning written Japanese. Additionally, several characters had identical meanings but were written differently from each other, further increasing complexity. After World War II, the Ministry of Education decided to minimize the number of kanji by choosing the most commonly used kanji, along with simplified kanji (see Shinjitai) commonly appearing in contemporary literature, to form the tōyō kanji. This was an integral part of the postwar reform of Japanese national writing. This was meant as a preparation for re- introducing their previous unsuccessful reform abolishing Chinese characters. Although the postwar timing meant no public debate was held on the future of the Japanese written language, the defenders of the original kanji system considered and accepted the tōyō kanji as a reasonable compromise. Since this compromise could not then be withdrawn in favour of more radical reform, discussion of kanji abolition ended. Thirty-five years passed before further reforms were brought to the Japanese written form. The table of the pronunciations of the kanji was published in 1948 and the exposition of altered character forms (Shinjitai) in 1949. In 1981, the Ministry of Education decided to replace the tōyō kanji with a more flexible system, leading to the publication of the jōyō kanji. This rendered the tōyō kanji obsolete. ==Applications and limitations== In addition to a list of the standardized tōyō kanji, the reform published by the Ministry for Education in 1946 also contains a set of guidelines for their use. Regarding provenance and scope, the foreword of the document states that: *The table of tōyō kanji put forth therein, are the selection of kanji recommended for use by the general public, including legal and governmental documents, newspapers, and magazines. *The presented kanji are selected as an approximate set of those characters found to be of no insignificant utility in the lives of today's Japanese citizens. *Concerning proper nouns, there is a wide range of usage beyond what may be formulated as rules, and consequently they are treated as outside the scope of this standard. *The simplified character forms from modern custom are taken as the proper form, and their original forms are provided alongside them for reference. *A systemization of the character forms and their readings is still under consideration (this referring to the later 1948 and 1949 publications that addressed these points in detail). Regarding guidelines for use, it continues: *If the kanji set forth in this standard do not suffice for the writing of a word, then either a different word should be substituted, or else the word shall be written in kana. *Write pronouns, adverbs, conjunctions, interjections, auxiliary verbs, and particles using kana as much as possible (normally hiragana is used for these). *Foreign placenames and people's names are to be written in kana, except that traditional usage examples such as 米国 (beikoku, America) or 英国 (eikoku, England) are permitted. *Words of foreign origin are to be written in kana (katakana is customarily used, but exceptions occur). *Names of plants and animals should be written in kana (katakana is frequently but not ubiquitously used for these). *Ateji (words like 玉子 (tamago, egg) and 多分 (tabun, probably) that use the characters for their sounds, ignoring meaning) are to be written in kana. (This rule is not widely followed in practice.) *As a general rule, furigana should not be used. *Concerning technical and specialized terminology, it is hoped that the list of characters prescribed by the list of tōyō kanji will serve as a template for further standardization (acknowledging that the tōyō list may be insufficient for these applications, but should be used to guide more complete de facto standards). (In the above, parenthetical remarks are used for exposition and do not reflect text that is present in the document.) ==Mazegaki== Because the majority of character-based words are composed of two (or more) kanji, many words were left with one character included in the Tōyō kanji, and the other character missing. In this case, the recommendation was to write the included part in kanji and the excluded part in kana, e.g. ふ頭 for 埠頭 and 危ぐ for 危惧. These words were called . ==List of the 1,850 tōyō kanji== Bold in 1981 and 2010 year added kanji ==See also== * Japanese orthography issues * Japanese script reform ==External links== *Pronunciation of the Kanji *Statement of the Ministry of Education from 1946 *Official table of the characters Category:Kanji ","title":"Tōyō kanji"},{"id":"1281628","text":"{{Infobox university  name = De La Salle–College of Saint Benilde  native_name = Dalubhasaan ng De La Salle San Benildo  image = DLSCSB seal.svg  motto = Religio, Mores, Cultura ()  mottoeng = Religion, Morals, Culture  former_names = College of Career Development (1980–1988) De La Salle University-College of Saint Benilde (1988–2004)  established =  type = Private, Catholic, research, non-stock, coeducational higher education institution  religious_affiliation = Roman Catholic (Christian Brothers)  president =  chancellor = Robert L.

In 1984, the Preparatory Studies Department (PSD) was established to allow students to cope with the requirements in subsequent degree-oriented courses in regular undergraduate colleges.DLSU-College of Saint Benilde Interactive. Development and Communications Office. 2003 In 1985, the college was renamed the Community College. In May 1987, the PSD was phased out and replaced by the Arts and Business Studies Area (ABSA). The ABSA offered two courses: a Bachelor of Arts degree in Management with emphasis on Human Resources Management and a Bachelor of Science degree in Business Administration, major in Computer Applications. ===Under De La Salle University (1988–1994)=== The Community College was officially renamed De La Salle University-College of Saint Benilde in 1988, after the establishment of the De La Salle University System. Saint Bénilde Romançon was selected as the namesake to symbolize its objective of providing innovative education for the verbally but not numerically gifted, late bloomers, handicapped, as well as artists. Bénilde made room for his students in Clermont-Ferrand, regardless of their age or their mental capabilities. He also learnt sign language to instruct a deaf-mute boy for his first Holy Communion.CSB'S Original Vision, excerpts from the paper of Br. Andrew Gonzalez FSC. DLSU-CSB Newsletter. August 10, 1992 The ABSA was renamed as the Arts and Business Studies Department (ABSD) and became the day program of the college, while the Career Development Department (CDD) remained as the college's evening program. Because of the need for more space, the college moved to its own campus at 2544 Taft Avenue in 1989. A third major program, a Bachelor of Arts degree in Interdisciplinary Studies, was offered, undertaken in consortium with the College of Liberal Arts. In 1991, the college offered certificate programs in Accounting and Bookkeeping for the deaf, and a Bachelor of Science degree in Industrial Design. ===As an autonomous college (1994–2005)=== { style=\\"float:right; margin:1em; width:19em; border:1px solid #a0a0a0; padding:3px; bg-color=yellow; text-align:right;\\" - 060; text-align:center;\\" Presidents of De La Salle–College of Saint Benilde - style=\\"text-align:center; font- size:x-small;\\" Under De La Salle University-Manila - style=\\"text-align:left; font-size:x-small;\\" • Br.

Edmundo Fernandez FSC, incumbent } The College of Saint Benilde became an autonomous member of the De La Salle University System in April 1994. It ratified its proposed Constitution and By Laws, and identified Benildean core values in November 1994. The Night College, a scholarship program, was transferred from De La Salle University-Manila to the college in 1995. In the same year, the School of Design and Arts (SDA) was established, and the following degrees were offered: Bachelor of Science in Interior Design in consortium with the Philippine School of Interior Design, Bachelor of Arts, Major in Production Design, Bachelor of Arts, Major in Technical Theater, Bachelor of Arts, Major in Arts Management, and Bachelor of Performing Arts, Major in Dance. In 1996, the School of Hotel, Restaurant, and Institution Management was formed, and groundbreaking ceremonies for the Angelo King International Center building were held. The following degrees were first offered in the same year: Bachelor of Science in Business Administration, Major in Export Management; Bachelor of Science in Hotel, Restaurant and Institution Management; Bachelor of Arts, Major in Fashion Design and Merchandising; Bachelor of Arts, Major in Consular and Diplomatic Affairs, and the Bachelor of Arts in Applied Deaf Studies. The college also established the Certificate Program Center (CPC) which offered short courses, and the Grants- in-Aid Program to provide financial assistance to students in need. In 1997, the administration of the vocational programs of the Night College of the De La Salle University was passed on to the college in June and was renamed as the Blessed Arnould Study Assistance Program in September. In October 1997, the college held its first graduation rites independent from De La Salle University. In the same year, the college established the School of Special Studies for deaf students. In March 1998, the NCAA accepted the college's application for membership to the sports league along with La Salle Green Hills athletes as its high school representatives. In 1999, the School of Design and Arts offered the Bachelor of Arts in Multimedia Arts degree, the first of its kind in the country. Later that year, the construction of the Angelo King International Center was completed, which then housed the School of Hotel, Restaurant, and Institution Management. In 2000, the college won its first Men's Basketball championship title in the NCAA, marking the fastest win of any new school in the league since World War II. The college offered a BSBA degree in Information Management and a Bachelor of Arts in Music Production degree, a first of its kind. In the same year, the college held bidding for the architect of the proposed School of Design and Arts building.Shrine to cutting-edge creativity Philippine Daily Inquirer, October 24, 2007 In 2001, the School of Special Studies was renamed as the School of Deaf Education and Applied Studies (SDEAS). A year later, the SDEAS was invited to become a member of the Post-Secondary Education Network-International. In 2004, the non-university members of the DLSU System — Canlubang, and Medical and Health Sciences Campus — removed the term \\"University\\" from their names. The college then restated its mission and vision and was renamed De La Salle–College of Saint Benilde. Construction for the 14-storey School of Design and Arts campus was started in this year.A design student’s utopia The Manila Times August 12, 2007 The Certificate Program Center was expanded and renamed into the School of Professional and Continuing Education.

It took place at the village of Rais, near Sidi Moussa and south of Algiers. The initial official death toll was 98 people killed and 120 wounded; CNN said that hospital workers and witnesses gave a toll of at least 200, and up to 400. The figure given by the Algerian government to the UN Commission on Human Rights (E/CN.4/2000/3/Add.1) was 238. The BBC later quoted the figure of 800 killed . In 1997, Algeria was at the peak of a brutal civil conflict that had begun after the military's cancellation of 1992 elections set to be won by the Islamic Salvation Front (FIS). The poor farming village of Rais had mostly voted for FIS and had a history of supporting Islamist guerrillas in the region, but (according to a villager quoted by PBS) had recently stopped providing them with food and money. The hooded attackers arrived about 1 am in trucks and cars, armed with shotguns, knives, axes, and bombs. They continued killing the village's men, women, children, and even animals until dawn (about 6 am), cutting throats and taking the time to burn corpses; young women, however, were abducted instead of being killed. In some cases, they left severed heads on doorsteps. They mutilated and stole from the dead, and committed atrocities against pregnant women. They burned and bombed some houses. The villagers tried to flee or hide. Army units stayed outside the village, shooting at fleeing villagers, but not attempting to enter the village until after the attackers, carrying away some 20 young women, left at dawn. Responsibility was claimed for this, as for the Bentalha massacre, by the Armed Islamic Group (GIA). In An Inquiry into the Algerian Massacres (a book arguing that the GIA had become a tool of the state) two survivors are quoted as reporting that the killers were dressed like \\"Afghans\\", with turbans, covered faces, beards (some false), and uniforms, that the attackers were also cursing God throughout, and that among them were a few women, wearing hijab over a uniform. These accounts (which can be read below) appear not to be corroborated by major media outlets. The government vowed to \\"continue to struggle without mercy against the barbarous criminals until their eradication\\", announcing a massive manhunt and new measures to reinforce rural security. Amnesty International expressed concern regarding the government response, noting that \\"the massacre site is surrounded by army barracks and security forces posts, located between a few hundreds metres and a few kilometers away\\", including an army barracks 100 metres away, and quoting a survivor as saying \\"The army and the security forces were right there; they heard and saw everything and did nothing, and they let the terrorists leave.\\" The Prime Minister, Ahmed Ouyahia, retorted to ITN that \\"the army, the national guard intervened, intervened as quickly as it was possible.\\" The authorities cited concern regarding the possible presence of mines and ambushes; however, a rescue worker interviewed by Human Rights Watch said that the first gendarmes there had not taken any precautions against possible mines as they drove in. The Algerian government told the UN Commission on Human Rights (E/CN.4/2000/3/Add.1) that \\"A judicial inquiry was opened by the Larbâa court and the four perpetrators of the massacre identified. Search warrants were issued by the examining magistrate on 30 May 1998.\\" How four attackers killed 238 people is not made clear. The village's population had already dropped from 1000 before the conflict began to 200 after the massacre; many of the remainder left following this massacre. Some of those who remained were given arms by the government for future self- defense, according to La Tribune, which quotes residents opposing Abdelaziz Bouteflika's amnesty to certain members of the armed groups (the Law of National Reconciliation), fearing that it would include murderers like those who killed their neighbors. ==See also== * List of massacres in Algeria * List of Algerian massacres of the 1990s ==External links== * CNN * AP * NYT * PBS NewsHour * Amnesty International * Rais, Bentalha - one year later - a poem by Assia Djebar * Surviving children's response - Algerian Red Crescent * 2 eyewitness accounts according to the LADDH * La Tribune * Human Rights Watch * BBC * BBC - 8 years on Category:Algerian massacres of the 1990s Category:1997 in Algeria Category:Conflicts in 1997 Category:Mass murder in 1997 Category:August 1997 events in Africa ","title":"Rais massacre"},{"id":"1281655","text":"The is the guide to kanji characters and their readings, announced officially by the Japanese Ministry of Education. Current jōyō kanji are those on a list of 2,136 characters issued in 2010. It is a slightly modified version of the tōyō kanji, which was the initial list of secondary school-level kanji standardized after World War II. The list is not a comprehensive list of all characters and readings in regular use; rather, it is intended as a literacy baseline for those who have completed compulsory education, as well as a list of permitted characters and readings for use in official government documents. Due to the requirement that official government documents make use of only jōyō kanji and their readings, several rare characters are also included by dint of being a part of the Constitution of Japan, which was being written at the same time the original 1,850-character tōyō kanji list was compiled. The 2,136 kanji in the jōyō kanji consist of: * 1,026 kanji taught in primary school (Grade 1-6) (the kyōiku kanji) * 1,110 additional kanji taught in secondary school (Grade 7-12) ==Changes from the tōyō kanji== In 1981, the jōyō kanji replaced the tōyō kanji as the standardized list of common kanji.

The public relations element of Megamarketing focuses primarily on businesses familiarizing themselves with the surrounding community, prior to actually entering a desired market. Of note, the negotiations that occur as a consequence of this particular form of marketing are often far more rigorous than those associated with conventional marketing; as such, it is difficult to adequately satisfy both parties in an equitable manner. Marketers who choose to pursue these foreign environments must also look to appease the general public, as they can have a significant impact on the continuing profitability of their businesses. One important element comprising the general public involves the local media, as they can heavily influence the perception associated with newly emerging companies. Contrarily, the power variable also proposed by Philip Kotler deals more so with the power to persuade third parties. This includes offering the correct incentives to entice expansion into foreign markets, in doing so, allowing for a controlling position when conducting business. Kotler's framework for power elucidates the importance of establishing strong ties with powerful political members in external markets; this, in turn, should enable ease of access to engage in commerce with these particular countries. Furthermore, this particular aspect of Megamarketing examines the means by which marketers go about incentivizing third parties, such as government organizations, in order to circumvent entry barriers. If businesses are to successfully adopt this nuanced marketing strategy, it is important that they diversify their business operations and broaden their business scope within the marketplace. This, of course, must be executed whilst continuing to meet the demands of the consumers in the various markets. Additionally, Megamarketing success can be attained through acquiring employees with the correct skill sets; likewise, having a desirable mix of resources on hand at the companies disposal. This broadened form of marketing is typically associated with a long-decision making process; this can be attributed to the fact that it takes a substantial amount of time to coordinate meetings at the same time requiring larger sums of money in an attempt to finance these augmented business endeavors. Megamarketing is different from traditional marketing in that its primary objective is grounded in expanding operations into external markets. This, in turn, makes it conducive to companies seeking foreign expansion to introduce new products and services to broaden consumer demands. In essence, it seeks to transform the types of industries that are prevalent in an existing market, however, these changes can often come at the expense of over imposing on others. So much so, in fact, that many Megamarketers run the risk of being perceived in a more negative light ==References== ==External links== *Materials from Harvard Business Online * * Category:Marketing strategy ","title":"Megamarketing"},{"id":"1281673","text":"ARTEXPRESS is an art exhibition which is a showcase of Higher School Certificate Visual Arts Examination artworks from across New South Wales, Australia.

BREIN () is an association in which the Dutch recording industry and movie studios participate. ==Participants== Several organizations or rights holders in the Entertainment Industry are participants in the organization. Those are amongst others: * Buma/Stemra * Nederlandse Vereniging van Producenten en Importeurs van Beeld- en Geluidsdragers * Motion Pictures Association * Nederlandse Vereniging van Filmdistributeurs * Bridge Entertainment Group B.V. * Nederlandse Vereniging van Bioscoopexploitanten * Stichting Videma * Nederlandse Vereniging van Entertainment Retailers * Nederlandse Uitgeversverbond ==Shutdowns of alleged piracy sites== BREIN is known for shutting down Dutch eDonkey 2000 link giant ShareConnector in December 2004. Due to controversy over the legality of links to illegal content, and a lack of quality in the evidence provided by BREIN, the case was not put to trial for several years. After being offline for two years, ShareConnector reopened in December 2006 but on November 12, 2007, Shareconnector went offline again. On March 16, 2010 the Amsterdam Court of Appeal ruled that sites that offer hash links (like .torrent links) were facilitating copyright infringement, an unlawful behavior. Shareconnector did not make the content available to the public because they did not have control over the content itself and they did not interfere in the up- and downloading process. However, the Court of Appeal ruled that the site was illegal because their procedure made it easier for users to retrieve the illegal content from the eDonkey network. On October 23, 2007 BREIN, together with IFPI, BPI, Dutch police, and other organizations shut down prominent Bittorrent tracker Oink's Pink Palace. In a civil court case which BREIN filed in the Netherlands against the founders of The Pirate Bay, on 22 October 2009 the Amsterdam District Court ruled that The Pirate Bay was not making a direct infringement but its facilitating activities amount to an unlawful act. The Court ordered The Pirate Bay to remove a list of torrents that link to copyright-protected works in the Netherlands and to make these torrents on its websites inaccessible for Internet users in the Netherlands. The Pirate Bay ignored the verdict. In January 2012 BREIN announced that a Dutch court had ordered Ziggo and XS4ALL to block all access to The Pirate Bay.John Eggerton, (13 January 2012) Netherlands court ruled last week that Dutch ISPs Ziggo and XS4All must block access to web site The Pirate Bay Broadcasting & Cable On May 10, 2012 this judgement was followed by a court order of the District Court in The Hague against UPC, KPN, T-Mobile and Tele2 to also block The Pirate Bay for their customers. Ziggo and XS4ALL appealed this verdict and won, with BREIN being ordered to pay 326,000 Euro as a compensation for process costs. ==Lawsuit by FTD== After a series of allegations that Usenet community Fill Threads Database (FTD) was acting illegally, the Dutch FTD started a lawsuit against BREIN in May 2009. BREIN president Tim Kuik alleged in a Dutch newspaper that \\"Although they [FTD] are not carrying illegal content on their servers, what FTD does is simply criminal\\". FTD is suing for a retraction of this libelous statement and demands a declaration from the courts that its activities are entirely within the law. On February 9, 2011 the Dutch District Court of Haarlem ruled, that FTD had acted unlawfully and issued an injunction. FTD was obliged to ban all references to files of BREIN members. The court also ruled that Tim Kuik was free to expose the conduct of FTD and communicate the opinion of BREIN. The request for rectification was therefore rejected by the court. FTD ceased all its operations a few weeks after the verdict. ==Alleged attack on BREIN website== On the 1 June 2009 Tim Kuik published an online article claiming BREIN's website was \\"broken\\" by hackers performing DDoS attacks. He speculated about a possible connection with the intended court summons against The Pirate Bay. Several independent sources reported the site's deep links were still available (only the frontpage was inaccessible) and as such BREIN's claim of having been attacked was false. Brein responded claiming the attacks had stopped and that the site's year old backup had been used to recover the site. Because the backup was dated, the website was now under construction. Internet blog Geenstijl purportedly discovered BREIN's server was still fully operational and there had been no attack whatsoever - the complete news archive was still available.BREIN liegt over aanvalStichting Brein liegt over DDoS aanvalWebsite Stichting BREIN werkt gewoon (A password was later added to BREIN's news archive to prevent further checks on availability.) On 23 June 2009 The Pirate Bay announced a lawsuit against Tim Kuik on libel charges, claiming The Pirate Bay had nothing to do with the alleged DDoS attack. ==Criticism== In September 2009 BREIN CEO Tim Kuik attracted controversy when in a news conference he stated he was using a laptop confiscated from a \\"pirate\\" and given to him by someone involved with the case. BREIN attracted controversy again when several suspicious aspects of their lawsuit against The Pirate Bay and Reservella were revealed, including evidence that documents used to link Fredrik Neij of The Pirate Bay to Reservella were faked. Peter Sunde and the Dutch Pirate Party filed criminal felony charges against both Tim Kuik and BREIN for fraud and forgery. In January 2011, BREIN targeted one of the Internet's largest warez piracy topsites. The site, known as Swan, was taken down by hosting provider WorldStream and without judicial process BREIN seized its servers. The owners of the servers retaliated by seizing them back and may sue BREIN for breach of privacy and property rights as BREIN is a private organization and has no special legal or investigative authority. ==References== ==External links== * Category:Entertainment industry associations Category:Organisations based in North Holland Category:Trade associations based in the Netherlands ","title":"BREIN"},{"id":"1281682","text":"The Swiss Football Association (, , , ) is the governing body of football in Switzerland.

Hudson Company, was a retail department store chain based in Detroit, Michigan. Hudson's flagship store, on Woodward Avenue in Downtown Detroit (demolished October 24, 1998), was the tallest department store in the world in 1961, and, at one time, claimed to be the second-largest department store, after Macy's, in the United States, by square footage. ==Growth== Founded in 1881 by Joseph Lowthian Hudson, the store thrived during the record growth of Detroit and the auto industry in the first half of the 20th century. In 1909, J.L. Hudson invested in a start-up automobile manufacturer which was named the Hudson Motor Car Company in his honor. The Hudson Motor Car Company eventually became part of the American Motors Corporation and later Chrysler. Hudson operated the store until his death in 1912, when his four nephews (James, Joseph, Oscar, and Richard Webber) assumed control. The third generation of the family assumed control in 1961, when Joseph L. Hudson, Jr., became president of the company. Over time, the store grew from its beginnings in the Detroit Opera House to a 25-story building with and occupying an entire city block. ==Policies== Hudson's was known for customer satisfaction and its liberal return policy that would include even merchandise that customers had purchased years earlier but never used. In 1952, Hudson's total sales were $175 million but issued refunds totaling $25 million. Store executives felt that to be a small price to pay for customer loyalty. In addition to cultivating loyalty through sales policies, Hudson's was involved in the community. In 1924, two years prior to rival Macy's, it staged its first Thanksgiving Parade, which continues today. In 1923, it unveiled the world's largest flag, which covered of the Woodward facade of the building. The flag was displayed annually until it was replaced, in 1949, by a larger flag. In 1959, the store began sponsorship of the annual fireworks display that was part of the International Freedom Festival. ==Locations== Hudson's Budget Store occupied two full basement levels of the downtown store as well as several branches. It had an independent staff of buyers, carried its own line of merchandise, and was considered the greatest competition to the big store. Hudson's expanded into suburban Detroit, starting with the anchor store at Northland Center in nearby Southfield, Michigan, the largest shopping center in the United States when it opened, in 1954. Similar suburban malls followed (Eastland Center in 1957 and Westland Center in 1965) as well as other locations throughout the tri-state region. The Dayton Co. of Minneapolis acquired The J.L. Hudson Co. in 1969 to form the Dayton–Hudson Corporation, but \\"The J.L. Hudson Co.\\" continued to operate as a semiautonomous entity. Dayton–Hudson eventually acquired and sold several other department store chains. ==Decline== Though customers flocked to the suburban locations, the downtown store still accounted for half of Hudson's business in 1961, but demographic changes continued to erode sales. Store officials even considered closing the store as early as 1971, citing $9,000,000 in pilferage, but decided to remain for fear of the potential backlash of city officials and customers. By 1978, they agreed to construct a smaller store of as part of a proposed downtown shopping center. Lack of interest from other retailers and funding problems shelved the center, and after many years of declining sales and consolidating selling space, the flagship Hudson's store closed January 17, 1983, at nearly the lowest point of Downtown Detroit's decline. After closure, Hudson's maintained its headquarters staff of about 1,100 in the downtown store. In May 1984, The J.L. Hudson Co. formally merged into The Department Store Division of the Dayton Hudson Corp., but Hudson's stores continued to carry the Hudson's name. All executive and buying positions transferred to Minneapolis, and other staff moved to space at the Northland store in Southfield. The last corporate department in the downtown Detroit building, credit operations, moved in October 1986. Dayton Hudson sold the building in December 1989, and it was imploded on October 24, 1998. Hudson's operated a large warehouse complex in an area bounded by Madison, Brush, Adams and Beacon Streets in Downtown Detroit. The buildings were constructed between the 1920s and the 1950s and averaged between four and six floors. In the early 1980s, Building 3 was sold and renovated into Madison Center, home for the 36th District Court. The remaining buildings in the complex closed in the late 1990s to make room for the new 65,000-seat stadium, Ford Field. Ford Field partially incorporated one of the warehouses into its design. The vacant site in Detroit between Woodward and Farmer Street and between E. Grand River and Gratiot was turned into an underground parking garage with supports in place for a future building. The address of the first Hudson's building on the lot was on Farmer, not at 1206 Woodward, the building's later and better-known address. In 2018 the parking garage at the former Hudson's site was demolished to make way for two new buildings on the former Hudson's site. One of these new buildings will be the tallest building in Michigan upon its completion, project height of 912 feet. In 2000, Dayton–Hudson Corporation took the name of its most successful operation, becoming Target Corporation, and one year, it later re-branded all Hudson's and Dayton's locations with the Marshall Field's moniker, an operation purchased by Dayton–Hudson in 1990. After being briefly owned by May Department Stores, the former Hudson's stores were acquired by Federated Department Stores in 2006 and all Marshall Field's stores were incorporated into the Macy's chain. Target still maintains a common law trademark in the use of Daytons.com and Hudsons.com, which both redirect to the Target website. ==See also== * Architecture of metropolitan Detroit * Dayton's * J.

Together with seven other stories, it was collected in His Last Bow (published 1917). ==Plot summary== Dr. Watson is called to tend Holmes, who is apparently dying of a rare tropical disease, Tapanuli fever, contracted while he was on a case. Watson is shocked, not having heard about his friend's illness. Mrs. Hudson says that Holmes has neither eaten nor drunk anything in three days. Holmes instructs Watson not to come near him, because the illness is highly infectious. In fact, he scorns to be treated by Watson and insults his abilities, astonishing and hurting the doctor. Although Watson wishes to examine Holmes himself or call in a specialist, Holmes demands that Watson wait several hours before seeking help. While Watson waits, he examines several objects in Holmes's room. Holmes grows angry when Watson touches items explaining that he does not like his things touched. At six o'clock, Holmes tells Watson to turn the gaslight on, but only half-full. He then instructs Watson to bring Mr Culverton Smith of 13 Lower Burke Street to see Holmes, but to make sure that Watson returns to Baker Street before Smith arrives. Watson goes to Smith's address. Although Smith refuses to see anyone, Watson forces his way in. Once Watson explains his errand on behalf of Sherlock Holmes, Smith's attitude changes drastically. Smith agrees to come to Baker Street within a half hour. Watson excuses himself, saying that he has another appointment, and returns to Baker Street before Smith's arrival. Believing that they are alone, Smith is frank with Holmes. It emerges, to the hiding Watson's horror, that Holmes has been sickened by the same illness that killed Smith's nephew Victor Savage. Smith then sees the little ivory box, which he had sent to Holmes by post, and which contains a sharp spring infected with the illness. Smith pockets it, removing the evidence of his crime. He then resolves to stay there and watch Holmes die. Holmes asks Smith to turn the gas up full, which Smith does. Smith then asks Holmes if he would like anything else, to which Holmes replies - no longer in the voice of a man near death - \\"a match and a cigarette.\\" Inspector Morton then enters - the full gaslight was the signal to move in. Holmes tells Morton to arrest Culverton Smith for the murder of his nephew, and perhaps also for the attempted murder of Sherlock Holmes. Smith points out that his word is as good as Holmes' in court, but Holmes then calls for Watson to emerge from behind the screen, to present himself as another witness to the conversation. Holmes explains his illness was feigned as a ruse to induce Smith to confess to his nephew's murder. Holmes was not infected by the little box; he has enough enemies to know that he must always examine his mail carefully before he opens it. Starving himself for three days and the claim of the \\"disease's\\" infectious nature was to keep Watson from examining him and discovering the ruse, since, as he clarifies, he has every respect for his friend's medical skills. ==Period details== In the story, the killer Culverton Smith's motive for killing his cousin, Victor Savage, is mentioned in an offhand remark by Holmes that Savage stood between \\"this monster [Smith] and a reversion.\\" The New Annotated Sherlock Holmes has a note for this word: The setting date may be inferred from Watson's mention of it being \\"the second year of my marriage\\", the first having been 1889. Inspector Morton is referred to in a familiar fashion but this is his only appearance in canon. Canonical scholar Leslie S. Klinger wondered if Morton was the companion to Inspector Brown in The Sign of the Four. Tropical disease specialist William A. Sodeman, Jr., proposed that \\"Tapanuli fever\\" was melioidosis, a conclusion supported by physician Setu K. Vora. Vora raised the possibility that Conan Doyle read the first report of melioidosis published in 1912 before writing his short story in 1913. ==Publication history== \\"The Adventure of the Dying Detective\\" was first published in the US in Collier's on 22 November 1913. It was first published in the UK in The Strand Magazine in December 1913.Smith (2014), p. 179. The story was published with three illustrations by Frederic Dorr Steele in Collier's, and with four illustrations by Walter Paget (Sidney Paget's brother) in the Strand.Cawthorne (2011), p. 145. The story was included in the short story collection His Last Bow, which was published in the UK and the US in October 1917.Cawthorne (2011), p. 151. ==Adaptations== ===Film and television=== * A 1921 short film adaptation was released in the Stoll film series starring Eille Norwood as Holmes. * A 1951 TV episode of We Present Alan Wheatley as Mr Sherlock Holmes in... was adapted from the story, starring Alan Wheatley as Holmes, Raymond Francis as Dr. Watson and Bill Owen as Inspector Lestrade. The episode is now lost. * A 1994 TV episode of The Memoirs of Sherlock Holmes starring Jeremy Brett as Holmes, Edward Hardwicke as Watson, and Jonathan Hyde as Culverton Smith was adapted from the story. This version is faithful to the original short story but greatly expanded. It features much more detail on Smith's nephew, who is instead portrayed as Smith's cousin, and replaces the infected spring with a pair of tacks. * The story was adapted as a 1999 episode of the animated television series Sherlock Holmes in the 22nd Century titled \\"The Adventure of the Deranged Detective\\". * A 2012 TV episode of Elementary starring Jonny Lee Miller as Holmes, which is the ninth episode of the first season, mirrors many elements from the story, albeit with Holmes simply ill from a more conventional disease that thus limits his ability to conduct fieldwork. * A 2017 episode of Sherlock includes the character Culverton Smith, portrayed by Toby Jones. The title of the episode, \\"The Lying Detective\\", is a play on the title of the original story. Unlike the original tale, where Culverton Smith is only suggested to have committed one murder, \\"The Lying Detective\\" presents him as a wealthy philanthropist who has arranged for a particular room in a hospital he sponsors to have a secret passage that he can use to sneak in and kill anyone being treated in it. Alerted to Smith's true nature by his apparently psychotic daughter as part of an unknown agenda, Sherlock uses this as an opportunity to create a dangerous situation that John Watson can save him from to fulfill Mary Watson's last request to save John from his grief after her death, deliberately falling off the wagon and reverting to an old drug habit so that he can be regarded as simply delusional, attacking Culverton and accusing him of being a serial killer so that he will be sent to Smith's hospital for treatment. This gives Sherlock a chance to hear Culverton's confession via a recording device hidden in John's old cane, which he had predicted John would leave with him after he was sent to hospital. Although the original confession is ruled inadmissible as Sherlock basically acquired it through entrapment, Culverton subsequently willingly confesses his crimes to Lestrade, gleefully musing that he will be even more famous now. ===Radio=== * \\"The Dying Detective\\" was adapted by Edith Meiser as an episode of the American radio series The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes. The episode, which aired in 1931, featured Richard Gordon as Sherlock Holmes and Leigh Lovell as Dr. Watson.Dickerson (2019), p. 39. Other productions of the story aired in 1935, with Louis Hector as Holmes and Lovell as Watson,Dickerson (2019), p. 63. and 1936, with Gordon as Holmes and Harry West as Watson.Dickerson (2019), p. 73. * An episode titled \\"The Riddle of the Dying Detective\\" aired in 1939 in the American radio series The New Adventures of Sherlock Holmes, with Basil Rathbone as Holmes and Nigel Bruce as Watson.Dickerson (2019), p. 89. Another episode titled \\"The Adventure of the Dying Detective\\" aired in 1943.Dickerson (2019), p. 130. The story was also adapted into a 1947 radio episode of the series, with Tom Conway as Holmes and Bruce as Watson.Dickerson (2019), p. 221. This version features Inspector Lestrade instead of Inspector Morton. * A 1954 radio adaptation with John Gielgud as Holmes and Ralph Richardson as Watson aired on the BBC Light Programme. Hugh Manning played Inspector Morton. Along with other Sherlock Holmes radio adaptations with Gielgud and Richardson, the production aired on NBC radio in 1955.Dickerson (2019), p. 285. * The story was adapted for BBC radio in 1967 by Michael Hardwick, as part of the 1952–1969 radio series starring Carleton Hobbs as Holmes and Norman Shelley as Watson. * A 1994 BBC Radio 4 adaptation dramatised by Robert Forrest aired as part of the 1989–1998 radio series starring Clive Merrison as Holmes and Michael Williams as Watson. It featured Edward Petherbridge as Culverton Smith and Alex Jennings as Savage. * In 2010, the story was adapted as an episode of The Classic Adventures of Sherlock Holmes, a series on the American radio show Imagination Theatre, with John Patrick Lowrie as Holmes and Lawrence Albert as Watson. ==References== ;Notes ;Sources * * * ==External links== * * Dying Detective, The Adventure of the Adventure of the Dying Detective Category:Short stories adapted into films Category:Works originally published in Collier's ","title":"The Adventure of the Dying Detective"},{"id":"1281712","text":"Saint-Éloi (French for Saint Eligius) may refer to: *Saint-Éloi, Quebec, Canada *Saint-Éloi, Ain, France *Saint-Éloi, Creuse, France *Saint-Éloi, Nièvre, France *Saint-Éloi-de-Fourques, Eure, France ==See also== * Saint-Éloy (disambiguation) * Sint-Elooi, Belgium (also known as St. Eloi near Ypres) ","title":"Saint-Éloi"},{"id":"1281715","text":"Dhaka Medical College and Hospital (DMCH) is a public medical college and hospital located in Dhaka, the capital city of Bangladesh. It houses the most prestigious medical school as well as the largest tertiary care hospital in the country on one campus. This institution is regarded as the epitome of medical education in Bangladesh since its inception. Dhaka Medical College pioneered in almost every unique medical achievements of Bangladesh. The country's first ever autologous bone marrow transplant took place in its bone marrow transplant unit. ==History== Hospital Building ===Site during pre- college years=== The college's original building was built before the Partition of Bengal of 1905. As of 1904, the building was being used as the secretariat (headquarters) of the newly formed provinces of East Bengal and Assam. In 1921, it was turned over to the University of Dhaka, which was founded that year. A part of the huge building was used as the university's medical center, another part as the students' dormitory, and the rest as the office of the administrative wing of the Arts faculty. In 1939, the Dhaka university council requested British Government to establish a separate medical college in Dhaka. The proposal was postponed because of the onset of the Second World War. During World War II the medical center building became an American armed forces hospital. The Americans vacated the building at the end of the war. ===Establishment of the college=== In 1946, due to the partition of India, all the advanced students (From K-4 to K-1) as well as many lecturers and professors were transferred from Calcutta Medical College to start academic studies and maintain hospital facilities in the newly established Dhaka Medical College. Academic classes started on 10 July, which is celebrated as DMC Day. Major W. J. Virgin, the head of the committee formed to establish the Dhaka Medical College, was the first principal. In the beginning there were only four departments – medicine, surgery, gynecology and otolaryngology (ENT). Since the college did not initially have anatomy or physiology departments, the students at first attended those classes at Mitford Medical School (now the Sir Salimullah Medical College); but, after a month, Professor of Anatomy Pashupati Basu and Professor of Physiology Hiralal Saha joined the staff and their specialties were taught in ward no. 22 of the hospital. ===Expansion=== There was no lecture hall nor dissection gallery at first. These needs were met after the construction of new academic buildings in 1955. The college did not have any student housing. Male students were allowed to reside in the Dhaka University's student halls, but female students did not have the use of that facility. The college and hospital premises were expanded with temporary sheds, some of which were built for outdoor services of the hospital and some for student housing. New buildings for housing, college, and hospital were constructed in phases: a dormitory for girls in 1952, a dormitory for male students in 1954–55, a new complex of academic buildings in 1955, and a dormitory for internee doctors in 1974–75. A new academic and hospital building, adding 500 beds, Dhaka Medical College Hospital-2 (DMCH-2), was inaugurated by Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina on 3 October 2013. === Historical controversies of K === Every student batch, or class, of Dhaka Medical College is tagged with the prefix K along with a number. The 1st year, the beginning batch of the college, was named K-5, likewise 2nd year as K-4, 3rd year as K-3, 4th year as K-2, and 5th year K-1. In 2020, DMC is hosting its 77th batch, hence branded as K-77. Many theories about the origin of the letter K exist, the most popular being that K stands for Kolkata, as many students of DMC's earlier batches migrated from Calcutta Medical College. Though Kolkata was officially known as Calcutta until 2001 but widely pronounced as Kolkata/Kolikata in Bengali. Another theory proposes that, as the college was the 11th medical school in Indian subcontinent, K, the 11th letter of alphabet, is used. ==Undergraduate course== A countrywide combined medical admission test for MBBS course is held every year under the supervision of DGHS. Students after passing Higher Secondary School Certificate or equivalent examinations with the required grades can apply for the test. In 2019, 216 general seats and 4 seats for freedom fighter quota were allocated for MBBS course in Dhaka medical college. The topper candidates, according to their preferences, get the opportunity to study at Dhaka Medical College. Foreign candidates from both SAARC and non-SAARC countries are selected by DGHS and MOHFW as per required qualifications. College runs 5-year MBBS course according to the curriculum developed by BMDC. A student studies Anatomy, Physiology, Biochemistry, Pathology, Pharmacology, Microbiology, Forensic Medicine, Community Medicine, Medicine & allied subjects, Surgery & allied subjects and Gynecology & Obstetrics during the course period. The course is divided into 4 phases. Four professional examinations, one at the end of each phase, are held under University of Dhaka. After passing the fourth or final professional examination, a student is awarded with MBBS degree. Course curriculum follows percentage system grading. Pass mark for the college's internal as well as professional examinations is 60 percent. Student shall have to pass written (MCQ + SAQ + formative), oral, practical and clinical examinations separately. Students scoring 85 percent or above in a subject are awarded with honors. == Postgraduate courses == College offers MD, MS, Diploma, M. phil in 43 different subjects in affiliation with University of Dhaka and Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujib Medical University. College also runs three fellowship courses of Bangladesh College of Physicians and Surgeons in different disciplines. ==Principals== Major William John Virgin, First principal of DMC { class=\\" sortable mw-collapsible\\" style=\\"width:auto\\" -  rowspan=\\"2\\" FFFFFF; color:black;\\"  Sl  rowspan=\\"2\\" FFFFFF; color:black;\\"  Name  colspan=\\"2\\" FFFFFF; color:black;\\"  Duration in office - From To - 1. style=\\"text-align:left;\\"  Major William John Virgin  style=\\"text- align:left;\\" 01.07.1946 14.08.1947 - 2. style=\\"text-align:left;\\"  Lt.

Muslim students were accommodated in Salimullah Muslim Hall, Hindus were accommodated in the then Dhaka Hall (now Dr. Muhammad Shahidullah Hall). Baptist mission hostel at Sadarghat accommodated the Christian students. Nursing Hostel was allocated for the female students. Later, 20 medical barracks were built and students were accommodated there. As of 2019, there are four hostels for accommodation of the students as well as interns. * Shaheed Dr. Fazle Rabbee Hall (established in 1955) - For male students (named after martyred intellectual Dr. Mohammed Fazle Rabbee) * Dr. Alim Chowdhury Hall - For female students (named after martyred intellectual Dr. AFM Alim Chowdhury) * Shaheed Dr. Shamsul Alam Khan Milon Intern Doctors' hostel (Male) (named after the martyred activist of anti-autocracy movement in 1990, Shamsul Alam Khan Milon) * Shaheed Dr. Shamsul Alam Khan Milon Intern Doctors' Hostel (Female) Dr. Fazle Rabbee Hall and Dr. Milon Intern Doctors' hostel (for male) share the same compound at Bakshibazar, Lalbagh, Dhaka. Dr. Alim Chowdhury hall and Dr. Milon Intern doctors' hostel (for female) share the same compound inside the territory of the college. === Sports facility === DMC has a large sports ground inside Fazle rabbee hall. It is used for football, cricket, and other athletics. Fazle Rabbee Hall also houses a basketball ground and a tennis ground. Besides, College building and hostels have students' common rooms with indoor game facility. === Cultural activities === College has a large auditorium with 1200 sitting capacity. DMC day is celebrated each year on 10 July, the foundation day of the college. ==Role in national politics== The Dhaka Medical College has been involved in all the national movements of Bangladesh. ===Bengali Language Movement=== The college dormitories that were known as barracks were at the heart of the Bengali Language Movement from 1948 to 1952. The barracks were formerly situated at the current location of the Shaheed Minar. There were about 20 tin shed barracks where the medical students resided. Because they were close to the Parliament of East Pakistan (presently Jagannath Hall of Dhaka University), the medical dormitories were chosen as the center of the student movement. In the early hours of 21 February 1952, all the students of Dhaka Medical College gathered in front of the medical college dormitories. In the afternoon the group headed for the parliament which was in session. No procession was allowed due to the imposition of Section 144 (a section of the penal code that prohibited unlawful assembly). The students decided to defy Section 144 at 4:00 PM at the historic Aam-tola (which was situated beside the present day Emergency gate). The police fired at the procession, resulting in the deaths of Salam, Barkat, Rafique, Jabbar and Shafiur. After sunset on 21 February, at the site of the deaths, the students of Dhaka Medical College decided to build a monument. Badrul Alam and Sayed Haider the then students of Dhaka Medical College planned and designed the structure. They worked continuously on 22 and 23 February and finished the construction, using bricks, gravel and cement reserved for the hospital. A paper with Shaheed Smritistambha( Monument in memory of the martyrs) written on it was attached on the monument. It was inaugurated by the father of Shofiur Rahman, a martyr of language movement. However, the monument was demolished by government forces on 26 February 1952. ===Liberation War, 1971=== Many staff and students took part in the 1971 Bangladesh Liberation War, as fighters or in treating the injured. DMC's doctors, teachers and students laid their lives in the war. Many eminent physicians and academics were abducted from home and killed during the war. == Student associations, clubs and extracurricular activities == * Dhaka Medical College Students' Union (DMCSU) * Computer Club of DMC * DMC Debating Club (DMCDC) * Ex-Cadets' Association of DMC * Medicine Club, DMC Unit * Rotaract club * Sandhani, DMC branch (blood, organ donating charitable organization) ==Notable alumni== * Sitara Begum, Bir Protik, Bangladeshi doctor, Army officer and war hero * Mohammed Fazle Rabbee, Cardiologist, Martyred intellectual * AFM Alim Chowdhury, Ophthalmologist, Martyred intellectual * A.

Previously, this was considered a distinct family (Scolytidae), but is now understood to be specialized clade of the \\"true weevil\\" family (Curculionidae). Although the term \\"bark beetle\\" refers to the fact that many species feed in the inner bark (phloem) layer of trees, the subfamily also has many species with other lifestyles, including some that bore into wood, feed in fruit and seeds, or tunnel into herbaceous plants. Well-known species are members of the type genus Scolytus, namely the European elm bark beetle S. multistriatus and the large elm bark beetle S. scolytus, which like the American elm bark beetle Hylurgopinus rufipes, transmit Dutch elm disease fungi (Ophiostoma). The mountain pine beetle Dendroctonus ponderosae, southern pine beetle Dendroctonus frontalis, and their near relatives are major pests of conifer forests in North America. A similarly aggressive species in Europe is the spruce ips Ips typographus. A tiny bark beetle, the coffee berry borer, Hypothenemus hampei is a major pest on coffee plantations around the world. ==Ecology== Mountain pine beetles killed these lodgepole pine trees in Prince George, British Columbia. Bark beetles reproduce in the inner bark (living and dead phloem and cambium tissues) of trees. Many species, such as the mountain pine beetle (Dendroctonus ponderosae) attack and kill live trees. Most, however, live in dead, weakened, or dying hosts. Bark beetles of the subfamily Scolytinae feed and breed between the bark and the wood of various tree species, including spruces. More than 20 species feed on weakened, dying, or dead spruce, fir, and hemlock.Rose, A.H.; Lindquist, O.H. 1985. Insects of eastern spruces, fir and, hemlock, revised edition. Gov’t Can., Can. For. Serv., Ottawa, For. Tech. Rep. 23. 159 p. (cited in Coates et al. 1994, cited orig ed 1977) Most restrict breeding area to one part of the tree: twig, branch, stem, or root collar. Some breed in trees of only one species, others in trees of many species. Bark beetles often attack trees that are already weakened by disease, drought, smog, overcrowding, conspecific beetles, or physical damage. Healthy trees may put up defenses by producing sap, resin or latex, which may contain a number of insecticidal and fungicidal compounds that can kill or injure attacking insects, or simply immobilize and suffocate them with the sticky fluid. Sap is one of the first line of defense of pines against bark beetles. Released sap or resins can plug bored holes of bark beetles and seals wounds. Resins also trap insect pests making some initial entry by bark beetles unsuccessful.Parao, M. R., Untalan, P. P., Ligat, B. S., Pagadan, C. S., & Tanguid, L. B. (2019). Damage Assessment of Bark Bettle Infestations on Benguet Pine (Pinus kesiya Royle ex Gordon) in Camp John Hay, Baguio City, Philippines. Mountain Journal of Science and Interdisciplinary Research, 79(2), 35–49. Under outbreak conditions, the sheer number of beetles can overwhelm the tree's defenses with resulting impacts on the lumber industry, water quality, fish and wildlife, and property values. 427x427px According to the United States Department of Agriculture, native bark beetles can cause high levels of tree mortality in California. Massive outbreaks of mountain pine beetles in western North America after about 2005 have killed millions of acres of forest from New Mexico to British Columbia. Most studies of wildfire after beetle outbreaks have found no effect of beetle-caused tree mortality on wildfire size or severity. Forests of Šumava damaged by Ips typographus and clearings after consecutive logging Management of bark beetle infestation in the Šumava National Park in the Czech Republic's Bohemian Forest has been controversial with some advocating non-intervention and others supporting harvesting of infested old-growth trees. ===Gallery=== Image:Bark beetle gallery.jpgBark beetle gallery engraving the sapwood Image:Bark beetle galleries.JPGBark beetle galleries with bark showing exit holes Image:Schorskevervraat op eik.jpgSome species produce single winding tracks Image:Elm bark beetle galleries 01.JPGBark beetle galleries on a dead American elm Image:Lapač kůrovce.JPGBark beetle trap Image:Fichtenstamm entrindet - Detail.jpgManually decorticated trunk of a spruce as protection to bark beetles ==See also== * Forest pathology * Ambrosia beetle * Xyleborus glabratus * Euwallacea fornicatus * Laurel wilt disease ==References== ==External links and further reading== *American and Mexican Bark and Ambrosia beetles *Nordhaus, Hannah.

FPS is \\"the federal agency charged with protecting and delivering integrated law enforcement and security services to facilities owned or leased by the General Services Administration (GSA)\\"—over 9,000 buildings—and their occupants. FPS traffic stop The FPS is a federal law enforcement agency, and employs approximately 900 law enforcement officers who receive initial training at the Federal Law Enforcement Training Center (FLETC). FPS provides integrated law enforcement and security services to U.S. Federal buildings, courthouses, and other properties administered by the General Services Administration (GSA) and the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS). To support that mission, FPS contracts with private security firms to provide 13,000 contract Armed Protective Security Officers (PSO) providing access control and security response within federal buildings. These PSOs are not federal law enforcement but private security employees trained by FPS. FPS also protects other properties as authorized and carries out various other activities for the promotion of homeland security as the Secretary of Homeland Security may prescribe, to include providing a uniformed police response to National Security Special Events, and national disasters. The FPS was formerly a part of the Immigration and Customs Enforcement until October 2009, when it was transferred to the National Protection and Programs Directorate. As part of the NPPD's transformation into the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), the FPS was moved to the Department's Management Directorate. ==Description== The Federal Protective Service is a branch of the Management Directorate and a component of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS). As the police force of the Secretary of Homeland Security, FPS is responsible for policing, securing and ensuring a safe environment in which federal agencies can conduct their business. FPS does this by investigating threats posed against over 9,000 federal facilities nationwide, while being deployed at 2,300 of them. FPS's work focuses directly on the interior security of the nation and the reduction of crimes and potential threats to federal facilities throughout the nation. Uniformed FPS officers/inspectors and special agents respond to calls for assistance, conduct investigations and provide crime prevention tips, as well as assist in occupant emergency planning. All federal facilities under FPS control receive a thorough building security assessment on a recurring schedule. During this assessment representatives of all agencies in the facility are interviewed to gather information on the specific mission they perform within the facility, and intelligence and crime statistics for the area are reviewed, as are existing security countermeasures. Based on the findings and working with the agencies housed in the facility, security countermeasures are added or adjusted. This allows for tailored security for each individual facility versus a one-size-fits-all approach. ==Services provided== A Federal Protective Service communications vehicle protecting the John Joseph Moakley United States Courthouse during Sail Boston 2017. ===Primary Protective Services=== * Conducting Facility Security Assessments * Designing countermeasures for tenant agencies * Maintaining uniformed law enforcement presence * Maintaining armed contract security guards * Performing background suitability checks for contract employees * Monitoring security alarms via centralized communication centers ===Additional Protective Services=== * Conducting criminal investigations * Sharing intelligence among local/state/federal * Protecting special events * Working with FEMA to respond to natural disasters * Offering special operations including K-9 explosive detection * Training federal tenants in crime prevention and Occupant Emergency Planning ==Training== Newly hired sworn FPS law enforcement personnel undergo initial entry training at the FPS Academy on the Federal Law Enforcement Training Center location in Glynco, Georgia. Furthermore, following graduation, new FPS law enforcement officers undergo additional post academy training, as well as career-continuous training, and are assigned to an FPS office in one of eleven regions throughout the country. FPS law enforcement officers also undergo additional training, depending on their assignment to special units within the service. ==History== Federal Protective Service vehicle. The origins of FPS date to 1790 (a year after the US Marshals Service), with the enactment of the Residence Act, authorizing President George Washington to appoint three commissioners to create a federal territory for a permanent seat of federal government. Prior to formal establishment of Washington & the District of Columbia, commissioners hired six night watchmen to protect designated buildings the government was intended to occupy. FPS traces its origins to the appointment of these six night watchmen. FPS has resided in a number of different agencies over the years. The act of June 1, 1948, authorized the Federal Administrator to appoint special policemen for duty in connection with the policing of all buildings owned and occupied by the United States. In 1949, Congress enacted the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949, which consolidated real property functions within the newly created General Services Administration (GSA). The FPS force, known at the time as the United States Special Police, came under the supervision of the Protection Division of the Public Building Service (PBS). In 1971, the Administrator of GSA signed an order formally establishing the Federal Protective Force, later known as FPS, and the Civil Service Commission authorized the special classification title of Federal Protective Officer (FPO). Initially, the main function of FPS was protection, as an integral part of building operations. For the most part, the force held fixed posts and performed duties that would be considered safety functions today, such as: eliminating fire and safety hazards, patrolling buildings, detecting fires, and providing the first line of defense in fighting fires; and answering visitor questions, assisting citizens, rendering first aid, and directing traffic when necessary. By 1960, the mission of FPS had become the first line of defense against bomb threats, bombings, vandalism, mass demonstrations, and violence against Federal buildings. In 1980, Fidel Castro instigated a wave of emigration from Cuba to the United States using the harbor town of Mariel for debarkation. The thousands of refugees were eventually distributed to military installations in several states (Fort Chaffee, AR, Fort McCoy, WI, Fort Indiantown Gap, PA) and Puerto Rico to await permanent resettlement. The Immigration and Naturalization Service and Border Patrol were understaffed to provide civilian law enforcement officers needed to maintain order within the installations. The Federal Protective Service, then administratively placed under the General Service Administration's Public Building Service, was among several federal authorities asked to provide additional on-site officers for the duration of the event. Federal Protective Officers from across the country frequently served in the camps, and also during the riot at Fort Chaffee. United States Federal Protective Service color guard More recently, the role of the FPS officer has undergone further changes. The FPS has shifted its emphasis from the fixed guard post concept of security to a mobile police patrol and response. FPS contracts private security companies to guard fixed posts. FPS officers perform all duties attendant to the normal interpretation of a police officer function including maintaining law and order, preventing or deterring disturbances, and investigating both felonies and misdemeanors. The Civil Service Commission developed standards for FPS applicants, which included background investigations, and physical examinations. ===21st century=== Pursuant to the Homeland Security Act of 2002, FPS was transferred to the Department of Homeland Security and retained its responsibilities for protecting the buildings, grounds, and property owned, occupied, or secured by the federal government under GSA's jurisdiction. In addition to GSA facilities, the Act also provides FPS with the authority to protect properties held by DHS components that were not under GSA jurisdiction. FPS was moved from GSA, Public Building Services, to DHS, effective March 1, 2003. Within DHS, FPS became a part of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). On October 28, 2009, President Barack Obama signed legislation which transferred FPS from ICE to the National Protection and Programs Directorate (NPPD) of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security. Today, FPS is responsible for policing, securing, and ensuring a safe environment in which federal agencies can conduct business by reducing threats posed against approximately 9,000 Federal government facilities throughout the United States.Cost and duration of FPS transition were underestimated .

Bush signed H.R. 2764 Omnibus spending bill into law which included a provision that FPS maintains, by July 31, 2008, not fewer than 1,200 full-time staff and 900 full-time Police Officers, Inspectors, and Special Agents who, while working, are directly engaged on a daily basis protecting and enforcing laws at Federal buildings. This amendment to H.R. 2674 was introduced by Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton and was successfully included in the bill and signed into law largely due to the efforts of the American Federation of Government Employees Local 918-FPS and the grassroots efforts of its membership. In March 2008, Del. Eleanor Holmes Norton, chair of the responsible House of Representatives subcommittee, said, \\"We're seeing the near collapse of the Federal Protective Service\\". A GAO report, which included incidents that occurred before H.R. 2764 passed, documented lapses that had occurred on federal government property, including the theft of a trailer of surveillance equipment from an FBI parking deck. A GAO investigator said that budget cuts were causing reduced effectiveness. The service has seen its budget and staff cut since it became a part of the Department of Homeland Security in March 2003.Lawmaker: U.S. security agency faltering. CNN.com (2008-03-14). Retrieved on 2013-07-23. In 2009, the Government Accountability Office (GAO) and the Inspector General for the Department of Homeland Security issued reports that were highly critical of the Federal Protective Service for relying on low-wage contract personnel to provide security at federal buildings. See GAO-09-0859T and OIG-09-51. Both documented that the contractors lacked the necessary skills or training to handle their duties, which threatened the security of all federal employees and visitors. The GAO report made national headlines in July 2009 as it cited frequent lapses, including failure to prevent investigators from carrying weapons into several key federal installations. It also displayed a photograph of a contract security guard asleep at his guard post. On October 28, 2009, U.S. President Barack Obama, signed legislation which effectively transferred the Federal Protective Service from the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement to the National Protection and Programs Directorate of the Department of Homeland Security. On June 17, 2019, a lone gunman by the name of Brian Issack Clyde opened fire on the Earle Cabell Federal Building and Courthouse in Dallas, Texas. Since FPS officers are charged with protecting federal courthouses, they were present at the shooting. Three FPS officers engaged the shooter, fatally wounding him. On May 30, 2020, Dave Patrick Underwood, a contract security officer for the Federal Protective Service, was shot and killed in Oakland, California. The attack occurred amid the George Floyd protests, which broke out into unrest in Oakland. Two suspects, one of whom had killed a Santa Cruz County deputy in a subsequent attack on police, were arrested in June; they were found to have had ties to the far-right boogaloo movement. ==Jurisdiction== FPS law enforcement personnel derive their law enforcement authority from Section 1315 of Title 40 of the United States Code (40 USC 1315):Office of the Law Revision Counsel, United States Code (Washington, D.C.: GPO, 2014), p. 139. ==Labor organization== The American Federation of Government Employees (AFGE) National Local 918 is the exclusive representative of all bargaining unit eligible Federal Protective Service employees which includes non-supervisory Police Officers, Inspectors, Special Agents and support personnel. Citation: AFGE NL#918 ==Protective Investigations Program== A U.S. Federal Protective Service officer in the early 2000s, equipped with full tactical gear and a shotgun The Protective Investigations Program was established in early 2004, to ensure the safety of DHS and FPS protectees and facilities. The objective of the program is to prevent an attack on persons and facilities designated as FPS protectees. The program integrates the following aspects of the FPS mission: the initial patrol response by FPS uniformed police officers; full investigation by FPS special agents; prosecution by the U.S. Attorney's Office or State Prosecutor's Office; physical security enhancements and countermeasures; security briefings and workplace violence seminars administered by FPS law enforcement personnel; suspicious surveillance detection initiatives designed to detect pre-incident indicators of threats to federal employees, facilities and protectees; a monthly Operations Security Bulletin; and protection details for high-ranking officials within DHS. FPS Headquarters developed a Memorandum of Understanding, in collaboration with the U.S. Capitol Police, enabling the two entities to use each other's resources to effectively, efficiently and professionally respond to and investigate threats and inappropriate communications directed at members of Congress, their families and staff when outside the Washington, D.C., metropolitan area. FPS collaborates with other components within DHS and has established liaisons with agencies having a protective and investigative mission such as the U.S. Secret Service—National Threat Assessment Center, Social Security Administration (SSA), U.S. Marshals Service, FBI, U.S. Postal Inspection Service and various state and local police agencies throughout the country. FPS special agents have made arrests and conducted investigations of subjects charged with making inappropriate communications and threats to members of the U.S. Congress (House and Senate) and/or their staff, the director of Federal Emergency Management Agency, FPS Director, members of the military reserve, SSA, the Department of Veteran Affairs and other federal employees. Many of these investigations resulted in convictions for making threats to do physical harm and threats to bomb federal facilities. FPS special agents investigated threats delivered in person, via telephone, e-mail and U.S. Postal Service mail. FPS special agents also oversee an outreach program designed to educate the community and tenant agencies and provide them with a point of contact to report suspicious behavior and incidents that threaten FPS protectees, facilities, and/or visitors. ==Explosive Detection Dog Teams== The mission of the Explosive Detector Dog (EDD) Teams is the protection of life and property and providing a strong visible and psychological deterrence against criminal and terrorist acts. Prior to the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, the FPS had a minimal program of 10 EDD Teams located in the Washington, D.C., metropolitan area. Since that time, the FPS EDD program has expanded to more than 60 teams nationwide. The EDD Teams conduct routine explosive searches of office areas, vehicles, materials, packages and persons housed in federally owned or leased facilities. The EDD Teams respond to bomb threats and suspicious packages or items and are used to assist in clearing identified areas. ===Deployment=== The FPS EDD Teams are deployed in their area of assignment as well as frequent deployment to National Special Security Events such as the Olympic games, the Republican and Democratic National Conventions, and the G-8 Summit. The EDD Teams provide their vital capabilities to state and local law enforcement authorities under emergency conditions when local EDD Teams are unavailable. ===Training=== The FPS Canine Training Academy is located in Fort McClellan, Alabama, and is conducted in partnership with the Auburn University Canine Detection Training Center. Each handler and respective canine attends the mandatory 10-week EDD Handler Training Course. The handlers and their canine partners graduate from the course as a team. The EDD Teams are on call 24 hours a day and serve a crucial role as part of a greater network of first responders in a growing national network of federal task force officers. ==Hazardous Response Program== The FPS Hazardous Response Program (HRP) was created to support the mission of FPS in response to credible chemical, biological, radiological, nuclear and high yield explosive (CBRNE) threats or incidents. HRP includes initial investigations of suspicious or threatening CBRNE incidents; completion of CBRNE threat assessments; confirmations of unauthorized presence of CBRNE agents and materials; and the conduction of emergency operations. HRP also provides: evacuation support during CBRNE incidents and some training assistance. The program is compliant with OSHA and NFPA guidance and regulations. The HRP consists of five main elements: Awareness, Prevention, Preparedness, Response, and Recovery. ==MegaCenters== In 2000, FPS transitioned all alarm monitoring and dispatching capabilities from several regional control centers to 4 MegaCenters. Currently, each MegaCenter monitors multiple types of alarm systems, closed circuit television and wireless dispatch communications within federal facilities throughout the entire nation. The centers located in Battle Creek, Michigan; Denver, Colorado; Philadelphia, Pennsylvania; and Suitland, Maryland, are equipped with state-of-the-art communication systems and in operation 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.https://www.dhs.gov/megacenters The centers are fully redundant—if there is a partial or catastrophic failure at one center, all operations can be remotely switched and monitored at a \\"peer\\" location without disruption to field service. ===Vital communications link=== While the MegaCenters are an alarm monitoring entity, they also serve as a unique and vital communications link between FPS law enforcement personnel on the street and contract Protective Security Officers (PSOs) located throughout the various facilities FPS protects. This vital communications link has been created as a result of the investment of millions of dollars to ensure effective communications and safety of FPS operations. The related alarm monitoring function for GSA and other federally owned and leased facilities provides a dedicated and specialized service to ensure prompt dispatch of law enforcement and emergency first responders to situations at those facilities nationwide. FPS MegaCenters are the 911 dispatch center for DHS. ===National network=== Presently, FPS MegaCenters have a national wireless communication network that uses a voice- over-internet protocol system that transmits over a wide-area network. This form of communication reduces recurring long line costs, ensures redundancy and is set up to provide fail over capability in the event of a scheduled or unscheduled outage. Considering the success of the FPS national wireless radio communication system, FPS is working with ICE and DHS to see if opportunities exist for FPS to extend this service to other DHS components. ===The future=== The FPS is working on several projects that range from access control/Smart Card management to rapid deployment capabilities in disaster situations. FPS is continually evaluating cutting edge technology that can enhance its capabilities to protect the U.S. ==See also== * Federal law enforcement in the United States * U.S. Diplomatic Security Service * U.S. Customs and Border Protection * U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement * U.S. Marshals Service * Federal Bureau of Investigation ==References== ==External links== Official: * Official page * U.S. Department of Homeland Security * Federal Protective Service webpage * Federal Protective Service Mega Centers * Federal Protective Service Explosive Detection Dog Program * Federal Protective Service Hazardous Response Program * Federal Protective Service Mobile Command Posts * Federal Protective Service Protective Investigations Program Others: * American Federation of Government Employees (AFGE) Local 918, the exclusive representative of all FPS bargaining unit employees nationwide.

He also composed Gabon's national anthem, \\"La Concorde\\". ==Life and career== A Mpongwe born in Libreville and educated at the Ecole Montfort, he worked as a bank clerk from 1924 to 1939, then as head bookkeeper for the Compagnie Maritime des Chargeurs Réunis until 1959. He first came to public attention in 1934, with a series of letters to the Etoile de l'AEF opposing special rights for the métis. In 1943, the Free French appointed him to represent Gabon in the governor-general's administrative council, a role which lasted until 1946, then from 1948 to 1954 was an advisor to the governor of Gabon. He was also active in the formation of labor unions, the CGT-Force Ouvrière, and in the politics of the territory. He was elected to the municipal commission of Libreville in 1956, a post he held until 1963, and in 1959 represented Gabon in the Economic and Social Council of the French Community. From 1961 to 1964 he served as ambassador to the European Common Market, to the Benelux countries, and to West Germany. In April 1964 Damas was elected to the National Assembly of Gabon, and its members selected him as President of the National Assembly, a role in which he served until 1975.

Its name derives from the word réveil (meaning \\"waking\\"), because participation involves staying awake until midnight and beyond. The practice is observed in Belgium, France, Brazil, in the Canadian provinces of Quebec, Manitoba, Ontario and New Brunswick, the city of New Orleans, and some other French-speaking places. In Portuguese-speaking countries, it is also a designation for the party preceding New Year's Day. In the United States, the réveillon tradition is still observed in New Orleans due to the city's strong French-Creole heritage, with a number of the city's restaurants offering special réveillon menus on Christmas Eve. The term is first documented in 18th century France, and was used by the French as a name for the night-long party dinners held by the nobility. Eventually the word began to be used by other courts (amongst them the Portuguese courts) and after the French Revolution it was adopted as a definition of the New Year's Eve. ==Food== The food consumed at réveillons is generally exceptional or luxurious. For example, appetizers may include lobster, oysters, escargots or foie gras, etc. One traditional dish is turkey with chestnuts. Réveillons in Quebec will often include some variety of tourtière. Dessert may consist of a Yule log, known as a bûche de Noël. In Provence, the tradition of the thirteen desserts is followed: 13 desserts are served, almost invariably including pompe à l'huile (a flavoured bread), dates, etc. Quality wine is usually consumed at such dinners, often with champagne or similar sparkling wines as a conclusion. ==Differences== There are certain traditional differences of character between the Christmas and New Year's Day réveillons. Christmas is traditionally a Christian occasion, celebrated within the family, and this family character is retained even among non-believers. The New Year's Eve, or Saint-Sylvestre, réveillon, on the other hand, is commonly a party with friends, etc. People may also go out to a cabaret show, or watch live relays of such shows on television. == Name in others countries == * In Italy, it is called Cenone di Natale for Christmas and Cenone di Capodanno for New Year. * In Poland, it is called Wigilia for Christmas. *In Brazil, it is called Ceia de Natal for Christmas, and Ceia de Ano Novo for New Year. Additionally, the word réveillon (alternatively called \\"virada do ano\\") refers nationally to the New Year's Eve. == See also == * List of dining events * Wigilia ==References== Category:French cuisine Category:Cuisine of Quebec Category:Christmas meals and feasts Category:Winter traditions Category:Canadian traditions Category:French Canadian culture Category:Christmas in Canada ","title":"Réveillon"},{"id":"1281742","text":"Helmut Poppendick (Nuremberg Trials Project: A Digital Document Collection, \\"Helmut Poppendick Affidavit, 14 January 1947\\", Harvard Law School Library Item No. 849. – ) was a German doctor who served in the SS during World War II. He was an internist and worked in the Medical Doctorate, as Chief of the Personal Staff of the Reich Physician SS and Police. After the war he was a defendant in the Doctors' Trial. He studied medicine from 1919–1926 in Göttingen, Munich, and Berlin. Poppendick received his medical license on 1 February 1928. Then, he worked for four years as a clinical assistant at the First Medical Clinic of Charité in Berlin. From June 1933 to October 1934 he was the assistant medical director at Virchow Hospital in Berlin. In 1935, he completed training as an expert for \\"race hygiene\\" at the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Anthropology, Human Genetics and Eugenics. After this, he became the adjutant of the ministerial director Arthur Gütt at the Reich Ministry of the Interior. He was also the chief of staff at the SS Office for Population Politics and Genetic Health Care, which in 1937 became the SS Main Race and Settlement Office. Poppendick was departmental head and staff leader of the Genealogical Office. At the beginning of World War II, he was drafted as an adjutant to a medical department of the army and took part in the attack on Belgium, France and the Netherlands. In November 1941, Poppendick was accepted into the Waffen-SS. In 1943, Ernst-Robert Grawitz of the Reich Physician SS appointed him to lead his personal staff. Poppendick joined the NSDAP in 1932 (party member No. 998607) and the SS (No. 36345). He reached the rank of Oberführer in the SS. Poppendick was implicated in a series of medical experiments done on concentration camp prisoners, including the medical experiments done in Ravensbrück. At the American Military Tribunal No. I on 20 August 1947 he was acquitted from being criminally implicated in medical experiments, but was sentenced to 10 years imprisonment for membership in a criminal organization, the SS. He was released on 31 January 1951.

Active from September 1997 to December 2010, its primary mission was to quantify chlorophyll produced by marine phytoplankton (microscopic plants). ==Instrument== The SeaStar satellite, which carried SeaWiFS SeaWiFS was the only scientific instrument on GeoEye's OrbView-2 (AKA SeaStar) satellite, and was a follow-on experiment to the Coastal Zone Color Scanner on Nimbus 7. Launched August 1, 1997 on an Orbital Sciences Pegasus small air-launched rocket, SeaWiFS began scientific operations on September 18, 1997 and stopped collecting data on December 11, 2010, far exceeding its designed operating period of 5 years. The sensor resolution is 1.1 km (LAC), 4.5 km (GAC). The sensor recorded information in the following optical bands: { border=\\"1\\" cellpadding=\\"2\\" !Band !Wavelength - 1 402–422 nm - 2 433–453 nm - 3 480–500 nm - 4 500–520 nm - 5 545–565 nm - 6 660–680 nm - 7 745–785 nm - 8 845–885 nm } The instrument was specifically designed to monitor ocean characteristics such as chlorophyll-a concentration and water clarity. It was able to tilt up to 20 degrees to avoid sunlight from the sea surface. This feature is important at equatorial latitudes where glint from sunlight often obscures water colour. SeaWiFS had used the Marine Optical Buoy for vicarious calibration. The SeaWiFS Mission is an industry/government partnership, with NASA's Ocean Biology Processing Group at Goddard Space Flight Center having responsibility for the data collection, processing, calibration, validation, archive and distribution. The current SeaWiFS Project manager is Gene Carl Feldman. ==Chlorophyll estimation== SeaWIFS-derived average sea surface chlorophyll for the period 1998 to 2006. Chlorophyll concentrations are derived from images of the ocean's color. Generally speaking, the greener the water, the more phytoplankton are present in the water, and the higher the chlorophyll concentrations. absorbs more blue and red light than green, with the resulting reflected light changing from blue to green as the amount of chlorophyll in the water increases. Using this knowledge, scientists were able to use ratios of different reflected colors to estimate chlorophyll concentrations. The visible color spectrum with corresponding wavelengths in nanometers Many formulas estimate chlorophyll by comparing the ratio of blue to green light and relating those ratios to known chlorophyll concentrations from the same times and locations as the satellite observations. The color of light is defined by its wavelength, and visible light has wavelengths from 400 to 700 nanometers, progressing from violet (400 nm) to red (700 nm). A typical formula used for SeaWiFS data (termed OC4v4) divides the reflectance of the maximum of several wavelengths (443, 490, or 510 nm) by the reflectance at 550 nm. This roughly equates to a ratio of blue light to green light for two of the numerator wavelengths, and a ratio of two different green wavelengths for the other possible combination. The reflectance (R) returned by this formula is then plugged into a cubic polynomial that relates the band ratio to chlorophyll. Chl = antilog(0.366-3.067\\\\mathsf{R}+1.93\\\\mathsf{R}^2 +0.64\\\\mathsf{R}^3 -1.53\\\\mathsf{R}^4) This formula, along with others, was derived empirically using observed chlorophyll concentrations. To facilitate these comparisons, NASA maintains a system of oceanographic and atmospheric data called SeaBASS (SeaWiFS Bio-optical Archive and Storage System). This data archive is used to develop new algorithms and validate satellite data products by matching chlorophyll concentrations measured directly with those estimated remotely from a satellite. These data can also be used to assess atmospheric correction (discussed below) that also can greatly influence chlorophyll concentration calculations. Numerous chlorophyll algorithms were tested to see which ones best matched chlorophyll globally. Various algorithms perform differently in different environments. Many algorithms estimate chlorophyll concentrations more accurately in deep clear water than in shallow water. In shallow waters reflectance from other pigments, detritus, and the ocean bottom may cause inaccuracies. The stated goals of the SeaWiFS chlorophyll estimates are \\"… to produce water leaving radiances with an uncertainty of 5% in clear-water regions and concentrations within ±35% over the range of 0.05–50 mg m-3.\\". When accuracy is assessed on a global scale, and all observations are grouped together, then this goal is clearly met. Many satellite estimates range from one-third to three times of those directly recorded at sea, though the overall relationship is still quite good. Differences arise when examined by region, though overall the values are still very useful. One pixel may not be particularly accurate, though when averages are taken over larger areas, the values average out and provide a useful and accurate view of the larger patterns. The benefits of chlorophyll data from satellites far outweigh any flaws in their accuracy simply by the spatial and temporal coverage possible. Ship-based measurements of chlorophyll cannot come close to the frequency and spatial coverage provided by satellite data. ==Atmospheric correction== A true color SeaWiFS image of a coccolithophore phytoplankton bloom off of Alaska Light reflected from the sub-surface ocean is called water-leaving radiance and is used to estimate chlorophyll concentrations. However, only about 5–10% of light at the top of the atmosphere is from water-leaving radiance.Gene Carl Feldman, ,\\"SeaWiFS Project – Detailed Description\\", OceanColor WEB, 7/30/2003 The remainder of light is reflected from the atmosphere and from aerosols within the atmosphere. In order to estimate chlorophyll concentrations this non-water-leaving radiance must be accounted for. Some light reflected from the ocean, such as from whitecaps and sun glint, must also be removed from chlorophyll calculations since they are representative ocean waves or the angle of the sun instead of the subsurface ocean. The process of removing these components is called atmospheric correction. A description of the light, or radiance, observed by the satellite's sensor can be more formally expressed by the following radiative transfer equation: L_T(\\\\lambda) = L_r(\\\\lambda)+L_a(\\\\lambda)+L_{ra}(\\\\lambda)+TL_g(\\\\lambda)+t(L_f(\\\\lambda)+L_W(\\\\lambda)) Where LT(λ) is total radiance at the top of the atmosphere, Lr(λ) is Rayleigh scattering by air molecules, La(λ) is scattering by aerosols in the absence of air, Lra(λ) is interactions between air molecules and aerosols, TLg(λ) is reflections from glint, t(Lf(λ) is reflections from foam, and LW(λ)) is reflections from the subsurface of the water, or the water-leaving radiance. Others may divide radiance into some slightly different components, though in each case the reflectance parameters must be resolved in order to estimate water-leaving radiance and thus chlorophyll concentrations. ==Data products== Though SeaWiFS was designed primarily to monitor ocean concentrations from space, it also collected many other parameters that are freely available to the public for research and educational purposes. These parameters aside from include reflectance, the diffuse attenuation coefficient, particulate organic carbon concentration (POC), particulate inorganic carbon concentration (PIC), colored dissolved organic matter (CDOM) index, photosynthetically active radiation (PAR), and normalized fluorescence line height (NFLH). In addition, despite being designed to measure ocean chlorophyll, SeaWiFS also estimates Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), which is a measure of photosynthesis on land. ==Data access== A false color SeaWiFS image shows a high concentration of phytoplankton chlorophyll in the Brazil Current Confluence region east of Argentina. Warm colors indicate high chlorophyll levels, and cooler colors indicate lower chlorophyll. SeaWiFS data are freely accessible from a variety of websites, most of which are government run. The primary location for SeaWiFS data is NASA's OceanColor website , which maintains the time series of the entire SeaWiFS mission. The website allows users to browse individual SeaWiFS images based on time and area selections. The website also allows for browsing of different temporal and spatial scales with spatial scales ranging from 4 km to 9 km for mapped data. Data are provided at numerous temporal scales including daily, multiple days (e.g., 3, 8), monthly, and seasonal images, all the way up to composites of the entire mission. Data are also available via ftp and bulk download. Data can be browsed and retrieved in a variety of formats and levels of processing, with four general levels from unprocessed to modeled output. Level 0 is unprocessed data that is not usually provided to users. Level 1 data are reconstructed but either unprocessed or minimally processed. Level 2 data contain derived geophysical variables, though are not on a uniform space/time grid. Level 3 data contain derived geophysical variables binned or mapped to a uniform grid. Lastly, Level 4 data contain modeled or derived variables such as ocean primary productivity . Scientists who aim to create calculations of chlorophyll or other parameters that differ from those provided on the OceanColor website would likely use Level 1 or 2 data. This might be done, for example, to calculate parameters for a specific region of the globe, whereas the standard SeaWiFS data products are designed for global accuracy with necessary tradeoffs for specific regions. Scientists who are more interested in relating the standard SeaWiFS outputs to other processes will commonly use Level 3 data, particularly if they do not have the capacity, training, or interest in working with Level 1 or 2 data. Level 4 data may be used for similar research if interested in a modeled product. ==Software== NASA offers free software designed specifically to work with SeaWiFS data through the ocean color website. This software, entitled SeaDAS (SeaWiFS Data Analysis System), is built for visualization and processing of satellite data and can work with Level 1, 2, and 3 data. Though it was originally designed for SeaWiFS data, its capabilities have since been expanded to work with many other satellite data sources. Other software or programming languages can also be used to read in and work with SeaWiFS data, such as Matlab, IDL, or Python. ==Applications== Biological pump, air-sea cycling and sequestering of CO2 Estimating the amount of global or regional chlorophyll, and therefore phytoplankton, has large implications for climate change and fisheries production. Phytoplankton play a huge role in the uptake of the world's carbon dioxide, a primary contributor to climate change. A percentage of these phytoplankton sink to ocean floor, effectively taking carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere and sequestering it in the deep ocean for at least a thousand years. Therefore, the degree of primary production from the ocean could play a large role in slowing climate change. Or, if primary production slows, climate change could be accelerated. Some have proposed fertilizing the ocean with iron in order to promote phytoplankton blooms and remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. Whether these experiments are undertaken or not, estimating chlorophyll concentrations in the world's oceans and their role in the ocean's biological pump could play a key role in our ability to foresee and adapt to climate change. Phytoplankton is a key component in the base of the oceanic food chain and oceanographers have hypothesized a link between oceanic chlorophyll and fisheries production for some time. The degree to which phytoplankton relates to marine fish production depends on the number of trophic links in the food chain, and how efficient each link is. Estimates of the number of trophic links and trophic efficiencies from phytoplankton to commercial fisheries have been widely debated, though they have been little substantiated. More recent research suggests that positive relationships between and fisheries production can be modeled and can be very highly correlated when examined on the proper scale. For example, Ware and Thomson (2005) found an r2 of 0.87 between resident fish yield (metric tons km-2) and mean annual concentrations (mg m-3). Others have found the Pacific's Transition Zone Chlorophyll Front (chlorophyll density of 0.2 mg m-3) to be defining feature in loggerhead turtle distribution. ==References== * == External links == * SeaWiFS Project Home Page * OceanColor Website Category:Spacecraft instruments Category:Satellite meteorology Category:NASA spin-off technologies Category:Oceanographic instrumentation ","title":"SeaWiFS"},{"id":"1281759","text":"Citadelle is the French word for citadel (a castle, fortress, or fortified center).

In 2018, the government has limited control as the country is mostly controlled by the Christian anti-Balaka and the Muslim ex-Seleka militia forces who occupy territories in the western and northern parts of the country. The police and the gendarmerie (military police) failed to stop or punish killings, physical abuse, religion-based and gender-based violence committed by these militias. Sectarian clashes between the militias and the rest of the population included attacks on churches and mosques and the deaths at those places of worship. In April and May, a joint government and UN operation to disarm a militia group in Bangui's predominantly Muslim PK5 neighborhood sparked violence. On 1 May, militia gunmen attacked and killed one priest, 26 worshipers, and injured more than 100 civilians. The following day, anti-Balaka elements burned two mosques in Bangui. On 15 November, a suspected ex-Seleka militia group set fire to the Catholic cathedral and an adjoining internally displaced person (IDP) camp in the city of Alindao, killing Bishop Blaise Mada and Reverend Delestin Ngouambango and more than 40 civilians. Central African Republic ====Chad==== Chad in 2018 is 51-58% Muslim, 40-45% Christian, with small populations of animists and unaffiliated individuals. During the inauguration of the new government, two Christian ministers refused to swear the required oath of office in the name of \\"Allah\\"; one minister who refused to take any oath in the name of Allah was immediately fired by President Idriss Deby. Chad ====Democratic Republic of the Congo==== The Democratic Republic of the Congo is approximately 45 percent Roman Catholic, 40 percent Protestant (including evangelicals), 5 percent Church of Jesus Christ on Earth through the Prophet Simon Kimbangu (Kimbanguist), and 5 percent Muslim. International NGOs, media, and religious organizations have reported that the government subjected religious organizations and leaders, most prominently Catholic, to intimidation, arbitrary arrest, and in some cases violence. Due to the political nature of many of the CLC's activities and practices, however, it is difficult to establish the government's response as being solely based on religious identity. Democratic Republic of the Congo ====Egypt==== According to official estimates, 90% of the population of Egypt are Muslim, with the majority Sunni, and 8% to 10% Christian. Sunni Islam is the state religion, but the government also officially recognizes Christianity and Judaism and allows their adherents to publicly practice their religion. According to multiple sources, prosecutors arrested a disproportionate number of Christians for 'blasphemy'-- criticizing religion. On 2 November, armed assailants attacked three buses carrying Christian pilgrims to a monastery in Minya in Upper Egypt, killing seven and wounding 19. There were also attacks on Christians and Christian-owned property, as well as on churches in the Upper Egypt region. On 26 May, seven Christians were injured in the village of Shoqaf while defending a church from attack by Muslim villagers. Egypt ====Eritrea==== The population of Eritrea is equally divided between the predominantly Christian high plateau (Asmara), and the Muslim lowlands and coast. The government recognizes four officially registered religious groups: the Eritrean Orthodox Church, Sunni Islam, the Roman Catholic Church, and the Evangelical Lutheran Church of Eritrea. Unregistered groups can be subjected to additional security service scrutiny. The government appoints the heads of the Eritrean Orthodox Church and the Sunni Islamic community. International NGOs and media reported that members of all religious groups were subjected to government abuses and restrictions. Members of unrecognized religious groups reported instances of imprisonment and deaths in custody, and detention without explanation. NGOs reported the government continued to detain 345 church leaders and officials without charge or trial, while estimates of detained laity ranged from 800 to more than 1,000. Authorities detained 53 Jehovah's Witnesses for conscientious objection. Eritrea ====Ethiopia==== Ethiopia is 43.5% Ethiopian Orthodox Christians, 33.9% Muslim, 18.6%, Protestants, and 2.6% traditional beliefs. There is also a small Jewish community and some adherents of the Bahá'í Faith. In January 2018, security forces fired tear-gas on a group of youth singing politically charged messages in Woldia town during Epiphany celebrations. The local Human Rights Council (HRCO) reported that security forces shot and killed eight Orthodox Church members; this was followed by further protests and more killings. On 4 August, in the Somali region, an organized group of Muslim youth reportedly killed six priests and burned down at least eight Ethiopian Orthodox churches during widespread civil unrest in Jijiga. On 25 August, in Bure town, followers of the Ethiopian Orthodox Church stoned a man to death after accusing him of attempting to set a church on fire. Ethiopia ====Kenya==== Kenya in 2018 is religiously diverse: 47.4% of the total population are varieties of Protestant, 20.6% are Roman Catholic, 11.1 percent are Islamic, and 16% are Baha'i, Buddhist, Hindu and traditional religionists. Kenya also has the highest number of Quakers of any country in the world, with around 119,285 members. The Eastern Orthodox Church has over 650,000 members making it the third largest Orthodox Church in Sub-Saharan Africa. The Somalia-based terrorist group Harakat al-Shabaab al-Mujahideen (al-Shabaab) carried out attacks in Mandera, Wajir, Garissa, and Lamu Counties saying they had targeted non-Muslims. In September, al-Shabaab reportedly stopped a bus in Lamu County and killed two Christian travelers. In October a group of residents in Bungale, Magarini Sub County, burned and demolished a Good News International Ministries church. There were reports of religiously motivated threats, such as members of Muslim communities threatening individuals who converted from Islam to Christianity. According to religious leaders, some Muslim youths vandalizied properties of local Christians.Kenya ====Libya==== Sunni Islam is the state religion and sharia is the principal source of legislation. Non- Muslim activity remains curtailed by legal prohibitions. Circulation of non- Islamic religious materials, missionary activity, or speech considered \\"offensive to Muslims\\" is prohibited. Multiple international human rights organizations said Christians faced a heightened risk of physical assault, including sexual assault and rape than other migrants and refugees at government detention centers. Some detainees reported they were tortured and abused. Domestic human rights activists continued to report a restrictive environment, especially toward women, imposing restrictions on women's dress and movement and punishing men for behavior they deemed un-Islamic. The East operated under a separate, unrecognized governmental administration, with security provided by the \\"Libyan National Army\\" (LNA) and LNA-aligned Salafist armed groups. Militias continued to operate and control territory throughout the country, including in Benghazi, parts of Tripoli, and Derna, where there were numerous reports of armed groups restricting religious practices, enforcing compliance with sharia, and targeting those viewed as violating their standards. According to Open Doors USA, Islamic militant groups and organized crime groups targeted religious minorities, including Christian migrants, converts to Christianity, and foreign residents for physical attacks, sexual assaults, detentions, kidnappings, and killings. Foreign terrorist organizations that included Ansar al-Sharia, al-Qaida in the Maghreb (AQIM), and ISIS continued to operate within the country. In December the Reuters news service reported local authorities said they had exhumed from a mass grave near Sirte the bodies of 34 Ethiopian Christians executed by ISIS in 2015. According to international media, former Muslims faced intense social and economic pressure to renounce their Christian faith and return to Islam. Libya ====Sudan==== The Foreign Missionary Society Act of 1962 put a limit on the number of churches constructed. Students in military training were forbidden from praying unlike Muslims.Human rights and religion – Page 257 Liam Gearon – 2002 ===Americas=== There are 48 countries in the Americas. North American contains 4 separate countries, Central America has 7, the Caribbean has 24, and South America has 13. ===North America=== ====Mexico==== Mexico is 83% Catholic, 5% Protestant, with some indigenous persons adhering to indigenous beliefs, .5% Jewish and an even smaller number of Muslims and others. In March, authorities in San Miguel Chiptic, Chiapas State, threatened three indigenous families for converting from Catholicism to the Seventh-day Adventist Church and did significant damage to their properties. On 23 May, local police in San Miguel Chiptic arrested two Seventh-day Adventist men for preaching beliefs other than Catholicism. Evangelical Protestant leaders in the states of Chiapas and Oaxaca said local indigenous leaders pressured them to financially support and/or participate in Catholic events, convert or return to Catholicism. In September Christian Solidarity Worldwide reported representatives from Rancheria Yocnajab, located in the Comitan de Dominguez municipality of Chiapas, did not allow the burial of an evangelical Protestant in the community public cemetery because she had not done so. The Catholic Multimedia Center reported that unidentified individuals killed seven priests and kidnapped another. In most cases, attacks on and killings of Catholic priests generally reflect criminal activity rather than religious persecution. In August, the CMC asserted that Mexico was the most violent country for priests in Latin America for the 10th year in a row. In March unidentified individuals detonated two homemade bombs in two Catholic churches in Matamoros, Tamaulipas. Christian Solidarity Worldwide reported unidentified individuals killed four non-Catholic clergy. ===South America=== ====Bolivia==== An angry mob of Indigenous peoples destroyed the only Protestant church in the remote village of Chucarasi in the Bolivian Andes after beating a congregational elder unconscious. Villagers apparently attacked their Christian neighbors because they blamed them for a hail storm that damaged local crops. Angry Mob destroys church in Bolivian Andes retrieved 21 January 2019 ====Chile==== Since 2015, twelve churches have been burned in southern Chile, 10 Catholic ones and two Protestant ones. Attacks were supposedly from the Mapuche indigenous people, who are campaigning to reclaim ancestral lands, according to authorities. A note declaring \\"We are going to burn all churches\\" was found at the ruins of the Christian Union Evangelical church in Ercilla, Chile, after an arson attack on 31 March 2016. ===The Caribbean=== ====Cuba==== In Cuba, government regulations are aimed at curbing the growth of Christian house churches. Christian House Churches in Cuba Facing New Restriction Laws retrieved 21 January 2019 ===Asia=== ====China==== In the Xi Jinping era, some estimates put the number of Christians in China at 100 million, but it has been claimed in 2019 that 20 million of them faced persecution, including crackdowns, raids and church closures. Claims of persecution of Chinese Christians occurred in both official and unsanctioned churches. ====India==== ====Indonesia==== ====North Korea==== According to the Christian Open Doors organization, North Korea is the leader among countries who persecute Christians. ====Pakistan==== Christians in Pakistan are a minority, making up 1.6% of the population, and religious minorities are frequently discriminated against. The Pakistan blasphemy law mandates that blasphemy of the Qur'an is to be punished. Critics of the laws say that Christians like Asia Bibi are sentenced to death with only hearsay for evidence of alleged blasphemy. At least a dozen Christians have been given death sentences, and half a dozen of them have been murdered after being accused of violating blasphemy laws. In 2005, 80 Christians were behind bars due to these laws. Christians in Pakistan have been murdered in outbreaks of communal violence, such as the 2009 Gojra riots, and they have been targeted by militant groups, with the Peshawar church attack killing 75 Christians in Peshawar in 2013, New York Times: \\"Suicide Attack at Christian Church in Pakistan Kills Dozens\\" by ISMAIL KHAN and SALMAN MASOOD 22 September 2013 and the Lahore church bombings killing 15 Christians in 2015. The campaign of violence by the Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan has been described as a genocide. ====Sri Lanka==== Christians in Sri Lanka are a minority, making up around 7.4% of the population as of the 2011 census.Religious Beliefs In Sri Lanka, worldatlas.com The Christian population faces sporadic outbreaks of violence and hostility by extremists. Churches have been vandalized by mobs organized by supporters of religious nationalist groups, such as Hindu supporters of Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh, Buddhist supporters of Bodu Bala Sena and Islamist supporters of National Thowheeth Jama'ath. ===Middle East=== Former Lebanese president Amine Gemayel stated in 2011 that Christians had become the target of genocide after dozens of Christians were killed in deadly attacks in Egypt and Iraq. According to Israeli ambassador to the United States Michael Oren, in the hundred years leading up to 2010 the Middle East's Christian population dwindled from 20% to less than 5%. Oren argues that with the exception of Israel, Christians in the Middle East have endured severe political and cultural hardships: in Egypt, Muslim extremists have subjected Coptic Christians to beatings and massacres, resulting in the exodus of 200,000 Copts from their homes; in Iraq, 1,000 Christians were killed in Baghdad between the years 2003 and 2012 and 70 churches in the country were burned; in Iran, converts to Christianity face the death penalty and in 2012 Pastor Yousef Nadarkhani was sentenced to death; in Saudi Arabia, private Christian prayer is against the law; in the Gaza Strip, half of the Palestinian Christian population has fled since Hamas seized power in 2007 and Gazan law forbids public displays of crucifixes; in the West Bank, the Christian population has been reduced from 15% to less than 2%. ====Egypt==== In Egypt, the government does not recognize religious conversions from Islam to Christianity. Foreign missionaries are allowed in the country if they restrict their activities to social improvements and refrain from proselytizing. The Coptic Pope Shenouda III was internally exiled in 1981 by President Anwar Sadat, who then chose five Coptic bishops and asked them to choose a new pope. They refused, and in 1985 President Hosni Mubarak restored Pope Shenouda III, who had been accused of fomenting interconfessional strife. Particularly in Upper Egypt, the rise in extremist Islamist groups such as the Gama'at Islamiya during the 1980s was accompanied by increased attacks on Copts and on Coptic Orthodox churches; these have since declined with the decline of those organizations, but still continue. The police have been accused of siding with the attackers in some of these cases. In April 2006, one person was killed and twelve injured in simultaneous knife attacks on three Coptic Orthodox churches in Alexandria. Since the overthrow of Hosni Mubarak in 2011, Egypt's Coptic Christians have been the target of increasing opposition and discrimination. In 2011, anti-Christian activity in Egypt included church burnings, protests against the appointment of a Coptic Christian governor in Qena, and deadly confrontations with the Egyptian army. On television Islamists referred to Christians as heretics and said they should be made to pay the jizya tax. A Coptic priest accused Islamists in the country of massacring uninfected pigs predominantly owned by Copts during a swine flu scare: \\"They killed these innocent pigs just because they thought they violated their religion in some way.\\" In October 2011 a draft resolution passed by the European Parliament accused Egypt of persecuting the country's Christian population. By mid-2012 10,000 Christians had fled the country. In July 2012, Dahshur's entire Christian community, which some estimate to be as many as a hundred families, fled to nearby towns due to sectarian violence. The violence began in a dispute over a badly ironed shirt, which in turn escalated into a fight in which a Christian burned a Muslim to death, which in turn sparked a rampage by angry Muslims, while the police failed to act. At least 16 homes and properties of Christians were pillaged, some were torched, and a church was damaged during the violence. From 2011 to 2013, more than 150 kidnappings, for ransom, of Christians had been reported in the Minya governorate. There is a long-running tension between Christians and Muslims in areas like Minya over whether churches may appear in the village. It is possible, legally speaking, for Christians to get a permit for built churches. However, civilian mobs are liable to attack the building if one's house is thought of as an unlicenced or not-yet-licensed church, or if one is thought to be building a new church. Some Muslim villagers see churches as unclean. In 2016, Egyptian poet Fatima Naoot was convicted of \\"contempt of religion\\" and sentenced to three years in jail for a 2014 Facebook post criticising animal killing during Eid. Four Coptic Christian juveniles were convicted of \\"contempt of religion\\" the next month, with three of them sentenced to five years in prison. ====Iraq and Syria==== The consolidation of power in the hands of Shiite Islamists in Iraq since the overthrow of the Saddam Hussein regime has been to the detriment of Iraq's Assyrian and Armenian Christian communities. Friction between rival sects in Iraq has frequently resulted in violence being directed against Christians in the country. Consequently, there has been a flight of Christians from some areas to Europe and to the United States. Since 2003, hundreds of thousands of Christians have fled Iraq, such that the Christian population, which may have been as high as 1.4 million prior to the Iraq War, has dropped to 500,000, with numbers continuing to decline. Between 2003 and 2012 more than 70 churches were bombed. In 2007 Al Qaeda militants killed a young priest in Mosul, and in 2010 gunmen massacred 53 Assyrian Christians in a Baghdad church. During the Syrian Civil War and the spillover into Iraq, persecution of Christians by ISIL and other militant groups has been ongoing. The Fall of Mosul and the Assyrian town of Qaraqosh in the 2014 ISIL advance in Iraq led to an estimated 100,000 Assyrian Christian civilians being displaced. After the fall of Mosul, ISIL demanded Assyrian Christians in the city to convert to Islam, pay tribute, or face execution. ISIL begun marking homes of Christian residents with the letter nūn for Nassarah (\\"Christian\\"). Thousands of Christians, Yazidis (the latter whom were given only the choice of conversion or death) and other, mostly Shi'a Muslims (whom ISIL consider to be apostates) have abandoned their homes and land. The destruction of cultural heritage by ISIL has included the Mosque of the Prophet Jonah, revered in all Abrahamic faiths. ====Israel==== A vandalized Christian graveyard in Bethlehem. The text says \\"Death to Arabs\\" in Hebrew. In Jerusalem, there have been instances of Christian churches and monasteries being vandalized with spray-painted offensive remarks against Christianity, including death threats. These are believed to be price tag attacks by extremist settlers. In Tel Aviv in 2008, three teenagers burned hundreds of Christian Bibles.In a 2008 Tel Aviv incident, hundreds of copies of the New Testament, which had been handed out in the city (allegedly by Messianic Jews in order to convert Ethiopian Jews), were burned by three teenaged Orthodox students of Judaism. Uzi Aharon, the town's deputy mayor, told CNN he had collected the New Testaments but that he did not plan for them to be burned. The youths had done so while he was not present. Once he found out that the fire was going, he put it out. A number of Ultra-Orthodox/Haredi youth have reportedly spat at Christian clergymen. Archbishop Aris Shirvanian, of Jerusalem's Armenian Patriarchate, says he personally has been spat at about 50 times in the past 12 years. The Anti-Defamation League has called on the chief Rabbis to speak out against the interfaith assaults. Father Goosan, Chief Dragoman of the Armenian Patriarchate of Jerusalem, stated that, \\"I know there are fanatical Haredi groups that don't represent the general public but it's still enraging. It all begins with education. It's the responsibility of these men's yeshiva heads to teach them not to behave this way\\". In January 2010, Christian leaders, Israeli Foreign ministry staff, representatives of the Jerusalem municipality and the Haredi community met to discuss inter-faith tolerance. The Haredi Community Tribunal of Justice published a statement condemning harassment of Christians, stating that it was a \\"desecration of God's name.\\" Several events were planned in 2010 by the Orthodox Yedidya congregation to show solidarity with Christians and improve relations between the Haredi and Christian communities of Jerusalem. In July 2012, a former member of the Knesset, Michael Ben-Ari, who supports Kahanism, videotaped himself tearing up a copy of the New Testament and throwing it in the trash. Ben-Ari referred to it as a \\"despicable book\\" that should be \\"in the dustbin of history\\". In response, the American Jewish Committee urged the Knesset to censure Ben-Ari, while a spokesman for Benjamin Netanyahu also condemned Ben- Ari's actions. ====Palestine==== Palestinian Media Watch (PMW) reported that state-controlled Palestinian media frequently demonize religions like Judaism and Christianity. PMW translated into English a children's television program aired twice in 2012 it said featured a young girl saying Jews and Christians are \\"cowardly and despised.\\" West Bank In 2002, a mob of Palestinian Muslims burned Christian property in Ramallah. A dossier submitted in 2005 to Church leaders in Jerusalem listed 93 incidents of abuse alleged to have been committed against Palestinian Christians by Muslim extremists and 140 cases of gangs allegedly stealing Christian land in the West Bank. In May 2012 a group of 100 Muslims attacked Taybeh, a Christian village in the West Bank. Gaza In 2007, the Gaza Strip had a tiny Christian minority of 2,500–3,000. The Hamas overthrow of the Palestinian Authority in Gaza during that year was accompanied by violent attacks against Christians and Christian holy sites by Islamic militants. A Catholic convent and Rosary Sisters school were ransacked, with some Christians blaming Hamas for the attack. In September 2007 Christian anxiety grew after an 80-year-old Christian woman was attacked in her Gaza home by a masked man who robbed her and called her an infidel. That attack was followed less than a month later by a deadly assault on the owner of the only Christian bookstore in Gaza City. Muslim extremists were implicated as being behind the incident. The library of YMCA was bombed in 2008 by gunmen who, according to guards at the site, asked why the guards worked for \\"infidels.\\" In 2011, the Christian population of Gaza Strip was less than 1,400. A member of the Catholic faith told The Guardian he was stopped by a Hamas official and told to remove a wooden crucifix he was wearing. ====Saudi Arabia==== The human rights advocacy group International Christian Concern (ICC) told the Christian Post that 35 Christian Ethiopians – men and women – were violently arrested in Jeddah in December 2011 while holding a prayer meeting in their home. The prisoners complained of being persecuted on account of their faith and of being pressured to convert to Islam, and the women reported undergoing a humiliating strip search. According to the ICC, one prisoner said, \\"The Muslim preacher [that was sent by officials to speak to the prisoners] vilified Christianity, denigrated the Bible and told us that Islam is the only true religion.\\" ===Europe=== ====Norway==== Anti-Christian graffiti in Tampere, Finland On 6 June 1992, the Fantoft Stave Church, a wooden structure originally built in 1150 in Fortun and moved to Bergen in 1883, was burnt down. At first the fire was attributed to lightning and electrical failure. In January 1993 Varg Vikernes, also known as \\"Count Grishnackh\\", was interviewed by a local journalist in his apartment decorated with 'Nazi paraphernalia, weapons and Satanic symbols'. Vikernes, at the time a proponent of White nationalism, social conservatism, survivalism and his völkisch-inspired ideology, declared that he wanted to blow up Blitz House and Nidaros Cathedral. He has publicly supported black metal fans burning down eight churches in Norway. He used a photo of the charred remnants of one church taken soon after the fire on his band Burzum's EP entitled Aske (Norwegian for ashes). Following his statement, the Norwegian authorities began to clamp down on black metal musicians. In 1994, Vikernes was found guilty of murder, arson and possession of illegal weapons (including explosives) and given the maximum sentence under Norwegian law of 21 years in prison. He was released in 2009. The following is a partial list of Norwegian Christian church arsons in 1992 by anti-Christian groups reported by English- language media sources: *23 May 1992: Storetveit Church in Bergen. *1 August: Revheim Church in Stavanger.Lords of Chaos (1998): 78 *21 August: Holmenkollen Chapel in Oslo.Lords of Chaos (1998): 79 *1 September: Ormøya Church in Oslo. *13 September: Skjold Church in Vindafjord. Varg Vikernes and Samoth were convicted for this. *October: Hauketo Church in Oslo. *24 December: Åsane Church in Bergen.Satan rides the Media (1998) Varg Vikernes and musician Jørn Inge Tunsberg were convicted for this.Satan rides the Media *25 December: a Methodist church in Sarpsborg. A firefighter was killed while fighting this fire. ==== Russia ==== Many attacks, arsons and acts of vandalism against churches in Russia are reported each year. Pope Supports Russian Church’s Position on Vandalism MOSCOW, 18 October (RIA Novosti) Acts of vandalism against Orthodox churches in Russia, 1998-2008 RIA Novosti, 14:46 01.12.2008 The acts of vandalism are often accompanied by Satanic symbolism and graffiti. In many instances, icons and crosses are burned and vandalized, and swastikas and Satanic symbols are painted on the walls of churches (while other attacks on churches in Russia are simply robberies). Some of the attacks on the churches, such as the cutting down of crosses, appear to be conducted by groups organized online and by local youth.

Although each block was cut with great precision on adjacent faces, the external face was left rough as when removed from the quarry. The blocks were laid randomly without continuous courses or vertical and horizontal joints. Ashlar () is finely dressed (cut, worked) stone, either an individual stone that was worked until squared or the structure built from it. Ashlar is the finest stone masonry unit, generally rectangular cuboid, mentioned by Vitruvius as opus isodomum, or less frequently trapezoidal. Precisely cut \\"on all faces adjacent to those of other stones\\", ashlar is capable of very thin joints between blocks, and the visible face of the stone may be quarry-faced or feature a variety of treatments: tooled, smoothly polished or rendered with another material for decorative effect. One such decorative treatment consists of small grooves achieved by the application of a metal comb. Generally used only on softer stone ashlar, this decoration is known as \\"mason's drag\\". Ashlar is in contrast to rubble masonry, which employs irregularly shaped stones, sometimes minimally worked or selected for similar size, or both. Ashlar is related but distinct from other stone masonry that is finely dressed but not quadrilateral, such as curvilinear and polygonal masonry. Ashlar may be coursed, which involves lengthy horizontal layers of stone blocks laid in parallel, and therefore with continuous horizontal joints. Ashlar may also be random, which involves stone blocks laid with deliberately discontinuous courses and therefore discontinuous joints both vertically and horizontally. In either case, it generally uses a joining material such as mortar to bind the blocks together, although dry ashlar construction, metal ties, and other methods of assembly have been used. The dry ashlar of Inca architecture in Cusco and Machu Picchu is particularly fine and famous. ==Etymology== The word is attested in Middle English and derives from the Old French aisselier, from the Latin axilla, a diminutive of axis, meaning \\"plank\\". \\"Clene hewen ashler\\" often occurs in medieval documents; this no doubt means tooled or finely worked, in contradistinction to rough-axed faces. This also attests the alternative spellings ashler and ashelere. ==Use== Ashlar blocks have been used in the construction of many buildings as an alternative to brick or other materials. In classical architecture, ashlar wall surfaces were often contrasted with rustication. The term is frequently used to describe the dressed stone work of prehistoric Greece and Crete, although the dressed blocks are usually much larger than modern ashlar. For example, the tholos tombs of Bronze Age Mycenae use ashlar masonry in the construction of the so- called \\"beehive\\" dome. This dome consists of finely cut ashlar blocks that decrease in size and terminate in a central capstone. These domes are not true domes, but are constructed using the corbel arch. Ashlar masonry was also heavily used in the construction of palace facades on Crete, including Knossos and Phaistos. These constructions date to the MM III-LM Ib period, c. 1700–1450 BC. In modern European masonry the blocks are generally about in height. When shorter than , they are usually called small ashlar. == As metaphor== In some Masonic groupings, which such societies term jurisdictions, ashlars are used as a symbolic metaphor for how one's personal development relates to the tenets of their lodge. As described in the explanation of the First Degree Tracing Board, in Emulation and other Masonic rituals the rough ashlar is a stone as taken directly from the quarry, and allegorically represents the Freemason prior to his initiation; a smooth ashlar (or \\"perfect ashlar\\") is a stone that has been smoothed and dressed by the experienced stonemason, and allegorically represents the Freemason who, through education and diligence, has learned the lessons of Freemasonry and who lives an upstanding life. ==See also== *Ablaq *Dimension stone *Opus quadratum *Stone cladding *Stone veneer ==References== ==External links== Category:Building stone Category:Stonemasonry Category:Types of wall Category:Wallcoverings Category:Architectural elements Category:Garden features Category:Masonic symbolism ","title":"Ashlar"},{"id":"1281808","text":"Salem University is a private for-profit university in Salem, West Virginia. It has about 250 on campus and about 600 online students that are enrolled in undergraduate as well as graduate programs, and was founded by the Seventh Day Baptist Church in 1888. ==History== The school was founded as Salem College in December 1888 by the Seventh Day Baptist Church. Over the next 100 years, the school continued as a liberal arts, teacher education, and nursing college. In 1989, Salem formed an alliance with Teikyo University of Tokyo, Japan, which changed the focus of the school to one of education of international students. Salem College was renamed Salem-Teikyo University. The alliance with Teikyo ended in 2000, when the school was purchased by investors from Singapore. At that time, the school changed its name to Salem International University. Salem International University was acquired by Salem Education LLC in June 2005. The school was renamed Salem University in September 2017. The Salem College Administration Building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1989. ==Accreditation== Salem is regionally accredited by the Higher Learning Commission. ==Academics== Salem offers a variety of undergraduate degrees including the Associate of Arts, Associate of Science, Bachelor of Arts, and Bachelor of Science. The School of Nursing offers a Bachelor of Science in Nursing (a degree-completion program for registered nurses), and an Associate of Science in Nursing that prepares students to become Registered Nurses. At the graduate level, Salem offers a Master of Business Administration, a Master of Education, and a Master of Science in Nursing. Teachers may take courses in the School of Education as non-degree students to renew their licenses. A post-master's certificate in Educational Leadership is offered that leads to advanced licensure and a certificate in Special Education Leadership is also offered. All programs, including distance education programs, are delivered in a monthly format allowing students to complete their degrees more quickly than their counterparts at other traditional or online universities. This attracts non-traditional students conscious of time and accessibility. Since classes are four weeks long, the MBA or M.Ed. can be completed in 12 months or fewer, a Bachelor's in 40 months, or an Associate's in only 20 months, if a student were to start college studies without any prior college credits. ==Athletics== Salem participates in NCAA Division II athletics. Salem had been a charter member of the West Virginia Intercollegiate Athletic Conference (WVIAC) in 1924, but left that conference in 2010. Since that time, the Salem Tigers have been members of the Eastern College Athletic Conference in 17 men's and women's sports including basketball, baseball, softball, soccer, tennis, water polo, swimming, cross country, volleyball, and track. Salem is one of four West Virginia schools that joined the Great Midwest Athletic Conference (G-MAC) in July 2013. The other three schools were former WVIAC colleagues of Salem that had been cast adrift in the breakup of the WVIAC. Salem left the G-MAC at the end of the 2015-16 season.

In 1968, she founded Council for a Beautiful Israel. == Biography == She was born in Ismailia, Egypt, to a Jewish family of Russian and Polish origin. Her parents were Leah Steinberg (the daughter of Yechiel Michal Steinberg, the founding family of Motza, a village on the outskirts of Jerusalem), and Simcha Ambash (an acronym for \\"I believe in complete faith\\", in Hebrew), an engineer by profession.

Her parents came to Egypt from Jaffa, she was educated in French schools in Ismailia and Cairo and completed her BA in mathematics and physics from the University of Witwatersrand, South Africa. In October 1946, after completing her studies, she immigrated to Israel. In the following year, she was chosen to participate in the first class of the Diplomatic School established by the Jewish Agency. During these years she was a member of the Haganah a Jewish paramilitary organization in the British Mandate of Palestine (1921–48). In 1947 she married Chaim Herzog and accompanied him in his roles in the IDF and in public life. On March 11, 1948, she was wounded in the attack on the Jewish Agency building in Jerusalem.

He is a former Minister of Social and Diaspora Affairs, a former Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs, and a former member of Knesset for Meimad. He is the Rabbi of a vibrant community in Talpiyot, Jerusalem (Beit Boyer), while still holding the title of the Chief Rabbi of Norway. ==Biography== A descendant of seven generations of rabbis in Denmark, Melchior was born in Copenhagen, Denmark, in 1954. His grandfather, Marcus Melchior, helped orchestrate the escape of over 7200 Danish Jews during the Nazi occupation of Denmark, and served and the country's chief rabbi until his death in 1969. Michael was ordained as an Orthodox Rabbi at Yeshivat Hakotel of Jerusalem in 1980. Soon afterwards, he returned to Scandinavia to serve as Chief Rabbi of Norway. In 1986, he immigrated to Israel, and settled down with his family in Jerusalem, while still holding the honorary title of Chief Rabbi of Norway. ==Political career== Melchior entered politics with the Meimad party in 1995. When Rabbi Yehuda Amital was appointed minister without portfolio after the assassination of prime minister Yitzhak Rabin in November 1995, Melchior served as Amital's assistant. Melchior was selected chairman of the managing committee of the Meimad party in early 1996. In the 1999 elections, Meimad ran as part of the One Israel alliance with the Labor Party and Gesher. Melchior won a seat, and was appointed Minister of Social and Diaspora Affairs on 5 August 1999, a post he held until Ariel Sharon became Prime Minister in 2001. Melchior was re-elected to the Knesset as a member of the joint list in 2003 and 2006, as Meimad continued its alliance with the Labor Party. In 2008, Meimad broke away from the alliance, and ran in partnership with the Green Movement in the 2009 elections, but failed to win a seat. On December 14, 2012, on his Facebook page, he said that he will quit Knesset elections. ==Extra-parliamentary political and social activities== As part of his official roles in the Knesset and the Israeli government, Melchior was involved with Birthright Israel, an organization that has brought over 200,000 young Jews to explore their heritage in Israel. In addition, Rabbi Melchior established a number of civil organizations that focus on issues he dealt with in his parliamentary activities, concerning education, inter-Jewish relations, the environment, economics, and Arab-Israeli peace. He founded The Yachad Council, which promotes dialogue between religious and secular Jews, and he continues to serve as honorary chairman of the Citizens' Accord Forum Between Jews and Arabs in Israel. CAF conducts activities that promote civic engagement, encourage active citizenship, and inspire members of the public to play an active role in formulating policies that affect their daily lives and their future. CAF has been working to create dialogue and civic action groups of Jews and Arabs across the country, in cooperation with civic and community organizations, including groups of ultra-Orthodox and Arab participants, among them a group of ultra-Orthodox Jewish women and religious Arab women, with the aim of building a shared society in a sustainable democracy in Israel. In 2002, Melchior established Meitarim - a network of pluralistic Jewish schools in Israel where religious and secular students can grow up and learn together in kindergartens, schools, pre- and post-military institutions in a non- coercive approach, enabling multi interpretations and expressions of Jewish heritage in order to take responsibility for a common Jewish heritage and vision. In 2002, Melchior initiated, together with his Palestinian counterpart Sheikh Talal Sider, an inter-religious summit in Alexandria, Egypt, co- sponsored by the Mufti of Egypt, Grand Imam of al-Azhar Mosque, and Grand Sheikh of al-Azhar University, Muhammad Sayyid Tantawi; Archbishop of Canterbury George Carey; and Eliyahu Bakshi-Doron, Israel's Chief Rabbi. The summit, which launched The Alexandria Process, brought together religious leaders from the Middle-East to adopt common principles aimed at preventing the region's religious sensibilities being exploited during conflicts, and declaring the need to work together towards peaceful solutions of the conflicts. Together with Elie Wiesel, Melchior established the Mosaica Center for Interreligious Cooperation – MERPI (Middle East Religious Peace Initiative) to \\"lead to the implementation\\" of the principles of the Alexandria Declaration.http://www.mosaica-interreligious.org/178926/About- Mosaica Melchior is also a member of the Elijah Interfaith Institute Board of World Religious Leaders.http://www.elijah-interfaith.org/index.php?id=797 More controversially, in September 2012, Melchior claimed that extremist Islamic leaders, including the leaders of Hamas, are ready for peaceful co-existence with Israel, and he added that he has \\"yet to meet with somebody who is not willing to make peace\\" with the Jewish state of Israel, placing the onus for lack of peace with extremist Islamic movements on Israel. Mosaica's second branch is The Center for Conflict Resolution by Agreement which Rabbi Melchior serves as its Chairman. The center serves as a professional address for establishing understandings and agreements between individuals, organizations, groups, and communities. The center believes in every person's abilities to resolve conflicts and to operate in cooperation with the aid of tools from the realm of mediation. Mosaica supports the activities of 33 mediation and dialogue centers across the country with the aim of making the activities accessible to an array of communities in Israel. Thus, individuals, groups, and communities can contribute to a cohesive and respectful Israeli society. An additional initiative of Rabbi Melchior is Kulanu. Kulanu seeks to strengthen the Jewish character of the State of Israel, enhance democracy, and foster unity through its diverse projects. Kulanu is best known for its Chagim BaKehilla (literally: holidays in the community) program, which provides religious services for secular Jews for many of the Jewish holidays. Kulanu worked with Teva Ivri to launch the Shmita Yisraelit program. Other Kulanu programs include Yom Kippur Shel Kulanu; B'Yachad: For a Shared Jewish Democratic Society; Meitarim: Inclusive Jewish Educational Network; and Shmita Yisraeli (in coordination with Teva Ivri). In 2010, Melchior involved himself in economic issues. He co-founded the Israel Civic Action Forum which promotes higher taxation on income from the extraction of natural resources, and the use of the tax income for higher government spending to increase government spending on welfare, education, and health. In 2014, he, along with Hadassah Froman of Tekoa and Yoel Bin Nun of Alon Shvut, participated at the Gush Etzion mourning where a kidnapping of three yeshiva students took place on June 12, 2014, who were found dead on June 30, 2014, and are believed to have been killed shortly after being kidnapped.Bodies of three missing Israeli teenagers found in West Bank, The Guardian ==Prizes and awards== Melchior is a recipient of The Norwegian Award For Tolerance & Bridge Building in the Nobel Institute (1988), The Church Of England's Coventry International Prize For Peace & Reconciliation (2002), and the Liebhaber Prize For The Promotion Of Religious Tolerance And Cultural Pluralism (2007). On January 26, 2016, Rabbi Melchior was awarded The FRRME (Foundation for Relief and Reconciliation in the Middle East) Annual Peace Prize for 2015 at the House of Lords in London. ==Personal== Melchior and his wife Hanna, an occupational therapist, have five children and eleven grandchildren. ==References== ==External links== * *'Doing God', or the importance of religious peacemaking: an interview with Rabbi Melchior - Fathom Journal Category:1954 births Category:Living people Category:20th-century rabbis Category:21st-century rabbis Category:Israeli Orthodox Jews Category:Israeli Orthodox rabbis Category:Religious Zionist Orthodox rabbis Category:Government ministers of Israel Category:Danish rabbis Category:Norwegian rabbis Category:Danish emigrants to Israel Category:People from Copenhagen Category:One Israel politicians Category:Meimad politicians Category:Israeli people of Danish-Jewish descent Michael Category:Members of the 15th Knesset (1999–2003) Category:Members of the 16th Knesset (2003–2006) Category:Members of the 17th Knesset (2006–2009) Category:Deputy ministers of Israel ","title":"Michael Melchior"},{"id":"1281865","text":"Malton is a market town, civil parish and electoral ward in North Yorkshire, England. Historically part of the North Riding of Yorkshire, the town is the location of the offices of Ryedale District Council and has a population of around 13,000 people, measured for both the civil parish and the electoral ward at the 2011 Census as 4,888. It is located to the north of the River Derwent which forms the historic boundary between the North and East Ridings of Yorkshire. Facing Malton on the other side of the Derwent is Norton. The Karro Food Group (formerly known as Malton Bacon Factory), Malton bus station and Malton railway station are located in Norton-on-Derwent. Malton is the local area's commercial and retail centre. In the town centre there are small traditional independent shops and high street names. The market place has recently become a meeting area with a number of coffee bars and cafés opening all day to complement the public houses. Malton has been described as \\"the food capital of Yorkshire\\", and was voted one of the best places to live in Britain by The Sunday Times in both the 2017 and 2018 lists. Malton was named the dog friendliest town in the UK at the annual Dog Friendly Awards, in association with the Kennel Club in 2018/19. In 2020 Malton was named as one of the most dog-friendly staycation spots in the UK and the best in Yorkshire. ==History== ===Roman=== View of St Leonards Catholic church through the Maltings The earliest established building at Malton comes from the late first century AD. The Roman auxiliary fort of Derventio was established under the governor Agricola (40-93) around the same time as Eboracum. The site was established on the north bank of the River Derwent. A large civilian settlement grew up alongside the fort, on the south bank of the river.Jones, R. 2009. Roman Malton. Malton: Malton Museum A single Roman cavalry unit, the Ala Gallorum Picentiana is recorded from the site. The site remained occupied (and subject to continued development) throughout the four centuries of Roman occupation in Britain, particularly in the Trajanic, Severan, Constantian and Theodosian periods and is notable for the manufacture of jet jewellery at the site as well as a single unique inscription identifying a goldsmith shop.Collingwood, R.G. and Wright, R.P. 1965. The Roman Inscriptions of Britain. Oxford: Claredon Press. no.712 ===Medieval=== There was some form of settlement in New Malton by 1138 and old Malton was probably also founded in the 1100s; a Gilbertine monastery was built between 1147-1154 in Old Malton, while the monastic church was probably built around 1180. The first reference to a market in New Malton was in a 1283 document, indicating that craftsment and others, such as butchers, were selling their wares. Earlier, in the 11th century, a wooden Norman castle, Malton Castle, was built in what is now Castle Garden. This was rebuilt in stone by Eustace de Vescy (1169-1216) by the time Richard the Lionheart visited the castle in 1189. Other visitors included Edward II, in 1307 and Robert the Bruce in 1322. The great house subsequently became ruined. The castle site was inherited by Lord William Eure (c. 1483-1548) in 1544, when he was also made a baron.The Eure family had a long and interesting connection with the area – William's son Ralph, born in 1510, defended Scarborough Castle against the Pilgrimage of Grace in 1536 and became Warden of the East Marches. He was also involved in the burning of Edinburgh in 1544. The exploits of this bloody warrior are commemorated in Sir Walter Scott's poem entitled 'Lord Eurie'. In 1569 Ralph Eure built a new house on the castle site and in 1602, the house was rebuilt in much grander style. This was a spectacular property and it was described by the diarist and gunpowder plotter Sir Henry Slingsby as the rival of many other great houses, including that at Audley End. The house was subsequently demolished in 1674 and the stones divided between two sisters, Mary (who married into the Palmes family) and Margaret Eure. (The site is now Castle Garden.) They had quarrelled over their inheritance and the demolition was the settlement ordered by Sheriff Henry Marwood. The Old Lodge Hotel is the remaining fragment of the original Jacobean \\"prodigy house\\" and its size hints at the grandeur of the complete structure. ===18th, 19th and early 20th centuries=== St Michael's, Market Place According to contemporary archives, during the 18th century attention was paid to improving the facilities for traders in Malton, in particular for the numerous butchers, . The town's Shambles, currently opposite Malton Town Hall, used to be located on the north side of St Michael's Church, which still stands in the centre of the Market Place. The Talbot Hotel, still standing and renovated, dates back to the early 17th century and may contain remnants of the medieval town wall. It was initially used as a hunting lodge and became an inn in 1740; it was also a coach stop. The property, with its associated buildings in Talbot Yard, is now Grade II listed. In the Victorian era, it was known as Kimberley's Hotel. Former flour mills, Railway Street The town hall was commissioned in 1749. The building was first used as a butter market, butter being the main marketable product for many farmers of the day. The town hall was extended and changed at various intervals over the years. A sure sign of a town 'up and coming' was the advertisement of a 'light coach, setting out from Leeds to Scarborough returning to Malton to dine.' In the last year of the 18th century, there was a famine in the area, and a soup kitchen was set up in a brew house in the town. The Earl Fitzwilliam of the time subscribed to a fund, which helped provide 'good strong soup' for the hungry poor. In 1801 the population of Old and New Malton numbered 3,788. The workhouse contained 15 elderly people and 17 children. In 1809 Malton's Talbot Hotel was extended and modernised with a third floor being added and new stables being constructed across the road from the hotel. The town's Assembly Rooms were opened in 1814, a place in which 'polite society' could mingle. An 1833 Gazeteer stated that New Malton did a great deal of trade in coal, corn, butter, etc. There were two churches, four meeting houses for \\"dissenters\\", a free school and a national school. A bridge connected this town to Old Malton. Several schools or academies were operating by the 1820s, on a fee basis. According to the 1840 edition of White’s Gazetteer, Malton's \\"town and suburbs have much improved during the last twenty years, by the erection of houses; and gas works were constructed in 1832.\\" The streets of Malton were lit with gas for the first time on 12 November 1832; the first electric light was lit in 1893, powered by a dynamo, in a single location. By 1867, the Malton Waterworks was supplying residents with water. By 1835, medical care was being provided at The Dispensary on Saville Street; this was a predecessor of the Malton Cottage Hospital which would not open until August 1905, funded by donations and a subscription. As late as 1841, dental care was provided by barbers; a Mr. Moseley was a prominent \\"surgeon-dentist\\". Newspapers were well established in 1855, when the tax on newspapers was repealed. The Malton Messenger and The Malton & Norton Gazette were both weekly publications. In 1856, the town was policed by the North Riding, with four men and a superintendent. Thomas Wilson was the Chief Police Officer. The Malton Town Gaol had been opened decades earlier. Work on new police house started in October 1893. By 1881, the Malton Fire Brigade, was operating with a steam engine. In 1881, the population of Old and New Malton totaled 8,750 persons. Newer industries in New Malton included iron and brass foundries. The development of the local railway network flourished during the mid-1800s – the York to Scarborough railway opened in 1845 and the Malton and Driffield Junction Railway opened in 1853. The Malton railway station is now Grade II listed (since 1986). During the early 1900s, electricity was installed in much of the town. Before WW II, several buildings were erected, including the Court House, Cottage Hospital and Police Station. The town was bombed during the war. ==Navigation on the River Derwent== The navigation capacity on the Derwent was one of the earliest in Britain to be significantly improved around 1725, enabling extensive barge traffic to transport goods and produce. The navigation continued to compete with the railway, having been extended as far as Yedingham after 1810. The river's use as a highway declined only after it was bought by the Railway itself and cheaper coal began to arrive by rail, while river maintenance was deliberately neglected. ==Governance== In Medieval times, Malton was briefly a parliamentary borough in the 13th century, and again from 1640 to 1885; the borough was sometimes referred to as 'New Malton'. It was represented by two Members of Parliament until 1868, among them the political philosopher Edmund Burke, and by one member from 1868 to 1885. Ryedale District Council is the local authority. The current Member of Parliament for Thirsk and Malton (since 2015) is Kevin Hollinrake of the Conservative Party. ==Today== Yorkersgate, one of the main streets in town The Fitzwilliam family has been important in the history of Malton for centuries, and its descendants, as the Fitzwilliam Malton Estate, own much of the commercial area in and around the town. In 1713 The Hon Thomas Watson Wentworth purchased the Manor of Malton, beginning a long association between the town and the Wentworth, Watson-Wentworth, Wentworth-Fitzwilliam, and Naylor-Leyland families. A book detailing the history since 1713 was published in 2013, written by Norman Maitland, entitled 300 years of continuity and change: families and business in Malton from the 18th century to the present. The Palace Theatre, Yorkersgate Attractions in modern Malton include the signposted remains of the Roman fort at 'Orchard Fields', and Malton Priory a Gilbertine priory. Eden Camp, a military themed museum, is located just outside the town. Malton Museum is located at the Subscription Rooms in Yorkersgate. The town has an independent cinema, which also houses the World Wide Shopping Mall, and independent retailers, high street shops, cafés, public houses and restaurants. Malton's two microbreweries, Brass Castle and Bad Seed, host an annual spring 'BEERTOWN' festival at the town's Milton Rooms. Both towns are known in connection with Charles Dickens, who made regular visits to the area to see his friend Charles Smithson. Dickens did not write A Christmas Carol while staying in Malton, but was inspired by some of the buildings in the town. There have been recent revivals of Dickens-related festivals. Malton and the neighbouring village of Old Malton provide the settings for the collection of stories told in the book, All is Bright - A Yorkshire Lad's Christmas by Dave Preston. Eden Camp Museum In September 2013 Ryedale District Council issued their Local Plan Strategy. The current Local Plan, produced in September 2013, supports Malton (together with Norton, its twin town on the south side of the river Derwent) as Ryedale District's Principal Town. The Local Plan sees Malton's historic town centre as the thriving and attractive cultural and economic heart of the area. During the Plan's period until 2027, Malton and Norton will be the focus for the majority of any new development and growth including new housing, employment and retail units. The Local Plan establishes a level of house- building of 200 units per annum for the whole district in order to deliver at least 3,000 (net) new homes over the period of 2012 to 2027. Approximately 50% of the planned supply – around 1,500 new homes - will be directed to Malton and Norton. A further plan for employment land is proposed for Malton. Of the 37 hectares of employment land required to meet the needs of the district until 2027, approximately 80% will be allocated towards Malton and Norton. For retail development the plan reflects Malton's role as the main retail centre serving Ryedale, and will direct most new retail and other town centre uses to Malton in order to support and promote its role as a shopping, employment, leisure and cultural centre for Ryedale.http://extranet.ryedale.gov.uk/PDF/Local_Plan_Strategy_text_only_version_5_sept_13.pdf. Morrisons Supermarket Malton Community Recycling bins Malton Telephone Exchange Malton holds a market every Saturday, and a farmers' market once every month. The town has a war memorial and several historical churches (Norton-on-Derwent also holds large church buildings). The town is served by Malton railway station. The livestock market, currently situated on the edge of the town centre will be relocated to a site close to Eden Camp once construction work there is complete. Malton is the middle-ground between York, Pickering (access to the North York Moors and also a terminus of the North Yorkshire Moors Railway), Scarborough, Filey and Whitby. The route of The White Rose Way, a long distance walk from Leeds to Scarborough, North Yorkshire also passes through Malton. Malton and Norton is significant for its horse racing connections, and has a number of training stables in the vicinity. The most recent Malton Stables Open Day, held in August 2013, showcased 19 trainer stables. Writer Norman Maitland describes the history of horse racing as \\"being in the blood in this part of Yorkshire for generations ...\\" with meetings being advertised as early as 1692. The Malton Races were run on Langton Wolds, between 1692 and 1861. ===We Love Malton=== The 'We Love Malton' campaign was launched in March 2009. It aimed to reinvigorate the town of Malton as a 'Food Lovers' destination and raise its appeal with both residents and tourists. The 2015 festival included special guest chef Rosemary Shrager. The Festival for 2018 took place on 27 and 28 May. A harvest festival was also scheduled for 8 September. By 2017, the town was considered to be the food capital of Yorkshire. Food is the main attraction, but tourists can also find a small museum, a cinema, and a theatre. Malton is also well located for visiting the North York Moors and the seaside towns of Whitby, Scarborough and Bridlington. ===Malton Community Interest Company (Malton CIC)=== Formed in 2011, Malton CIC benefits the area with donations to local organisations, including Ryedale Book Festival. The CIC also finances and provides two hours free parking in Malton's Market Place. It helps organise and fund Malton Food Lovers Festival and the Malton Monthly Food Markets. ==Religion== Malton's churches include St Michael's Anglican church and Ss Leonard & Mary Catholic church. There are other churches in the area. ==Education== There are two secondary schools in Malton and Norton, Malton School, founded in 1547, and Norton College. Primary education is provided by St Mary's RC Primary School, Norton Community Primary School and Malton Community Primary School. ==Climate== As with the rest of the British Isles and Yorkshire, Malton possesses a maritime climate with cool summers and mild winters. The nearest Met Office weather station for which records are available is High Mowthorpe, about east of the town centre. Due to its lower elevation, the town centre is likely to be marginally warmer than High Mowthorpe throughout the year. ==Transport== Malton railway station opened in 1845 (1988 photo) Malton is bypassed by the A64, which runs from Leeds and York to Scarborough, with a junction at the A169 to Pickering and Whitby. Malton railway station is on the TransPennine Express route, with fast trains every hour running from Scarborough to York, Leeds, Manchester and Liverpool. Current fastest train time from Malton to London Kings Cross (with one change at York) is approximately 2 hours 33 minutes, while Malton to Leeds can take as little as 51 minutes. There are plans to re-open the old rail link between Malton and Pickering, by the heritage North Yorkshire Moors Railway that would re-create services from Malton to Whitby at a distance of . Malton's bus service is run by Coastliner, a division of the TransDev bus group. Buses run from Leeds and York through Malton to Pickering/Whitby, Scarborough, and Bridlington. There are also regular buses to Castle Howard and Hovingham, and a number of local bus routes. ==Notable people from Malton== * Simon Dyson – golfer * Tim Easterby – racehorse trainer.

Alomar was a switch-hitter and threw right-handed. He is the father of former Major League catcher and current Cleveland Indians interim manager Sandy Alomar Jr. and Hall of Fame second baseman Roberto Alomar. ==Career== Through his career, Alomar was a valuable defensive player. His range and defensive positions were excellent but he was prone to poor throws after making fantastic stops. Alomar was able to play all infield and outfield positions. He led league second basemen in fielding percentage in 1975. Alomar's offense was below-average with a .245 career batting average, 13 home runs and 282 RBI in 1,481 games played. He was, however, a great bunter and gathered a significant number of bunt singles in his career. Alomar enjoyed his best season in with career highs in batting average (.260), home runs (4), runs (82), hits (179) and games played (162), and received an All-Star berth. Alomar was a smart and aggressive base-runner compiling 227 stolen bases including a career high 39 in 1971. A durable player, Alomar was the Angels' everyday second baseman for five years. He twice played a full 162-game season and played in 648 consecutive games between 1969 and 1973. The only postseason at bat of Alomar's career came with the Yankees, during the 1976 American League Championship Series; he was standing on-deck when Chris Chambliss hit the series-winning home run in Game 5. After retiring, Alomar became a manager both in his homeland and minor leagues, and coached in the majors for the Chicago Cubs, Colorado Rockies and San Diego Padres. While in San Diego, Alomar coached his two sons, Sandy Jr. and Roberto. . After the season, Alomar was hired by the Mets as a bench coach and was moved to first base coach after the season. In 2007, he was moved to third base coach. On June 17, 2008 he was once again made bench coach of the Mets by former bench coach and recently promoted manager Jerry Manuel. Following the season, Alomar was let go by the Mets, and replaced by Dave Jauss. ==See also== * List of Major League Baseball career stolen bases leaders * List of players from Puerto Rico in Major League Baseball * List of second-generation Major League Baseball players ==External links== Category:Major League Baseball second basemen Category:Major League Baseball players from Puerto Rico Category:Major League Baseball bench coaches Category:Major League Baseball first base coaches Category:Major League Baseball third base coaches Category:Milwaukee Braves players Category:Atlanta Braves players Category:New York Mets players Category:Chicago White Sox players Category:California Angels players Category:New York Yankees players Category:Texas Rangers players Category:American League All-Stars Category:New York Mets coaches Category:Chicago Cubs coaches Category:Colorado Rockies (baseball) coaches Category:San Diego Padres coaches Category:Minor league baseball managers Category:Wellsville Braves players Category:Davenport Braves players Category:Boise Braves players Category:Austin Senators players Category:Denver Bears players Category:Atlanta Crackers players Category:Richmond Braves players Category:Jacksonville Suns players Category:Caribbean Series players Category:1943 births Category:Living people Category:People from Salinas, Puerto Rico ","title":"Sandy Alomar Sr."},{"id":"1281874","text":"Afon Tryweryn rafters hitting the standing wave of a hydraulic jump. The Tryweryn is a river in the north of Wales which starts at Llyn Tryweryn in the Snowdonia National Park and after joins the river Dee at Bala. It is one of the main tributaries of the Dee and it was dammed in 1965 to form Llyn Celyn, drowning the village of Capel Celyn in spite of much popular and political opposition in Wales. The resulting graffito \\"Cofiwch Dryweryn\\" (\\"Remember Tryweryn\\") near Llanrhystud became and remains a popular icon of Welsh feeling. Water is stored in Llyn Celyn in winter when flows are high, and released over the summer to maintain the flow in the Dee (water from the Dee is used as the water supply for large areas of north-east Wales, and for the Wirral and much of Liverpool in England. ==Whitewater sports== The Tryweryn River joins the River Dee roughly half a mile downstream from llyn Tegid. The reservoir now at the head of the Tryweryn was created in 1965, to provide water to Liverpool. At that time, the 67 inhabitants of the village of Capel Celyn were forcibly removed. The Tryweryn is the site of the Welsh Canolfan Tryweryn national whitewater centre, managed by the Welsh Canoe Association. It is an important river for whitewater kayaking and rafting. The centre features a café and facilities to support whitewater sports. The natural whitewater rapids of the upper section of the Treweryn have been modified (by placing boulders along the river bed) to make them safer and to build playspots. The upper part of the river is usually considered to be Grade III. Usually between 9 and 12 m³/s are released from the Llyn Celyn Dam. The rapids of the lower section remain in a more natural state. These are of somewhat easier grade, with the exception of Bala Mill Falls. The regular releases from Llyn Celyn in summer mean that kayak events and trips can be planned in advance, and commercial rafting can take place. Most whitewater rivers in Wales rely on recent rain to have enough water for kayaking or rafting. Access to the upper part of the Tryweryn is uncontroversial - this contrasts with recreational access to many of the other rivers in Wales (see Rivers Access Campaign for more information), and adds to the popularity of the Tryweryn among kayakers and rafters. In August 2004, John Prescott, deputy prime minister, was on a rafting trip on the Tryweryn and helped to aid a kayaker who had been injured. ==Notes== Category:Bala, Gwynedd Category:Llandderfel Category:Llanycil Tryweryn Tryweryn 1Tryweryn ","title":"Afon Tryweryn"},{"id":"1281876","text":"Ratu Joni Madraiwiwi, Lord Madraiwiwi Tangatatonga (10 November 1957 – 29 September 2016) was a prominent Fijian lawyer, legal scholar, jurist, and politician. He served as Vice-President, and also acting President, of Fiji, and Chief Justice of Nauru. Ratu Madraiwiwi was ceremonially sworn in as Vice- President on 10 January 2005, following his nomination by President, Ratu Josefa Iloilo, and his subsequent approval by the Great Council of Chiefs on 14 December 2004.http://www.pireport.org/articles/2004/12/16/madraiwiwi- appointed-fiji-vice-president He held the Office of Vice-President effective 14 December 2004 to complete the unexpired term of his predecessor, Ratu Jope Seniloli, who had resigned in disgrace on 29 November 2004 in the wake of his convictions for treason concerning his role in the Fiji coup of 2000. Madraiwiwi's first priority was to restore dignity and respect to the Vice- Presidential office.Fraenkel J (2016). Ratu Joni Madraiwiwi. The Journal of Pacific History, 51 (4): 447-450. However, on 5 December 2006, Madraiwiwi was informed of pending dismissal from the Vice-Presidential office, to take effect officially on 15 January 2007, by the Military Commander, Commodore Frank Bainimarama, who had seized power in a military coup. He was forcibly evicted from his official residence and his office on the night of 6 December. Yet, Madraiwiwi announced in the second week of January 2007 that he was merely \\"on leave\\" as Vice-President of Fiji and intended in the meantime to resume private practice as an attorney at Howards law firm. In 2010, Madraiwiwi was presented with a Tongan life peerage and the title of Lord Madraiwiwi Tangatatonga by King George Tupou V of Tonga. Owing to his Fijian and Nauruan nationalities, he was nominated as early as 2013, and subsequently appointed in 2014, to the Supreme Court of the Republic of Nauru as its Chief Justice, the highest position in that country's judicial system, which he held until his death on 29 September 2016.https://www.radionz.co.nz/international/pacific-news/314489/fiji's-ratu- joni-madraiwiwi-diesFraenkel J (2016). Ratu Joni Madraiwiwi. The Journal of Pacific History, 51 (4): 447-450. A lifelong legal scholar, Madraiwiwi was a prolific writer and public speaker who authored several articles and books, including A Personal Perspective, his last book.https://solivakasamablog.wordpress.com/2016/10/07/ratu-joni-madraiwiwi-a- national-treasure-set- aside-6-oct-2016/https://www.academia.edu/3088047/A_review_of_Personal_Perspectives_by_Ratu_Joni_Madraiwiwi == Career == Descended from a long line of Fijian royal hereditary rulers, Ratu Madraiwiwi was the eldest son of Bau chief Ratu Jione Atonio Rabici Doviverata and Fijian Member of Parliament Adi Losalini Raravuya Uluiviti, and was the namesake of his paternal grandfather, Joni Madraiwiwi I, a Fijian Ratu and early colonial administrator in what was then the British Crown Colony of Fiji. He was born in Levuka, on the island of Ovalau, and subsequently titled Turaga na Roko Tui Bau, a vassal chief to the Vunivalu of Bau, Paramount Chief of the Kubuna Confederacy. He obtained a Law degree from the University of Adelaide in Australia, and then left for Montreal, Canada for graduate study in Law at McGill University. For his Master of Laws (LL.M.) degree which he obtained in 1989 at the McGill University Faculty of Law, he chose to specialize in comparative law. His LL.M. thesis on air and space law was titled The archipelagic regime under the United Nations convention of the Law of the Sea 1982 : its development and effect on air lawhttps://www.mcgill.ca/iasl/about/alumni/thesisllm#M1 He also pursued and obtained a Diploma in Air and Space Law (DipA&SL;) from the Institute of Air and Space Law at McGill University a year earlier in 1988. From McGill, Madraiwiwi came back to Fiji and worked for the Office of the Attorney-General of Fiji as solicitor, serving from 1983 to 1991.http://www.pireport.org/articles/2004/12/16/madraiwiwi-appointed-fiji- vice-president He was then appointed a permanent arbitrator in that office until 1997, when he became a judge of the High Court, which stands at the apex of the Fijian judiciary.Fraenkel J (2016). Ratu Joni Madraiwiwi. The Journal of Pacific History, 51 (4): 447-450. He resigned from the bench in mid-2000 in protest against the coup d'état that saw the elected government toppled, the constitution abrogated, and the judiciary reorganised by decree. Thereafter, he practised law privately as a partner of Howards. In addition, he served as director of Fiji Times Limited (the nation's leading newspaper) and trustee of the Fijian Trust Fund. He was also a human rights commissioner and former chairman of the Citizens Constitutional Forum, a pro-democracy and human rights organisation. In 2004, he was installed as Vice-President of Fiji. Rewa high chief Ro Jone Mataitini said the chiefs unanimously supported Ratu Madraiwiwi Vice-Presidential appointment because of his extensive knowledge of the law and because of his great rapport with other racial and religious groups. In this regard, he was regarded as a compromise between those who insisted on reserving the Vice-Presidency for a high chief, and those (including Ratu Epeli Ganilau, the former Chairman of the Great Council of Chiefs), who believed it was time for a non-Fijian, to be appointed to the post as a gesture of goodwill to the Indo-Fijian and other minorities. Fiji Labour Party leader and former Prime Minister Mahendra Chaudhry also welcomed Ratu Madraiwiwi's appointment. \\"Ratu Joni is an eminent scholar who served Fiji with distinction in the last 20 years holding high offices. He is fully conversant with the affairs of the State and he will certainly restore dignity and decorum to the high office,\\" Chaudhry said. Tribal and regional factors played a part in the appointment. Fiji's tribes each belong to one of three confederacies – Kubuna, Burebasaga, and Tovata. One member of the Great Council of Chiefs explained to the media that they had understood that as President Iloilo is from Burebasaga and his predecessor, Ratu Sir Kamisese Mara was from Tovata, the current Vice-President should be from Kubuna. Installed as the Roko Tui Bau on 11 November 1995, Ratu Madraiwiwi is one of the highest chiefs of the Kubuna Confederacy. The Constitution of Fiji assigns a purely ceremonial role to the Vice-President, apart from the power to exercise the functions of the Presidency should the President be unable to perform his duties. With the 84-year-old President Iloilo suffering from ill health, the appointment to the Vice-Presidency of a respected individual who could assume the Presidency in the event of an emergency was regarded as a priority. Madraiwiwi, in fact, was acting President of Fiji in the absence of Iloilo in 2005 and 2006. == Career after the Vice-Presidency == In 2008, when a Truth and Reconciliation Commission was established in the Solomon Islands, in the aftermath of ethnic conflict, it was to have five commissioners, including two foreign nationals. Madraiwiwi was asked, and accepted, to serve as one of the two foreign commissioners. The Commission noted that he brought \\"strong international human rights experience to the TRC\\".Truth and Reconciliation Commission Solomon Islands In January 2010, King George Tupou V elevated him to the Life Peerage in the Kingdom of Tonga, with the title of Lord Madraiwiwi Tangatatonga.\\"Ratu Joni Madraiwiwi appointed Lord Madraiwiwi Tangatonga\\", government of Tonga, 4 January 2010 Ratu Joni became the Chief Justice of Nauru following the resignation of former Chief Justice, Geoffrey Eames QC.He died in service as Supreme Court Chief Justice of Nauru. == Opinions == Madraiwiwi is noted for his outspoken calls for political and cultural moderation, and for his efforts to encourage people to come up with creative and practical solutions to issues that have caused tension in Fijian society. === Ethnic tensions and human rights === Madraiwiwi says that ethnic Fijians really have nothing to fear from the large Indo-Fijian population, as native ownership of most of the land is enshrined in the Constitution. Madraiwiwi has called for a national discussion on adopting an inclusive label for all Fijian citizens. He pointed out that the Fijian label is very often taken to mean the Fijian ethnic group, rather than the citizenry as a whole. \\"While I personally have no problem with the term Fijian, I recognise many others in my community are not,\\" he said in a speech to the Lautoka Rotary Club on 14 March 2005. \\"But let us not leave it there. Let us find other options,\\" he proposed. Addressing the Fiji Law Society convention at Warwick Hotel on Fiji's Coral Coast on 2 July 2005, Madraiwiwi said that the feeling of insecurity felt by many indigenous Fijians would disappear when more of them became better educated. He said that most members of his ethnic community did not trust the Constitution or the rule of law sufficiently, as both instruments could be impugned by whatever government was in power – an attitude that needed to be changed. His people needed to understand, he said, that the rule of law was not an alien Western concept, but one that was, in fact, rooted as much in Fijian as in Western traditions. At an education workshop in Suva on 13 July, Madraiwiwi said it was a mistake to view indigenous rights as superior to human rights in general. He said that the ILO Convention 169 (the Convention concerning Indigenous and Tribal Peoples in Independent Countries) clearly stated that indigenous rights were not separate from human rights and could not be asserted at their expense. Articles referring to a self-contained system of governance for indigenous peoples were, he said, for traditional and cultural matters, and did \\"not legitimise or authorise indigenous supremacy.\\" Madraiwiwi also rejected arguments by some politicians that when the United Kingdom granted independence to Fiji in 1970, they should have handed power back to the chiefs, calling this position legally untenable. \\"To say that power should have been returned to the Fijian chiefs is to ignore what occurred between 1874 and 1970,\\" Madraiwiwi said. He said there was a legal continuity from the chiefs, through British colonial rule, to the modern Fijian state. Universal rules, he said, required Fijians to temper their indigenous rights with the fundamental human rights enjoyed by other communities, though he admitted that many found that difficult to accept. \\"It is an unpalatable truth for Fijians because it flies in the face of everything they have been brought up to believe and conditioned to accept,\\" he said. Madraiwiwi said tensions often arose because fundamental rights were collective, while indigenous rights were individual in character. He reiterated this position in his closing address to the Roundtable on Human Rights, Indigenous Rights, and Nationalism, organised by the Fiji Human Rights Commission at Suva's Holiday Inn on 23 July. He insisted that indigenous rights and fundamental rights are mutually dependent and neither can exist without the other. In a message to cadets at Xavier College in Ba on 27 July, Madraiwiwi said that the cycle of blame trapped Fiji islanders into racially polarised politics. He said that Fiji was the richer for its ethnic and cultural diversity, and commended the cadet corps for having overcome ethnic divisions to operate as a cohesive whole. === Relationship between church and state === In the same Lautoka speech, Madraiwiwi opposed calls for the establishment of a Christian state in Fiji, saying that it would hinder a \\"correct relationship\\" between the overwhelmingly Christian ethnic Fijians and the mainly Hindu and Muslim Indo-Fijian community. He expressed concern that the growth of newer fundamentalist denominations at the expense of the long- dominant Methodist Church \\"evoked a less tolerant dimension to the work of some Christian churches.\\" Madraiwiwi has since reiterated that proposals to establish a Christian state ignore the potential for division and conflict. Speaking at the Religion and Governance Forum in Suva on 17 May 2005, he said the proposal had its roots in the initial conversion of chiefs to Christianity and in the Deed of Cession, in which the chiefs ceded sovereignty to the United Kingdom in 1874, but considered that in a multi-faith country like Fiji, it would not be wise to establish any one faith. In an earlier address to a Hindu gathering on 28 March, Madraiwiwi had criticised government politicians for couching pronouncements in purely Christian terms. \\"When national leaders address the people of Fiji in specifically Christian terms, whatever the occasion, nearly half of our people are excluded,\\" he said. \\"When prayer in mixed company is uttered in terms of a purely Christian God, we unintentionally omit and diminish others present of different faiths. When we use Christian symbolism to promote reconciliation, forgiveness and unity, we discount the contribution and equally rich traditions extant in other faiths and cultural traditions.\\" Madraiwiwi has also said that churches have failed to do enough to confront serious social problems, including rape, incest, and other violent crimes, and has called on Christian leaders to set an example for the people to follow by practising what they preach. Speaking in the Lau Islands on 12 May 2005, he pointed to the late Lauan chief and former Fijian President, Ratu Sir Kamisese Mara, as a one \\"who not only went to church but lived the life of a Christian,\\" and called on religious leaders to do likewise. Later, speaking at the Religion and Governance Forum in Suva on 18 May, he said that there have been cases of churches making unreasonable demands on parishioners in terms of time and natural resources, which have led to \\"a significant erosion on family values\\". He also called on churches to address the problem of excessive yaqona drinking, which he said was a major social problem. He expressed concern that the Methodist Church, to which approximately two-thirds of indigenous Fijians belong, had not addressed these issues at their recent conference, but conceded that as Fijian cultural conditioning aims for consensus rather than frank debates, raising such matters could cause divisions. On 13 May 2005, Roman Catholic Archbishop Petero Mataca said he agreed that churches had a role to play in reducing crime, but said that they should not be seen as solely to blame for the problem. === Views on Fiji's chiefly system === Madraiwiwi has also spoken of the need for chiefs to be accessible to their people and to listen to them. \\"It will be impossible to achieve this if the elders and chiefs have their own way and are too proud of their chiefly status to not bring themselves down to the people,\\" Madraiwiwi told the Lau Provincial Council on 11 May 2005. In an address to the Pacific Regional Workshop on Leadership Development in Lami on 9 July, Madraiwiwi said that the chiefly system in Fiji and other Pacific Island nations would have to adapt to modern realities. Traditional leadership remained significant, he said, but its role was diminishing. He said that British colonisation had reinforced the chiefly system and in fact fossilised it. Historically, there had been some flexibility, as chiefs had to earn their positions through military prowess, but British protection had given the chiefs an unprecedented \\"reach and depth\\", he said. Christianity, too, had buttressed the system. The church and the chiefly system had become intertwined and mutually reinforced each other, not always to society's benefit. The changing realities of the modern world, however, meant that traditional leaders would have to share the leadership of the country with others. He also said that chiefs and church leaders would have to recognise that tradition did not always sit easily with human rights, and that sensitivity was needed to defuse the inevitable tension between the church and tradition on one hand and human rights on the other. At the Fiji Medical Association conference on 1 September, Madraiwiwi said that the days when chiefs, religious ministers, and state officials expected to be treated with deference were gone, and he welcomed the change. He also called on doctors to adopt a higher public profile, as by virtue of their training, skills, and income level, they held a position that required them to provide leadership to the community. \\"The world outside medicine is yours as well,\\" he said. \\"Remedying ailments and illness is not the sum total of your existence. You are also citizens of this country and need to be seen in that role.\\" Madraiwiwi has also maintained that democracy has not yet completely settled down in Fiji. Opening the conference of the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association in Nadi on 6 September 2005, he said that Fiji had yet to fully recognise and appreciate the concepts of human rights and the rule of law. Despite constitutional guarantees, certain aspects of democracy were somewhat tenuous, he considered. Ethnic tensions exacerbated the problem, he said. Indigenous Fijians and Indo-Fijians had competing priorities that would need to be addressed in a manner fair to all, he said. \\"All our communities have to make the effort to reach out to each other rather than waiting passively for gestures that may never be made,\\" Madraiwiwi declared. He added a note of caution, however: \\"Social integration cannot be forced and not proceed at the pace that the community considers uncomfortable.\\" He was optimistic about the overall state of race relations, but thought that more needed to be done: \\"Relationships between our ethnic communities are generally good but we need to continue weaving connections to the point where they are interwoven and unbreakable,\\" he said. In the same speech, Madraiwiwi praised the Commonwealth of Nations. \\"The strength of Commonwealth lies in its diversity and it to be mindful of bearing economic, social, political and cultural systems which comprise its membership,\\" he said. 'Its commonality lies in its connection to humanity, in the main it has provided an invariable forum whose members to open and continue meaningful issues of concern.\\" === Economic and environmental views === On 7 July 2005, Madraiwiwi called on his fellow-chiefs to consider how to maximise the effectiveness of income generated through tourist facilities built on natively owned land. Opening the Tourism Forum at the Sheraton Resort, he said that the annual profit, now more than F$30 million, should be invested to spearhead native Fijian participation in the industry. He also called on leaders to take a more \\"bipartisan\\" approach to national issues, saying that as a small country with limited resources, Fiji could ill afford \\"endless debates about ethnicity and identity.\\" He spoke of the need to break new ground. \\"We need to move forward and beyond the point where we endlessly pursue the demons bequeathed us by our history,\\" Madraiwiwi said. Addressing a Greenpeace meeting in Suva on 10 July to commemorate the 20th anniversary of the bombing of the Rainbow Warrior by French DGSE agents in 1985, Madraiwiwi said that while nuclear testing, the issue at the time of the Rainbow Warrior's destruction, was a thing of the past, the region was still faced with major environmental challenges. \\"Back then the issue of the day was nuclear testing, now we are faced with problems such as climate change, overfishing, deforestation, shipments of radioactive materials through Pacific waters and nuclear proliferation,\\" he said. \\"We need to remain vigilant so that we won't become victims again.\\" A former Greenpeace board member, Madraiwiwi called on the environmental lobby to remember that \\"the actions of a few with commitment, can alter the course of world history.\\" The Vice-President has also called for a crusade against corruption, and for streamlining of the Public Service Commission's disciplinary laws to prevent delays in fighting corruption, which only foster further abuse. \\"Combating it will take courage, determination and perseverance. The most effective means of doing it is by creating a climate not receptive to corruption,\\" Madraiwiwi said at the launch of the Transparency International Fiji book in Suva on 9 December 2005. === Views on homosexuality === On 31 August 2005, Madraiwiwi became the first high-ranking office-holder in Fiji to call for homosexuality to be legalised. Speaking at the opening of the Fiji Medical Association conference in Suva, he said that while he acknowledged the abhorrence of many great religions towards homosexuality, he thought that what sexual acts people do in private is no business of the state. \\"Whatever one's views about it, those who choose to practise that lifestyle in private surely have a right to do so,\\" he said. Madraiwiwi's comments flew in the face of pressure from the Methodist and other churches, as well as some Hindu and Muslim organisations, to close the loopholes in the law which allowed a Fijian citizen and a foreigner who had been convicted of homosexual acts to walk free in late August. Madraiwiwi's endorsement of legalised homosexuality also ran contrary to assertions from Prime Minister Laisenia Qarase that so long as he remained in office, homosexuality would remain illegal. === Views on Fiji's national identity === Speaking at the launch of Fiji Week celebrations on 7 October 2005, Madraiwiwi called on the nation to face up to questions about its fundamental identity. Such issues involved finding an inclusive adjective of nationality, the term \\"Fijian\\" being widely thought of as an ethnic term and its use by non-indigenous persons sometimes resented. The choice of a national language, and the question about whether to keep or change the flag, should also be addressed, he said. It would not do any good to avoid facing such questions, he said, because resolving them was essential to fostering true reconciliation and unity in the nation. === Poppy Drive speech === At the launch of the Poppy Drive on 21 October, Madraiwiwi called on returned servicemen to lay aside old resentments. The general refusal of Indo-Fijians to contribute to the war effort in World War II caused widespread resentment among indigenous Fijians, which has not entirely abated. Madraiwiwi considered, however, that they had shown bravery in their own way, enduring mistreatment \\"with fortitude and grace\\" at the hands of their colonial masters, to whom \\"they had little reason to be grateful.\\" He also challenged people to consider the question of how the economy could have survived had the Indo-Fijians left Fiji for the war. \\"Who would have planted the cane, run the mills and funded the colony if they had gone to battle?\\" he asked. In the same address, the Vice-President said that only those who had experienced the horrors of war could truly appreciate the value of freedom. A generation had grown up taking freedom for granted, he said, but owed a debt of gratitude that could never be repaid to those who had paid the price with their blood. He also said that people have become bolder in asserting their rights, but cautioned that that is one of the causes of wars. === Thoughts on the Fijian electoral system === * See main articles: Electoral system of Fiji; Voting system of Fiji. On 3 November 2005, Madraiwiwi expressed reservations about the so-called Alternative Vote, which incorporates elements of instant run-off voting and electoral fusion, which has been used in Fiji for the past two elections. The system allows political parties and candidates to combine their votes in a constituency according to a prearranged ranking of \\"preferences.\\" Although voters may customise the ranking, few did so at the last two elections, and many were reportedly unaware that a vote cast for the party of their choice might end up being transferred to a party they might have no wish to support. Madraiwiwi said that in practice, voting for a party meant voting for any other party to which that party had agreed to transfer its \\"preferences.\\" He considered that this compromised the voter's freedom of choice, and that in retrospect, it might have been better to retain the first past the post system that was formerly used. At a workshop organised by the Citizens Constitutional Forum in Suva, Madraiwiwi endorsed calls for electoral reform on 9 February 2006. Madraiwiwi, who was the chief guest at the forum, called for a reduction in the number of communal constituencies (elected on ethnic rolls, almost two-thirds of the present House of Representatives) and a corresponding increase in the number of open constituencies (elected by universal suffrage). Communal voting reinforced the ethnic faultline that characterised elections in Fiji, he said, and steps should be taken to move away from it. The Vice-President also reiterated his earlier reservations about the Fijian electoral system. It was not well understood by less literate sections of the population, he said, and though its purpose was to encourage coalition-building, it was open to manipulation and a simpler voting system, which would be fair and neutral, should be considered, the Fiji Live and Fiji Village news services reported him as saying. He proposed proportional representation for as an option which would reflect the composition of the Fijian electorate. The constitutional requirement for multi-party coalitions, which has never been implemented strictly as stipulated, should also be reconsidered, he said. In a rare display of unity, both Tomasi Vakatora of the predominantly indigenous Grand Coalition Initiative Group and Krishna Datt of the mainly Indo-Fijian Fiji Labour Party both rejected the Vice-President's calls for proportional representation, saying they were satisfied with the present electoral system. Madraiwiwi also expressed concern about how the high level of Indo-Fijian emigration could create electoral disparity, affecting the election results in marginal open constituencies. === Critique of ethnic politics === In his opening address to the Pacific Islands Political Studies Association (PIPSA) conference on 24 November 2005, Madraiwiwi described race relations as \\"a work in progress.\\" He lamented the ethnic faultline that defines Fijian politics, a situation reinforced, he said, by what political parties thought the electorate wanted. The electoral system, in which almost two-thirds of the seats in the House of Representatives are chosen by voters registered on closed ethnic rolls, further reinforced this divide, he maintained. The result was that people retreated into their \\"ethnic fortresses\\" and viewed one another with suspicion. Madraiwiwi spoke of the need to build personal relationships on the basis of trust, across ethnic lines. \\"We must begin to trust each other if this country is to progress the way we want it to. But before that we have to lay the preparatory work to engender that trust by building relationships every day,\\" he declared. One factor gave the Vice-President cause for optimism. The indigenous population was growing somewhat faster than that of the nation as a whole, which he thought would gradually allay their fears of marginalisation and could lead to their being less fearful about being led by someone of a different ethnic group. === Views on the place of the Fijian language === * See main article: National language debate in Fiji. Addressing the 72nd annual meeting of the Fijian Teachers Association in Suva on 9 January 2006, Madraiwiwi added his own voice to calls for the Fijian language to be made a compulsory subject in all primary schools. His parents' generation had emphasised prioritising English on the assumption that Fijian could be learned later, but this had resulted in a generation knowing little Fijian, and unless the language was made compulsory at all levels of primary education, it would be lost to the next generation, Madraiwiwi said. == Achievements == In his capacity of Acting President of Fiji, Madraiwiwi succeeded in brokering a truce on 16 January 2006 between Prime Minister Laisenia Qarase and Military Commander Commodore Frank Bainimarama, whose long-running feud had raised fears of civil unrest or a military coup. Under Madraiwiwi's mediation, each side made some concessions to the other, and observers were cautiously optimistic that Fiji had been pulled back from the brink. Although the truce eventually broke down, it postponed the coup that eventually took place on 5 December. == Personal life == Ratu Madraiwiwi is the eldest son of Doctor Ratu Jione Atonio Rabici Doviverata, who preceded him as Roko Tui Bau in 1995. His mother, Adi Losalini Raravuya Uluiviti was from the chiefly Tui Nairai family, in Fiji's Lomaiviti province. She was one of the first women to become a member of Fiji's Legislative Council and subsequently a Member of Parliament. Ratu Madraiwiwi is a grandson of Ratu Joni Madraiwiwi (1859–1920), a Bauan chief, and a great- great grandson of Ratu Seru Epenisa Cakobau (1815–1883), the Fijian monarch who unified the nation under his leadership before ceding the islands to the United Kingdom in 1874. He is also a nephew of Ratu Sir Lala Sukuna (1888–1958), who forged embryonic institutions for what would become the independent nation of Fiji, although he did not live to see it. On 5 December 1998, he married Adi Lusi Tuivanuavou, also known as Adi Lusiana Paluvavau Qolikoro, on Bau Island in Fiji. Madraiwiwi died on 29 September 2016 after a short illness. He was later laid to rest at the Sau Tabu in Bau Island on 07 October 2016 a week after his death. His death was attended by The King of Tonga King Tupou VI and other Chiefly families around Fiji. == References == ==External links== * Fiji's 2001 Elections: Our Country at the Crossroads – 2001 Parkinson Memorial Lecture Series, 15 August 2001. * Ethnic Tensions and the Rule of Law – Siwatibau Memorial Lecture, Honiara, Solomon Islands, 24 September 2004. * Speech to Lautoka Rotary Club (14 March 2005). * As you enter (a poem by Ratu Joni Madraiwiwi) Category:1957 births Category:2016 deaths Category:Chief Justices of Nauru Category:Fijian chiefs Category:Tongan nobles Category:Tui Kaba Category:Vice-Presidents of Fiji Category:Fijian judges on the courts of Nauru Category:University of Adelaide alumni Category:McGill University alumni Category:Politicians from Bau (island) ","title":"Joni Madraiwiwi"},{"id":"1281893","text":"Kathryn Leigh Scott (born Marlene Kringstad;Biography: \\"Kathryn Leigh Scott \\".

His father was a solicitor, and his mother was the daughter of Matthew Buist, factor to Lord Haddington. In 1855 Mrs. Adamson was left a widow with small means, and devoted herself entirely to the education of her six children. Of these, Robert was successful from the first. At the end of his school career he entered the University of Edinburgh at the age of fourteen, and four years later graduated with first-class honours in mental philosophy, with prizes in every department of the faculty of Arts. He completed his university successes by winning the Tyndall-Bruce scholarship, the Hamilton fellowship (1872), the Ferguson scholarship (1872) and the Shaw fellowship (1873). After a short residence at Heidelberg (1871), where he began his study of German philosophy, he returned to Edinburgh as assistant first to Henry Calderwood and later to A. Campbell Fraser; he joined the staff of the Encyclopædia Britannica (9th edition) (1874) and studied widely in the Advocates' Library. ==Professorial appointments== In 1876 he came to England as successor to W. S. Jevons in the chair of logic and philosophy, at Owens College, Manchester. In 1883 he received the honorary degree of LL.D. In 1893 he went to the University of Aberdeen, and finally in 1895 to the chair of logic at the University of Glasgow, which he held till his death. Except during the first few years at Manchester, he delivered his lectures without manuscripts. In 1903, under the title The Development of Modern Philosophy and Other Essays, his more important lectures were published with a short biographical introduction by W. R. Sorley of Cambridge University (see Mind, xiii. 1904, p. 73 foil.). Most of the matter is taken verbatim from the note- book of one of his students. Under the same editorship there appeared, three years later, his Development of Greek Philosophy. In addition to his professional work, he did much administrative work for Victoria University and the University of Glasgow. In the organisation of Victoria University he took a foremost part, and, as chairman of the Board of Studies at Owens College, he presided over the general academical board of the Victoria University. At Glasgow he was soon elected one of the representatives on the court, and to him were due in large measure the extension of the academical session and the improved equipment of the university. Throughout his lectures, Adamson pursued the critical and historical method without formulating a constructive theory of his own. He felt that any philosophical advance must be based on the Kantian methods. It was his habit to make straight for the ultimate issue, disregarding half-truths and declining compromise. He left a hypothesis to be worked out by others; this done, he would criticise with all the rigour of logic, and with a profound distrust of imagination, metaphor and the attitude known as the will-to-believe. ==Philosophical views== As he grew older his metaphysical optimism waned. He felt that the increase of knowledge must come in the domains of physical science. But this empirical tendency as regards science never modified his metaphysical outlook. He has been called Kantian and neo-Kantian, realist and idealist (by himself, for he held that appearance and reality are co-extensive and coincident). At the same time, in his criticism of other views he was almost typical of Hegelian idealism. All processes of reasoning or judgment (i.e. all units of thought) are (i) analysable only by abstraction, and (2) are compound of deduction and induction, i.e. rational and empirical. An illustration of his empirical tendency is found in his attitude to the Absolute and the Self. The \\"Absolute\\" doctrines he regarded as a mere disguise of failure, a dishonest attempt to clothe ignorance in the pretentious garb of mystery. The Self as a primary, determining entity, he would not therefore admit. He represented an empiricism which, so far from refuting, was actually based on, idealism, and yet was alert to expose the fallacies of a particular idealist construction (see his essay in Ethical Democracy, edited by Stanton Coit). ==Personal life== His wife, Margaret Duncan, the daughter of a Manchester merchant, was a woman of kindred tastes, and their union was entirely happy. Their daughter, Sarah Gough Adamson was a highly regarded landscape artist. ==Published writings== It is matter for regret to the student that Adamson's active labours in the lecture room precluded him from systematic production. His writings consisted of short articles, of which many appeared in the Encyclopaedia and in Mind, a volume on Kant and another on Fichte. At the time of his death he was writing a History of Psychology, and had promised a work on Kant and the Modern Naturalists. Both in his life and in his writings he was remarkable for impartiality. It was his peculiar virtue that he could quote his opponents without warping their meaning. From this point of view he would have been perhaps the first historian of philosophy of his time, had his professional labours been less exacting. ;Bibliography The following were published, either in his lifetime or posthumously. * Development of Greek Philosophy, The (1908) * Development of Modern Philosophy and Other Essays, The (1903) * Fichte (1881) Blackwood's Philosophical Classics * On the Philosophy of Kant (1879) ;Contributions to the Encyclopædia Britannica Ninth Edition *Friedrich von Hermann ;Contributions to the Encyclopædia Britannica Eleventh Edition *Francis Bacon (with John Malcolm Mitchell) *Roger Bacon (with an anonymous co-author) *Friedrich Eduard Beneke *George Berkeley *Saint Bonaventura (with an anonymous co-author) *Giordano Bruno (with John Malcolm Mitchell) *Joseph Butler (in part) *Category (in part) *Johannes Scotus Erigena (with John Malcolm Mitchell) *Johann Gottlieb Fichte (with an anonymous co-author) *Fourier, François Charles Marie *Pierre Gassendi (with an anonymous co- author) *David Hume (with John Malcolm Mitchell) *Immanuel Kant (with an anonymous co-author) ;Contributions to the Dictionary of National Biography *Adelard of Bath *Alcuin *Alexander of Hales *Alfred Anglicus *Bacon, Roger *Eyton, Thomas Campbell ==References== ;Attribution * ==External links== * Category:Scottish philosophers Category:1852 births Category:1902 deaths Category:Alumni of the University of Edinburgh Category:Academics of the University of Edinburgh Category:Academics of the University of Aberdeen Category:Academics of the Victoria University of Manchester Category:People from Kingsbarns Category:19th-century Scottish educators Category:19th-century British philosophers ","title":"Robert Adamson (philosopher)"}]`),B={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:P},data(){return{visibleCount:3,poemsData:I}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{loadMore(){this.visibleCount+=3}}},R={class:"card-container"};function H(s,a,o,c,u,i){const m=p("PoemCard");return t(),n(h,null,[a[1]||(a[1]=e("section",null,[e("div",{class:"top-Banner"},[e("div",{class:"top-Banner-Title"},[e("div",{class:"top-Banner-Title-Text"},"🎉Life Quotes🥳")])])],-1)),e("section",null,[e("div",R,[(t(!0),n(h,null,y(i.visiblePoems,(r,f)=>(t(),w(m,{key:f,poem:r},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),i.hasMorePoems?(t(),n("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",onClick:a[0]||(a[0]=(...r)=>i.loadMore&&i.loadMore(...r))},"See more")):b("",!0)])],64)}const L=d(B,[["render",H]]),E=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"drive/38.md","filePath":"drive/38.md"}'),D={name:"drive/38.md"},N=Object.assign(D,{setup(s){return(a,o)=>(t(),n("div",null,[v(L)]))}});export{E as __pageData,N as default};
