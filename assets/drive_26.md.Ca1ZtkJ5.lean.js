Three foreign nationals died in the operation, whom the police identified as terrorist mercenaries, while a further two people were arrested. According to the Bolivian police, the group had been planning to assassinate Bolivian President Evo Morales and Vice President √Ålvaro Garc√≠a Linera. Eduardo R√≥zsa- Flores, Hungarian-Bolivian; √Årp√°d Magyarosi, Hungarian-Romanian; and Michael Martin Dwyer, Irish; were killed during the raid. Mario Tadic, Croatian- Bolivian; and El≈ëd T√≥√°s√≥, Hungarian; were arrested. == Political operation == On April 16, 2009, at 4.30 am, Bolivian security forces entered the Hotel Las Am√©ricas in the city of Santa Cruz. According to the police, the authorities arrived after receiving reports that five foreign nationals, occupying two rooms, were carrying arms. The police report stated that when agents attempted to enter the rooms, they were met with gunfire, initiating a shoot-out which went on for almost half an hour. That same day, the police reported having discovered an arsenal of explosives and firearms in the Santa Cruz fairground. According to some reports, the operation was carried out without any judge's warrant, which violates the Bolivian penal code. The two arrested foreigners were brought to San Pedro prison, in La Paz. == Accusations == President Evo Morales announced upon his arrival in Venezuela, on April 16, that the police had dismantled a left-wing conspiracy to assassinate the President and Vice President. According to Morales, this alleged commando group was responsible for an attack carried out on the house of Cardinal Julio Terrazas, a critic of Morales, two days earlier. The manager of the hotel has contradicted Morales, as he claims that the men were in their rooms when the attack on Terrazas occurred. Breaking with his custom, Morales did not mention the United States on this occasion: a country he has accused in the past of attempting to destabilise his government. Vice President, √Ålvaro Garc√≠a Linera, also accused the leaders of the Santa Cruz separatist movement; but the prefect (now governor) of the Santa Cruz department, Rub√©n Costas, claimed that the incident was a \\"crude set-up\\" by the government, and noted that Morales had previously reported attacks against his person without offering any evidence. Costas also highlighted the absence of Santa Cruz prosecutors in the raid; and claimed that one of the objectives of the alleged set-up was to distract attention from the attack on Cardenal Terrazas. The publication of photographs of cadavers in underwear or unclothed has raised suspicions around the facts of the shoot-out. The extended length of time it took to move the bodies, 16 hours, and the disconnection of CCTV cameras has strengthened these suspicions. Furthermore, it was determined that the doors to the rooms had been blown up before the shooting commenced. Finally, recordings from April 14, when the foreigners entered the hotel, had been deleted. An Irish official declared shortly afterwards that in some of the photographs, Irish citizen Dwyer appeared with his hands bound, which he considered very unusual: The Hungarian Ambassador declared that the three foreigners may have been executed, alleging that the police did not give them time to react: Evo Morales has invited the Hungarian, Irish and Croatian governments to undertake independent investigations in Bolivia, though he underlined that if these governments defend their deceased citizens, he may begin to suspect that they themselves were involved in the supposed conspiracy. For its part, the Bolivian opposition requested the participation of Interpol, whose help had already been offered; however, Morales rejected the request for international investigation, alleging that the opposition had no right to do so. The Bolivian government also claimed to possess photographs which showed Dwyer with local officials; a week after the claims, however, the photos had still not been released. The opposition has underlined that this alleged evidence of political ties has still not been offered, and that this accusation only sought to damage them in the run up to the planned December elections. Dwyer's family have denied that he was a mercenary, claiming that he had not been interested in politics. The Bolivian Minister of Government, Alfredo Rada, presented photographs of a group of people armed with airsoft guns (a game using guns which shoot plastic \\"bullets\\") and military uniform, whom he accused of being part of a terrorist group linked to R√≥zsa. Rada also believed he had identified Mauricio Iturri, an activist, in the photo. He subsequently acknowledged that the person in the photograph was not Iturri, but was instead an airsoft fan. The people in the photograph, members of the Santa Cruz Air Soft sports club, have defended themselves from Rada's accusations, explaining that they are only airsoft players. Despite demands from the opposition, Minister Rada refused to retract his error. A video of Eduard R√≥zsa Flores, filmed in Hungary, was also presented, in which he claims he was contacted by a previously unknown organisation named the Consejo de Santa Cruz, asking that he return to Bolivia to organise the department's \\"defence\\". However, in that same video, R√≥zsa claims that he was not planning to overthrow Evo Morales, and that his intention was to organise \\"self-defence\\" to face up to \\"violent groups\\" of government supporters. A friend of R√≥zsa, the infamous Carlos \\"el Chacal\\", denied that he was \\"a hitman for the extreme left\\". On the other hand, a Spanish journalist, Julio C√©sar Alonso, claimed that R√≥zsa was in fact a mercenary, and that he had been investigating him since a friend and colleague had allegedly been assassinated by R√≥zsa's group during the Croatian War of Independence, in which R√≥zsa fought as a volunteer in the Independence Army. Alonso claimed that videos existed in which R√≥zsa declared that he had been contracted to organise a civil war in Bolivia. Although he said that the evidence would be made public in September or October 2009, these had still not been released at the end of 2010. According to WikiLeaks, in a cable from the US embassy in Bolivia, sent in May 2009, an unnamed whistle-blower assured North American authorities that the government of Evo Morales, under then Chief of Intelligence Jorge Santiesteban, had contacted R√≥zsa, with the aim of framing separatist groups and the principal regional leaders. Although, according to the cable, the US embassy in Bolivia had no means of verifying the claim, it was given credibility by the track record and political position of the informant, who had supposedly supplied photographs of the two surviving suspects, who presented with clear signs of having been tortured. In the cable, it is claimed that the guns had been planted by the police, who had even forgotten to deactivate the safety. The report concluded that Morales' government had intended to blame the United States for the incident, and underlined that the Bolivian attorney general had declared the existence of emails which linked R√≥sza with the CIA. The alleged US diplomatic cable ended as follows: The Bolivian Interior Minister, Sacha Llorenti, qualified this information as \\"gossip\\", underlining the fact that in the cable itself it was recognised that the \\"rumour\\" could not be verified, and announced that he would summon the US Charg√© d'Affaires to La Paz to demand explanation. == Investigations by the families == The respective families of Hungarian √Årp√°d Magyarosi and Irish Michael Dwyer sought the repatriation of their bodies, and once under their control, requested that new autopsies were carried out. In the case of Dwyer, an autopsy was performed by State Pathologist Professor Marie Cassidy and compared it with that which was carried out in Bolivia. Cassidy's report contradicted the Bolivian report, which claimed that Dwyer had died after being shot six times. According to Cassidy, Dwyer was shot only once, by a bullet which pierced his heart with a descending trajectory, which may indicate that he had been sitting on the bed at the time of his death. Furthermore, no evidence was found to suggest that Dwyer fired any gun. In the case of Magyarosi, in addition to forensic analysis, the family requested that a Hungarian special forces police official carry out a ballistic examination. According to the results revealed by the family, Magyarosi was shot seven times, none of which were fatal, but died choking on his own blood half an hour after having been shot, contradicting the official version which indicated that he had bled to death. The report claimed that Magyarosi had been protecting his face, with his arms crossed, the first three times he was shot. The last four shots were fired as he lay on his back on the floor. As with Dwyer, no chemical residue was found to indicate that he had fired a gun. In October 2009, the British ambassador to Bolivia, Nigel Baker, requested that the reports carried out in Europe be taken into account in the Bolivian investigation, claiming that the latter had \\"too many questionable points\\" and that at that moment \\"nothing\\" had been cleared up.Marco Chuquimia (October 21, 2009). \\"Europa pide incluir sus informes en caso R√≥zsa\\". El Deber. Retrieved December 23, 2010. However, it was soon clarified that Baker had not made these declarations on behalf of the United Kingdom or the European Union. However, President Evo Morales reacted in declaring that although the European nations had the right to defend their citizens, they also had responsibilities in Bolivia:Bolivian Vice President, √Ålvaro Garc√≠a Linera, also reacted, asserting that the Hungarian and Irish governments should apologise to Bolivia for their citizens' alleged crimes, and also dismissed the Hungarian report, explaining that these results did not line up with those obtained in the Bolivian autopsy. The attorney in charge of the case agreed with the Vice President, and declared that he would continue using the Bolivian results throughout the trial. == Consequences == Days after the raid, the central government sent hundreds of soldiers to Santa Cruz, arguing that they were going to be carrying out preventative control duties. Furthermore, Morales issued a decree which allowed the seizure of suspected terrorists' personal property. According to his own government, the principal targets of this decree were Rub√©n Costas and Branko Marinkovic, opponents of Morales, who had been accused by the President of having supported R√≥sza financially. Costas and Marinkovic have denied these accusations, alleging that the objective of these claims is to neutralise them as political leaders. Costas, the Santa Cruz governor, has claimed that the aim of these accusations is: After these events, the government agreed to a special parliamentary commission to investigate the alleged crimes of terrorism. Several witnesses have been summoned to give evidence; one of the main witnesses is Ignacio Villa Vargas, the alleged mercenaries' driver, better known as \\"El Viejo\\" [The Old One]. According to Vargos, there existed a core group of financial backers supporting the alleged terrorist cell, which was formed of business owners and political activists in the Santa Cruz department. On June 13, the Bolivian public prosecutor ordered the capture of seven people who had not attended to give evidence in the case. Two of those named worked in the principal telecommunications company of the Santa Cruz region, which was at risk of being nationalised at the time.EFE (June 21, 2009). \\"La Fiscal√≠a boliviana ordena la captura de siete acusados de financiar el terrorismo.\\". Yahoo!. Retrieved June 13, 2009. The main evidence against these people were \\"chat\\" conversations obtained from the computer taken during the raid on the Hotel Las Am√©ricas, and photographs of the alleged mercenaries counting money. Several of the suspects implicated subsequently fled Bolivia, but the President declared that he was prepared to bring them to military justice, accusing them of being separatists. On December 17, 2010, the Bolivian public prosecutor presented a formal complaint against 39 people for their alleged involvement in the case. Pablo Costas Aguilera, brother of the opposition governor Rub√©n Costas, is the principal suspect implicated by the prosecutor in charge. == References == Category:2009 in Bolivia Category:Politics of Bolivia ","title":"Raid on the Hotel Las Am√©ricas"},{"id":"60369029","text":"Inke N√§thke is a German cell biologist. She is Professor of Epithelial Biology at the Department of Cell & Developmental Biology, Interim Dean and Associate Dean for Professional Culture at the School of Life Sciences at the University of Dundee in Scotland. She is known for her work on the role of the adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) protein in colorectal cancer. == Early life and education == N√§thke grew up in the northern German town of Itzehoe. She first came to the US as an au pair. After spending a year in San Jose, California, she realized that the educational system in the US would allow her to learn about multiple topics, instead of focusing on a single discipline. Finding this attractive, she enrolled at San Jose State University, initially as a pre-med student but then switching to biochemistry. After a year at a small biotechnology company, she attended graduate school at the University of California, San Francisco, where she studied the structure of clathrin in the laboratory of Frances Brodsky. She then moved to Stanford for postdoctoral training in the laboratory of William J. Nelson. In her postdoctoral work she established a link between the adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) tumor suppressor and cell movement mediated by the cytoskeleton. She then performed a short second postdoc in the laboratory of Tim Mitchison. == Career == In 1998 N√§thke was recruited to the University of Dundee as a lecturer in the Cell and Evolutionary Biology Department. A core hypothesis in her work is that the APC protein is involved in cell motility and cell division through its effects on microtubules. She discovered that loss of APC leads directly to chromosome instability and polyploidy by affecting the spindle checkpoint. In work on mouse and human gut stem cells, she found that these cells normally divide with their mitotic spindle in a particular orientation. This orientation is lost in precancerous colon that is deficient in APC function. N√§thke has exploited this change in tissue organization to develop a new way to monitor very early changes that may lead to cancer, using microultrasound. She developed a system for using the slime mold Dictyostelium discoideum to study the effects of the APC on cell migration. She has commented that since APC is an adaptor protein with \\"its fingers in many pies in the cell\\", loss of APC has many effects that push cells closer to becoming cancerous. She is co- editor of a book on APC Proteins. ==Awards== * 2004: ASCB Women in Cell Biology Junior Award * 2004: Cancer Research UK Senior Cancer Research Fellowship. == References == == External links == * Nathke group website Category:1961 births Category:Living people Category:Cell biologists Category:University of California, San Francisco alumni Category:21st-century women scientists ","title":"Inke Nathke"},{"id":"60369043","text":"Thomas Charles Ravenscroft Walters is a South African politician who has been serving as a Member of the National Assembly of South Africa for the opposition Democratic Alliance since May 2014.

The participant begins sharing in the profits from the first ticket sale, not waiting until the film studio turns a profit. It is a film finance and distribution term used primarily in the United States film industry. In France, as of September 2003, one condition for filmmakers to get government support is that money must be reimbursed on the first-dollar gross basis. First-dollar gross has become a rare arrangement, and compensation has increasingly shifted away from first-dollar gross to back-end compensation. Some contracts define \\"first dollar\\" as a net figure after certain expense deductions rather than a true distributor's gross. ==Notable examples== For Inception, DiCaprio chose to forego his normal rate in favor of first-dollar gross. If a film does well, a first-dollar gross arrangement can be very lucrative for the participant. Natalie Wood took 10 percent of the first- dollar gross on Bob & Carol & Ted & Alice, which according to Freddie Fields earned her more money than she did on any other movie. Cameron Diaz negotiated first-dollar gross on Bad Teacher, and netted $42 million. Sandra Bullock made more from her 15 percent first-dollar gross deal on Gravity than from her upfront pay of $20 million. In his heyday, Arnold Schwarzenegger received 25 percent first-dollar gross. When Warner Bros. thought Inception was a risky investment, Leonardo DiCaprio agreed to cut his then normal $20 million salary to a minimal salary with a first-dollar gross to make the film, which eventually paid him $50 million. Tom Hanks and Steven Spielberg shared a 40 percent first-dollar gross on Saving Private Ryan. Some other filmmakers known to have made first-dollar gross deals are Tyler Perry, Eli Roth, Clint Eastwood, Quentin Tarantino, Christopher Nolan, actor Tom Cruise, and film producer Jason Blum. ==See also== * Film budgeting * Hollywood accounting ==References== Category:Hollywood history and culture Category:Filmmaking Category:Film production Category:Film distribution Category:Film and video terminology ","title":"First-dollar gross"},{"id":"60369509","text":"There have been eight chief executives of NHS England since the post was established in 1985, following the report and recommendation of Sir Roy Griffiths. # Victor Paige 1985‚Äì1986 (1.5 years, as chair) # Len Peach 1986‚Äì1989 (3 years) # Duncan Nichol 1989‚Äì1994 (5 years) # Alan Langlands 1994‚Äì2000 (6 years) # Nigel Crisp 1 November 2000 ‚Äì 6 March 2006.

It occupies a central site, and is used for public meetings. Its origin was in the colonial period, when the city was laid out on a grid plan.(see note) Some buildings in the vicinity, such as the Cathedral date from the colonial period. The square was renamed after Sim√≥n Bol√≠var in the 19th century. The centrepiece of the square is a monumental column celebrating Venezuela's independence. Inaugurated in 1889, the column commemorates Bol√≠var and specifically his victory at the battle of Carabobo in 1821. ==History== In the 1880s, when Valencia's monument to Bolivar was constructed, Venezuela was an agricultural country. Despite having large amounts of iron ore, the country lacked industrial iron-making capacity. Antonio Guzm√°n Blanco, three times president of Venezuela, implemented plans to modernize infrastructure. His projects, which have been described as megalomaniac, had a strong impact on Valencia, the second city of the Republic. He gave a concession to a British company to build a railway between Valencia and the coast at Puerto Cabello. The Valencia terminus was at Camoruco, 3 km from the city center, and plans were made for a tramway (initially horse-drawn) to the Plaza Bol√≠var. Guzman Blanco also approved a railway from Valencia to Caracas, the Great Venezuela Railway, built by a German company. The Valencia terminus was at San Blas, relatively near the city center. In 1887 the president decided to enhance the Plaza Bol√≠var of Valencia. The main feature is a marble column (called a monolito in Spanish) surmounted by a bronze statue of Bol√≠var. The monument was part of a national programme of promoting the memory of Bol√≠var begun in the 1870s,Nava, Julian. \\"The Illustrious American: The Development of Nationalism in Venezuela under Antonio Guzman Blanco.\\" The Hispanic American Historical Review 45, no. 4 (1965): 527-43. doi:10.2307/2511095. when, for example, Guzm√°n Blanco commissioned an equestrian statue for the Plaza Bolivar of Caracas and adopted the bol√≠var as the currency of Venezuela. Nelson's Column presents some similarities Work on the column was endorsed by General Herm√≥genes L√≥pez, governor of Carabobo State, who succeeded Guzm√°n Blanco as president of Venezuela during a transition period in 1887/1888. It was inaugurated under a third president, Juan Pablo Rojas Pa√∫l on Carabobo Day 1889. ==Design== The project was under the direction of the architect Antonio Malaussena (1853-1919). Malaussena later designed Valencia's municipal theatre (inaugurated in 1894) in Napoleon III style. The sculptor Rafael de la Cova, who studied in Europe in the 1870s, is credited with bas-reliefs depicting the battle of Carabobo at the base of the monument. ===Imagery=== The statue depicts Bolivar pointing south-west towards the battlefield of Carabobo, his famous victory of 1821 in the Venezuelan War of Independence. The pedestal of the monument is adorned with the shield of the State of Carabobo and three bas-reliefs depicting scenes from the battle: * Bol√≠var directing his troops * the British soldiers At the corners of the pedestal are Andean condors. ==Conservation== The monument is officially protected, but in 2018 El Carabobe√±o reported that ornamental metal-work had been removed from the structure. ==Notes== :1. In 1573, King Phillip II of Spain compiled the Laws of the Indies to guide the construction and administration of colonial communities. The Laws specified a square or rectangular central plaza with eight principal streets running from the plaza's corners. Hundreds of grid- plan communities throughout the Americas were established according to this pattern, echoing the practices of earlier Indian civilizations. ==References== ==External link== *Restoration project.

He was one of the five recorded children, and the eldest of the three sons, of the publisher-politician Heinrich Brockhaus (1804-1874) by his marriage to Pauline Campe (1808‚Äì86). He was sent for his education to the boarding school at Schnepfenthal (near Gotha) between 1837 and 1842. Thereafter, till 1847 he was sent to study at the prestigious St. Thomas School back in Leipzig.Richard Sachse, Karl Ramshorn, Reinhart Herz: Die Lehrer der Thomasschule zu Leipzig 1832‚Äì1912. Die Abiturienten der Thomasschule zu Leipzig 1845‚Äì1912. B. G. Teubner Verlag, Leipzig 1912, p. 19. After that he attended university in Leipzig, Heidelberg and Berlin. It was at Leipzig that in 1850 he received his doctorate. By this time he had decided to follow his father into the publishing business, and was apprenticed into the family business, which produced books and journals. After only two years he was entrusted with management responsibilities (\\"...Prokura\\") and became a full partner in the business when aged just twenty-five. For the next twenty years he worked alongside his father, which provided abundant learning opportunities and also enabled him to provide support in helping to build and develop the business further. Further family support was provided when his younger brother Rudolf joined the business in 1864. Rudolf's responsibilities focused especially on the firm's printing operation while Eduard concentrated on the management and commercial aspects of the operation. By 1894 the firm was operating 30 \\"fast presses\\" and one rotary press. After their father died in 1874 Eduard and Rudolf took over the business jointly. Later they were joined by Eduard's son, Albert Brockhaus in 1881 and by his nephew, another Rudolf Brockhaus, in 1889. Between 1857 and 1863 Eduard Brockhaus was also himself editing the Deutsche Allgemeine Zeitung (newspaper). Like his father before him, Eduard Brockhaus also participated in the business community more widely. In 1872 was elected to the presidency of the Leipzig-based German Book Printers' Association (\\"Deutscher Buchdruckerverein\\") in succession to Albin Ackermann, holding the position continually between 1873 and 1886. He also presided over the \\"Leipzig Association of Book Dealers\\" (der \\"Verein der Buchh√§ndler zu Leipzig\\") between 1880 and 1894. He was also a leading figure in the Association of German Book Dealers' Exchanges (\\"B√∂rsenverein der Deutschen Buchh√§ndler zu Leipzig\\"), serving as the association's secretary and then as chief executive (\\"Vorsteher\\") between 1892 and 1895. Subsequently he remained engaged with the association as an honorary member. His proposals triggered a major reconfiguration in the way the book exchanges - and therefore the book trade in Germany - operated, even though he was for several years sceptical over the various changes introduced during the 1880s. The reforms were led by Adolf Kr√∂ner: they involved an newly prescriptive set of rules for the books trade, including the so-called \\"Book trading and transfer regulations\\" (\\"Buchh√§ndlerische Verkehrsordnung\\") which involved fixed pricing, and meant fundamental changes to the ways in which publishers interacted with wholesalers, the ways in which wholesalers interacted with book retailers, and the way the books trade interacted with the public. Eduard Brockhaus saw the need for some sort of structure, and in the end he was won round to Adolf Kr√∂ner's reforms, becoming a stalwart backer. It was indeed Adolf von Kr√∂ner (ennobled in 1905) who succeeded Eduard Brockhaus as president of the Book Exchanges' Association. Brockhaus also engaged in national politics. Following unification, on 3 March 1871 he was elected to the Reichstag, in which he participated as an NLP member, representing the Zschopau-Marienberg-Lengefeld electoral district (\\"Wahlkreis 20\\"). He was re- elected in 1874 and again in 1877. (In 1878 the seat fell to the Socialist Workers' Party.) He was a member of several parliamentary committees and played an important role in the formulation of press and copyright legislation. Brockhaus was a backer and huge admirer of Chancellor Bismarck, at whose home he was a regular visitor after Bismarck's departure from office in 1890. He also numbered Helmuth von Moltke among his friends. ==Personal== Eduard Brockhaus married Emilia \\"Milly\\" Wei√ü on 4 September 1854 in Budapest. She came from a Roman Catholic banking family based in Hungary. The marriage resulted in the recorded births of six sons. These included the publisher- politician Albert Brockhaus (1855-1921) and the art-historian Heinrich Brockhaus (1858-1941). ==Notes== ==References== Category:Politicians from Leipzig Category:19th-century publishers (people) Category:20th-century publishers (people) Category:German publishers (people) Category:National Liberal Party (Germany) politicians Category:Members of the 1st Reichstag of the German Empire Category:Members of the 2nd Reichstag of the German Empire Category:Members of the 3rd Reichstag of the German Empire Category:Knights 1st class of the Albert Order Category:Knights First Class of the Order of the Z√§hringer Lion Category:Businesspeople from Leipzig ","title":"Eduard Brockhaus"},{"id":"60370025","text":"Georges Andr√© Martin was a French actor and variety performer.

Dan was a member of the Romanian Communist Party during the period of the Socialist Republic of Romania. In 1971, he became a leader in the Union of Communist Youth, a position that allowed him to serve as Minister in the union from 1971‚Äì1972. In 1974, he briefly distanced himself from the world of politics due to grievances with the Ceau»ôescu regime. Dan was a leader in the Romanian Revolution, and was a member of the Council of the National Salvation Front, in which he served as secretary of the executive office. He joined the National Salvation Front as a political party in 1990 under the leadership of Ion Iliescu. ==Early political career== In the 1950s, as Dan attended high school in Oradea, he joined the Union of Communist Youth, a youth organization of the Romanian Communist Party (PCR), which had held power in the country since the fall of fascist dictator, Ion Antonescu. From 1954-1955 he was a student of the Faculty of General Economics of the Academy of Economic Studies in Bucharest, and from 1955-1960 he relocated to the Soviet Union, to take courses at the Faculty of History of the Lomonosov State University of Moscow. In this phase, he succeeded in getting himself elected as a member of the Union of Communist Youth committee of the faculty and secretary of the organization's Romanian students in Moscow. After graduating in 1960, Dan began a teaching career at the University of Bucharest in the Department of History and Philosophy, where he taught until 1989. In the 1960s he continued political militancy within Bucharest, climbing the leadership of the youth organization of the party, which allowed him, in March 1971, to succeed Ion Iliescu as first secretary of the Central Committee of the Union of Communist Youth and, for that reason, as Minister for Youth Affairs in the Government of Ion Gheorghe Maurer. He left the position in October 1972. In addition to activism in the Union of Communist Youth, Dan also had connections within the Communist Party of Romania itself. In 1968, under the regime of Nicolae Ceau»ôescu, he was appointed as secretary and was responsible for propaganda within the City Committee of Bucharest, while on 12 August 1969 he succeeded in being appointed as an alternate member of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Romania. In November 1974 he withdrew from political life, apparently because of a difference of views with the then-president of the socialist republic, Nicolae Ceau»ôescu, concerning management of the country. He concentrated, therefore, almost exclusively on his teaching career. ==During the Romanian Revolution== With outbreak of the Romanian Revolution of 1989, during the power vacuum and the subsequent violence, Mar»õian Dan, alongside other communist dissidents such as Ion Iliescu, Petre Roman, Dumitru Mazilu, Silviu Brucan, Corneliu MƒÉnescu, Victor StƒÉnculescu and Alexandru B√¢rlƒÉdeanu, promoted the creation of a provisional legislative body, and formed the Council of the National Salvation Front (CFSN) which took power in late December 1989 and oversaw the execution of Nicolae Ceau»ôescu and his wife. After the execution, on 27 December Dan was designated by the group led by Iliescu as Secretary of the CFSN Executive Office. The executive group of the council was composed of former major PCR members, that had never denied their adherence to communist ideals, but that had lost faith in Ceau»ôescu as a leader. In February 1990 Iliescu founded the party of National Salvation Front (FSN), which was formed by an overwhelming majority of CFSN members. At the same time, this was renamed the Interim Council of the National Union (CPUN) and it also allowed the participation of other party representatives that had been created after the Revolution's conclusion. The platform, however, followed the organisation of the CFSN, the majority were members of the FSN and its management was confirmed with very few variations. Mar»õian was secretary of the executive office also in the new entity, which was in charge of holding free elections and enacting the first laws in any democratic sense. Infighting, especially between Mazilu and Iliescu, plagued the Nation Salvation Front, and made many of its members wary of the new provisional government's ability to arrive at decisions. Mazilu wanted capitalism, Roman wanted socialism, and Iliescu wanted to keep communism in place, but merely remove Ceau»ôescu. As a member of the Communist Party, who greatly revered figures such as »òtefan Fori»ô, whose death had been ordered by Ceau»ôescu's predecessor, Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej, Dan tended toward sympathy for Iliescu, making his loyalties known for when Mazilu was pushed out of the party by Iliescu and other senior party members. ==Member of Parliament== In the first democratic elections in May 1990, the FSN held a plebiscite that allowed it to control 2/3 of the parliament. Mar»õian Dan observed the election as deputy in the Vaslui district and, in June 1990, was appointed president of the Chamber of Deputies, holding office for the entire constituent legislature until October 1992. He was also a member of the committee drafting the draft Rules of the Chamber and co-chairman of the Constituent Assembly (July 1990-November 1991). By this time, the FSN had left behind any notion that Communism should be kept in place. Instead, Dan and Iliescu tended toward social democracy, whereas Petre Roman remained loyal to socialism as an ideology. In the spring of 1992 the FSN experienced a split as a result of the clash between the two conflicting tendencies within the party. The FSN itself, led by the president of the republic Ion Iliescu, was a promoter of a line of slow transition to the market economy through social democracy, and former Prime Minister Petre Roman desired to keep the democratic socialism that had remained a strong ideological attraction throughout the revolution. In response to this conflict, Iliescu founded the Democratic National Salvation Front (FDSN), while the counterpart party led by Roman maintained the original initials. Iliescu, with Dan in his cabinet, attended the parliamentary and presidential elections of 1992 under the new party name. Dan remained loyal to Iliescu's new party, which successfully established itself as the largest political party in the national elections of 1992. The following year, the party changed its name to the Social Democratic Party of Romania (PDSR). Dan, considered one of the leaders of the revolution by much of the Romanian population, became party leader in the House, as well as national vice president of the PDSR serving under Adrian NƒÉstase, a colleague from Dan's party. Following a 1996 defeat to the centre-right Romanian Democratic Convention (CDR), the PDSR moved to the opposition. Dan was reelected for another 4-year term in office, holding varying positions during this time. ==Final years== At the end of his parliamentary term in June 2001, Dan became the Romanian ambassador to Portugal, a position he retained until his death on 8 March 2002. On 12 March 2002, Dan was adorned with the Order of the Star of Romania by President Ion Iliescu due to his status as one of the leaders who brought democracy to Romania. ==Personal life== Dan was married, and he had two children ==Awards and honours== : Order of the Star of Romania (Romania) ==References== Category:People of the Romanian Revolution Category:Romanian communists Category:Members of the Chamber of Deputies (Romania) Category:Presidents of the Chamber of Deputies (Romania) Category:1935 births Category:2002 deaths Category:People from Bihor County Category:University of Bucharest alumni Category:University of Bucharest faculty Category:Moscow State University alumni Category:Ambassadors to Portugal Category:Knights of the Order of the Star of Romania Category:Ambassadors of Romania to Portugal ","title":"Mar»õian Dan"},{"id":"60370430","text":"Carma Leigh (November 15, 1904‚ÄîSeptember 25, 2009), born Carma Russell, was an American librarian.

She was president of the California Library Association and the Pacific Northwest Library Association, and a member of the executive board of the American Library Association. Beyond the state level, Leigh lobbied and testified for the federal Library Services Act, passed by Congress in 1956, and its successor the Library Services and Construction Act, passed in 1964. In the early 1950s, she went to West Germany as part of the American Library Association's efforts to assist post-war rebuilding, and she was a member of the Defense Advisory Committee on Women in the Services. Leigh was editor of the Washington State Library News Bulletin from 1945 to 1951, and had her own newsletter, From the California State Librarian, from 1951 to 1972. In 1966 she presented a paper, \\"The Role of the American Library Association in Federal Legislation for Libraries\\", at the Allerton Park Institute, conducted by the University of Illinois Graduate School of Library Science. == Honors and awards == On the occasion of her retirement, a resolution commending her work was read in the state senate. In 1973, she was named to the University of Science and Arts of Oklahoma Alumni Hall of Fame. In 1995, the California Library Association honored her as its longest-active member. She was honored in 1996 by the American Library Association as a \\"Legislative and Grass Roots Champion\\". She also held an honorary doctorate from the University of the Pacific. == Personal life and legacy == Carma Russell was married twice. She divorced her first husband, Ernest Zimmerman, in 1938. Her second husband was political scientist and Bennington College president Robert Devore Leigh. They married in 1960; he died in 1961. She had a daughter, Rita Zimmerman Collier. Carma Leigh died in 2009, aged 104 years, in LaMesa, California.

Following his participation in the German diplomatic team at the Brest-Litovsk conference, which negotiated the Treaty of Brest- Litovsk, Baehr was posted to Moscow as part of the diplomatic mission there, with a brief to develop contacts with the intelligentsia. Here he made friends with Vassily Kandinsky. He put Kandinsky in touch with Bruno Taut, Walter Gropius and Max Pechstein, who were linked with the Novembergruppe and the Arbeitsrat f√ºr Kunst (Workers' Council for Art ‚Äì WCA). Baehr was able to act as channel of communication between the avant-garde artists of Berlin and Russia for most of 1919. However Baehr was also the middle-man in a deal to buy 25-50 million rubles worth of printing presses and Russian language school books in Germany using Russian credits in Denmark. However in July 1919 he was informed by the German Foreign Office that they would not permit this transaction to go ahead. He was arrested in late 1919 in Lithuania and the 13 crates of material he had with him were confiscated. ==References== Category:German artists Category:German diplomats Category:German military officers Category:Year of birth missing Category:Year of death missing ","title":"Ludwig Baehr"},{"id":"60370833","text":"Kosoff is a surname.

He was a very active man of wide interests, a pioneer of driving and a pilot. During World War II, he was hiding people in danger of their life in the crypt of the Dominican Church in Ko≈°ice, and is thus registered among those who rescued Jews at the Holocaust Memorial Center in Budapest. At the beginning of the 1950s, he was interned by the communist government in several monasteries, where harsh living conditions deteriorated his health and hastened his death. He belongs to the martyrs of the Dominican Order of the 20th century. In 2013, the Slovak province of the Order approved to initiate a process of his beatification. ==Early life== Jozef Lexmann was born as the first of eight children to a family in which the father was a craftsman and the mother had a drapery business. His mother was very pious, and a lay Dominican. Four of her children eventually chose religious life: besides Joseph, his brother Gregor and sister Mary joined the Dominicans, and sister Brigita became a member of the Congregation of Teaching Sisters of Notre Dame. Jozef went to the elementary school in Bobot, then he continued at the school in B√°novce nad Bebravou. He then joined the Dominican juvenate. From 1912 to 1916, he studied at a grammar school in Budapest. As a seventeen-year-old, he entered the Dominican Order in Graz and adopted the religious name Mikul√°≈° (Nicholas). He finished his novitiate and graduated in philosophy and theology in Graz and Vienna. He received priestly ordination on July 29, 1923. The following year he began to work in the Dominican priory in Ko≈°ice. On July 4, 1933, he became its superior. ==The first ‚Äúflying monk‚Äù== In addition to all his duties, Mikul√°≈° Lexmann was very much interested in technical innovations. In Ko≈°ice he became the first priest to hold a driving license and already in the 1920s he used to drive there. Using a rental car, he ran a driving course for the unemployed and the poor. He was an executive director of the Autoclub for Eastern Slovakia. He also completed a pilot course in 1935, becoming the first priest-pilot in Czechoslovakia. He dropped a wreath of flowers from his plane in front of the Dominican church in Kosice for his brother Rafael's first Holy Mass. He was also Mayor of the Orol (a Christian Sports Association) and he founded the Veritas Cultural Center in the city. Photography and filming were among his hobbies. In 1936 he was assigned by his superiors to Znojmo. He enrolled at Masaryk University in Brno. From 1937 he continued his studies at Charles University in Prague. However, he did not finish his studies due to the threat of being arrested by the Gestapo. Therefore, he fled to a monastery in Sopron, then he was assigned to Vasvar. ==Saving lives== In 1944 he returned to Ko≈°ice. At the turn of 1944-45, in the crypt of the Dominican Church, he hid about twenty people from the terror of the Arrow Cross Party, and probably saved their lives. He is thus registered at the Holocaust Memorial Center in Budapest as one of those who rescued the Jews during the War. In 1946 he founded the Holy Rosary magazine in Ko≈°ice. He also learned Esperanto and organized its courses. In 1948 he participated in organizing a congress of Slovak Esperanto students in Ko≈°ice. In addition, he worked there as a monastery librarian, catechist or preacher of retreats. ==Interrogations and internment== Mikul√°≈° Lexmann experienced his first interrogation at the Ko≈°ice headquarters of the StB (Secret Service) in December 1947. On February 20, 1948, he was arrested for a month due to his contacts with Julius Pat√∫c, accused of establishing an illegal organization Slovak National League, directed against communism. M. Lexmann was also mentioned in the investigation of the activities of Rodina (the Family, a spiritual movement), founded by Croatian priest Tomislav Kolakoviƒá. Despite StB's pressure, on June 17, 1949, he read during a Holy Mass a pastoral letter written by the secret bishops' conference in Prague. In April 1950 he was arrested and transported from Ko≈°ice during the Akcia K (Action K, an apprehension of all religious in Czechoslovakia) and then transferred to internment monasteries in Pezinok, B√°ƒç and Podol√≠nec. On November 29, 1950, he was considered officially as a \\"reactionary and incorrigible\\" religious and transferred to the monastery in Kr√°l√≠ky. In the internment monasteries, living conditions were generally very harsh. In Kr√°l√≠ky M. Lexmann had already serious heart problems, high blood pressure and walked with a cane. Lack of drugs and hard work worsened his health. On one hot July day he was sent to graze a cow. The sun and walking up a steep hill exhausted him completely. He died on July 17, 1952, at the age of 52, probably due to a stroke. He was buried in his native village of Bobot. Mikul√°≈° Jozef Lexmann was included on the international list of Dominican martyrs of the 20th century. In 2013, the Slovak province of Dominicans approved the initiation of the process of his beatification. ==References== ==Further reading== * Lagov√°, Veronika, a kol. Smr≈• za mre≈æami.

Her art is held in the collections of San Francisco Museum of Modern Art, and the Fine Arts Museums of San Francisco. ==Early life and education== Armer was born on May 26, 1896, in San Francisco, California. She attended the California School of Fine Arts and the School of Fine and Applied Art in New York. While in New York, she studied at the Art Students League with influential American artists such as George Bellows, Robert Henri, Kenneth Hayes Miller, and John Sloan. ==Career== Armer was regarded as \\"one of San Francisco's more profound abstractionists.\\" She had solo exhibitions at the Cleveland Museum of Art, and at the San Francisco Museum of Art in 1936 and 1939, and in the Quay Gallery in San Francisco in 1972 and 1975. She painted landscapes, portraits, and abstract works, and was also a lithographer. Her art was influenced by her experience living in California, and her subject matter included the California desert and the cityscapes of San Francisco. Armer studied under George Bellows, Robert Henri, Kenneth Miller and John Sloan at the School of Fine and Applied Art in New York. She taught drawing, painting and other subjects at the California School of Fine Arts, today known as the San Francisco Art Institute, from 1933 to 1940. During her career, she also worked at the Oakland Museum, and later served on the Board of Directors. After retiring from teaching, she devoted her time to painting in her studio on Russian Hill, in San Francisco. ===Artistic vision=== Armer began her career painting landscapes, with an emphasis on portraying connections between objects rather than a literal likeness. Her later work was influenced by her exposure to classical music during a convalescence. She sought to re-create the emotion and form of music using the medium of line and color. In an interview, she explained, \\"What I paint is really an emotion, and I am most interested in the emotional response...What I want to create is a milieu wherein one can flow with bits and pieces of a luminous universe.\\" ==Personal life== She was married to Joseph M. Bransten, a wealthy businessman and art collector from San Francisco. Bransten outlived his wife, and died in 1980, at the age of 79. ==Death and legacy== Ruth Armer died in San Francisco in 1977.

It publishes a scholarly journal, Costume, as well as one-off publications; and organises events and study days. ==History== The Costume Society was formed in 1965, arising from a developing interest in the history of fashion and a desire on the part of its founders to foster serious research in an area which previously had been the domain of the amateur collector. The immediate genesis of the organisation was a meeting held at the Victoria and Albert Museum on 13 October 1964. Its first chairman was Charles Harvard Gibbs-Smith, Keeper of the Department of Public Relations at the Victoria and Albert Museum (V&A;), followed by Donald Beeson King, art historian and keeper of textiles at the V&A; Roy Strong, V&A; director, Anne Buck, curator of the Gallery of Costume at Platt Hall in Manchester, and June Swann, Keeper of the Boot and Shoe Collection at the Northampton Museum and Art Gallery. The most recent chairman (2014-2018) was Deirdre Murphy, senior curator at Kensington Palace. ==Aims and activities== Since 1967, the society, through Edinburgh University Press publishes its journal, Costume twice per year. Costume is listed in the Arts and Humanities Citation Index of the Institute for Scientific Information. It organises regular conferences, study days and museum visits, and administers a number of conservation awards and bursaries. Student awards and conservation grants are aimed at students of the history and theory of dress, costume design and production as well as other related fields. They also make awards to museums and other institutions to cover the costs of conservation of objects. ==References== Category:Organisations based in the United Kingdom Category:Organizations established in 1965 Category:Clothing-related organizations ","title":"The Costume Society"},{"id":"60372090","text":"Gularte is a surname.

Mells Manor Horner was baptized on 3 July 1688, the second, but eldest surviving son of George Horner, MP of Mells, Somerset and his wife Elizabeth Fortescue, daughter of Robert Fortescue of Filleigh, Devon. He matriculated at Trinity College, Oxford on 14 May 1705, aged 17. In 1708 he succeeded his father to Mells Manor. He married Susanna Strangeways, daughter of Thomas Strangways of Melbury House, Dorset in 1713. Horner was High Sheriff of Somerset for the year 1711 to 1712. In 1713 he became a freeman of Bath. At the 1713 British general election, he was returned unopposed as a Tory Member of Parliament for Somerset. He did not make any impression in Parliament. At the 1715 British general election Horner was returned in a contest as Tory MP for Wells. Shortly after, he was nearly arrested on the discovery of Wyndham's plans for a western rising. He kept his seat in time to vote against the septennial bill, before he was unseated on petition on 30 May 1716. There was a re-election at which he was returned again in a contest on 27 June 1716, but was unseated on petition again on 12 April 1717. Horner did not stand for Wells again. Melbury House Horner moved out of the Mells Manor house in the village in 1724 and commissioned Nathaniel Ireson to build Park House within Mells Park. In 1726, Horner's wife succeeded to the Strangways Dorset estate of Melbury and he assumed the additional name of Strangways. In 1729 she succeeded to the rest of the Strangways estates on the death of her sister Elizabeth, Duchess of Hamilton. At the 1727 British general election Horner was returned again unopposed as MP for Somerset. He consistently voted against the Government. He was returned unopposed again at the 1734 British general election and did not stand in 1741. In 1736 Horner's wife arranged a clandestine marriage between their only daughter Elizabeth, then 13 years old, and Stephen Fox, who was the brother of her paramour Henry Fox. Horner objected strongly to the match, not only because of the bride's age, but also because of the bridegroom's politics. His two sons predeceased him and when he died on 19 November 1742, his Somerset estates passed to his younger brother and his daughter received only the ¬£7,500 to which she was entitled under her parents‚Äô marriage settlement. However, when her mother died in 1758, she inherited the Dorset properties of the Strangways family. ==References== Category:1688 births Category:1741 deaths Category:Alumni of Trinity College, Oxford Category:Members of the Parliament of Great Britain for English constituencies Category:British MPs 1713‚Äì1715 Category:British MPs 1715‚Äì1722 Category:British MPs 1727‚Äì1734 Category:British MPs 1734‚Äì1741 Category:British MPs 1741‚Äì1747 ","title":"Thomas Strangways Horner"},{"id":"60372107","text":"Wucherer's worm lizard (Leposternon wuchereri) is a worm lizard species in the family Amphisbaenidae.

From 1920 to 1923 she studied at the Academy of Fine Arts, Berlin before acting as guest auditor at the Weimar State Bauhaus, Sorbonne and √âcole de Beaux-Arts, Paris. In 1923, whilst attending the first large exhibition presented by the Bauhaus, she met Herbert Bayer and, through this connection, was able to attend the Bauhaus‚Äôs Vorkurs (foundation course, informally) without officially being enrolled as a student. At the same time, Hecht attended the Academy of Graphic Arts and Book Publishing in Leipzig, Germany. Hecht married Herbert Bayer in 1925 and in 1926 they moved to the Bauhaus in Dessau. The two separated in 1928 and, although they did not divorce until 1944, had a daughter (Julia Alexandra) together in 1929. Following her move to Berlin in 1928, Hecht's work was shown in the 'Film und Foto' Werkbund exhibition in Stuttgart. In 1938 Bayer-Hecht returned to the United States due to the political implications of her Jewish origins in Germany at this time. Hecht ceased her photography and began working as a translator for the American military authorities in Munich. She returned to Europe from 1945-1947 to work as the chief of the American Photo Section in Munich before returning to California in 1947. ==Photography== Hecht both took her own photographs and used her technical skill in photography to support Bayer in his work. Hecht's work primarily focused on people, taking the form of both portraits and formal studies. Her photographs were included in the Bauhaus exhibition Film und Foto, in 1929 and her work featured in the Thomas Walter Collection (1909-1949) that was exhibited at the Museum of Modern Art in New York City in 2014-2015.

He graduated from the secondary school in Kyustendil and then moved to Sofia. Since he had the talent of an artist, he moves among artists and associates with famous artists. After all, Sokolov decided to join the Macedonian-Adrianopolitan revolutionary movement. From June to October 1899 Sokolov took part in a cheta, led by Gotse Delchev. The Cheta managed to kidnap a rich Greek and later released him for a ransom. In 1899, together with Slavi Merdjanov, Pavel Shatev and Petar Mandjukov, they dug a tunnel under the central office of the Ottoman Bank in Istanbul, where they planned to set a dynamite. The Chairman of the Supreme Macedonian-Adrianople Committee, Boris Sarafov, provided the money for that operation. In September 1900, the tunnel was almost completed, but due to difficulties with the supply of dynamite, the plan was temporarily abandoned. Soon, however, an Armenian revolutionary was trying to supply to the Bulgarians in the Ottoman capital explosives, but the Turkish authorities managed to arrest him. The investigation led them to the four revolutionaries who are arrested. Still, the Ottoman authorities fail to locate the tunnels and ultimately released the detainees. Merdjanov and Sokolov were deported to Bulgaria. Merdzjanov and Sokolov went to Sofia and began to think up new ideas, one of which was to hold up the Orient Express on Turkish territory near Adrianople, and to gain possession of the mail in order to finance future actions. In pursuit of this plan, they went to the Adrianople area in July 1901, with a cheta consisting of ten men, equipped with the help of Pavel Genadiev, the Supreme Macedonian Committee's representative in Plovdiv. The cheta managed to place a large quantity of dynamite on the railway line, but something went wrong, and the train passed undamaged. After this failure, they kidnapped the son of a rich Turkish landowner, but they were soon discovered and surrounded by Turkish forces. In a battle near the village of Matochina, most of the terrorists were killed or seriously wounded. Sokolov was among the dead, and Merdzjanov was captured alive, together with a Bulgarian and two Armenians. The captives were taken to Adrianople, where, in November 1901, all four were publicly hanged. ==References== Category:People from Kyustendil Category:Bulgarian revolutionaries Category:Members of the Internal Macedonian Revolutionary Organization Category:Bulgarian anarchists Category:Bulgarian people imprisoned abroad Category:Prisoners and detainees of the Ottoman Empire Category:1870 births Category:1901 deaths ","title":"Petar Sokolov"},{"id":"60372493","text":"Desmo Race is a dueling roller coaster at Mirabilandia in Ravenna, Italy. The pair of coasters opened as a part of the park's new ‚Ç¨25,000,000 Ducati World in July 2019. ==Announcement and construction== In November 2017, Parques Reunidos, Mirabilandia's owners, announced plans to build a 115,000 spare foot Ducati Motorcycle themed land in 2019, in league with Ducati themselves. This themed land would be located on the north side of the park, near the Eurowheel. Early concept artwork lead to speculation that a dueling Spike Coaster system would be a part of this, among some children's rides and simulator attractions. This was later confirmed in various articles. Construction began on July 5, 2018, with a ceremony held for the official laying of the first stone of Ducati World. The first piece of track was later erected on October 11, 2018. More details about the coaster, then known by the temporary codename Superbike Race, were revealed at IAAPA in 2018, as well as a model. The official name was also revealed to be Desmo Race. The ride opened alongside Ducati World in July 2019. ==Characteristics== ===Ride model=== Desmo Race is the first dueling Spike Dragster, a concept that Maurer AG spent years working on. A single tracked prototype was installed at Skyline Park in 2017, but this version is not a prototype and has two much longer, parallel throttle embedded in each car, thus classifying them as powered coasters. ===Statistics=== Both of Desmo Race's tracks are 1,722.4 ft (525.0 m) long and have a peak height of 72.2 ft (22.0 m). Strangely enough, the coaster's speed is unknown. Each track can accommodate up to 500 riders an hour, but given the fact that both tracks will run at the same time, a capacity of 1,000 riders per hour is estimated. ===Trains=== Desmo Race utilizes 12 cars between both tracks, each of which can hold up to two riders. The cars are outfitted with a throttle, an LED dashboard, lights, and even an onboard audio system to create a unique and immersive coaster experience. The cars resemble Ducati's futuristic Panigale V4 motorcycle series. Riders will be able to use the throttle and control their speed and acceleration. ===Layout=== Both tracks will feature a meandering layout that includes plenty of twists, S-turns, helixes, dips, valleys, and hills. The loading area/station is located in the centre of the there-and-back layout, much like the prototype installed at Skyline Park, except much larger, spread out, and complex. Both tracks constantly interact with and weave in and out of one another. ==Similar rides== The coaster operates much like an alpine coaster/mountain coaster, where the 1-2 person cars are lifted to the starting elevation by at least one lift hill at the start or end of the experience, and much like the Spike Dragster, riders are able to control their speed by pushing physical levers that directly control the speed of the descent. Spike Dragsters, however, operate with a different throttle system that indirectly controls the speed of the coaster. The first Spike Dragster was Sky Dragster, a prototype built at Skyline Park in Bad W√∂rishofen, Germany. The coaster only has a single track with a length of 889.1 ft (271 meters) and a peak height of 38.7 ft (11.8 meters). The coaster operates 4 cars, enabling a theoretical hourly capacity of 200 riders. The ride system is identical to that of Desmo Race. Carnival Cruise Lines also announced that their new Mardi Gras ship setting sail in 2020 is including Bolt; Ultimate Sea Coaster, the first Spike Dragster coaster in the North American market and the first roller coaster out at sea. Before the concept existed, coasters were unreliable at sea due to maintenance needs and the high risk of hitting a bottom due to the shifting motion of the boat at sea. That second factor does not affect the Spike Dragster model as they are powered coasters and don't rely on a downhill slope to keep its momentum. Like Sky Dragster, Bolt will have a single track. ==References== ","title":"Desmo Race"},{"id":"60372495","text":"Vega flight VV07 () is the Vega space launch, of the Per√∫SAT-1 and 4 SkySat satellites. == Payload == The flight was a multi-payload mission that deployed 5 Earth observation satellites into orbit, with a total payload mass of about including the satellites, their adapters and dispensers. === Per√∫SAT-1 === Per√∫SAT-1, with a mass of approximately , was in the lower position and was the last satellite to be separated, approximately 1 hour, 42 minutes and 59 seconds after lift-off.

Following her marriage in 1945 to Beresford Cecil Bingham, 8th Earl Annesley she became Josephine, Countess of Annesley. ==Early life== According to the 1900 U.S. Federal Census and the 1905 New York State Census, Josephine Brandell was actually born as Janetta Kleinberg in Austria in 1887 into a Jewish family, the daughter of Fishel 'Phillip' Kleinberg (born 1848) and Yetta n√©e Goldstein (1857-1953). Her siblings included Samuel Lasker Kleinberg, Sadie Zehring Kleinberg and William Kleinberg. Later in applications for passports and American citizenship she claimed that she was a British citizen born on 26 November 1891 or 1892 in Bucharest in Romania, the daughter of Phillip Brandell. Her father, a tailor by profession, immigrated to the United States of America, settling in New York City in 1895, with the rest of the family following him in 1897 and 1898. Josephine Brandell had ambitions of becoming an actress and attempted to break into show business on the New York stage while in her early teens but this was temporarily put on hold when in 1907 at the age of 19 she married dentist and naturalised American citizen Dr Bernard Black Brandeis (1879‚Äì1944), also from Romania. The marriage made Brandell an American citizenJosephine Brandell - 'People's Stories: Everyone on the Lusitania's last voyage, including passengers and crew' - Merseyside Maritime Museum website but it was short-lived with the couple divorcing in September 1910 following which she assumed the name 'Brandell', possibly to avoid anti-Semitic persecution. After the divorce Brandell resumed her ambition of following a career on the stage.Miss Josephine Mary Brandell - The Lusitania ResourceThe Lusitania: Passengers of Distinction - Gare Maritime website ==Career== Cast of The Beauty Spot (1909); Brandell seated at the front A soprano, 'Jenny' Brandell's first small role was in the comic-opera Nightbirds by Johann Strauss in which she toured Europe and America with Fritzi Scheff and gaining favourable press coverage for her performance.

In 1913 Brandell played her first leading role in the revue Come Over Here, performed at the London Opera House.J. P. Wearing, The London Stage 1910-1919: A Calendar of Productions, Performers, and Personnel, Rowman & Littlefield (2014) - Google Books After that her career took off with engagements in England and Broadway. On her numerous trans-Atlantic crossings one of her favourite ships was the RMS Lusitania, one of the most exclusive and fastest luxury liners of the time. ==Lusitania== Painting of the sinking of RMS Lusitania in 1915 After Brandell had played on Broadway in the spring of 1915 on May 1 she boarded the RMS Lusitania to return to London. She was accompanied by Mrs Mabel Crichton, the wife of a friend. The actress knew of the danger of being hit by a submarine in British territorial waters and she was not confident that the ship could outrace a submarine and, as she put it, was \\"in a state\\" for much of the voyage. She and Mabel Crichton (who did not survive the sinking) became friendly with their tablemates: Max Schwarcz and Francis Bertram Jenkins. However, despite the convivial company on board Brandell never got over her feeling of dread. Jenkins did not help matters by pointing out the shortage of lifebelts on board. Brandell begged Mabel Crichton to allow her to stay the night in Crichton's cabin because she was so frightened. Crichton welcomed Brandell into her cabin and spent most of the night trying to reassure her that nothing would happen to them. However, Brandell's fears were proved right and the next day on May 7, 1915 the Lusitania was torpedoed by a German submarine and sank. In her written deposition to the authorities Brandell wrote: Josephine Mary Brandell photographed for The Graphic (1915) > \\"Dear Sir, I am replying to your request in giving my statement to the best > of my recollection about the sinking of the Lusitania.

J.B.\\" Brandell never fully recovered from this tragedy, having been pulled nearly dead from the water and becoming hysterical when revived - consequently suffering for the rest of her life with nightmares. ==Later years== On returning to the United States Brandell filed a claim for compensation with the U.S. State Department. This could not be considered until the War had ended but following her marriage to British stock broker John Ormiston Lawson- Johnson (1877‚Äì1955) on 19 May 1920 she gave up her American citizenship. On 19 March 1925 the Mixed Claims Commission refused her compensation claim as she was no longer an American citizen despite the fact that she had been at the time of the sinking. After the Lusitania drama Brandell failed to continue her promising career which had begun so successfully. She had difficulty concentrating and could not put herself in other characters, therefore she appeared only sporadically in small roles and gradually faded from the acting scene. Her marriage to John Ormiston Lawson-Johnson was not happy and ended in divorce in 1928. She quickly entered into a third marriage in London on 1 June 1929 with George John Seymour Repton (1898‚Äì1943), who served as a Captain in the Irish Guards during World War II; the marriage was harmonious and happy. During World War II Brandell founded the organization 'The American Friends of Britain' designed to foster understanding between the two nations. On May 10, 1943 George Repton died unexpectedly in London, leaving Brandell comfortably off with nearly ¬£50,000 in his will.George John Seymour Repton in the England & Wales, National Probate Calendar (Index of Wills and Administrations), 1858-1995 - Ancestry.com On December 7, 1945 in London she married her fourth husband, Beresford Cecil Bingham (1894‚Äì1957), the 8th Earl Annesley, and 9th Viscount of Glerawly, giving her the title of Countess of Annesley. Bingham had been a Pilot Officer in the Royal Air Force Volunteer Reserve during World War II; he had also previously served as a Lieutenant in the 6th Battalion Royal Fusiliers. After his death on June 29, 1957 she returned to New York, where she led a quiet and unassuming life and there she died in June 1977 at the age of 89 years. She was buried in a mausoleum at Woodlawn Cemetery in the Bronx in New York. She had no children from any of her four marriages. ==References== ==External links== *Brandell on Internet Broadway Database *Mausoleum of Josephine Countess Annesley at Woodlawn Cemetery in New York - Find a Grave *Josephine Mary Brandell on The Peerage website Category:1887 births Category:1977 deaths Category:Austrian Jews Category:20th-century American actresses Category:20th-century American musicians Category:Austrian opera singers Category:Austrian stage actresses Category:Austrian emigrants to the United States Category:American stage actresses Category:American opera singers Category:20th-century Austrian singers Category:20th-century American singers Category:Jewish Austrian actresses Category:RMS Lusitania Josephine Category:Burials at Woodlawn Cemetery (Bronx) ","title":"Josephine Brandell"},{"id":"60372546","text":"Odessadale is an unincorporated community in Meriwether County, in the U.S. state of Georgia. ==History== Variant names were \\"Odessa\\" and \\"Xerxes\\".

Hayeur‚Äôs works are inspired by a critical analysis of ecology and urbanity. Since the late 1990s, Hayeur has created public art commissions, photography books, video installations, and has participated in many solo and group exhibitions. Her artworks can be found in both national and international collections, including those of the National Gallery of Canada, the Vancouver Art Gallery, the Art Gallery of Ontario, the Art Gallery of Alberta (Edmonton), the Mus√©e d‚Äôart contemporain de Montr√©al, the New Orleans Museum of Art and the Museum of Contemporary Photography in Chicago, and the Fonds national d‚Äôart contemporain in Paris. == Early Life and Education == Isabelle Hayeur was born in Montreal, Canada in 1969. Hayeur obtained a Bachelor of Fine Arts degree in 1997 and a Master of Fine Arts degree in 2002, both from the Universit√© du Qu√©bec √† Montr√©al. She has lived and worked in Montreal for most of her life. Hayeur was raised in the suburb of Bois-des-Filion in Montreal, where she lived into her early 20s. During these years, Hayeur experienced feelings of alienation and dislocation that she believes to accompany suburban living. Hayeur‚Äôs suburban upbringing is highly influential to her works, where she frequently confronts the issue of land exploitation in urban planning. Hayeur currently resides in the Rawdon Municipality, located on the Ouareau River in southwestern Quebec, Canada. == Artistic Practice == === Digital Imaging === Hayeur primarily works in digital imaging. She is known for her large scale environment-based photomontages. Hayeur uses photo manipulation to create new artificial landscapes. In Her 2004-2007 photo series Model Homes, Hayeur creates images with photographs of houses from both quaint suburban dwellings and prefabricated model homes. As opposed to the modest, more dated, homes, the model homes all look similar due to \\"cookie cutter\\" architectural elements. Steepled roofs, bay windows, and double car garages, stand out as formal characteristics of urban sprawl building. The fanciful character of these model homes are exemplary of society's use of repetition and familiarity in construction as a means of creating a new, urban, identity. Using photo manipulation, Hayeur places these homes in different environments to give them new contexts. These new contexts are described as being both no place and everyplace, referencing how seemingly rural Canadian communities have become prime venues for suburban sprawl. In her 2005-2007 photo exhibition Excavations, Hayeur places ground-level views of generic suburban homes in construction sites. By photographing construction sites at ground-level, Hayeur records the erasure of the land by capturing the rich topsoil being removed to create barren grounds ready for development. The goal of Excavations is to show model homes in unaltered environments, providing x-ray like visions of the geological foundations they sit upon. By using digital manipulation to merge these man made habitats with their natural origins, Hayeur shows the coexistence of spaces that appear disconnected. Hayeur utilizes underwater cameras in her digital imaging practice. In her 2008-2013 photo series Underworlds, she captures photographs of aquatic ecosystems. The images are taken either fully underwater or, partially underwater, as to show the aquatic ecosystem's relationship to the environment above. In this project, Hayeur photographs the waterways near New Jersey's chemical coast and in Rossville (Staten Island). The photographs reveal \\"aquatic deserts,\\" which Hayeur attributes to a lack of oxygen caused by pollution in these areas. In her photographs, Hayeur captures the unconventional beauty of these lifeless waters as they become animated in the wavering sunlight. Hayeur also works in panoramic photography to capture expansive landscapes. Hayeur‚Äôs panoramic photographs are digitally manipulated as she retouches the landscapes by adding fragments of other images taken from environments in various locations. With these additions, Hayeur‚Äôs images reveal conditions of the environment that unaltered documentary photography cannot show. Hayeur‚Äôs photo manipulations are described as a parody of objective documentary photography. To create these images, Hayeur uses Adobe Photoshop software. === Video === Hayeur is also known for her works in experimental film. Losing Ground is a critique of urban sprawl, drawing attention to the erosion and homogenization of the countryside that results from it. In Losing Ground, Hayeur uses time lapse videography to capture recently man-made territories, confronting viewers with footage of their own depleting environment. === Site-Specific Installations === Hayeur integrates her environmental-critique works into the environment itself by creating site- specific installations in high traffic public areas. In her 2010 site-specific video installation Fire with Fire, Hayeur simulates a fire in a four-storey heritage building located in Vancouver's Downtown Eastside. Using three Blu- ray disk players and multiple video projectors, Hayeur loops a 15 minute video of a fire onto the windows of the building. This installation being in Vancouver's oldest and most run-down neighbourhood is purposeful. The work comments on the neglect of the area as its residence struggle with homelessness, drug abuse, prostitution, and violence. Sommeil (ou Les s√©jours sous terre) is a photographic work in the international quarter of Montreal. It was integrated into the pedestrian path where it remained from 2005 - 2006. Songes a photo triptych. It was installed at the cultural community centre of Montr√©al-Nord in 2005 where it remained for one year. === Other === Beyond digital imagery and video, Hayeur has been known to work in Internet art. Currently, none of these works exist publicly online. == Themes == === Urban Sprawl === One of the main themes in Hayeur‚Äôs work is urban sprawl. Urban sprawl refers to the environmental consequences of the uncontrolled building of homes and commercial buildings over large territories. Hayeur highlights the irony between persistent urbanization and the accompanying disappearance of things. Particularly interested in the flaws of housing in modern society, Hayeur examines how the rapid erection of disposable homes causes the environmental needs of various lands to be neglected. === Industrialization === Much of Hayeur‚Äôs work critiques industrialization. Hayeur expresses worries about the ways humans have inhabited natural territories. She often refers to work in construction, road building, drilling, and archaeology, in her artworks. She critiques these industrialized spaces by blending different sites into a single territory.Galerie Th√©r√®se Dion. Quarternaire. Montreal: Galerie Th√©r√®se Dion, 2007. This draws attention to the dehumanized state of these spaces. Hayeur‚Äôs documentary style photography (normally associated with realism) to create these fictive images further emphasizes industrialization‚Äôs dehumanization. === Ecotopia === Ecotopia is derived from the subgenre Ecotopian fiction. Ecotopian fiction is derived from the synthesis of utopian and dystopian worlds. In 2012, Hayeur participated in a group exhibition called Ecotopia. Here, Hayeur and her contemporaries presented works that show the coexistence of rural and urban, natural and manufactured, protection and exploitation, conservation and destruction, nostalgia and futuristic vision, to challenge the notion that modernity equals progress. Hayeur‚Äôs contribution was footage from her 2012 video, Losing Ground. Hayeur‚Äôs video evokes themes of Ecotopia as it shows a blend of industrial architecture amongst environmental decay and erosion. === Capitalism === Hayeur criticizes capitalism in her photographs and exhibitions. She denounces society‚Äôs consumerist mindset with the extreme accumulation of goods and money as well as the giant infrastructure projects that destroy the environment. == Collaborations == In 2004, Hayeur was a part of a 10 month field study conducted by Jude Leclerc and Frederic Gosselin, researchers in the Department of Psychology at the University of Montreal. Leclerc and Gosselin examined the under-researched cognitive problem solving process in a contemporary visual arts practice. Hayeur was the test subject and data on her creative processes was collected through multiple 30-60 minute interviews and site visits to her workspace. The study revealed that within the creative realm, the cognition of a professional artist is on part with the cognition of a scientist. Hayeur collaborated with a plethora of artists and curators throughout her career. At the VOX Gallery‚Äôs show Awakening in 2004, Hayeur collaborated with the artists Mark Lewis and Mary Kunuk. These three Canadian artists manipulated the idea of landscape through their works in this exhibition via still photography, video, and cinema. == Solo Exhibitions == * Mus√©e d'art de JolietteIsabelle Hayeur ‚Äì D√©payser.

The monastery was originally Benedictine but after a lawsuit broke out between the abbot of Fontenelles and the abbot of Marmoutier, a prestigious Benedictine monastery, the community became Augustinian, as a daughter house of the nearby Chancelade Abbey, in about 1224.Gallia Christiana, tome 2 (relatif aux provinces eccl√©siastiques de Bourges et de Bordeaux), cols 1433-1437. Imprimerie royale, Paris, 1720 The church was dedicated in 1248 by Jean de Melun, bishop of Poitiers. The last regular abbot died in 1487, after which the abbey passed into the hands of commendatory abbots. From 1632 the abbots of Chancelade shared in the governance of Fontenelles. From 1669 the community was taken on by the reformist Congr√©gation de France.Abb√© Louis Delhommeau, Documents pour l'histoire de l‚Äô√©v√™ch√© de Lu√ßon, 1317-1801. Lu√ßon, 1980] The church was damaged during the Hundred Years' War. In 1533 there were only 9 monks here. In 1562 during the Wars of Religion Protestants attacked the abbey, killing some of the monks, set it on fire and largely destroyed it. In particular they damaged the church to the extent that part of nave collapsed, leaving it permanently shortened, with a Greek cross floor plan. Protestants attacked it again in the 1620s but were forced to repair the damage. The monastery was restored from 1669 onwards by the canons of the Congr√©gation de France. The abbey, by that time containing only three monks, was suppressed during the French Revolution in 1791. In 1794 the passage of the \\"infernal columns\\" through the Vend√©e left it entirely abandoned. The site was later used for agriculture: the church was turned into a barn and the abbot's lodging into accommodation for labourers. Continued neglect brought about the collapse of most of the remaining buildings including in 1935 the collapse of the south transept of what was left of the church. The site remains private property. ==Buildings== West end of the abbey church The monastery was built in granite in the Angevin Gothic style, transitional between Romanesque and Gothic. The truncated church is the most intact structure remaining, and contains the tomb of either the foundress B√©atrice de Machecoul or her daughter Jeanne, Vicomtesse de Thouars, consisting of a recumbent effigy (gisant) in an arched recess (arcosolium) with small figures.Yves Blomme, Poitou gothique (Les monuments de la France gothique).

Its author claims to be writing at the behest of Sadalberga's daughter and successor as abbess, Anstrude, but the date and reliability of the Vita are disputed by scholars. The Vita's 19th-century editor, Bruno Krusch, argued that it was a forgery of the 9th century and of no historical value. He claimed that it invented numerous details, such as Sadalberga's forced marriage and children, and believed that only reliable source for the saint's life was her contemporary, Jonas of Bobbio, author of the Vita sancti Columbani.J. A. McNamara, J. E. Halborg, E. G. Whatley, eds. Sainted women of the Dark Ages (Duke University Press, 1992), p. 176.

Fouracre, (2008), \\"Forgetting and Remembering Dagobert II: The English Connection\\", in Frankland: The Franks and the World of the Early Middle Ages (Manchester: Manchester University Press), p. 73. Jamie Kreiner places it around 680, a decade or so after Sadalberga's death.Jamie Kreiner, The Social Life of Hagiography in the Merovingian Kingdom (Cambridge University Press, 2014), p. 189. The author of the Vita had access to the writings of Jonas on Sadalberga. He embellished this material without falsifying the basic outline. His vivid narrative gives the impression of an eyewitness. Since there is no evidence of a cult of Sadalberga at Laon, it is not clear who would have sponsored or profited from the production of a literary forgery in the 9th century. The Vita is the only source for the civil war between Dagobert II (676‚Äì79) and Theuderic III (675‚Äì91). Since the family and its monastic foundations suffered during the war, the Vita Sadalbergae along with the Vita Anstrudis may have been composed in the immediate aftermath as part of an effort to restore the reputation of both.H.

After his father's death, his mother remarried to Sir Thomas Nicolson, 1st Baronet, with whom she had several daughters (his half-sisters), one of whom was Margaret Nicolson, the wife of William Kerr, 3rd Marquess of Lothian (Hamilton's brother-in-law). His maternal grandparents were Sir Thomas Nicolson, 2nd Baronet and Lady Margaret Livingstone (daughter of Alexander Livingstone, 2nd Earl of Linlithgow), and his paternal grandfather was Andrew Hamilton of Monktonhall. In 1687, at age three, he succeeded his father. His wardship was granted to George Baillie in 1692. He succeeded Sir Francis Hamilton, 3rd Baronet, to the name but not the lands of Innerwick in 1714. His family, the Hamiltons of Innerwick, acquired their lands in the fourteenth century. ==Career== At the 1727 British general election, Hamilton was returned unopposed as Member of Parliament for Linlithgowshire with the backing of Lord Hopetoun. He was appointed Secretary for Scotland to the Prince of Wales by 1733. He was returned again for Linlithgowshire after a contest at the 1734 British general election.

Sometimes referred to as \\"gendered nationalism,\\" gender and nationalism describes the phenomena whereby conceptions of the state or nation, including notions of citizenship, sovereignty, or national identity contribute to or arise in relation to gender roles. == Overview and key themes == \\"Your motherland will never forget\\", an illustration from Canada in Khaki. Artist: Joseph Simpson, restored by Adam Cuerden. Though there are different varieties of nationalism, gender and sexuality affect the way nationalism develops in specific contexts. Different gender systems and gender roles are instituted by or invoked to support nationalist movements in differing ways. For example, when communities determine that nationhood is necessary, and often inevitable, the identity of the nation is often imagined in gendered ways.Mackay, Eva (2000). \\"Death by Landscape: Race, Nature and Gender in the Canadian Nationalist Mythology\\". Canadian Woman Studies. 20: 125‚Äì30 ‚Äì via Journals.Yorku. The physical land itself may be gendered female (i.e. \\"Motherland\\"), considered to be a body in constant danger of violation by foreign males, while national pride and protectiveness of \\"her\\" borders is gendered as masculine.Peterson, Spike V. (1998). \\"Gendered nationalism: Reproducing \\"Us\\" versus \\"Them\\"\\". In Turpin, Jennifer; Lorentzen, Lois Ann. The Woman and War Reader. New York: New York University Press. pp. 41‚Äì49. . Legal rights related to gender and sexuality are also impacted by nationalist movements. Kumari Jayawardena's work has explored how the desire for legal recognition and equity motivated women's participation in nationalist movements in Asia. Relatedly, Emil Edenborg has investigated how opposition to legal rights for LGBT people in Russia and Chechnya is linked to particular nationalist discourses.Edenborg, Emil. \\"Homophobia as Geopolitics: 'Traditional Values‚Äô and the Negotiation of Russia‚Äôs Place in the World.\\" In Gendering Nationalism, 67‚Äì87. Springer, 2018. Scholarship on gender and nationalism has tended to examine the relationships between gender, sexuality, and national structures by exploring themes of men and masculinity, women and femininity, heteronormativity and sexuality, or along the intersection of religion, race, gender and nationalism.Mulholland, Jon, Nicola Montagna, and Erin Sanders-McDonagh. Gendering Nationalism: Intersections of Nation, Gender and Sexuality. Springer, 2018, 20‚Äì24. === Men, masculinity, and nationalism === Normative understandings of masculinity and male behavior vary across cultural, historical, or geographical contexts. Because male behavior and masculinity impact social and political relations, men and masculinity affect the development of nationalism. George Mosse has argued that modern masculine stereotypes exist in a mutual relationship to modern nationalism.Mosse, George. The Image of a Man: The Creation of Modern Masculinity. New York: Oxford University Press, 1996, 7. Nationalism and the structure and expansion of the state are closely related, and institutions like the military as well as state projects such as imperialism and colonialism are often dominated by male participants. Shirin M. Rai has also pointed out how economic development tied to nation-building projects in postcolonial contexts is often gendered as masculine, ultimately devaluing the economic stability of women and subaltern men.Rai, Shirin M. Gender and the Political Economy of Development: From Nationalism to Globalization. John Wiley & Sons, 2013, 1‚Äì2. Within national structures, hierarchical models of authority and decision-making often prioritize men's authority, legal rights, labor, and sexuality. Symbolically and ideologically, nationalist movements frequently valorize masculine projections of honor, patriotism, bravery, physical virility, rationality, individualism, and duty.

SUNY Press, 2012, 2‚Äì3. alt= === Women, femininity, and nationalism === Specific social and political roles expected of women are not only tied to conceptions of femininity, but are also linked to local and national power relations. Social responsibilities, such as child-rearing, or particular forms of employment and interpersonal engagement become feminized and expected of women.Enloe, Cynthia. Bananas, Beaches and Bases: Making Feminist Sense of International Politics. Univ of California Press, 2014, 11‚Äì12. Women's labor and women's bodies have provided material and symbolic resources to nationalist and colonial projects.Enloe, Cynthia. Bananas, Beaches and Bases: Making Feminist Sense of International Politics. Univ of California Press, 2014, 92. National identities are often linked to women and their reproductive capacity.Yuval- Davis, Nira, and Floya Anthias. Woman, Nation, State. New York: St. Martin's Press, 1989. Concepts like territory, community, and ethnicity as well as aspirations regarding the future of the nation are tied to gender roles that cast women as maternal caretakers of a nation's future.Mulholland, Jon, Nicola Montagna, and Erin Sanders-McDonagh. Gendering Nationalism: Intersections of Nation, Gender and Sexuality. Springer, 2018, 8. When women resist these expectations, projections, and roles, their resistance impacts the development of national identity. At the same time, nationalist movements have also provided disenfranchised women with potential opportunities to be treated as active participants within political and social spheres.Enloe, Cynthia. Bananas, Beaches and Bases: Making Feminist Sense of International Politics. Univ of California Press, 2014, 87. Summarizing the relationship between women and nationalism, Nira Yuval-Davis and Flora Anthias distinguish five forms by which women participate in nationalism. In their framework, women act as: biological producers of new national members, symbols of national difference, carriers and creators of cultural narratives, agents enforcing the boundaries of the nation, active participants in national movements.Yuval-Davis, Nira, and Floya Anthias. Woman, Nation, State. New York: StMartin's Press, 1989, 7‚Äì8. === Heteronormativity, sexuality, and nationalism === Nationalist movements are often aligned with heteronormative family models, that is, heterosexual family units assuming male leadership, female reproduction, as well as natural and complementary roles between men and women. Thus, nationalism has been identified as a tool to support heteronormative structures of power that exclude or subjugate sexual minorities and those outside of the male-female gender binary. === Religion, race, gender, and nationalism === Race and religion intersect with the development of nationalism and impact how gender roles are structured in relation to nationalism. Racialization, the process of ascribing race to particular social groups or individuals, always corresponds to particular configurations of gender, class, and nationalism.Collins, Patricia Hill. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs All In the Family: Intersections of Gender, Race, and Nation.‚Äù Hypatia 13, no. 3 (1998): 62‚Äì82, 62. https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/j.1527-2001.1998.tb01370.x.Andersen, Margaret L., and Patricia Hill Collins. Race, Class, and Gender: An Anthology. Wadsworth Cengage Learning, 2013. For example, according to scholar Anne McClintock, the development of Afrikaner nationalism in South Africa was dependent on the rise of an apartheid doctrine among Afrikaner people and was also tied to gender roles that positioned women as subservient to men and with responsibilities of service to the nation. Religion may also affect participation in nationalist movements, nationalist discourse, and motivations for establishing nation-states. The inclusion or expulsion of particular religious communities may be aligned with particular forms of gendered nationalist discourse. Theorist Jasbir Puar suggests that gendered discourses of nationalism often demonize or advocate the expulsion of Muslim people in the United States, thus tying particular understandings of the nation-state and nationalism to specific configurations of gender.Puar, Jasbir K (Author). Terrorist Assemblages: Homonationalism in Queer Times. Durham: Duke University Press, 2007. Religion may also inform gender roles in particular locations, thus when nationalist projects are undertaken women and men may feel tension between the gender expectations of their religion and the gender expectations associated with nationalist discourse. == Scholarly studies of nationalism and gender == Nationalism and gender studies is a subfield within the broader interdisciplinary study of nationalism, also referred to as nationalism studies. Nationalism and gender studies draw on feminism, queer theory, postcolonialism, and interdisciplinary methods to investigate the interplay between gender and nationalism. A shared evaluation among many scholars is that gender, sexuality, and nationalism are socially and culturally constructed. Scholars of gender and nationalism thus argue that gender configurations are always intimately related to and impact the development of nationalism. The development of nationalism and gender studies arose due to a lack study about the way gender and sexuality intersect with nationalism by mainstream scholars of nationalism. Feminist scholars were among the first theorists to approach the relationship between nationalism and gender and began writing of the relationship between gender, sexuality, and nationalism in the 1980s and 1990s. These early feminist studies of gender and nationalism focused primarily on the role of women in the development of nationalism. However, several scholars are now approaching multiple dimensions of gender and sexuality in relation to the development of nationalism. Context and location are important for understanding how nationalism develops. Therefore, scholars often use case studies to explore how gender and nationalism are linked in specific contexts. Among other locations, case studies exploring gender and nationalism have analyzed situations in Canada, Argentina, India,Oza, Rupal. The Making of Neoliberal India: Nationalism, Gender, and the Paradoxes of Globalization. Routledge, 2012. South Africa, Israel, Russia, Ireland, and the United States. Due to the interplay between colonialism, migration, and nationalism, other theorists have paid specific attention to the interplay of gender and nationalism in postcolonial contexts and have explored the relationship between transnationalism and gender. === Related terms === ==== Muscular nationalism ==== Muscular nationalism is a term developed by the political scientist Sikata Banerjee to describe the development of nationalism amidst tensions produced by gender binaries. Banerjee describes muscular nationalism as a form of nationalism that relies on a binary notion of gender with opposing conceptions of man versus woman. In such a situation, female activists and political actors contest a dualistic notion of nationalism, thus generating political, cultural, and social tension. The form of nationalism resulting from the binary and its contestation is muscular nationalism.Banerjee, Sikata. Muscular Nationalism: Gender, Violence, and Empire in India and Ireland, 1914‚Äì2004. NYU Press, 2012. ==== Queer nationalism ==== Within studies of nationalism, gender, and sexuality, queer nationalism refers the process wherein homosexuality and queer sexuality function as the basis of social and political organization and produce particular nationalisms. Queer nationalism can also refer to the process of using queerness as a metaphor for types of affiliations between nation-states.Hayes, Jarrod. Queer Nations: Marginal Sexualities in the Maghreb. University of Chicago Press, 2000. ==== Homonationalism ==== Scholars have used the term homonationalism to describe the emergence of nationalism that advances support for homosexuality and LGBT rights while also promoting xenophobic, racist, colonialist, and supremacist ideologies.Jasbir Puar, who first developed the term homonationalism, has argued that it describes a form of nationalism that assumes \\"sexual exceptionalism, queer as regulatory, and the ascendancy of whiteness.\\"Puar, Jasbir K (Author). Terrorist Assemblages: Homonationalism in Queer Times. Durham: Duke University Press, 2007, 2. ==== Femonationalism ==== Developed by theorist Sara Farris, femonationalism describes a particular form of nationalism within western European contexts. Farris defines femonationalism as a form of nationalism that deploys feminist critique and support for gender equality while simultaneously promoting xenophobic, racist, and anti-Islam sentiment and policy.Farris, Sara R.

She was seized in May 1945 before launching and claimed as a war prize. Named Empire Frome, she was allocated to the Ministry of War Transport (MoWT). The ship was completed in 1948. She was sold and converted to a cable ship in 1953, operating until 1959 when she caught fire at sea. Although she safely reached port, she was declared a constructive total loss and scrapped. ==Description== As built, the ship was overall, between perpendiculars, with a beam of . She had a depth of . As built, she was assessed at , . The ship was propelled by a 1,800 ihp Lenz engine driving an exhaust turbine. The engine was built by Werkspoor, Amsterdam, North Holland, Netherlands. Steam was supplied by three Capus-type boilers. It drove a single screw propeller. The engine could propel the ship at a speed of . ==History== The ship was built by Flensburger Schiffbau- Gesellschaft as yard number 508. Laid down in 1945, she was seized in May 1945 before she had been launched. Allocated to the Ministry of War Transport, which became the Ministry of Transport that year, she was completed in 1948 as Empire Frome. Although not officially yet declared a prize of war, she was advertised for sale in January 1948 \\"as lying in the River Tyne\\". She was placed under the management of George Nesbit & Co. Ltd., Glasgow. Empire Frome was allocated the United Kingdom Official Number 181837. In December 1951, Empire Frome issued an SOS in the Atlantic Ocean whilst on a voyage from Bridgewater, Nova Scotia, Canada to Hull, Yorkshire. She reached Hull on 27 December, having suffered damage to her derricks and with lifeboats lost or damaged. She was advertised for sale in April 1953, and again in September. Empire Frome was purchased by Submarine Cables Ltd. In January 1954, Submarine Cables Ltd applied to the Ministry of Transport and Civil Aviation to have the ship's name changed in accordance with the Merchant Shipping Act, 1894. In March, it was reported that Empire Frome had been purchased by Submarine Cables Ltd and was to be converted to a cable ship. Work was estimated to take about a year to complete. The rebuild, by R S Hayes at Pembroke Dock, took fifteen months at a cost of ¬£1 million, including purchase. She was renamed Ocean Layer on 29 September 1955. Following rebuilding, she was long overall with a depth of . She was assessed at , . She could carry 3,700 tons of submarine cable, enough for depending on size. Cable was carried in four tanks, of , , and diameter. Her complement was 83. Ocean Layer was then the second-largest cable ship in the world. Cable similar to that laid by Ocean Layer between California and Hawaii.In October 1955, she laid her first cable, a long telephone cable in the Skaggerak. In 1952, she laid of cable between Pernambuco, Bahia and Vitoria, Brazil. In August 1956, she laid a power cable in the Gulf of Georgia, linking mainland British Columbia with Vancouver Island. In July 1956, and Ocean Layer laid a cable for American Telephone and Telegraph between California, United States and Hawaii. At , it was then the longest in the world. In 1957‚Äì58, she laid cables in the Indian Ocean and in 1959 she renewed of cable off the coast of Brazil. In 1959, she was engaged to lay TAT-2 in the Atlantic Ocean. On 15 June, a fire started in the crew's quarters whilst she was west of Ouessant, Finist√®re, France (). The ship was abandoned. Her 86 crew and twelve telephone executives on board were rescued by the German ship Flavia, which took her in tow. was also sent to assist in the rescue. A Royal Air Force Avro Shackleton was despatched from Cornwall with life-saving equipment on board, but was subsequently recalled. On 17 June, the tow was transferred to the German salvage tug Wotan. The Dutch tug Loire had reached Ocean Layer first, but was refused the tow as a contract had already been made with Wotans owners. She arrived at Falmouth, Cornwall on 19 June still on fire. On 22 June, the Falmouth harbourmaster called the Cornwall Fire Brigade to attend the burning ship and extinguish the fire. Access was refused by the captain of Wotan, who claimed that maritime law dictated that it was his responsibility to extinguish the fire before handing the ship over. He said it would take two or three days before the fire was put out. Ocean Layer was handed over to the port authorities at Falmouth on 25 June. At an inquiry into the loss of the ship, it was claimed that an electric heater in one of the cabins had been the cause of the fire. The inquiry found that the probable cause was an electric stove had been placed under a crewman's bunk whilst still hot after being used, although disconnected from the electricity supply. The order to abandon ship had been given about 40 minutes after the fire started. Firefighting efforts were deemed ineffective. The emergency fire pump failed at an early stage because its power supply had been destroyed by the fire. Declared a constructive total loss, Ocean Layer was scrapped at Hendrik-Ido-Ambacht, South Holland, Netherlands in December 1959. ==References== ==External links== *Photograph of Ocean Layer. *Painting of Ocean Layer. *Silent newsreel of Ocean Layer fire (British Path√©).

Currently a member of Modern Nature, Cooper was previously a member of The Beep Seals, Mazes and Ultimate Painting. ==Biography== Cooper was born in Blackpool, and re-located to Manchester in the early 2000s. In 2003, he signed to Twisted Nerve Records and released the song Hope I Don't Cry on a 7\\" single with 2 other artists which was issued as part of the label's mail order single subscription service. In 2004, Cooper signed to My Dad Recordings and released his debut EP in July 2004 in the form of Turn The Light Off. My Dad Recordings was the home of local musician Jim Noir, who helped Cooper record demos with his backing band for a possible debut album. However, instead of continuing to pursue a solo career Cooper served as part of Noir's backing band along with former Alfie guitarist Ian Smith on drums. The musicians dubbed themselves The Beep Seals and helped Noir record and tour his debut album Tower of Love, which was released in December 2005. Following tour commitments, the band parted ways with Jim Noir and began working on their own material with Cooper and Smith co-fronting. Commenting on the formation of the band, Cooper stated that they \\"all gelled immediately as a band. Me and Ian bonded straight away over obscure psychedelic records, and stuff like that first EP by The Aliens. I was thinking of packing in my solo stuff, anyway, and Ian was looking for a new band after Alfie finished\\". Through 2007, the band released 2 singles in the form of Tell Your Friends and Stars. In 2018, the band released their debut album Things That Roar, which was produced by Teenage Fanclub frontman Norman Blake. They split up in April 2009, cancelling their last planned gig which was part of an all day gig in Glasgow dubbed BeepFest. In 2009, Cooper formed Mazes. Initially conceived as a solo project following the split of the Beep Seals, after some early lineup changes the band lineup was completed by bassist Neil Robinson and drummer Conan Roberts. The band went on to release 3 albums proper; A Thousand Heys in 2011, Ores & Minerals in 2013 and Wooden Aquarium in 2014. Commenting on how the band worked together, Cooper revealed that \\"on the first record back in 2011, the songs were almost entirely fully formed. And then on Ores the songs were constructed around loops and I think of that record as being a mood board of how we want to sound in the long run. With the new stuff, I‚Äôm still bringing in the seeds of songs but we‚Äôre collaborating a lot more in the arrangement and vibe. Neil and Conan both have really great taste\\". Following the quiet disbandment of Mazes in 2014, Cooper moved on to work with former Veronica Falls member James Hoare and formed Ultimate Painting. The band signed to US record label Trouble in Mind and released 3 albums in quick succession; Ultimate Painting in 2014, Green Lanes in 2015 and Dusk in 2016. Commenting on the productiity of the band, Cooper commented that \\"after we made the first record I knew that this is something we‚Äôd be doing for a while but to do three records in three years does feel like an achievement. Being completely honest, it‚Äôs not always easy. We‚Äôre two very different people and we disagree about even the tiniest thing\\". In August 2017, Cooper released his debut solo album Sandgrown via Trouble in Mind, influenced by his childhood in Blackpool. In January 2018, Ultimate Painting announced that their fourth album Up was set for release in the following April via Bella Union and shared lead-single Not Gonna Burn Myself Anymore. A UK tour to coincide with the release was announced and put on sale. On 12 February 2018, Jack Cooper announced that the band were splitting up, adding that \\"the partnership at the core of this band has always been a very fragile thing, but due to an irreconcilable breakdown we will no longer be working with each other\\". The previously announced album release was cancelled at Cooper's express request and the UK tour to support it was also cancelled.https://www.facebook.com/UltimatePaintingOfficial/posts/1446266252150122title=Ultimate Painting In February 2019, Cooper unveilved his new band Modern Nature, announcing their debut EP Nature which was released in March via Bella Union. Commenting on the lineup of the band, Cooper revealed that \\"the band is so new, it's hard to say who's in and who isn't.

It is written and produced by Nomaan Khan, directed by Azfar Jafri, and stars Mikaal Zulfiqar, Hassan Niazi, Armeena Rana Khan and Sabeeka Imam. The film revolves around Pakistan Air Force. It is the 28th highest-grossing Pakistani film. Sherdil was a commercial success though it received mixed to negative reviews from critics. == Plot == The film opens during the year 1965, where two Pakistani F-86 Sabre fighters are doing a CAP (Combat Air Patrol). Squadron Leader Sikandar and his wingman spot three Indian Folland Gnat fighters flying in Pakistani airspace. The PAF (Pakistan Air Force) planes engage the IAF (Indian Air Force) fighters. Sikandar heroically gives up his life and crashes his plane into the final enemy jet. Fast forward to present day, Haris Mustafa (Mikaal Zulfiqar) who is the grandson of Sikandar Mustafa, and his best friend Fawad both dream of becoming fighter pilots. Haris's parents disapprove of his career choice. However, Haris's grandmother, widow of Sikander, is supportive of his ambitions. When Haris is accepted into the PAF academy, his father disowns him. At the academy, Haris and Fawad befriend Harijeet, a Pakistani Sikh and Irfan. During this time, Haris meets and falls in love with Sabrina (Armeena Khan). Two Indian Mirage 2000's enter the Pakistani airspace and Haris and Irfan are scrambled to intercept them in JF-17's. Haris engages in an intense dogfight with the Mirage, barely escaping with his life. Haris returns to base where he learns his grandmother passed away. Although Haris survived the air encounter, his superiors are disappointed that he almost lost the plane and his life. They reluctantly send him to the International Flight School. At the flight school, he encounters Flight Lieutenant Arun Veerani, a Mirage 2000 fighter pilot. Haris and Arun are initially very hostile to each other, but end up becoming friends. Haris returns and proposes to Sabrina. She agrees to marry him, but only if he remains with the PAF, as she realizes that she cannot let him give up his dream and passion for serving his country. Their honeymoon is cut short when political tensions once again arise between India and Pakistan, with the Indian armed forces threatening to perform surgical strikes along the Pakistan-controlled Kashmir area. Sabrina is horrified at the risk that Harris's life will be in, but he states that he must do what is required of him, to which she then gives him her full support. Haris and Irfan are sent on a CAP, when they encounter 2 Indian Mirage-2000's. During the ensuing fight, Haris comes face to face with a Mirage flown by Arun. Haris hesitates to shoot Arun due to their friendship, and then hears a distress call from his wingman Irfan who is now being shot at by another Mirage. Haris spares Arun, telling him to leave the area and flies towards Irfan, but is too late. Harris returns to Arun who tells him that this decision is \\"out of his hands\\" and tries to shoot Haris down. Haris comes up behind him, says \\"Sorry my friend\\" and shoots Arun's plane down.

The nearest higher peak is Mount Athabasca, to the southwest. Hilda Peak is situated south of Sunwapta Pass and can be prominently seen from the Icefields Parkway. The Hilda Glacier lies to the south side of the peak, and the Boundary Glacier lies to the west. __NOTOC__ ==History== The first ascent of the mountain was made in 1938 by E. Brooks, H. Brooks, R. Cross, and W. Marples. The mountain was named Hilda Peak in 1938. The mountain's name was officially adopted in 1985 when approved by the Geographical Names Board of Canada. ==Geology== Like other mountains in Banff Park, Hilda Peak is composed of sedimentary rock laid down from the Precambrian to Jurassic periods. Formed in shallow seas, this sedimentary rock was pushed east and over the top of younger rock during the Laramide orogeny. ==Climate== Based on the K√∂ppen climate classification, Hilda Peak is located in a subarctic climate with cold, snowy winters, and mild summers. Temperatures can drop below -20 ¬∞C with wind chill factors below -30 ¬∞C. Precipitation runoff from Hilda Peak drains east into Hilda Creek, thence Nigel Creek, tributaries of the North Saskatchewan River. ==Gallery== File:Icefields Parkway view of Mount Athabasca and Hilda Peak.jpgHilda (right) seen from the Icefields Parkway ==References== ==See also== *List of mountains of Canada *Geography of Alberta ==External links== * Hilda Peak weather forecast * Parks Canada web site: Banff National Park Category:Mountains of Alberta Category:Mountains of Banff National Park Category:Alberta's Rockies Category:Canadian Rockies ","title":"Hilda Peak"},{"id":"60373084","text":"Endocephalus is a genus of leaf beetles in the subfamily Eumolpinae.

The restaurant first opened in March 1996. Up until the mid 2010s, it was known for several novel animatronics based on the wildlife of Canada. Animatronics of bulls, buffaloes, or moose trophy head mounts would greet guests and provide entertainment. Other novelty characters such as Timber, The Talking Christmas Tree, would be programmed to tell customers about Canadian history and natural attractions. ==Menu== The menu offered classic steakhouse offerings. Some menu items included steak, burgers, salads, desserts, appetizers, breakfast food (mornings only), seafood, sandwiches, pasta, and other bar food. ==Bankruptcy and closure== In November 2010, Praesidian Capital announced that it is filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy and closed most of its Massachusetts locations. At the time of the announcement, the company had 12 restaurants still in operation after closing 18 restaurants the previous week. Following the bankruptcy, the chain began moving away from the talking animals, shutting down their animatronics while still leaving them up on the walls. On June 29, 2016, the chain completely closed its doors worldwide. == Animatronics == From the time of the chain's opening until the bankruptcy, Bugaboo Creek was known for its novelty animatronics. Among the real mounts of bucks, deer and bears, several recreated mounts would be fitted with robotics to talk and move. Depending on the location, moose or bull mounts would be near the dining tables or at the bar, whereas a constant Bill the Buffalo would watch over the customers coming into the dining room. The characters would break the fourth wall, sardonically referencing their status as perpetually trapped robots, hanging above the guests, who were happily enjoying their meals. Local restaurants would name these animatronics, such as Moxie the Moose or Goose the Moose. Classic flapping fish were included alongside raccoons or weasels who would pop out of wooden barrels. After each restaurant closed, the non-robotic mounts were sold at local auctions, yet the locations of the talking moose and buffaloes are unknown, theorized to have found other homes in other game themed restaurants. ==References== Category:Companies based in Essex County, New Jersey Category:Restaurants in New Jersey Category:Economy of the Northeastern United States Category:Regional restaurant chains in the United States Category:Restaurants established in 1996 Category:Restaurants disestablished in 2016 Category:Steakhouses in the United States Category:Defunct restaurant chains in the United States Category:Defunct restaurants in the United States Category:1996 establishments in New Jersey Category:2016 disestablishments in New Jersey Category:Millburn, New Jersey Category:Companies that filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in 2010 Category:Theme restaurants ","title":"Bugaboo Creek Steakhouse"},{"id":"60373159","text":"Dead Pixels is a British television sitcom, which began airing on E4 on 28 March 2019.

The series creators have been cited as wanting to create a more well-rounded portrayal of the lives of some gamers, noting that mainstream television does not have the best reputation for how it presents gamers on screen. It hopes to do this by showing both the funny and the thought provoking side of gaming and gaming culture. Both the writer of the series, Jon Brown, and the director, Al Campbell, have been described as \\"massive gamers\\". ==Reception== The series has been described by The Guardian as \\"wickedly entertaining\\" and \\"the sharpest new sitcom of 2019\\".

The Wilderness Society has designated the area as a ‚ÄúMountain Treasure‚Äù. Next to the Barbours Creek Wilderness, the area extends the wilderness opportunity to an upland oak forest managed mainly for bear. There is a good walk along Potts Mountain. The area is part of the Barbours Creek-Shawvers Run Cluster. ==Location and access== The area is located in the Appalachian Mountains of Southwestern Virginia, about 18 miles southwest of Covington, Virginia. Barbours Creek is on the south, Va 617 on the northwest, Va 621 on the northeast, and the James River Ranger District of the George Washington National Forest on the north and east. There are no designated trails in the area. A 1.1 mile section of an unimproved road, FDR 5036, the Potts Creek Jeep Road, is on the western edge of the area. A parking lot for access to the area is located at the intersection of Va 617 and Potts Creek Road. Boundary of the Barbours Creek addition as identified by the Wilderness SocietyThe boundary of the wildland, as determined by the Wilderness Society, is shown in the adjacent map. The outline on the map includes two areas: the Barbours Creek Wilderness Addition on the southeast; and the Toms Thumb wild area in the James River Ranger District on the west. Additional roads and trails are given on National Geographic Maps 788 (Covington, Alleghany Highlands). A great variety of information, including topographic maps, aerial views, satellite data and weather information, is obtained by selecting the link with the wild land's coordinates in the upper right of this page. Beyond maintained trails, old logging roads can be used to explore the area. The Appalachian Mountains were extensively timbered in the early twentieth century leaving logging roads that are becoming overgrown but still passable. Old logging roads and railroad grades can be located by consulting the historical topographic maps available from the United States Geological Survey (USGS). The Barbours Creek Wilderness Addition wildarea is covered by USGS topographic map Jordan Mines. ==Natural history== Brook troutThe area is within the Ridge and Valley Subsection of the Northern Ridge and Valley Section in the Central Appalachian Broadleaf Coniferous Forest-Meadow Province. Yellow poplar, northern red oak, white oak, basswood, cucumber tree, white ash, eastern hemlock and red maple are found in colluvial drainages, toeslopes and along flood plains of small to medium-sized streams. White oak, northern red oak, and hickory dominate on the north and west, while chestnut oak, scarlet oak and yellow pine are found on ridgetops and midslopes on the east. Wild natural trout streams in Virginia are classified by the Department of Game and Inland Fisheries by their water quality, with class i the highest and class iv the lowest.9VAC25-260-370. Classification Column.: 9VAC25-260-370. Classification Column., accessdate: June 18, 2017 Barboiurs Creek is a class ii stream. The area contains a small tract of old-growth trees, 140 years old or older. ==Topography== The landscape is distinguished by ridges that trend northeast/southwest. The ridges, composed of sandstone or shale, have parallel drainages flowing into broad limestone valleys. Pine Mountain is typical with small steep sideslope drainages. The highest elevation is 3355 feet along the crest of Pine Mountain and the lowest elevation of about 2260 feet is at Barbours Creek. Silurian-aged sandstone underlays about 75 percent of the area, with the remaining area underlain by Brallier and Martinsburg shale. ==Forest Service management== The Forest Service has conducted a survey of their lands to determine the potential for wilderness designation. Wilderness designation provides a high degree of protection from development. The areas that were found suitable are referred to as inventoried roadless areas. Later a Roadless Rule was adopted that limited road construction in these areas. The rule provided some degree of protection by reducing the negative environmental impact of road construction and thus promoting the conservation of roadless areas. Barbours Creek Wilderness Addition was inventoried in the roadless area review, and therefore protected from possible road construction and timber sales. The forest service classifies areas under their management by a recreational opportunity setting that informs visitors of the diverse range of opportunities available in the forest. The area is managed as ‚ÄúBlack Bear Habitat‚Äù. ==See also== Barbours Creek-Shawvers Run Cluster ==References== ==Further reading== * Stephenson, Steven L., A Natural History of the Central Appalachians, 2013, West Virginia University Press, West Virginia, . * Davis, Donald Edward, Where There Are Mountains, An Environmental History of the Southern Appalachians, 2000, University of Georgia Press, Athens, Georgia. . ==External links== * George Washington and Jefferson National Forest * Wilderness Society Category:George Washington and Jefferson National Forests Category:Southwest Virginia Category:Protected areas of the Appalachians Category:Mountains of Virginia ","title":"Barbours Creek Wilderness Addition"},{"id":"60373200","text":"The 2019 Women's EuroHockey Championship III was the eight edition of the Women's EuroHockey Championship III, the third tier of the women's European field hockey championships organized by the European Hockey Federation.

As a teenager, she received a prize for having the most perfect hands and arms in Louisville, Kentucky. Two years after that recognition, judges unanimously selected her as \\"the most beautiful woman in America\\" in a contest that had 10,000 entrants. ==Career== Worthing's professional acting debut came in What's in a Name?, soon after which she played in The Greenwich Village Follies of 1920 in New York. Following that production, she went to England to appear as \\"America's most Representative show girl\\" in a revue. She also performed in the 1921, 1922, and 1923 editions of Zigfeld Follies. Worthing's films included Janice Meredith, The Swan, Don Juan, Night Life of New York, Flower of the Night, Vanity, and Thumbs Down. ==Personal life== Worthing married businessman Jack McDonald in 1921, and they divorced in 1922. (Another source indicates that she secretly married McDonald in 1917.) In April 1922, she was treated at a hospital after taking poison that, according to her maid, she thought was headache tablets. A contemporary news report, however, said that friends described her as despondent and that a policeman said, \\"she stated she took poison because she was sick of living.\\" She also said that, after falling in love again, she had learned that her unidentified lover planned to marry another woman. In April 1927, Worthing was attacked in her home. The Los Angeles Times reported that her maid found her unconscious, \\"lying in a pool of blood, her nose broken, eyes discolored, one tooth knocked out and bruised about the body.\\" Her physician was Dr. Eugene Nelson, and a romantic relationship developed between doctor and patient. In June 1927 Nelson and Worthing married, which led to ostracism for her because he was African-American. When the couple emerged from a limousine for the opening of a play, the crowd greeted them rudely, and the reaction inside the theater was also unfriendly. Worthing later recalled \\"the ordeal of that night\\" as people she thought were friends treated her coldly. Before the marriage was two months old, Worthing entered voluntary bankruptcy, citing assets of $680 and liabilities of $19,086.62. She sought relief from her troubles via use of alcohol and drugs, and her relationship with Nelson grew sour until she filed for divorce, which was granted on May 26, 1932. While he awaited the outcome of the divorce hearing, Nelson sought an annulment on the grounds that the couple had not met Mexican requirements for a marriage prior to their wedding in Tijuana. He continued to plead his case after the divorce, and in January 1933 Worthing consented to a court order to have the divorce decree vacated and replaced by an annulment. During the hearing, Worthing interrupted her attorney's statement opposing the annulment to tell the court, \\"I have confidence in the doctor. I say, let him have the marriage annulled.\\" Worthing disappeared briefly in 1933 after she boarded a train in Los Angeles on June 15 to travel to Chicago and New York. Nelson reported her missing, and police could not find her, even after two people reported having seen her in Pasadena. Reappearing on June 19, she said that Nelson had asked her to marry him again, but he changed his mind and told her that she needed to go. She explained that she left the train in Pasadena because she didn't want to be sent away. ==Legal problems== A few months after the marriage ended, Nelson complained to the court that Worthing was spending his $12,000 alimony payment on narcotics. Subsequently she faced a court hearing on an insanity complaint by a friend who cited the actress's hallucinations and threats of suicide. Psychiatrists' testimony led the judge to commit her to a sanitarium, and that confinement was followed by a parole. Worthing was arrested in August 1933 when she was found using narcotics (a violation of her parole) in a Los Angeles apartment where she was living under as assumed name. In 1935, an arrest for public drunkenness in Ocean Park, California, led to her spending a night in jail before she was fined $5 and given a suspended 10-day jail sentence and one year's probation. More trouble arose in September 1939 when Worthing received a five-month sentence in the Los Angeles County jail for forging a narcotic prescription. Less than a year later, she surrendered to authorities, admitting additional forging of prescriptions for narcotics. ==Death== On August 25, 1948, Worthing died of barbiturate poisoning in a three-room house on a back lot in Hollywood, where she lived with a 39-year- old Filipino man. Scrapbooks filled with clippings of news stories that reported her successes and failures were found beside the bed in which she died. She was buried in Inglewood Park Memorial Cemetery. == References == Category:1905 births Category:1948 deaths Category:20th-century American actresses Category:American film actresses Category:American musical theatre actresses Category:American silent film actresses Category:American stage actresses Category:Broadway actors Category:Ziegfeld girls ","title":"Helen Lee Worthing"},{"id":"60373277","text":"High Jinks is a musical farce with music by Rudolf Friml and book and lyrics by Otto Harbach and Leo Ditrichstein, based on the farce Before and After by Leo Ditrichstein which was adapted from a French farce, Les Dragees d'Hercule, by Maurice Hennequin and Paul Bilhaud.

It tells the story of the editor of a lurid tabloid newspaper and a serial killer whose actions the paper reports on. After tryouts in Florida and Connecticut, The News premiered on Broadway on November 7, 1985. It received abysmal reviews and closed after just four performances. A 1986 production in London received a better response. == Synopsis== The stage is divided into three parts, with the newsroom in the center, Girl's bedroom on one side, and Killer's apartment on the other. The action takes place mostly in the newsroom of The Mirror, a fictional tabloid in an unnamed large city. Executive Editor tries to drive readership with sensational reporting and outrageous headlines, such as \\"Head Red Dead\\", and \\"Live Goat Found in Madonna's Stomach\\". He is an inattentive father to a 15-year-old, Girl, speaking to her only over the phone. Girl makes a connection with a mysterious man, Killer, through a series of personal ads (\\"Classifieds/Personals\\"). She makes an off-handed remark to Killer that someone should kill all the unethical figures who work in the media. Killer takes Girl's remark to heart and resolves to go on a killing spree (\\"Shooting Stars\\"). The staff at The Mirror are excited to cover the subsequent spate of murders. They hold a contest inviting readers to name the serial killer. Girl and Killer finally meet face to face. == Development == Paul Schierhorn wrote the music and lyrics for The News. The book was written by Schierhorn, R. Vincent Park and David Rotenberg, who also directed. The three had little or no experience on Broadway. Schierhorn and Rotenberg had met while studying at the Yale School of Drama. In an interview with The Globe and Mail before opening night, Rotenberg described the venture as a \\"gamble\\", with close to one million dollars invested in the show, and acknowledged that if reviews were bad, they might have to close the following day. == Productions == The show went through tryouts at the Burt Reynolds Jupiter Theatre in Jupiter, Florida. It later played for two weeks at the Westport Country Playhouse in Westport, Connecticut, starting September 24. The show began previews at the Helen Hayes Theatre on Broadway on October 18, 1985, opening on November 7 and closing November 9. In all, the show played 22 previews and 4 performances on Broadway. A year after its Broadway failure, another production was staged in London with a new cast, most notably Richard O'Brien as the Killer. The show opened on September 18, 1986 at the Paramount City theatre (formerly known as the Windmill Theatre, known for its nude revues), and ran for three weeks. Schierhorn was billed as \\"Paul Pulse\\" in the show's promotional materials. In 2002, Tulane University Theatre (where Schierhorn was then teaching in the drama department) staged what they described as the first American production of The News in 17 years. Schierhorn co-directed the production with choreographer Beverly Trask. === Original Broadway cast === * Cheryl Alexander ‚Äì Reporter * Frank Baier ‚Äì Circulation Editor * Jeff Conaway ‚Äì Executive Editor * Anthony Crivello ‚Äì Killer * Michael Duff ‚Äì City Editor * Jonathan S.

In The New York Times, Frank Rich wrote that \\"every minute of The News, as it happens, is agony\\". Writing for the Associated Press, Michael Kuchwara called the show \\"ludicrous and distasteful\\". Writing for New York magazine, John Simon described it as \\"a monstrosity so noxious and nauseating, so sophomoric and witless, so pretentious and pointless, and, above all, so LOUD, that past horrors seem to beckon from the oubliettes of memory\\". Critics disparaged virtually every aspect of the show. The set design was criticized as \\"unattractive\\" and \\"dingy\\", with Rich writing that the newsroom had been \\"inexplicably designed to resemble a sushi bar\\". Costumes were derided as cheap and ugly. Many reviewers found the plot confusing. The music was described as too loud and \\"aggressively screechy\\". Reviews were also critical of the cast, with Michaelis' portrayal of Executive Editor's 15-year-old daughter widely considered inept. Simon wrote that she looks \\"30 and appalling\\". Some faint praise was given to Crivello's portrayal of Killer, with Simon writing that he \\"at least tries for a genuine performance\\", and Kuchwara calling his song \\"Shooting Stars\\" the best of the evening. Some reviewers speculated that the show had combined its two acts into one after previews to prevent the audience from escaping during intermission. The News was nominated for Best Original Score at the 40th Tony Awards. The New York Times noted that the nominees were the only four productions eligible in the category that year. === London production === The London production received a positive review in The Times. Andrew Rissik wrote that the show combined two clich√©s (a cynical view of tabloid journalism, and a melodramatic story of \\"loneliness and broken dreams\\") into an \\"invigorating and enjoyable\\" product. He praised Richard O'Brien's performance as the Killer, writing that he \\"held the evening together\\" with his sinister stage presence. == References == Category:Broadway musicals Category:1985 musicals ","title":"The News (musical)"},{"id":"60373321","text":"Kentucky Route 538 (KY 538) is a state highway in Boyd County, Kentucky that runs from U.S. Route 60 and Meade Springer Road west of Rockdale to U.S. Route 23 south of Catlettsburg via Rockdale. ==Major intersections== ==References== 0538 Category:Transportation in Boyd County, Kentucky ","title":"Kentucky Route 538"},{"id":"60373336","text":"St. George's Castle (; , or Hizir kalesi) is an Ottoman fortification located in the city of Preveza, northwestern Greece. It was built in 1807, during the rule of Ali Pasha of Ioannina over the region (1806-1820), and it was constructed on plans drawn by the French engineer Fr√©d√©ric Fran√ßois Guillaume de Vaudoncourt (1772-1845).Nikos D. Karabelas, The fortifications of a strategic Passage [in Greek with English abstract], Prevezanika Chronika 53-54, Preveza, 2017. ==History== The castle was built in 1807, when the region was governed by Ali Pasha of Tepeleni, a semi-autonomous Ottoman ruler of Epirus. It was the first major architectural intervention of Ali Pasha in Preveza, after he recaptured it in late November 1806. F.F.Guillaume de Vaudoncourt. Ali Pasha pressed Fran√ßois Pouqueville, the French consul stationed in Ioannina, to send for officers and supplies from Napoleon‚Äôs troops, as he was particularly interested in securing military engineers who could assist in the construction of new fortifications in the region, and particularly at Preveza and the camps positioned against the Russian troops still stationed on Lefkada.Emily Neumeier, Trans-imperial encounter on the Ionian Sea: A French engineer's account of constructing Ottoman fortifications, in: Tessarae of Preveza's History Œ±ŒÑ, Preveza, 2018, pp. 11-54. The castle was initially called by the Ottomans Yeni kale (the new castle), but a few years later (around 1815) another castle took this name, as it was newer than the one we are talking about. The castle was afterwards named Hizir kalesi (the castle of the Green) or (the barracks castle).Nikos D. Karabelas, op. cit., pp. 89-90. The castle of St. George's in Preveza. Photograph by Fr√©d√©ric Boissonnas, May 1913. St. George's castle, as it was named after 1912, was designed by French engineers, who also oversaw the construction of the fort. It was constructed at the southern edge of Preveza in order to defend the narrow water channel leading from the Ionian Sea into the Gulf of Arta. For the construction, Ali Pasha hired two French military engineers; Captain Ponceton, and colonel Fr√©d√©ric Fran√ßois Guillaume de Vaudoncourt, to assist in the design and execution of the plan. He, also, brought in several hundreds of Greek workers and stonemasons from many areas of his territory, who worked by compulsory labour and without pay for the project, which was concluded in less than a year's time. It seems likely that Ali Pasha refused to realize de Vaudoncourt's proposed designs, thus taking all the credit for constructing the military works in Preveza.Emily Neumeier, op. cit., pp. 17-18. Based on the hand-written reports of the then colonel de Vaudoncourt we can precisely date the construction of the castle. The works started in February 1807 and were completed in the autumn of the same year.Emily Neumeier, op. cit., pp. 20-24. ==The castle today== The enclosure of St. George's castle, Preveza. Behind the cannon, the guardhouse above the main entrance of the castle. Photograph of c.1930. Today, the castle consists of a single enclosure protected by high polygonal bastions. As was typical for fortifications from this time, the walls of the enceinte were set at a slight angle so as to better deflect artillery fire. Although the majority of the original early nineteenth-century structure survives, some aspects of the fort‚Äôs defensive features have been modified to accommodate the fortification‚Äôs use by the Greek military into the twentieth century. For example, some of the battery platforms were excavated and the bastions were pierced to create better- protected casemates. Also, all service buildings within the enclosure appear to be completely of twentieth-century manufacture, with the exception of a small masonry building that leads down to a powder magazine. The main entrance to the fort is set at the north-eastern corner of the enclosure, facing the center of the town. Historic photographsFor the photographs, see: Spyros Sklavenitis & Nikos D.

The sixth mainline entry and a soft reboot of the Sakura Wars series, the game was released in 2019 in Asia and 2020 worldwide. It is the first Sakura Wars game not to be developed by Red Entertainment. The gameplay combines overlapping action role-playing, dating sim and visual novel elements. The base campaign was later expanded with downloadable content (DLC), adding further gameplay options such as additional costumes. The game takes place in a fictionalised version of the Taish≈ç period in 1940, where the World Luxury Operatic Federation fights against those who threaten peace around the world. Naval captain Seijuro Kamiyama is transferred to Tokyo, where he must lead the struggling Imperial Combat Revue through a worldwide tournament of Combat Revues and fight the demons once again. Development of Sakura Wars began in 2016 after a positive fan response at that year's Sega Fes convention. A combination of new and returning staff were involved in development; these include veteran Sega producer Tetsu Katano, director Tetsuya Otsubo, scenario director Takaharu Terada, music composer Kohei Tanaka, story writer Jiro Ishii, and scenario writer Takaaki Suzuki. Manga artist Tite Kubo designed the main cast, while guest artists handled the supporting cast. The cinematics were produced by Sanzigen. The game was announced at Sega Fes 2018. It is the first mainline entry in the series since Sakura Wars: So Long, My Love (2005). A manga adaptation is running in Young Jump. An anime television series sequel produced by Sanzigen premiered on April 3, 2020. Gameplay-based DLC was released between 2019 and 2020. Upon release, Sakura Wars received mixed reviews, praising the game for being welcoming to new players as well as for its mix of tactical and story-based gameplay, but criticising it for some story elements. ==Gameplay== An example of how the LIPS system is used in the game. In this shot, Kamiyama is being consulted by the rest of the Flower Division on how they can improve their acting. Sakura Wars is a cross-genre video game set in Tokyo during a fictionalized version of the Taish≈ç period. The player controls the main protagonist Seijuro Kamiyama and the all-female members of the Imperial Combat Revue's Flower Division, who must fight demons while participating in the Combat Revue World Games. Dubbed a \\"dramatic 3D action adventure\\" game, the player explores a fully 3-D version of Ginza, Tokyo usually through a third- person perspective on foot and talks to various characters to trigger main story events and side objectives. As in Sakura Wars: So Long, My Love, the world of Sakura Wars is rendered to scale relative to the characters in it; instead of a caricature of the character roaming around miniature maps, as found in the earlier Sakura Wars games, every area is represented proportionally. A variant of the Kinematron, called the Teletron, is a smartphone that allows Kamiyama to see a map of Ginza and speak with other characters. As with previous entries, the gameplay is split between adventure segments where Kamiyama explores Ginza and talks to the characters; and battle segments. A returning gameplay element is the traditional \\"Live & Interactive Picture System\\" (LIPS); during conversations, the player is presented with multiple choices to select within a time limit. What response the player selects directly affects Kamiyama's relationship with the protagonists and impacts their later performance in battle segments; Kamiyama's responses also affect supporting non-playable characters (NPCs). The version introduced in this game is \\"Analog LIPS\\", in which the player can move the camera around and highlight objects or people to trigger more dialogue. In one-on-one conversation segments, the player can move the cursor over background elements or the characters to trigger internal monologues and varying responses from the characters. Players may save their game automatically at the start of the adventure and battle parts of each chapter and manually during intermissions and while exploring, which also includes the statuses of the main heroines as well as supporting NPCs. Sakura Wars is the first entry in the main Sakura Wars series to use an action-based battle system. Instead of using a menu interface, the player selects commands directly mapped to the buttons on the controller. The Combat Revue World Games can be played for up to a maximum of three rounds. The player can select up to two characters to assist Kamiyama in the matches. During battle, each character has health points (HP) and magic points (MP). HP is depleted whenever a character is attacked. The game ends when all of the characters' HP levels reach zero, although the player can continue from the beginning of the battle or the last checkpoint. ==Synopsis== In 1930, two years after the events of So Long, My Love, the Great Demon War results in the annihilation of the Imperial and Paris Combat Revue's Flower Divisions and the New York Combat Revue's Star Division. With Earth at peace and the revues' actions becoming public, the World Luxury Operatic Federation (WLOF) is formed with several international divisions; a biennial Combat Revue World Games tournament has been organized. Ten years later in 1940, the Combat Revue's commander Sumire Kanzaki (Michie Tomizawa) recruits Imperial Japanese Navy ensign Seijuro Kamiyama (Yohei Azakami) to become the captain of the new Imperial Combat Revue's Flower Division in Tokyo, which consists of: Sakura Amamiya (Ayane Sakura), a swordswoman; Hatsuho Shinonome (Maaya Uchida), a shrine maiden; Anastasia Palma (Ayaka Fukuhara), a newly transferred Greek actress; Azami Mochizuki (Hibiku Yamamura), a ninja prodigy from the Mochizuki clan; and Clarissa \\"Claris\\" Snowflake (Saori Hayami), a Luxembourger noblewoman. The division once again faces a new demon invasion and participates in the upcoming tournament with Xiaolong Yang (Yuichiro Umehara) and Yui Huang (Sumire Uesaka) of the Shanghai Combat Revue, Arthur (Nobunaga Shimazaki) and Lancelot (Manami Numakura) of the London Combat Revue, and Elise (Nana Mizuki) and Margarete (Rie Kugimiya) of the Berlin Combat Revue‚Äìwhile trying to keep their home at the Imperial Theater open. However, as the tournament progresses, it is later revealed that the leader of the Federation, President G (Ryotaro Okiayu), is actually the demon Sotetsu Genan in disguise. Using his position, Genan steals the Imperial Sword, which is a special artifact Sakura Amamiya's mother Hinata (Mariko Kouda) sacrificed herself to create, which the previous Combat Revues used to seal themselves and the Archdemon away in Shadow Tokyo to end the Great Demon War. With the Imperial Sword now in his possession, Genan begins to use it to weaken the barrier between Tokyo and Shadow Tokyo so that he may revive the Archdemon and destroy the world. The Imperial, Shanghai, London, and Berlin Combat Revues work together to take back the Imperial Sword. With assistance from Sakura Shinguji (Chisa Yokoyama), Kamiyama is able to kill Genan while Sakura Amamiya uses the Imperial Sword to seal away Shadow Tokyo. With the threat finally over, the Combat Revues prepare for the World Pageant to celebrate peace. ==Development== The Sakura Wars series had been mostly inactive since the last mainline release, Sakura Wars: So Long, My Love, in 2005 (2010 internationally). Franchise owner Sega had decided to end the series in 2008, following the release of the spin-off title Dramatic Dungeon: Sakura Wars and a final concert performance by the cast of So Long, My Love. Scenario director Takaharu Terada would make yearly pitches to Sega, but these were repeatedly declined. At the 2016 Sega Fes in Tokyo, in response to a fan poll about dormant series, Sakura Wars was voted the most requested revival. While actual development had begun shortly before Sega Fes, the positive fan feedback gave the developers the boost they needed to begin full production. The staff included producer Tetsu Katano of Sonic the Hedgehog series fame and director Tetsuya Ootsubo. Katano was a newcomer to the series, but Ootsubo had previously worked with the series on Sakura Wars 3: Is Paris Burning?. Because much time had passed between So Long, My Love and the production of this new game, and both the platform and most of the team were different, it was decided that Sakura Wars would be a soft reboot. The game was developed by a team within Sega's CS Research & Development No. 2 division, which also includes Sonic Team. The basic gameplay was carried over, but extensively reworked and the world built entirely in 3D due to the greater hardware specs of the PlayStation 4. The game's engine was based on Hedgehog Engine 2, a proprietary first-party engine created by Sega for the Sonic the Hedgehog series. The cutscenes were crafted using techniques perfected for Sega's Yakuza series. Alongside the 3D conversion, the team worked to make transitions between different areas and between gameplay and cutscenes as seamless as possible. During production, internal staff who were fans of classic Sakura Wars would often be critical of the current team's work, putting pressure on them to create a product worthy of the series. The game features over 40 minutes of CGI cinematics produced by Sanzigen. All other cutscenes were created in real-time using the game's engine. While there were a new cast and development team, the series romanticized steampunk setting remained intact. The narrative was described as a \\"Sakura Wars-esque fantasy\\". Terada created the basic setting and scenario concept, the scenario draft was written by Jiro Ishii, while the main script was handled by Takaaki Suzuki. Ishii was contacted in 2016 by Sega. Ishii was initially sceptical about his skill to manage the project due to the Sakura Wars franchise's prestige. He accepted as the one who approached him was 428: Shibuya Scramble producer Koichi Nakamura; Ishii recognized that the challenge of Sakura Wars was equivalent to the relationship between 428: Shibuya Scramble and its predecessor Machi. During his work on the scenario, Suzuki offered suggestions to keep the game as historically accurate as possible. ===Character design=== The main characters and their weapons were designed by Tite Kubo, a manga artist best known for the shonen manga Bleach. Kubo had been suggested at an early stage, as the team wanted someone skilled at drawing traditional Japanese clothing for their characters. This wish traced back to the recurring protagonist archetype of a young Japanese woman in a kimono, first with Sakura Shinguji and then new female lead Sakura Amamiya. Kubo was contacted when full production began, and ended up not only designing the characters and weapons but made suggestions for the Koubu designs. Kubo described the character designs as difficult and fun as they did not follow his usual style. The characters were turned into 3D gameplay models by animator Masashi Kudou, who worked on the Bleach anime adaptation. Kubo vouched for Kudou originally, believing only he could carry over the character designs. The Koubu designs were made by regular series mecha designer Mika Akitaka. Other guest artists designed the supporting cast, with different anime artists for different Combat Revue teams and supporting characters. The artists included Yukiko Horiguchi (K-On!) for the Shanghai Combat Revue (Xiaolong Yang & Yui Huang), BUNBUN (Sword Art Online (as abec)) for the London Combat Revue (Arthur & Lancelot), Ken Sugimori (Pok√©mon) for the Grand Imperial Peanut, Fumikane Shimada (Girls und Panzer) for the Berlin Combat Revue (Elise & Margarethe), Noizi Ito (Haruhi Suzumiya) for Itsuki Saijo, and Shigenori Soejima (Persona) for Hakushu Murasame. While previous titles had used near-silent protagonists, as the 3D model would have more presence in player minds, it was decided that he should voice all his lines. Kamiyama's role was hard for Azakami, as due to the different LIPS responses he had five times more dialogue than any of the heroines. Sakura's role mirrored earlier principle heroines such as Sakura Shinguji and Gemini Sunrise, but with personality difference that would show her individuality despite emulating Shinguji's clothing and manners. Some characters, such as Sakura and Hatsuho, hearkened back to earlier Sakura Wars heroines while having altered personalities. Azami's loud clothing tied into both her personality and role in the narrative. Anastasia was intended to represent a mature and \\"sexy\\" archetype. Claris was included at Terada's insistence to fill the recurring \\"gentlewoman\\" archetype. Two notable returning actors were Chisa Yokoyama who voiced the character Yaksha, and Michie Tomizawa voicing returning character Sumire. Due to changes in their portrayal, recording for the two characters lasted longer than the other staff members. Yokoyama was contacted during early 2018 by Sega about taking part in the game, and was surprised at being asked to voice a new character. She originally refused as she felt the new Yasha could be played by another actress, as while physically identical to her character Sakura Shinguji she had a very different personality. Yokoyama eventually accepted, and worked with Sega to make the character more like the original Sakura. Sumire's role was originally written as being similar to Ayame Fujieda, a severe leader character from the first game, but as voice recording took place the characterization shifted. Tomizawa was initially anxious about reprising her role after reading the story outline, feeling almost like a traitor at being the only original member reprising a role, but was cheered up by Yokoyama's support. Due to input from Tomizawa, Sumire became a more mature version of her original self rather than a radically different character. ===Music=== Regular series composer Kohei Tanaka wrote the music. Because of his long association, Tanaka was happy to return and write for a new Sakura Wars game. When conceiving the project, the team decided firmly that the music was something that should not be changed, as it had helped maintain the series' popularity through stage shows and concerts in Japan during its dormancy. The developers aimed to have the largest number of vocal themes of any Sakura Wars game, ranging between 70 and 80. These included ensemble pieces and solo songs. The main theme was a reworked version of the series' recurring theme \\"Geki! Teikoku Kagekidan\\", titled and performed by Ayane Sakura, Maaya Uchida, Hibiku Yamamura, Ayaka Fukuhara and Saori Hayami. The theme was composed by Tanaka and arranged by Takayuki Negishi, with lyrics by series creator Oji Hiroi. The ending song, , was also composed by Tanaka, arranged by Negishi, written by Jiro Ishii and performed by Sakura, Uchida, Yamamura, Fukuhara, Hayami, Sumire Uesaka, Nana Mizuki and Manami Numakura. A vocal collection album, containing 14 tracks, was released by Wave Master in Japan on April 29, 2020, and a soundtrack album, containing the original score, was released on June 24, 2020. ==Release== A new Sakura Wars title was first announced in April 2018 under the title New Sakura Wars, also known in the west as Project Sakura Wars. The announcement stated that the game would \\"inherit the DNA\\" of the series. Its first public appearance was at Sega Fes 2019 in March of that year, to a positive fan response. The announcement of a Western release coincided with this, making Sakura Wars only the second Sakura Wars game to be localized at that time. Development at the time was placed at between 50% and 60% complete; all the scenario and basic systems were completed and voice recording was nearly finished, with the next phase being bringing together the various elements and polishing them for release. Speaking in a later statement, Sega said that they hoped to continue the series beyond Sakura Wars. A demo of Sakura Wars was released on November 21, 2019. The English localization was handled by Inbound Games and the French, German and Spanish localizations were handled by Keywords Studio; this was the first time a Sakura Wars title was localized in these languages. The game was released in Asia on December 12, 2019 and worldwide on April 28, 2020. Additional fixes to the game were made through a patch released on March 18, 2020 in Japan and concurrently with the worldwide release; it also included a tie-in to Sakura Wars the Animation. The Japanese release of the game was published in standard and deluxe editions. The deluxe edition included a five-disc CD collection containing songs from the main six Sakura Wars games as well as an artbook. Famitsu released a companion book: the Sakura Wars Complete Guide on February 21, 2020. It provides profiles of the characters and areas in Ginza, the complete story of Sakura Wars, details on the adventure and battle scenarios, and details on each location. Kadokawa Game Linkage released the Sakura Wars Story Setting Collections on March 30, 2020. It included interviews with the developers, detailed character profiles, storyboards and a collection of artworks and illustrations. Cosmetic and audio-based downloadable content (DLC) were released from December 2019 to January 2020 in Japan. ==Reception== Sakura Wars received \\"mixed or average\\" reviews from critics, according to Metacritic. Japanese gaming magazine Famitsu gave the game a score of 33 points out of 40. GameSpots Heidi Kemps praised the game's episodic format. Josh Torres of RPGFan felt that the t√™te-√†-t√™te feature was \\"misplaced or implemented in a slipshod fashion\\". Chris Moyse of Destructoid called the conversations \\"almost always a pleasure, rarely a chore\\" and the writing \\"very funny\\". Kimberly Wallace of Game Informer called the plot \\"outlandish\\", but praised the cast's performances. Kemps finds that the story compensates for the gameplay, saying \\"fun character interactions, and high-stakes melodrama help it overcome mediocre action sequences\\". ===Sales=== In Japan, Sakura Wars was ranked second place during its first-week sales behind Pok√©mon Sword and Shield, selling over 140,376 units. It was the highest-selling new release of the week. Second week sales in the region were 13,532, causing the game to drop to 15th place. As of January 2020, the game had sold nearly 174,500 units at retail. ===Accolades=== At the 2019 Japan Game Awards, Sakura Wars won the \\"Future Division\\" award. ==Media adaptations== ===Printed adaptations=== A manga adaptation of the game's main story started in Weekly Young Jump on September 12, 2019. The manga finished on June 25, 2020. The series follows the events of the story from the perspective of Sakura Amamiya with minor variations from the game. The series is drawn by Koyuri Noguchi, with two tank≈çbon volumes published as of April 2020. A light novel prequel, titled was written by Ayumu Mugi and released on December 19, 2019. Set in 1939, the novel focuses on the early lives of Sakura, Hatsuho, Claris, Azami and Anastasia during the formation of the new Flower Division. ===Anime=== An anime television series set one year after the game premiered on April 3, 2020 on Tokyo MX and BS11. The series is animated by Sanzigen and directed by Manabu Ono, with Ono and Tatsuhiko Urahata handling series composition, and Kohei Tanaka composing the music. Mika Pikazo, Masashi Kudo, Takuya Chanohara, and Tatsuya Fukushima are designing the characters. The main cast reprised their roles from the game. The series is licensed in North America by Funimation for a simulcast release, and in Southeast Asia by Medialink. ===Stage play=== A stage adaptation of the game was planned to run from March 5‚Äì8, 2020 at Sogetsu Hall. However, on February 26, 2020, Sega announced that the event would not take place because of the COVID-19 pandemic. ==References== ;Citations ;Notes ==External links== * * Category:2019 video games Project Sakura Wars Category:Sega video games Category:Action role- playing video games Category:Adventure anime and manga Category:Alternate history video games Category:Dating sims Category:Military in anime and manga Category:Military science fiction Category:Military science fiction video games Category:PlayStation 4 games Category:PlayStation 4-only games Category:Science fiction anime and manga Category:Science fiction video games Category:Seinen manga Category:Shueisha manga Category:Steampunk video games Category:Video games developed in Japan Category:Video games set in 1940 Category:Video games set in Tokyo Category:Video games with cel-shaded animation Category:Visual novels Category:Video games scored by Kohei Tanaka Category:Video game sequels ","title":"Sakura Wars (2019 video game)"},{"id":"60373472","text":"Coody is a surname of Irish origin.

The Alphorn is the ancestor of the big family of musical horns and historically has been used by sheepherders to aide in herd recall in the French Alps.

The Ynys Gybi ward elects three county councillors to the Isle of Anglesey County Council. The Ynys Gybi ward was created following the Isle of Anglesey electoral boundary changes in 2012, which created 11 multi-councillor wards from 40 single-councillor wards. The new ward replaced the former county wards of Kingsland, Maeshyfryd and Trearddur, which had each elected one county councillor. According to the 2011 UK Census the combined total population of Kingsland, Maeshyfryd and Trearddur was 6,039. ==Elections results == During the campaign of the inaugural May 2013 county elections, former Holyhead mayor Jeff Evans campaigned using the family caravan because of \\"the sheer size\\" of the 6-mile long ward. Evans succeeded in being elected as an Independent councillor, together with Plaid Cymru's Trefor Lloyd Hughes and another Independent, Dafydd Rhys Thomas. The turnout was 45.7%. At the May 2017 county elections, Councillor Jeff Evans lost his seat to the Labour Party's Arwel Roberts. Councillors Hughes and Thomas retained their seats. ==References== Category:2012 establishments in Wales Category:Holy Island, Anglesey Category:Wards of Anglesey ","title":"Ynys Gybi (electoral ward)"},{"id":"60373585","text":"Colloton is a surname.

She works in the diagnosis and treatment of prostate cancer at University College London. Her research on evaluating photodynamic therapy for prostate cancer, became the subject of her MD, which was completed in 2007, and led to the first completed randomised trial comparing focal treatment for prostate cancer with active surveillance. == Early life and education == St- George's Hospital Caroline Moore was born in Chester, and moved to Wombourne at the age of five. She was educated at St. Edmunds Catholic College before gaining admission to study medicine at St George's Hospital Medical School, London, from where she graduated in 1997. == Research and career == University College London After completing her early medical training in London, she gained membership of the Royal College of Surgeons, who subsequently awarded her a research fellowship. Her research began in 2002 on evaluating photodynamic therapy for prostate cancer. It became the subject of her MD, which was completed in 2007, and led to the first completed randomised trial comparing focal treatment for prostate cancer with active surveillance. Later, she published the first study using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to evaluate treatment in early prostate cancer. Moore started using MRI to detect prostate cancer in men who would not need treatment, and found that if biopsies were performed before MRI scans the images were blurred.Moore, Caroline 10 July 2018 In October 2012 she established a committee on Standards in Reporting in MRI-targeted biopsy (START). The recommendations included reporting histologic results of standard cores using Gleason scores and maximum core cancer length, as well as reporting the recruitment criteria, radiologist experience and population biopsy status of a particular trial. She has worked on a combination of multi-parametric MRI and cognitive fusion transperineal biopsy, which can reduce the time taken diagnose and treat diseases. She has found that using MRI can reduce the need for biopsies by 28%. In 2019, her MRI protocols were approved by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE), and incorporated into national guidance for the investigation of men suspected of having clinically localised prostate cancer. Moore has developed electronic psychometric patient-reported outcome measures to monitor men who have had radical prostatectomy. Men who have this surgery can suffer from urinary leakage and difficulties with erections. The survey allows researchers to track their progress and share information with their surgical teams. Moore has been among a group of researchers spread across six hospitals who have been investigating high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) as a treatment for prostate cancer. Five years after treatment with HIFU the cancer survival rate is 100%, the same as for the more traditional methods of surgery and radiotherapy, but with fewer side-effects. She has been Head of Urology at University College London, within the Division of Surgical and Interventional Sciences since 2018. She was senior author on the Prostate Evaluation for Clinically Important Disease: Sampling Using Image Guidance or Not? (PRECISION) study comparing standard prostate biopsy and MRI- targeted biopsy. In 2019 Moore was the first woman in the United Kingdom to be made a Professor of Urology. Her research has been supported by Prostate Cancer UK, the Movember Foundation, the Cancer Vaccine Institute, the National Institute for Health Research, the European Association of Urology Research Foundation, the Wellcome Trust and the Department of Health. ==Other roles== She serves on the board of the European Association of Urology Research Foundation.

She was active in the Baltic and was lost there in 1917. ==Design== Bars was ordered under the 1913 Programme for the Baltic Fleet, and was laid down at the Baltic shipyard in St. Petersburg. She was powered by diesel/electric propulsion, though a shortage of diesel engines meant the boats were equipped with a variety of machinery, as it became available. Armament, too, varied as to availability; Bars was armed with 2 x 63mm guns, as opposed to the single 63mm and single 37mm gun she was designed for.Conway p316 The design originally had external torpedoes as well as internal torpedo tubes; these were carried in drop-collars in recessed niches low in the hull. Trials with Bars showed these to be unsuitable and subsequent vessels had the niches and drop-collars moved to the upper deck; Bars was later refitted to this pattern, before their ultimate complete removal.

By the decree of Empress Anna Ioannovna of July 29, 1731, the Senate was ordered to establish a cadet corps. Menshikov Palace on Vasilyevsky Island was transferred to the placement of the school. The opening took place on February 28, 1732First cadet corps opened // Official city tourist portal of St. Petersburg: on this day there were 56 cadets. When in June the number of cadets was already 352, they were divided into three companies. The first graduation took place on June 8, 1734: all 11 graduates were promoted to ensignsOver 110 years of the corps, by February 1832, 6388 cadets were graduated.. The first teachers were accepted without any test; since 1736, the best students began to be involved in teachingSince the end of 1736, mathematics has been defined to teach cadets by Corporal Ivan Remezov and Dmitry Yakhontov.. ==Education system== Initially, the corps was conceived for the training of the military, but due to the lack of educational institutions, it began to train civilian officials. This was due to a set of disciplines: simultaneously with the military sciences languages were taught: German, French, Latin, \\"oratorio\\" and others. Teachers at school rarely explained the material, reducing learning to memorizing sections. This system changed in 1766, when Ivan Betskoy, who headed the corps, compiled the \\"Charter of the Land gentry Cadet Corps for the upbringing and training of the noble Russian youth\\". Instead of dividing the cadets into companies, a division into five ages was introduced. Only children of 5-6 years of age were accepted, whose training was to last 15 years. The youngest age was under female supervision, and starting from the 4th age, pupils shared, \\"at will or by inclination\\", to prepare for military or civil services. Each age consisted of five sections. In these departments, both noble children and gymnasium students (children of commoners) studied together. High school students studied on an equal footing with the Cadets. In the corpus, theatrical art, dance, music were studied, while military disciplines were not among the priority ones. As a result, a situation emerged that Semyon Vorontsov estimated as follows: A fundamental change occurred in 1794, when the corps was headed by Mikhail Kutuzov, who reorganized according to the instructions of Emperor Paul I. Instead of five ages, companies were introduced ‚Äì four musketeers and one grenadier. All civilian teachers were replaced by officers. Tactics and military history classes were introduced, which were conducted not only with pupils, but also with officers. ===Names=== *from 1732 to 1743 ‚Äì Knight Academy; *from 1743 to 1766 ‚Äì Land cadet corps;

Through smart charging, the charging stations may monitor, manage, and restrict the use of charging devices to optimize energy consumption. Comparing with uncontrolled charging, smart charging will flatten the electricity usage peak by shifting the peak due to vehicle charging away from the peak due to other consumption. Smart charging can be divided into two charging management systems, User- managed charging (UMC) and Supplier-managed charging (SMC). For UMC, a Time- of-Use tariff is applied, and the customer decides the timing to charge based on the price and needs. The EV charging profile under Time-of-Use tariff is off-peak EV charging, is an abrupt rise in charging load at the time where the electricity pricing goes down. Comparing to peak EV charging profile caused by uncontrolled charging, UMC will delay the peak charging load formation to a specific later time, usually between 9:00 pm and 10:00 pm, depending on electricity pricing regulation. In SMC, the charging and discharging decision is made based on multiple signals: real-time energy production, local energy consumption, as well as the state of charge information from nearby EVs and other electric devices. A gradual rise in the charging load can be observed within the off-peak hours. Ideally, the EV charging peak is self-adjustable to fit the real-time electricity demand gap at off-peak hours. == Smart charging Implementation == V1G In UMC systems, electricity pricing with respect to time is a simple form of incentive. EV owners can only get rewarded by adjusting the timing of charging and the rate of charging. This is considered a unidirectional control of vehicles (V1G). V2G Through SMC networks, in addition to charging decisions, the EVs can also discharge to meet local electricity needs or to mitigate the pressure on electricity demand during peak hours. V2G is a smart charging implementation where the utility/transmission system is capable of purchasing energy from customers, usually during peak hours. Discharging provides extra flexibility to the grid by extending the power range and may shave the peak in electricity production.IRENA (2019), Innovation outlook: Smart charging for electric vehicles, International Renewable Energy Agency, Abu Dhabi. == Smart Charging features == ===Energy efficiency=== Smart charging transfers a portion of the peak load to off-peak hours. The predictability of energy demand is also improved because of the capability to use V2G as a backup. Study shows that a smoother and more predictable energy demand curve will boost the proportion of green energy in total energy production. ===Liability=== A survey on customer responses to electricity prices in Shanghai shows that, if the peak/off-peak pricing ratio is 2:1, 75% of the customers will adjust their charging pattern to charge off-peak. The percentile reaches 90% if the pricing ratio is 6:1. == Criticisms and Concerns == A survey in the UK on the acceptance rate of UMC versus SMC shows that current and former EV owners are twice more likely to adopt to UMC than SMC. Perceptions among Actual and Potential Plug-in Electric Vehicle Adopters in the United Kingdom) Some of the general concerns are addressed below. ===Damage due to redundant and incremental charging=== Studies have proved that fragmental charging will have minimal effect on battery lifetime if the battery state of charge is kept at 70-80%. However, the charging habit survey suggests the majority of the EV owners will ‚Äútop-up‚Äù their vehicle to full charge every day. ===Difficulty to foresee future trips=== Another issue is that by adopting to SMC, the battery percentage at every use becomes unclear. This subsequently restrains the flexibility in trips. Possible solutions include improved battery capacity and alternative charging paths. ===Accelerated charging pressure in car-sharing society=== Studies have shown that car sharing will lead to a reduction in private vehicle use with a low occupancy rate.Santi, P., 2017. Interview However, as the average vehicle use time increase, the parking/charging time will drop. This will bring a challenge to the charging power. == Government Promotions == The United Kingdom Government has mandated that: \\"All government funded home chargepoints for electric vehicles must use innovative ‚Äòsmart‚Äô technology from July 2019. This means chargepoints must be able to be remotely accessed, and capable of receiving, interpreting and reacting to a signal. Smart charging can also reduce high peaks of electricity demands, minimising the cost of electric vehicles to the electricity system ‚Äì and keeping costs down for consumers by encouraging off-peak charging.\\"HM Government news release published 14 December 2018 ==Future == ===Alternatives to cable charging=== In a mature smart charging system, the public charging infrastructure should be commercially sustainable. Charging stations locations, cost and the ability to respond to demand shift (i.e. the charging/ discharging power) are the limiting factors. Alternative charging paths can be considered to reduce the costs, spaces and power output associated with charging stations. ===Continuous charging=== Continuous charging consists of inductive and conductive charging. Conductive charging uses a charging board to transfer energy. A built-in receiver is required to receive power. Metal contact can be made possible by setting up a chargeable road. Inductive charging uses an electromagnetic field to transfer energy through electromagnetic induction. ===Battery Swapping=== As the name suggests, battery swapping eliminates the time to wait for charging at the stations. == See also == * ISO 15118 * IEC 61851 * IEC 63110 * Open Charge Point Protocol == References == Category:Electric vehicle technologies ","title":"Smart charging"},{"id":"60373837","text":"Ousley is an unincorporated community in Lowndes County, in the U.S. state of Georgia. ==History== The community was named after Joseph and William H.

Amiri's work has been exhibited in Canada in cities including Halifax, Vancouver, Toronto and Lunenburg. Internationally, her work has appeared in New York, London, Hong Kong, Italy, France, Morocco and Venice. ==Early life and education== Hangama Amiri was born in Kabul, Afghanistan. She and her family became refugees when she was six, leaving because of the Taliban in 1996. Over the next few years, they lived in Pakistan, Iran, and Tajikistan. As a high school student in Tajikistan, Amiri submitted an early painting, ‚ÄúTwin Buddhas‚Äù, to a competition held by the UN Refugee Agency (UNHCR), winning a first prize. The painting dealt with the reconstruction of the Buddhas of Bamyan, which were destroyed by the Taliban in March 2001. The prize enabled Amiri to attend Olimov College of Art in Dushanbe, Tajikistan. She received a Bachelor in Fine Arts from Olimov College in 2005. Her family settled in Nova Scotia, Canada in 2005. Amiri attended Nova Scotia College of Art and Design in Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada. In 2012, she graduated from NSCAD with a second Bachelor in Fine Arts degree. A visit to Afghanistan in 2010 inspired her series of paintings \\"The Wind-Up Dolls of Kabul\\". Work from this series was shown during the 2013 Passion for Freedom Festival in a gallery in London, England. In 2013, Amiri held a residency in Lunenburg, Nova Scotia. In 2015, Amiri was selected to receive a Fulbright Canada grant to attend Yale University in New Haven, Connecticut. In 2017, Amiri was an Artist-in-Residence at the Lunenburg School of the Arts in Nova Scotia. In 2019, Amiri was an Artist-in-Residence at Long Road Projects in Jacksonville, Florida. As of fall 2018, she entered the master's program at the Yale School of Art as a Fulbright Fellow. ==Works== Much of Amiri's work is figurative and focuses on cross-cultural dialogue, women's rights, and feminism. Many of her pieces deal with the treatment of women in Afghanistan, in particular the infringements of their human rights. Her series ‚ÄúMemory Diary‚Äù, small paintings on wood, explores childhood memories of Afghanistan. More recently, she has completed two landscape projects. The first group of works, At the Edge of the Shore was exhibited in 2013 in Lunenburg, Nova Scotia, a UNESCO World Heritage Site. In 2017, Amiri completed a second residency there, again focusing on landscapes. ==References== Category:Artists from Nova Scotia Category:Afghan emigrants to Canada Category:NSCAD University alumni Category:Year of birth missing (living people) Category:Living people ","title":"Hangama Amiri"},{"id":"60374156","text":"The Greatest Hits is a compilation album by the band Earth, Wind & Fire issued in 2010 on Sony Music.

Rwanda hoped to depose Laurent-D√©sir√© Kabila and install a government more favorable to Rwanda's interests by quickly taking control of Kinshasa and the strategic western province of Bas-Congo (today Kongo Central). On August 4, 1998, joint Rwandan and Ugandan forces launched a surprise attack on Kitona airbase in Western Congo using hijacked civilian airliners. While initially successful in taking control of major ports and infrastructure, Zimbabwean and Angolan intervention prevented the Rwandans and Ugandans from taking control of Kinshasa. The invading forces were forced to withdraw to the jungles of Angola until they were evacuated by air to Rwanda ending December 24, 1998. Today the operation is studied for its daring initial aerial assault, as well as the intelligence failures on the Rwandan side. == Prelude == In the aftermath of the First Congo War, Rwanda and other allied groups had installed Laurent-D√©sir√© Kabila in May 1997 as leader of the newly renamed Democratic Republic of the Congo. In turn, Kabila appointed many Rwandans as key officials in his new government and armed forces; including James Kabarebe who served as the Congolese army Chief of Staff. For over a year Rwandan soldiers and officials supported the Kabila Government, using the influence to export numerous raw materials to Rwanda. By mid-1998, internal ethnic tensions convinced Kabila that Rwandan influence was a threat to his power. On July 13, he removed all Rwandans from government positions and on July 27 ordered all remaining RPA and UPDF soldiers to leave the country. Kabila replaced these losses with friends, local militias, and surviving Hutu G√©nocidaires. Banyamulenge (Congolese Tutsis) were also removed from power as they were thought to be Rwandan sympathizers. These actions angered many in the Rwandan government, as it posed a threat to their influence in the Congo as well as the safety of Tutsis in both the DRC and Rwanda. Paul Kagame, Rwandan Minister of Defence, concerned of these outcomes for months, had begun drawing up plans for a second invasion of the Congo in April 1998. After his return to Kigali, Kabarebe proposed a plan intended to swiftly depose Kabila to Kagame, who quickly accepted and began preparations for the attack. === Rwandan plans === Kabarebe proposed flying Rwandan troops over 1,900 km (1,200 miles) to Kitona Air Base in western Congo, only 320 km (200 miles) from Kinshasa. Here they would be able to take control of the economically important Bas-Congo province, home to Congo's only seaports, as well as the Inga Dams, the main source of electricity for western Congo. In the ensuing chaos, they would then march to Kinshasa, depose Kabila, and install another Pro-Rwandan regime. Kabarebe's experience in the Congo convinced him that various local dissidents, from interned Banyamulenge to ex-FAZ soldiers, would join the Rwandans and help swiftly depose the Kabila government. === Opening moves in Goma === On August 2 in Goma, Congolese General Sylvain Mbuki took control of a local radio station, announcing his intention to overthrow Kabila. The following day, Rwandan HCU commandos took control of Goma International Airport, hijacking four civilian aircraft, 2 Boeing 727s and 2 Boeing 707s, sitting on the runway. On August 4, the commandos were then joined by more Rwandan and Ugandan soldiers, including a Ugandan light artillery unit, numbering over 500 soldiers in total. The pilots were then ordered at gunpoint to fly west to Kitona Air Base. == Initial successes == === Landing in Kitona === 9Q-CDLM, one of the 727s used in the initial attack on Kitoma Air Base. On the morning of August 4, the two 727s landed first, using their airstairs to discharge the HCU commandos as the aircraft were still taxiing. The lightly defended Kitona Air Base was quickly captured, and the remaining two 707s then landed and offloaded their troops and supplies. The four aircraft continued to fly between Kitona and Rwanda, and by August 5 over 3,000 Rwandan and Ugandan troops had been airlifted into Kitona. After the airfield was secured, Kabarebe convinced and bribed local Congolese army units to join his invasion force. These new recruits added over 2,000 Congolese Rebels, as well as Type 59 and Type 62 tanks and ZU-23 anti-aircraft cannons. === Actions on the coast === Inga I, one of the Inga Dams, a key early target of the operation. This force quickly overwhelmed local Congolese forces loyal to Kabila. By August 5, the nearby oil infrastructure at Moanda and the port of Banana had been captured. Widespread rape and looting ensued in areas occupied by the Rwandans. August 7 saw the capture of Boma, 100 km (62 miles) inland of Kitona. On August 10, Matadi, Congo's most important seaport fell to the invaders. Three days later on August 13, the Inga Dams, a key early objective of the operation, were secured. Immediately upon arrival, Kabarebe ordered the turbines shut down, completely cutting off power to the city of Kinshasa. === Chaos in Kinshasa === 226x226px By this point, Kabila's government was in chaos; Kinshasa was cut off from the outside world and without power, portions of eastern Congo were under Rebel control, and well armed Rwandan troops were only 230 km (145 miles) from Kinshasa. This caused panic among the government and general population throughout Kinshasa. Kabila's government and media outlets called upon the population to mobilize to protect the capital and root out those disloyal to the regime. Banyamulenge, Tutsis, political opponents, as well as ordinary citizens believed to be enemies were subject to property seizures, imprisonment, rape, torture, and summary execution. == Foreign intervention == === Zimbabwean intervention === Drawing of an Alouette III of the Air Force of Zimbabwe, as deployed in Congo in 1998. As a gunship helicopter, it is armed with two .30 machine guns. Kabila had been in talks with Zimbabwe since before the outbreak of war, and on August 4 Robert Mugabe, the president of Zimbabwe, and Kabila signed a military cooperation treaty. On August 8 a contingent of Zimbabwean SAS led by Air Marshal Perrance Shiri arrived at N'Djili Airport outside of Kinshasa. This action, code-named Operation Sovereignty Legitimacy, marked the start of Zimbabwean involvement in the Second Congo War. By August 12, over 800 Zimbabwean Paratroopers and several Cascavel armored cars had been airlifted to Kinshasa. Kabila continued his pleas for aid from South African Development Community, and on August 17 Zimbabwe and Namibia agreed to support his efforts to combat the various threats to his regime. Angola remained supportive, but refrained from entering the war, while South Africa urged further talks. Zimbabwean reinforcement efforts intensified, and by August 22, Zimbabwean troops at N'Djili totaled over 800 ground troops, ground support, and pilots, 15 Cascavels, 8 Fighter and light attack aircraft, and over a dozen Alouette III and AB 412 helicopters configured for both gunship and transport use. === Rwandan setbacks === While Kabila was searching for allies, Kabarebe continued his advance towards Kinshasa. On August 11, Rwandan forces were ambushed before they could begin an attack on Kasangulu, 45 km (28 miles) south of Kinshasa. By August 17 the main Rwandan force had advanced as far as Kinsielele, 30 km (18 miles) south of Kinshasa, using country roads before running out of fuel. From this point onward, the Zimbabwean air support proved invaluable, as the Rwandans were relatively ill-equipped to defend themselves from aerial attacks. In this regard they depended entirely upon the FAC mutineer's ZU-23 guns, which they lacked experience in operating. This proved particularly devastating on August 24, when the Rwandan Tanks were spotted by a ZAF helicopter outside of Kasangulu. The lead tank was disabled, giving Zimbabwean paratroopers time to set up an ambush further along the road. In the ensuing skirmish, several of the captured tanks were destroyed, and most of the rest captured. The Rwandans were now delayed several kilometres outside Kinshasa, with little remaining armor and under constant threat of Zimbabwean air attack. === Angolan intervention === Angolan Army Personnel, with equipment similar to that in use in 1998. Before beginning the operation, Rwandan intelligence had indicated Angola had no intention of assisting Kabila's regime. Under Kabila, the Congo had sheltered members of UNITA, an insurgent group in conflict with the MPLA since Angola's independence from Portugal. While this information was accurate with respect to many in the Angolan Army, Jos√© Eduardo dos Santos, the President of Angola, remained a friend of Kabila. On August 22, a force of 2,500 Angolans entered the Congo, retaking Kitona the following morning. The Rwandan rear guard continued to fight however, with Banana and Moanda holding out until the 28th. Once recaptured, these cities were once again subject to rape and looting by the victorious Angolan troops. It is widely believed that Kabila's regime would not have survived the operation without Angolan Intervention. == The battle for Kinshasa == A ZAF Hawk similar to those used in the defense of N'Djili Airport While cut off from the coast and reinforcements, Kabarebe was still in command of nearly 15,000 troops in high spirits on the outskirts of Kinshasa. Instead of attacking along the Kasangulu road a third time, Kabarebe realized the Zimbabweans at N'Djili were both outnumbered and the only real support for the Kabila government, given the unreliable performance of the remaining FAC troops. Zimbabwean Major-General Mike Nyambuya realized this and on August 25 deployed numerous SAS teams across the outskirts of Kinshasa with the aim of delaying the Rwandan advance. While these were initially effective, on the 26th FAC mutineers disguised as retreating FAC soldiers still loyal to Kabila managed to slip into the city. One of these groups headed for N'Djili Airfield, where they managed to get within 100m of the airport before being found out and gunned down by the Zimbabwean troops guarding it. The second wave of Rwandans and FAC mutineers managed to overwhelm the defenders, and the Rwandans captured the western end of the runway as well as the main terminal and hangars. The control tower and eastern end of the runway remained in Zimbabwean hands. From here all remaining ZAF helicopters and jets were made airborne. They continuously pounded the Rwandan positions throughout the city for the remainder of the day. That afternoon two ZAF helicopters extracted Kabila from the presidential palace who was then flown to safety in Lubumbashi. Sporadic fighting continued throughout Kinshasa for the remainder of the 26th. On the morning of August 27 Kabarebe deployed his remaining tanks and anti-aircraft guns in a final attempt to capture the rest of the airfield. Throughout the day ZAF aircraft flew continuous sorties, taking off from the north side of the runway under Zimbabwean control, bombing the Rwandan positions on the south side, then returning to be refueled and rearmed. At the peak of the fighting, average turnaround for the aircraft was reduced to less than five minutes. Due to the constant attack from the air and determined defense of the remainder of the airfield, the first Rwandan assault was unable to take any ground. A second attack later in the afternoon also failed and resulted in the loss of all remaining tanks and anti-aircraft guns. Nyambuya ordered a counterattack to retake the airfield early on the 28th which encountered heavy resistance. Eventually the Rwandans were dislodged and forced to retreat to the Kimbanseke and Masina neighborhoods where they had prepared trenches and other defensive works throughout the previous few days. Two days of trench warfare ensued until August 30, when Kabarebe and the remaining Rwandan and Ugandan troops abandoned the FAC mutineers, and fled south into the Jungle. This marked the end of organized fighting for Kinshasa and Operation Kitona. == Kabarebe's retreat == Kabarebe's forces were now in a difficult position; they were nearly 1,500 km (930 miles) from the nearest allied forces in Kivu and surrounded on three sides. To the west lay Kitona, which was now under the control of the Angolans who were now headed towards Kinshasa, north was the Congo River which Kabarebe was unable to cross due to a lack of boats, and east lay 1,500 km of jungle and the Congolese Army. As a result, they headed south towards Angola and friendly UNITA forces. September 1, Angolan troops with support from Zimbabwean SAS commandos finally recaptured the Inga Dams, who's Ugandan defenders slipped away to rendezvous with the remaining Rwandan attack force. By this point Kabarebe had identified an airfield outside the Angolan town Maquela do Zombo which was defended by over 400 Angolans. The Rwandan troops took time to regain strength and in mid- September launched an attack on the airfield with the assistance of local UNITA insurgents, quickly taking control of it. The runway however was too short, and needed to be lengthened in order to allow large cargo planes to land to complete the evacuation. For the next two months, Kabarebe's men worked on lengthening the runway from 1,400m to 1,800m. During this period they also fended off numerous Angolan attacks, including one consisting of over 26 armored vehicles. Once the runway was lengthened transports undertook over 30 flights to evacuate the remaining Rwandans and Ugandans by cover of darkness. By December 24, all remaining Rwandans and Ugandans, numbering around 3,000, had returned to Rwanda. == Aftermath == James Kabarebe in 2012. Following Kabarebe's retreat, Congolese, Zimbabwean, and Angolan troops spent much of the next few months re-establishing order throughout western Congo. In the ensuing violence thousands of suspected rebels were raped, tortured, and killed. The remaining ~12,000 FAC mutineers either fled into the Jungle, switched sides again, or were killed outright. Three years after the Rwandan failure to depose Laurent-D√©sir√© Kabila, he was assassinated by his own bodyguards on 16 January 2001. He was succeeded by his son, Joseph. Although powers on both sides expected the conflict to end shortly after the operation failed, Operation Kitona served as the opening act to the Second Congo War, which would continue for another 5 years and claim more than 5 million lives. Although a total defeat for the Rwandans, James Kabarebe would become a national hero in Rwanda for his leadership during the offensive. The operation is also studied at military colleges throughout the world for its innovative use of airborne infantry, and for its intelligence failures; chiefly the Rwandans mistaken belief that Angola would not support Kabila's Government. == References == Category:Second Congo War Category:Aircraft hijackings in Africa Category:Airborne operations Category:August 1998 events Category:Conflicts in 1998 ","title":"Operation Kitona"},{"id":"60374323","text":"Brecc Evans (born September 6, 1999) is an American soccer player who plays as a defender for USL Championship club North Texas SC. ==Career== ===Professional=== In February 2019, Evans signed a two-year deal with North Texas SC ahead of their inaugural season after just one year at Cal Poly.

Starring Julian and Claire McDowell, the photoplay was produced by the Bluebird Photoplays and released on December 15, 1916, by Universal. ==Plot== The film is a retelling of Charles Dickens' A Christmas Carol, recounting the story of Ebenezer Scrooge, played by Rupert Julian. Scrooge is an elderly miser and curmudgeon. Alone in his room on Christmas Eve, he is visited by the ghost of his former business partner Jacob Marley Harry Carter. Marley‚Äôs ghost tells Scrooge three spirits will visit him over the next three nights. Scrooge's first visit is by the Ghost of Christmas Past (Wadsworth Harris). The Ghost shows Scrooge's development from a young boy to a young man. He sees how he started to become a miser. Then, the Ghost of the Christmas Present (Richard L'Estrange) appears, who shows Scrooge how the Cratchit family has fared. He finds out, unless the future changes, the Cratchit's disabled son, Tiny Tim (Frankie Lee), will die. The last spirit Scrooge meets is the Ghost of Christmas Yet to Come (Tom Figee). This figure shows Scrooge scenes of people discussing someone's death. Nobody in the room seems concerned about the dead person. Scrooge doesn't know who the dead man is. Then, he finds out Tiny Tim has also passed. Next, Scrooge discovers he is the man whose death is celebrated. He vows to change his ways and become a new person. Finally, Scrooge wakes up at home and finds out all the spiritual visits happened one night. He also finds out today is Christmas Day. Each visit positively changed Scrooge; he transforms into a kinder, gentler man full of Christmas spirit. ==Cast== :{ ! style=\\"width: 180px; text-align: left;\\" Actor ! style=\\"width: 230px; text-align: left;\\" Role - style=\\"text- align: left;\\" Rupert JulianEbenezer Scrooge - John CookBob Cratchit - Claire McDowellMrs. Cratchit - Frankie LeeTiny Tim - Harry CarterJacob Marley - Emory JohnsonFred, Scrooge's Nephew - Francelia BillingtonScrooge's Sweetheart - Lydia Yeamans TitusMrs. Fezziwig - Wadsworth HarrisThe Ghost of the Past - Richard L'EstrangeThe Ghost of the Present - Tom FigeeThe Ghost of the Future - Roberta WilsonCaroline - } File:The Fire Flingers (1919) 1.jpgRupert Julian File:Claire McDowell 01.jpgClaire McDowell File:Frederick, Pauline - Bonds of Love - scene 1919.jpgFrankie Lee File:Harry Carter - The Kentucky Derby (1922).jpgHarry Carter File:Emory Johnson 32.jpgEmory Johnson File:Francelia Billington 1.jpgFrancelia Billington File:Lydia Yeamans Titus NYPL.JPGLydia Yeamans Titus File:Wadsworth Harris.jpgWadsworth Harris ==Preservation status== According to the Library of Congress website, no copies survive. ==ReferencesCategory:1916 films Category:1910s Christmas films Category:1916 drama films Category:American silent feature films Category:American black-and-white films Category:American Christmas films Category:Films based on A Christmas Carol Category:Silent films Category:Universal Pictures films Category:American films ","title":"The Right to Be Happy"},{"id":"60374344","text":"Morris Lolar (born February 18, 1970) is an American gridiron football coach and former player.

In 1951, while a student at Duquesne University, he and his advisor Peter Pauson discovered the compound ferrocene by accident, while trying to prepare fulvalene. Their discovery revolutionized chemistry and created organometallic chemistry as a separate discipline. Between 1957 and 1967, at least, he was working as a research chemist for DuPont in Delaware. His published research includes the addition reaction of phenols with ethylene,, the chemistry of allene (propadiene, ), the synthesis of diazaquinones, the co-dimerization of monoalkenes and conjugated dienes. He also filed a patent on synthesis of biciclooctenones in 1957, one on diazaquinones in 1960, and one on extrudable alkene copolymers in 1968. ==References== \\"Thomas Joseph Kealy\\".

Her work combines cultural anthropology with environmental studies, and focuses on the relationship between human communities and their physical environments. Strang's publications include the books What Anthropologists Do , Gardening the World, and The Anthropology of Sustainability: Beyond Development and Progress. == Background == Strang completed her masters at Oxford between 1991 and 1994, which culminated in the publication of Uncommon Ground: cultural landscapes and environmental values (Berg 1997). Between 1994 and 1997, Strang was employed at the Institute of Social and Cultural Anthropology and the Pitt Rivers Museum, while continuing her studies at Oxford's Environmental Change Institute. In 2000, Strang received an award for the Royal Anthropological Institute Fellowship in Urgent Anthropology. She moved to Australia shortly after this and worked closely with Australian and New Zealand communities, holding positions at the Auckland University of Technology and the University of Auckland. Her focus on the sociocultural understandings and use of water resources deepened during this time, and she published Gardening the World; agency, identity, and the ownership of water in 2009. Strang has been living in the UK since 2012, and served Chair of the Association of Social Anthropologists of the UK and the Commonwealth from 2012 to 2017. == Scholarship == Much of Strang's work focuses on the sociocultural value and perception of water resources. Her second major publication, The Meaning of Water, introduced this theme in 2004; she has since worked on multiple projects that examine the relationship between specific communities and nearby water bodies. Strang's methodology is structured around her belief in interdisciplinary academia and collaborative research. Her work with UNESCO and, later, as an ally to the Maori Council may classify her as a public anthropologist. In keeping with this, her research aims for productive, applied outcomes, generally for the benefit of either the environment or for the communities she works alongside. In her book The Anthropology of Sustainability, Strang notes her desire for anthropology to grow into a collaborative discipline that examines not only the human experience but its environmental context. She criticizes the Gaia Hypothesis for its oversimplification of the world as a self-regulating system, and for its placement of humanity in a \\"stewardship\\" position instead of as just another species whose actions exist and play out in a complex web removed from anyone's direct control. == Recognition == * Royal Anthropological Institute Fellowship in Urgent Anthropology, 2000 * International Water Prize, UNESCO, 2007 * HEFCE's national Interdisciplinary Advisory Panel Fellowship, 2017 * Chair of the Association of Social Anthropologists of the UK, 2013‚Äì2017 == Selected publications == ;Authored books * Strang, V.

She also writes romance as Zoey Castile. == Personal life == C√≥rdova was born in Guayaquil, Ecuador and came to the United States when she was five or six years old. English is her second language. She grew up in Hollis, Queens. Her favorite books in high school were In the Forests of the Night and Demon in my View by Amelia Atwater Rhodes, which she first read 13. Impressed by the fact that Rhodes was published when she was 14, C√≥rdova was inspired to start to want to become a writer as well. C√≥rdova attended the National Book Foundation‚Äôs writing camps in high school, with the help of a supportive teacher, and the Summer Solstice writing conference at Pine Manor college. She says that she wrote many unfinished stories in college, accumulating multiple \\"Part 1s\\", and completed her first novel at age 19. After college, she interned at PMA Literary and Film management, where she first met the person who would become her literary agent. C√≥rdova identifies as Latina and is one of the co-founders of the Latinx in Kidlit blog, a website centering fellow Latinx writers. == Selected works == C√≥rdova wrote her first query letter to a literary agent when she was 17. She wrote two more novels before writing the novel that ultimately made her able to get literary representation. The Vicious Deep Series C√≥rdova wrote what would become her debut novel, The Vicious Deep, as part of the National Novel Writing Month in 2010. It sold to Sourcebooks within a week of submitting. The Vicious Deep follows Tristan, a boy who gets swept away by a tidal wave and lands on Coney Island, having developed strange powers. It was published by Sourcebooks in August 2012. C√≥rdova says that she has had an infatuation with the sea ever since she was a child, saying that she had been sent a VHS of The Little Mermaid by her grandmother while still living in Ecuador and started to develop an interest in mermaids. While there is one biracial Ecuadorian and Greek side character in the novel, C√≥rdova says that \\"it all began in Ecuador\\" for her. She first had the concrete idea for the novel when she spent a summer in Coney Island. Two sequels, The Savage Blue and The Vast and Brutal Sea, followed in May 2013 and June 2015. Brooklyn Brujas Series Her second young adult series, Brooklyn Brujas (Witches), originally began as a Latinx version of Charmed and has been inspired by C√≥rdova's Ecuadorian heritage. C√≥rdova says that she wanted to write about identity, family, and magic, while being inclusive of people of color, without taking from preexisting mythologies, ultimately creating a fictional pantheon of gods, inspired by many different Latin American cultures. She worked on multiple drafts of what would become the first novel, Labyrinth Lost, for years before it ultimately sold in 2014. Labyrinth Lost follows Alex, a bruja who hates magic and accidentally makes her entire family vanish when she performs a spell to rid herself of her own magic. It was published by Sourcebooks in September 2016 and received a starred review from School Library Journal. In April 2017, it was announced that Paramount had acquired movie rights to the novel. the project is still in early development and no producer or writer has been attached yet. A sequel, Bruja Born, about Lula, the sister of the protagonist of the first book, whose life is turned upside down after a bus crash, was published in June 2018. C√≥rdova says that she didn't feel the story was complete after the first novel and that she didn't want to \\"mess up\\" Alex's ending, so chose the point of view of her sister instead, writing a much more \\"darker\\" novel in tone than the first. A third novel in the series is slated for publication in 2020. Star Wars Canon Universe She wrote the short story \\"You Owe Me a Ride\\", included in the short story collection Star Wars: From a Certain Point of View, featuring 40 authors' takes on stories taking place during the first Star Wars film, Star Wars: A New Hope, as told through the perspective of supporting characters. The collection was released in October 2017. C√≥rdova is also the author A Crash of Fate, a Star Wars canon universe novel released by Disney-Lucasfilm Press in August 2019. It tells the story of Izzy and Jules, two best friends on the run from vengeful smugglers and pirates. Other works She also writes romance under the pen name Zoey Castile, most notably her Magic Mike-inspired Happy Endings series about male strippers falling in love.

Lynceus arrived there after fleeing from the city of Argos when all of his brothers were murdered by the daughters of Danaus on their wedding night. He gave intelligence of his safe arrival to his faithful wife Hypermnestra by holding up a torch and she in like manner informed him of her safety by raising a torch from Larissa the citadel of Argos. Lyrcus was the illegitimate son of Abas, the son of Lynceus and Hypermnestra. He was expelled from Argos and got possession of Lynceia and it was renamed Lyrceia.

When he was only one month old (presumably following the Duke's death), his family moved to Madrid. In 1624, when his father died, he became an apprentice in the workshop of Juan van der Hamen and remained there for three years. Upon completing his training, he married Francisca de Alfaro, Hamen's niece. In 1631, after Hamen's death, it is believed that, as a member of the family, he kept the workshop open and continued to paint in the same style, which has created difficulties with attribution although, after 1630, some of his works were signed. In 1633, he was among the painters whose workshops were raided by the government. Portraits of King Philip IV and the Royal Family were confiscated so they could be examined by Vicente Carducho and Diego Vel√°zquez, to judge their quality and propriety. This resulted from complaints by local officials and members of the court that many painters possessed portraits which were no parecidos los m√°s de ellos, y otros con h√°bitos indecentes (not like most of them and others with indecent habits). Apparently, nothing objectionable was found as, the following year, he became a member of the Painters' Guild. In 1637, documents indicate that he was working on ephemeral decorations for the arrival of the Princess of Carignano and, a year later, creating decorations at the Palacio del Buen Retiro, together with Francisco Barrera. By 1642, business seems to have fallen off, as he requested an appointment as Inspector of Weights and Measures. He worked with Barrera again in 1649, making preparations for the visit of Queen Mariana of Austria. They were joined by the sculptor, and several gilders, who would produce ten golden figures of Kings and emperors. From then until his death, he is known only from the paintings he signed and a \\"Last Will and Testament\\", drawn up by him and his wife in 1657, although they were in good health and childless. A death certificate was issued in 1677. His wife survived him. == Further reading == * * Lo fingido verdadero.

The term draws its name from the Four Sacred Mountains of China, four mountains in mainland China that each hold sacred Chinese Buddhist sites. The founders of the institutions are collectively referred to as the Four Heavenly Kings of Taiwanese Buddhism. Each of the \\"Four Heavenly Kings\\" corresponds to one cardinal direction, based on where their organization is located in Taiwan. The institutions that make up the \\"Four Great Mountains\\" of Taiwanese Buddhism are: :* North (Jinshan): Dharma Drum Mountain (Ê≥ïÈºìÂ±±) founded by Master Sheng-yen (ËÅñÂö¥, d. 2009) :* South (Dashu): Fo Guang Shan (‰ΩõÂÖâÂ±±) founded by Master Hsing Yun (ÊòüÈõ≤) :* East (Hualien): Tzu Chi Foundation (ÊÖàÊøüÂü∫ÈáëÊúÉ) founded by Master Cheng Yen (Ë≠âÂö¥) :* West (Nantou): Chung Tai Shan (‰∏≠Âè∞Â±±) founded by Master Wei Chueh (ÊÉüË¶∫, d. 2016) With exception of Tzu Chi, all of them belong to the Linji school of Chan Buddhism. == Dharma Drum Mountain == Dharma Drum Mountain Monastery Dharma Drum Mountain is an international Buddhist spiritual, cultural, and educational foundation founded by Buddhist monk and scholar Master Sheng-yen (1930 ‚Äì 2009). The headquarters of the organization is located at Jinshan District, New Taipei City, Taiwan. Dharma Drum Mountain focuses on educating the public in Buddhism with the goal of improving the world and establishing a \\"Pure Land on Earth\\" through Buddhist education. The precursors to Dharma Drum Mountain were Chung- Hwa Institute of Buddhist Culture (CHIBC) and Nung Chan Monastery founded by Dongchu, a prominent Chan monk and disciple of modernist monk, Grand Master Taixu. CHIBC was founded in 1956 and was primarily active in promoting Buddhist culture through publishing journals. Nung Chan Monastery (literally: 'Farming Chan Monastery') was established in 1975. After Master Dongchu died in 1977, his Dharma heir, Sheng-yen became the new abbot of both Nung Chan and CHIBC. Both institutions grew rapidly, eventually overwhelming the building capacities.Sheng Yen, Footprints in the Snow: The Autobiography of a Chinese Buddhist Monk. Doubleday Religion, 2008. In 1989, the institutions bought a plot of hilly land in Jinshan, New Taipei City to build another monastery to expand to, which would become Dharma Drum Mountain. The architectural design of the monastery took seven years and followed and adjusted to the natural contour of the hills. Sheng-Yen personally oversaw the construction process.Drum of Life(documentary film). Dharma Drum Mountain Cultural Center The monastery broke ground in 1993 and was completed and inaugurated in 2001. Dharma Drum Mountain at Jinshan is a complex of monasteries and education centers. Aside from being the international headquarters of Dharma Drum Mountain, it also serves as the campus of Dharma Drum Sangha University (DDSU), Dharma Drum Buddhist College (DDBC) and Dharma Drum University (DDU). The organization's main focus is on teaching Buddhism to the public with the goal of improving the world through Buddhist education and scholarship. The monastery describes its mission as including three types of education: education through academics, education through public outreach, and education through caring service. Dharma Drum Mountain also does charity work, but mostly does so indirectly through the funding of other charities. Dharma Drum Mountain has affiliated centers and temples in fourteen countries spread across North America, Europe, Asia, and Oceania.Dharma Drum Mountain: Global Affiliates == Fo Guang Shan == Main shrine building at Fo Guang Shan Monastery Fo Guang Shan monastery was founded in Dashu District, Kaohsiung, Taiwan in 1967 by Buddhist monk Master Hsing Yun. The organization follows Humanistic Buddhism, which focuses on using Buddhism to improve the current world, as well as promotes Chinese culture, Buddhist education and charity. The temple is known for its use of modern technology and teaching methods. The organization's counterpart for laypeople is known as the Buddha's Light International Association. In 1966, Hsing Yun purchased more than 30 hectares in Dashu Township, Kaohsiung County as the site for the construction of a monastery. The groundbreaking ceremony was held on 16 May 1967. In 2011, the monastery opened the Fo Guang Shan Buddha Museum (formerly called the Buddha Memorial Center), which was built with support from the Taiwanese government. Fo Guang Shan Buddha Museum The monastery is the largest Buddhist temple in Taiwan and is the most comprehensive of the \\"Four Great Mountains\\". The organization runs social and medical programs including a free medical clinic with mobile units that serve remote villages, local and international disaster and poverty relief, a children's and seniors' home, wildlife conservation areas, orphanages, and drug rehabilitation programs in prisons. The monastery is best known for its education programs which include Buddhist colleges, full universities, various community colleges, and several primary schools. The monastery established several notable universities including Fo Guang University and Nanhua University in Taiwan and the University of the West in the United States. Fo Guang Shan and Tzu Chi are the only \\"Four Great Mountains\\" that offer some form of strictly secular education, as opposed to purely religious. Fo Guang Shan's approach to Dharma propagation focuses on simplifying Buddhism in order to make it more appealing to the masses. The organization is known for utilizing modern marketing techniques and methods to preach such as the use of laser shows and multimedia displays. Fo Guang Shan temples have no entrance fee, and do not allow many of the practices commonly found in other Chinese temples, such as fortune-telling or the presence of sales vendors. Fo Guang Shan entered mainland China in the early 21st century, focusing more on charity and Chinese cultural revival rather than Buddhist propagation in order to avoid conflict with the Chinese Communist Party, which opposes religion. In mainland China, Fo Guang Shan operates numerous cultural education programs and has built several libraries, publishing several books even through state controlled media. As of 2017, the order had over 1,000 monks and nuns, and over 1 million followers worldwide, with branches in fifty countries. == Tzu Chi == Main hall at Tzu Chi Foundation The Tzu Chi Foundation, known in full as the 'Buddhist Compassion Relief Tzu Chi Foundation', is a Taiwanese international humanitarian and non-governmental organization (NGO). The foundation was founded by Master Cheng Yen, a Taiwanese Buddhist nun, or bhikkhuni, in 1966 as a Buddhist humanitarian organization. The foundation has several sub-organizations such as the Tzu Chi International Medical Association (TIMA) and also the Tzu Chi Collegiate Youth Association (Tzu Ching). Although still Buddhist in nature, the organization focuses primarily on charity and humanitarian work rather than Buddhist propagation. The foundation's work includes medical aid, disaster relief, and environmental work such as recycling. Tzu Chi is the largest Buddhist organization in Taiwan, and also Taiwan's largest owner of private land. The Tzu Chi Foundation was founded as a charity organization with Buddhist origins by the Buddhist nun Master Cheng Yen on 14 May 1966 in Hualien, Taiwan after Cheng Yen saw the humanitarian work of Christian missionaries in Taiwan in the post World War II period. The organization began with a motto of \\"instructing the rich and saving the poor\\" as a group of thirty housewives who saved fifty cents (US$0.02) every day and stored them in bamboo savings banks to donate to needy families. Auditorium inside Tzu Chi Main hall The foundation expanded its work from helping needy families to medical aid in 1970, opening a medical clinic. The foundation established its first hospital in Hualien in 1986 to serve the impoverished eastern coast of Taiwan. The publicity from the extensive fundraising to build its first hospital is credited with helping Tzu Chi expand its membership rapidly during this period. From 1987 to 1991, Tzu Chi membership doubled in size each year, by 1994, it boasted a membership of 4 million members. Tzu Chi has since built hospitals in several more counties in Taiwan and built the Tzu Chi College of Nursing in 1989 which would become the Tzu Chi University of Science and Technology and Tzu Chi College of Medicine in 1993 which would become Tzu Chi University. In 1993, Tzu Chi began the first large scale bone marrow registry in the Taiwan. Tzu Chi is most well known for its disaster relief programs. Although Buddhist in nature, Tzu Chi has a policy not preaching religion while giving aid. One of the most iconic attributes of Tzu Chi disaster relief efforts is that volunteers not only provide short term aid but also partake in long term projects to rebuild the communities affected. Tzu Chi often builds new homes, schools, hospitals, and places of worship (including churches and mosques for non-Buddhists) for victims following a disaster. Tzu Chi Hospital in Taipei The foundation has policy of environmental protection and encourages the recycling of items such as water bottles as well as using reusable items or reusing items to reduce waste. As of 2014, the foundation operates over 5,600 recycling stations. One of the foundation's projects is the recycling of polyethylene terephthalate (PET) plastic bottles for the production of textiles.Tzu Chi Quarterly, Winter 2008 Items made with the recycled resins include blankets, thermal underwear, T-shirts, hospital bed sheets, medical gowns, suitcases, stuffed animals and uniforms for Tzu Chi volunteers, these items are often used during its disaster relief programs. Tzu Chi is notably distinct from the other \\"Four Great Mountains\\" in respect to three main unique characteristics. First of all, the founder of the organization is a female. Secondly, the founder is not a Buddhist scholar who promotes a specific interpretation of Buddhism nor started any kind of religious movement. And finally, the organization is officially a charitable organization and Tzu Chi itself focuses primarily on humanitarianism and community service rather than Buddhist spiritual development. Nuns at Tzu Chi practice spiritual contemplation only in the morning and evening, and spend the rest of the day doing charity or humanitarian work. == Chung Tai Shan == Chung Tai Chan Monastery Chung Tai Shan is a Taiwan-based Buddhist monastic order founded in 1987 by the Chan meditation master and Buddhist monk Master Wei Chueh. Its headquarters is the Chung Tai Chan Monastery in Nantou, Taiwan completed in 2001. Chung Tai Shan emphasizes meditation practice to purify the mind and encourages people to join the monastic life. Chung Tai Shan started in 1987, after Master Wei Chueh founded the Lin Quan Temple in Taipei County. Due to the continuing growth of both lay disciples and monastic disciples, Master Wei Chueh founded Chung Tai Chan Monastery in Nantou, Taiwan in 2001 and moved the order's headquarters to the new larger location. Chung Tai Shan emphasizes meditation and strict adherence to the monastic lifestyle, the order follows a meditation technique developed by Master Wei Chueh known as \\"breathe counting\\". Chung Tai Shan is the least socially engaged of the \\"Four Great Mountains\\", emphasizing purifying one's own mind and religious study over charity or disaster relief. It publishes a newspaper that is strictly religious in nature and its education programs are strictly Buddhist or highly laced by Buddhist content. The order also encourages lay members to adhere to the Eight Precepts on weekends. As of 2005, Chung Tai Shan's headquarters at Chung Tai Chan Monastery had about 1,600 monastics. == References == * * Category:Buddhist charities Category:Charities based in Taiwan Category:Religious service organizations ","title":"Four Great Mountains (Taiwan)"},{"id":"60375754","text":"Dugald William Saunders is an Australian politician.

A halal cart platter consists of chicken or lamb gyro, yellow rice, and salad, with optional red or white sauce on top. The red sauce is believed to derive from harissa, while the white sauce may come from zabadi (similar to tzatziki). The origin of the halal cart is disputed, but The Halal Guys was one of the first, starting off as a hot dog cart in Midtown Manhattan, New York City, before switching to halal food in the 1990s. As early as 2007, halal carts had already begun displacing hot dog carts as the city's dominant form of street food. A Queens College study showed that there were 306 street vendors who immigrated from Germany and Italy to New York City in 1990, and none in 2005; over the same period, those from Egypt, Bangladesh, and Afghanistan had risen from 69 to 563.

He ran the Yeshiva Centre in Sydney with his father, Pinchus Feldman. He has been the subject of numerous high-profile controversies in the Jewish community, specifically the cover up of child sex abuse. == Controversies == === Royal Commission === Feldman was called as a witness during the Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Sexual Abuse. While on the stand, he said that he did not know as a fact that it was illegal for an adult to touch the genitals of a child. At the time he was the dean of the Yeshivah Gedola Rabbinical College, a position he eventually resigned. He claimed that rabbis should be able to determine themselves whether to pass claims of abuse on to the police, or to deal with them privately. In his testimony, Felman spoke about a letter he wrote to the Sydney Beth Din, objecting to their stance encouraging victims of abuse to talk to police. Feldman was concerned that this would have implications for his friend, David Cyprys. Cyprys was later jailed on charges of sexually abusing boys in Melbourne. He assisted another abuser to escape Australia not long after he discovered that an accusation was taken to the police. Following the backlash from his appearance at the Royal Commission, Feldman attacked the media saying that their reporting \\"encourages even people who may not be real victims or may want to be considered heroes\\". An editorial in Australian Jewish News called his testimony \\"our darkest week\\" as a community and singled out Feldman and his father for particular condemnation. The editorial claimed that it had not seen an improvement in culture from the period when the abuse occurred. Feldman's testimony was widely condemned across the community. He later resigned from his positions. Feldman threatened to sue news organisations over their reporting of his testimony. The International Business Times withdrew their reporting and apologized. In addition, Australian Jewish News, The Guardian, The Herald Sun, The Daily Telegraph, The Australian, ABC, SBS, The Daily Beast, the Council of Orthodox Synagogues of Australasia, The Executive Council of Australian Jewry and The New South Wales Jewish Board of Deputies were all threatened with legal action over their reporting. On 31 January, 2020 the judgement by Feldman against Nationwide News, Herald and Weekly Times, the Special Broadcasting Corporation and individual journalists in the Supreme Court of NSW was made for the case heard in May and August of 2018. Judgments were made against the plaintiff (Feldman) and defendants‚Äô costs awarded to him. === Other controversies === In June 2013, Feldman was ordered to pay a former employee, Rabbi Shabsi Tayar, $1.6 million. The amount was due to his failure to repay a $1 million loan and to pay wages. Tayar was described as on the verge of bankruptcy and was forced to live with family in Melbourne since he could not afford rent. In 2015 he resigned as a director of the Yeshiva Centre to as part of an agreement to settle an outstanding bill of $10,000 relating for commercial waste removal. Feldman was providing a rival kosher certification to the mainstream Kashrut Authority, but resigned from that position following the Royal Commission. When he initially provided the certification the NSW Rabbinical Council voted 18-3 against Feldman. Following this vote Feldman, a former president of the organisation, resigned. === Removal from Yeshiva Centre === Following financial difficulties, businessman Harry Triguboff purchased the Yeshiva Centre and leased it back to the Feldmans for a peppercorn rent. Triguboff later regretted renting the premises to them, and handed control of the organisation to Rabbi Dovid Slavin. Feldman took Triguboff to court where he lost and was forced to vacate the premises. In response Feldman sent a letter to Triguboff stating that the centre would be shut down \\"out of hatred\\" and that Triguboff was \\"about to commit one of the biggest sins possible of degrading and humiliating a Talmid Chochom [Torah scholar]\\". He also claimed that \\"you‚Äôll be ‚Äì not because of lack of money ‚Äì the first Jew to close a Shule since the Nazis, communists and terrorist Palestinians\\". == Family == Feldman's father, Pinchus, was the head of the Sydney Chabad institutions in Sydney for many years. Feldman's grandfather, Chaim Gutnick was a high profile rabbi in Melbourne. He has a number of high profile uncles, including mining magnate Joseph Gutnick, senior rabbi on the Sydney Beth Din Moshe Gutnick, and the senior rabbi on the Melbourne Beth Din, Mordechai Gutnick. His uncle, Joseph had provided money to the synagogue and was in a legal dispute with the Feldman family when he attempted to sell the synagogue site to developers. ==See also== *Judaism in Australia == References == Category:Australian Hasidic rabbis Category:Australian Jews Category:Chabad-Lubavitch rabbis Category:Year of birth missing (living people) Category:21st-century rabbis Category:Living people ","title":"Yossi Feldman"},{"id":"60375990","text":"Sophie Hyde is an Australian film director, writer and producer based in Adelaide, South Australia. She is co-founder of Closer Productions at Glenside and best known for her award-winning debut fiction film, 52 Tuesdays. ==Biography== ===Early life and career=== As a teenager in Adelaide, Hyde learnt acting skills at the Unley Youth Theatre (later Urban Myth and now SAYarts), where she met some of her future colleagues. She later studied film theatre at Flinders University in Adelaide and followed up at La Trobe University in Melbourne, graduating with a Bachelor of Arts in 1988. Returning to Adelaide based on funding supplied to make a film about women's toilets, in 2005 she re-met her now partner Bryan Mason, editor and cinematographer. Since then they have shared both a personal and professional relationship, both working out of their company Closer Productions in suburban Adelaide and parenting their child Audrey Mason-Hyde. ==Work== Hyde and Mason started making videos for nightclubs and dance shows, then moved to documentary films. After becoming friends with choreographer and dancer Tanja Liedtke, they started making a documentary about her. After the dancer's untimely death in a traffic accident in Sydney in 2007, they completed the film and named it Life in Movement, which was named best work at the 2011 Ruby Awards for the arts, won the 2011 Foxtel Australian Documentary Prize and won AACTA nominations for direction and for best feature documentary. Hyde completed her first feature film as director, co-writer and co-producer, 52 Tuesdays, filmed in Adelaide in 2013, then spent a year promoting it. This film earned many accolades, including World Cinema Dramatic Directing Award for Hyde at Sundance in 2014 and a Crystal Bear at the Berlin International Film Festival. Hyde's next project was a six-part TV series called Fucking Adelaide (aka F*!#ing Adelaide), commissioned by the Australian Broadcasting Corporation and Screen Australia, aired on national TV from 15 July 2018 and ABC iviewF*!#ing Adelaide on iview after debuting at the Adelaide Film Festival in 2017. A dark comedy about \\"home, family, identity and the 'small town-ness' of Adelaide\\", each episode was a part of a story told from a different character‚Äôs perspective, including a character played by Hyde's child Audrey and also starring Tilda Cobham-Hervey, Brendan Maclean and Kate Box as three siblings who respond to their mother's (played by Pamela Rabe) request to return to the family home in Adelaide. Hyde has said that \\"It‚Äôs about the beautiful side of family, but also the negative side of being around people who feel like they know you, but perhaps don't allow you to change.\\"; also that it reflects her love of Adelaide, which is greater once one has been away. The title started out as a joke, reflecting how Hyde felt about returning to Adelaide after being away ‚Äî \\"both comforting and claustrophobic\\". Co-written by Matthew Cormack and Matt Vesely and produced by Rebecca Summerton, it was in competition at the S√©ries Mania International Festival in France2018, and screened in Berlin. In 2018 Hyde made Animals, based on the novel of the same name by Emma Jane Unsworth, in Dublin. This was her first feature film shot abroad, and was screened in the Premieres category at the 2019 Sundance Film Festival and as an Adelaide Film Festival \\"pop-up\\" event in April 2019. In January 2019 it was announced that a drama mini-series called The Hunting would be screened later in the year on SBS TV, produced and directed by Hyde and starring Richard Roxburgh, Asher Keddie, Pamela Rabe, Sam Reid, Jessica De Gouw, Elena Carapetis and Sachin Joab. In My Blood It Runs, directed by Gayby Baby director Maya Newell, produced by Hyde, Rachel Nanninaaq Edwardson, Larissa Behrendt and Maya Newell and made in collaboration with Arrernte and Garrwa people in the Northern Territory, had its world premiere at the Hot Docs Canadian International Documentary Festival in Toronto in April/May 2019. It follows the story of 10-year-old Dujuan Hoosan a healer and hunter, as his family try to give him an Arrernte education alongside the western education system. ==Closer Productions== Hyde is co-founder, along with Mason, of the film production company Closer Productions.

He was a Member of Parliament, representing Haryana in the Rajya Sabha the upper house of India's Parliament as a member of the Indian National Congress Nekiram sharma: Freedom fighter and Haryana Kesari Pandit Nekiram Sharma fought against the British throughout his life. He not only turned down the temptation of the British DC to give 25 marmalades of land, but also said that this entire country is mine, what land will you give me, British. His great-grandson Parag Sharma and his close former judge Subhash Kaushik said that Pandit Nekiram Sharma was born on 7 September 1887 in Kelanga (Kalinga)village of Bhiwani district to Pandit Hariprasad Mishra. He got higher education in Sanskrit by staying in Sitapur, Banaras and Ayodha in Uttar Pradesh. He got an opportunity to meet the country's best leaders Gopal Krishna Gokhale, Lokmanya Bal Gangadhar Tilak, Punjab Kesari Lala Lajpat Rai, Babu Surendra Nath Banerjee and Mahamana Pandit Madan Mohan Malviya on the occasion of the annual session of the Indian National Congress in December 1905 at Banaras. Inspired by He came back to his village Kelgaon Lot in 1907 at the age of 20. In 1907, Bhagat Singh, uncle Sardar Ajit Singh, Lala Lajpat Rai were sent to Mandalay jail by the British Government and prosecuting Lokmanya Tilak in 1908 did not tolerate Nekiram and he became a staunch opponent of the British Government. When Lokmanya Tilak was sentenced to 6 years of rigorous imprisonment, Nekiram fasted for a day and vowed not to sit peacefully until the British rule was over. In the heart of Pandit Nekiram, the fire was burning against the atrocities being committed against the people by the British Government. At one time, he wanted to fight against the British by making a bomb against them, but when he reached Calcutta for this work, he met the Congress leader Babu Surendra Nath Benerjee. Taught Ahisa the lesson to Panditji. He was arrested in the Non-Cooperation Movement in 1921 on the call of Mahatma Gandhi, the Father of the Nation. He first met Mahatma Gandhi during the 1915 Mumbai Congress. He joined the campaign against untouchability under the inspiration of Gandhiji. Working in the Homerul movement, Nekiram first met Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru in March 1918 at a place called Etawah in Uttar Pradesh. The visit later turned into a strong friendship. On 30 June 1918, he was arrested along with another leader Asaf Ali in the Homerul movement. \\\\------------- Comrade Omprakash, a historian and philanthropist, says that fearing the popularity of Pandit Nekiram in the Homerul movement, the British wanted to break him by greed or intimidation. He was proposed by Rohtak English DC Joseph to give 25 marmalade land for free, which was turned down by Pandit Nekiram. Then he was declared a traitor and threatened to be sent to jail. Which had no effect on them. \\\\---------- Pandit Nekiram called Gandhiji in 1920, Bhiwani Ambala Divisional Political Conference was convened at Bhiwani on 22 October 1920 to popularize the non-cooperation movement. In it, at the insistence of Pandit Nekiram, the Father of the Nation Mahatma Gandhi, Shokhat Ali, Mohammad Ali, Molana Abul Kalam Azad and Kasturba Gandhi attended.

It is situated in the parish of Forte da Casa, in the municipality of Vila Franca de Xira, in the Lisbon District. ==History== Following the Treaty of Fontainebleau signed between France and Spain in October 1807, which provided for the invasion and subsequent division of Portuguese territory into three kingdoms, French troops under the command of General Junot entered Portugal, which requested support from the British. In July 1808 troops commanded by the Duke of Wellington, at the time known as Arthur Wellesley, landed in Portugal and defeated French troops at the Battles of Roli√ßa and Vimeiro. This forced Junot to negotiate the Convention of Cintra, which led to the evacuation of the French army from Portugal. In March 1809, Marshal Soult led a new French expedition that advanced south to the city of Porto before being repulsed by Portuguese-British troops and forced to withdraw. The threat of a further invasion by the French led Wellington, on October 20, 1809, to order the secret construction of defensive lines in order to protect Lisbon from Napol√©on Bonaparte's troops led by Marechal Mass√©na. A total of 152 military installations were constructed and they were each given a number. The Fort of Casa was Number 38 and it was originally named ‚ÄúDa Caza‚Äù by the Portuguese Major Brand√£o de Sousa. It had a star-shaped layout and, like most other forts of the Lines, it was built with a dry moat and equipped with an magazine. In 1810 it was garrisoned by around 340 soldiers, with five cannon. At an altitude of just 41 metres and close to the River Tagus it was given the task, together with the higher forts of Portela Grande and Portela Pequena, of potentially impeding the progress of the French army along two main roads. However, Mass√©na‚Äôs troops were repulsed by the first line of defence at Sobral de Monte Agra√ßo and the Fort of Casa never saw action. ==The present day== The fort was excavated in 2008 and 2010 and the ruins are now incorporated into a small urban park. The site also contains a Lines of Torres Vedras ‚ÄúInterpretation Centre‚Äù, one of several in the region. The Centre informs visitors about the construction of the two northerly lines of Torres Vedras, the relation of the fort with other military works, and on the impact of the French invasion and construction of the forts on the people of the area. ==See also== *List of forts of the Lines of Torres Vedras ==References== * Casa Category:Lines of Torres Vedras ==External links== * Friends of the Lines of Torres Vedras ","title":"Fort of Casa"},{"id":"60376286","text":"is a 1970 Japanese film directed by Kazuo Ikehiro.

On January 11, 2004 in a 38-31 divisional round victory over the Kansas City Chiefs in the 2003‚Äì04 NFL playoffs, he caught a 2-yard touchdown pass from Peyton Manning in the second quarter. Ironically, that touchdown pass would go on to be the only time Lopienski ever touched the ball during an NFL regular season or playoff game. He also played the following week in the AFC Championship Game, where the Colts lost to the New England Patriots by a score of 24-14. ===2004 season=== In the 2004 season, Lopienski played in the Colts‚Äô first two regular season games. He finished his NFL career having played six total regular games. ==References== Category:1979 births Category:Living people Category:American football fullbacks Category:Indianapolis Colts players Category:Notre Dame Fighting Irish football players ","title":"Tom Lopienski"},{"id":"60376597","text":"Khurram Shahzad may refer to: * Khurram Shahzad (Pakistani cricketer) (born 1993), Pakistani cricketer * Khurram Shahzad (Qatari cricketer) (born 1988), Qatari cricketer * Khurram Shahzad (weightlifter) (born 1981), Pakistani weightlifter ==See also== * Khurram Shehzad (disambiguation) ","title":"Khurram Shahzad"},{"id":"60376602","text":"Bugay is a surname.

The topology allows for an efficient implementation of some basic communication primitives such as Broadcast, All-Reduce, and Prefix sum.Grama, A.(2003). Introduction to Parallel Computing. Addison Wesley; Auflage: 2 ed. . The processing elements are numbered 0 through 2^d - 1. Each processing element is adjacent to processing elements whose numbers differ in one and only one bit. The algorithms described in this page utilize this structure efficiently. == Algorithm outline == Most of the communication primitives presented in this article share a common template.Foster, I.(1995). Designing and Building Parallel Programs: Concepts and Tools for Parallel Software Engineering. Addison Wesley; . Initially, each processing element possesses one message that must reach every other processing element during the course of the algorithm. The following pseudo code sketches the communication steps necessary. Hereby, Initialization, Operation, and Output are placeholders that depend on the given communication primitive (see next section). Input: message m. Output: depends on Initialization, Operation and Output. Initialization s := m for 0 \\\\leq k < d do y := i \\\\text{ XOR } 2^k Send s to y Receive m from y Operation(s, m) endfor Output Each processing element iterates over its neighbors (the expression i \\\\text{ XOR } 2^k negates the k-th bit in i's binary representation, therefore obtaining the numbers of its neighbors). In each iteration, each processing element exchanges a message with the neighbor and processes the received message afterwards. The processing operation depends on the communication primitive. Algorithm outline applied to the 3-dimensional hypercube. In the first step (before any communication), each processing element possesses one message (blue). Communication is marked red. After each step, the processing elements store the received message, but other operations are also possible. == Communication primitives == === Prefix sum === In the beginning of a prefix sum operation, each processing element i owns a message m_i. The goal is to compute \\\\bigoplus_{0 \\\\le j \\\\le i} m_j, where \\\\oplus is an associative operation. The following pseudo code describes the algorithm. Input: message m_i of processor i. Output: prefix sum \\\\bigoplus_{0 \\\\le j \\\\le i} m_j of processor i. x := m_i \\\\sigma := m_i for 0 \\\\le k \\\\le d - 1 do y := i \\\\text{ XOR } 2^k Send \\\\sigma to y Receive m from y \\\\sigma := \\\\sigma \\\\oplus m if bit k in i is set then x := x \\\\oplus m endfor The algorithm works as follows. Observe that hypercubes of dimension d can be split into two hypercubes of dimension d - 1. Refer to the sub cube containing nodes with a leading 0 as the 0-sub cube and the sub cube consisting of nodes with a leading 1 as 1-sub cube. Once both sub cubes have calculated the prefix sum, the sum over all elements in the 0-sub cube has to be added to the every element in the 1-sub cube, since every processing element in the 0-sub cube has a lower rank than the processing elements in the 1-sub cube. The pseudo code stores the prefix sum in variable x and the sum over all nodes in a sub cube in variable \\\\sigma. This makes it possible for all nodes in 1-sub cube to receive the sum over the 0-sub cube in every step. This results in a factor of \\\\log p for T_\\\\text{start} and a factor of n\\\\log p for T_\\\\text{byte}: T(n,p) = (T_\\\\text{start} + nT_\\\\text{byte})\\\\log p. Example for a prefix sum calculation. Upper number: tentatetive prefix sum (variable x). Lower number: sum over all elements in the sub cube (variable \\\\sigma). === All-gather / all-reduce === All-gather operations start with each processing element having a message m_i. The goal of the operation is for each processing element to know the messages of all other processing elements, i.e. x := m_0 \\\\cdot m_1 \\\\dots m_p where \\\\cdot is concatenation. The operation can be implemented following the algorithm template. Input: message x := m_i at processing unit i. Output: all messages m_1 \\\\cdot m_2 \\\\dots m_p. x := m_i for 0 \\\\le k < d do y := i \\\\text{ XOR } 2^k Send x to y Receive x' from y x := x \\\\cdot x' endfor With each iteration, the transferred message doubles in length. This leads to a runtime of T(n,p) \\\\approx \\\\sum_{j=0}^{d-1}(T_\\\\text{start} + n \\\\cdot 2^jT_\\\\text{byte})= \\\\log(p) T_\\\\text{start} + (p-1)nT_\\\\text{byte}. The same principle can be applied to the All-Reduce operations, but instead of concatenating the messages, it performs a reduction operation on the two messages. So it is a Reduce operation, where all processing units know the result. Compared to a normal reduce operation followed by a broadcast, All-Reduce in hypercubes reduces the number of communication steps. === All-to-all === Here every processing element has a unique message for all other processing elements. Input: message m_{ij} at processing element i to processing element j. for d > k \\\\geq 0 do Receive from processing element i \\\\text{ XOR } 2^k: all messages for my k-dimensional sub cube Send to processing element i \\\\text{ XOR } 2^k: all messages for its k-dimensional sub cube endfor With each iteration a messages comes closer to its destination by one dimension, if it hasn't arrived yet. Hence, all messages have reached their target after at most d = \\\\log{p} steps. In every step, p / 2 messages are sent: in the first iteration, half of the messages aren't meant for the own sub cube. In every following step, the sub cube is only half the size as before, but in the previous step exactly the same number of messages arrived from another processing element. This results in a run- time of T(n,p) \\\\approx \\\\log{p} (T_\\\\text{start} + \\\\frac{p}{2}nT_\\\\text{byte}). == ESBT-broadcast == The ESBT-broadcast (Edge-disjoint Spanning Binomial Tree) algorithm is a pipelined broadcast algorithm with optimal runtime for clusters with hypercube network topology. The algorithm embeds d edge-disjoint binomial trees in the hypercube, such that each neighbor of processing element 0 is the root of a spanning binomial tree on 2^d - 1 nodes. To broadcast a message, the source node splits its message into k chunks of equal size and cyclically sends them to the roots of the binomial trees. Upon receiving a chunk, the binomial trees broadcast it. === Runtime === In each step, the source node sends one of its k chunks to a binomial tree. Broadcasting the chunk within the binomial tree takes d steps. Thus, it takes k steps to distribute all chunks and additionally d steps until the last binomial tree broadcast has finished, resulting in k + d steps overall. Therefore, the runtime for a message of length n is T(n, p, k) = \\\\left(\\\\frac{n}{k} T_\\\\text{byte} + T_\\\\text{start} \\\\right) (k + d). With the optimal chunk size k^* = \\\\sqrt{\\\\frac{nd \\\\cdot T_\\\\text{byte}}{T_\\\\text{start}}}, the optimal runtime of the algorithm is T^*(n, p) = n \\\\cdot T_\\\\text{byte} + \\\\log(p) \\\\cdot T_\\\\text{start} + \\\\sqrt{n \\\\log(p) \\\\cdot T_\\\\text{start} \\\\cdot T_\\\\text{byte}}. === Construction of the binomial trees === A 3-dimensional hypercubes with three ESBT embedded. This section describes how to construct the binomial trees systematically. First, construct a single binomial spanning tree von 2^d nodes as follows. Number the nodes from 0 to 2^d - 1 and consider their binary representation. Then the children of each nodes are obtained by negating single leading zeroes. This results in a single binomial spanning tree. To obtain d edge-disjoint copies of the tree, translate and rotate the nodes: for the k-th copy of the tree, apply a XOR operation with 2^k to each node.

Each player collects and places layers of tiles to plan the map for their individual bear park, a type of zoo common in certain parts of the world, such as the B√§rengraben in Bern. It won the Austrian Game of Games prize in the year of its publication. The game's designer has alluded to possible expansion of the game, including through the addition of monorails. == Gameplay == Each player starts with a 4x4 square land tile, which they then complete by collecting and placing a sequence of smaller tiles in the shapes of various polyominoes. These tiles have higher point values for larger pieces and for first placement of the smaller, more frequent tiles. In addition to basic green areas, such as food stalls, toilets, playgrounds, and rivers, players compete for choosing from a central pool of tiles for animal house and outdoor enclosures for polar bears, pandas, koalas, and Gobi bears. Players will continue to expand their park until their map holds four of the 4x4 square tiles in any arrangement. On a player's turn, that player places a tile within their park map, rotating it in any direction that they wish; takes new tiles from the central pool based on symbols covered by the tile they just placed; and receives a bear statue if they complete a 4x4 square. As game play continues, the point value for many of the tiles decreases and certain tiles may run out, eliminating that option for players to use in the rest of the game. Once any player has completed their park, all players get one more turn until the game ends. Alternatively, the game ends when all players have played as many tiles as possible on their map. Then, players count their total score by counting all of the numeric values face up on their map, including enclosures, animal houses, and bear statues. The player with the highest score is the winner: in the case of a tie, the winner is the player with the highest score among unplayed tiles within their collection. === Advanced Variant === In an additional variant of the game, players can choose three of ten possible bonus tiles that typically increase the desirability of placing a certain type of tile within your park. The player who fulfills the requirements of these bonus tiles first will receive the largest bonus, with subsequent players who also fulfill the requirements earning decreasing amounts in each succession. == Reception & Rating == The game has been generally well-received since its release, with a 7.4/10 net review on BoardGameGeek. It garnered nominations for the 2017 Meeples' Choice and Golden Geek Best Family Board Game awards from the same site. It won the Austrian Game of Games prize. In addition, the game was featured in a number of 2017 Best Of lists for board games, including Paste and Ars Technica. == References == Category:Board games introduced in 2017 Category:Tile-based board games Category:Board games Category:Bears in popular culture ","title":"B√§renpark"},{"id":"60376929","text":"Trinidad Navarro is an American politician who is the Delaware Insurance Commissioner and previously served as New Castle County Sheriff.

Debuting in first-class cricket in 1864, Silcock made 41 appearances in first-class cricket from 1864-1879, scoring 776 runs and taking 79 wickets. Regarded as one of the best professionals of his time to play for Essex, he was instrumental in the foundation of Essex County Cricket Club in 1876 and played for the county until 1887. He later stood as an umpire in first-class matches between 1889-1892\\\\. ==Cricket career== Silcock was born at Sawbridgeworth and grew up in Chipping Ongar, Essex. He began playing cricket at the age of seventeen and was originally a saddler by profession. Playing as an all- rounder, he made his debut in first-class cricket for a United England Eleven against an All-England Eleven at Lord's in 1864. He was employed as a cricket coach by several notable public schools, starting with Uppingham in 1864. In April and May 1865, he was employed by Felsted School, while from June-August of the same year he was coaching the officers of the Colchester Garrison. Three years later he appeared twice for England against the Marylebone Cricket Club and a combined Surrey and Middlesex cricket team, as well as appearing for the Players in two Gentlemen v Players fixtures, and for the Players of the South against the Gentlemen of the South. He took 16 wickets with his right-arm roundarm fast-medium bowling at an average of 17.43, including taking what would be career best first-class figures when he took 7 for 132 against the Gentlemen at The Oval. He featured in six first-class matches in 1869, taking a further 15 wickets at 22.86. In that same year he was employed by Eton, while the following year he the professional at Thorndon Hall with William Petre. He had been an inn-keeper at the Chequers Inn in Maldon for sometime prior to 1869, having given that up in 1869. Silcock played eight further first-class matches in 1870, featuring mostly for the United South of England Eleven and various Players' teams and taking a further 14 wickets at 27.35. He featured just once in 1871, appearing for the Players of the South against the Gentlemen of the South, taking 5 for 56 in the Gentlemen's first- innings. He had returned to Eton to coach in 1871, a position he held until 1874. He played in five first-class matches in 1872, taking 12 wickets at 14.83, before making just one appearance in 1873 in the Gentlemen of the South v Gentlemen of the North fixture, during which he made his highest first-class batting score, with 66 opening the batting in the Players' first-innings. He made five first-class appearances in 1874, taking 9 wickets at 15.55, following this up in 1875 with a further five appearances and 6 at 13.66; Silcock took all six of his wickets in one match, against the North at Tunbridge Wells. His last major season of first-class cricket came the following year in 1876, when he made three appearances, taking a single wicket. ==Formation of Essex County Cricket Club== Silcock had played for Essex in minor matches since 1860, during which time he was considered one of the finest professionals to play for the county. He was a founding member of Essex County Cricket Club in 1876 and captained the Players of Essex against the Gentlemen of Essex in a match to celebrate the occasion at Brentwood. The year prior to the formation of the county club, Silcock was keeping a cricket warehouse at Chipping Ongar. A benefit match played on his behalf was held in 1878, when a United South of England Eleven captained by W. G. Grace played Essex. In 1879, Silcock appeared in his 41st and final first-class match, playing for a London United Eleven against the United North of England Eleven at Birmingham. Across his 41 first-class matches, he scored 776 runs at a batting average of 11.41, while with the ball he took 79 wickets at 20.63 apiece. He continued to play for Essex until 1887, seven years prior to its elevation to first-class status. He took up umpiring in first-class matches in 1889, standing in 36 matches until 1892, including the earliest matches of the nascent County Championship. He died at Marden Ash in May 1897. His cousin, Joseph Silcock, also played for Essex as a professional, but did not feature in first-class matches. ==References== ==External links== * Category:1838 births Category:1897 deaths Category:People from Sawbridgeworth Category:English cricketers Category:Non-international England cricketers Category:Players cricketers Category:Players of the South cricketers Category:North v South cricketers Category:United South of England Eleven cricketers Category:London United Eleven cricketers Category:English cricket coaches Category:English cricket umpires ","title":"Frank Silcock (cricketer)"},{"id":"60376983","text":"Sala Thammasop (, ) is a khwaeng (sub-district) of Bangkok's Thawi Watthana District.

She lists her early crime influences as the 1989-1990 The Granny Killer case and the 1991 movie, The Silence of the Lambs. In 2003, she received a bachelor's degree in social science (criminology) from Charles Sturt University. In 2012, she received a diploma of management (health care) from TAFE NSW. In 2015-2017, she studied for a master's degree of arts (writing) from Swinburne University of Technology and in 2019, a graduate certificate (criminology) at Griffith University. She is currently studying a master's degree (criminology) at Macquarie University. == Career == Her interest in criminology began when she noticed factual errors in an undergraduate textbook, and set out to confirm the information by writing directly to the criminal (in this case Ivan Milat). Following this, she wrote to others and when many began writing back, she decided to pursue it further. After 25 years of corresponding with hundreds of serial killers (including Milat, Charles Manson, David Birnie, Richard Ramirez, Ian Brady, and Roy Norris) she has been nicknamed \\"The Serial Killer Whisperer\\" by sections of the media. Howard released her first books in 2004, and has since made numerous media appearances on radio, television, at conferences, online, and also appears on the morning show Studio 10 as a regular guest. In 2017, she was included in the Who's Who of Australian Women. In 2018, she began work as an associate producer on an American film about serial killer Jesse Pommeroy. In 2019, Howard opened a pop up museum exhibition called Memento Mori Death Museum. It features pieces from her true crime collection and correspondence from killers from across the globe as well as pieces related to death and culture. == Personal life == Howard was married to Steve Howard, a high-school peer, and they went on to have two children. In mid-2017, however, her husband committed suicide at the family home at the age of 42. As a result of his death, Howard is now a spokesperson for male suicide prevention. == Bibliography == Howard has authored a number of books and articles in a number of genres: 2004: * Ripper Notes: Murder by Numbers (chapter only) * Ripper Notes: Madmen, Myths and Magic (chapter only) * River of Blood: Serial Killers and their Victims (co-author: Martin Smith) 2005: *Man of The Shadows (Ripperologist Magazine 62; co-authors: Adam Went and Antonio Sironi) 2007: * The Lottery Kidnapping (Forensic Files) * Million Dollar Art Theft (Forensic Files) * Robbery File: The Museum Heist (Crime Solvers) * Terror in the Skies: The Lockerbie Bombing (Forensic Files) * Terrorist Bombing File: The Lockerbie Investigation (Crime Solvers) *Sex Or No Sex (Ripperologist Magazine 83) *On Whether JTR Was A Sexual Serial Killer (Ripperologist Magazine 86; co-author: RJ Palmer) 2008: *Kidnapping File: The Graeme Thorne Case (Crime Solvers) *One Hundred and Twenty Years Ago (Ripperologist Magazine 94) 2009: * Innocence Lost * Predators 2011: * Predators - Killers Without A Conscience (co-author: Paul Wilson) * Serial Killers and Philosophy 2013: * Charlotte's One of a Kind Cakes * The Cicadas Roar * A Killer in the Family (nominated as a finalist for the Davitt National Crime Writing Award) 2014: * Murder on the Mind 2015: * A Thousand Cuts 2016: * How to be An Author: 36 Real Authors Talk Writing and Publishing (chapter only) * Innocence Lost: The Crimes That Changed Australia * Killer Australia: Death and Destruction Down Under * Rope: A History of the Hanged 2017: * Bound by Blood: Killers We Trust * Child Killers: When Evil Hunts Innocence * Killer Minds: An Insight into the Minds of Serial Killers * Killing Time: Tales of Terror and Torment * Life, Death and Other Funny Stories 2018: * Monsters Who Murder (Volume 1) * The Story of the Hanged === Kate Reilly series === Howard has also authored a series of investigative novels \\"following the life of a police detective who is an international expert on ritual crimes and ancient societies.\\" The series, set in the fictional Somerset Police Violent Crimes Department, currently consists of: * The Blood of Many (Ritual book 1) (2013) * The Elements of Murder (Ritual book 2) (2013) * A Thousand Cuts (Ritual book 3) (2015) * Shrouded Echoes (Ritual book 4) (2016) == Media == *Monsters Who Murder - an Australian crime podcast hosted by Howard and Robert McKnight (2018-present) *Behind True Crime - Amanda Howard, The Serial Killer Whisperer (11 August 2017) *Australian True Crime - Serial Killer Whisperer Amanda Howard - #49 (10 May 2018) * Amanda on 'The Feed' - SBS Television. == References == == External links == * Website * YouTube Channel * Trove Citation Category:Australian non-fiction crime writers Category:Non-fiction crime books Category:True crime Category:Women crime writers Category:Australian non-fiction writers Category:Non-fiction genres Category:1973 births Category:Living people Category:Australian crime writers ","title":"Amanda Howard"},{"id":"60377064","text":"Acacia calamifolia foliage Acacia calamifolia, commonly known as wallowa or reed-leaf wattle, is a shrub or tree belonging to the genus Acacia and the subgenus Phyllodineae endemic to south eastern parts of Australia. ==Description== The rounded shrub typically grows to a height of with some individuals reaching as high as the width of the plant is usually .

Other synonyms include; Acacia microcarpa var. linearis, Acacia pulverulenta and Acacia uncinata. The specific epithet is taken from the Latin words calamus meaning reed and folium meaning leaf in reference to the shape of the phyllodes. ==Distribution== The shrub is found in South Australia from the Flinders Ranges in the north south to the Tothill Ranges in the northern Mount Lofty Ranges and east to Broken Hill and central parts of New South Wales. It is often a part of woodland and open scrubland communities where it grows in a variety of soil types different soils. It is also found in north western Victoria. ==Cultivation== The shrub is planted as medium-sized ornamental wattle that is suitable as a low shelter plant. It can tolerate full sun or part shade and prefers a well-drained soil but can endure short periods of water logging. It is drought and frost tolerant to . It makes good habitat for bird life and the seeds are and an important part of the Mallee fowl's diet. ==See also== List of Acacia species ==References== calamifolia Category:Flora of South Australia Category:Flora of New South Wales Category:Flora of Queensland Category:Flora of Victoria (Australia) Category:Plants described in 1824 Category:Taxa named by John Lindley ","title":"Acacia calamifolia"},{"id":"60377090","text":"Sodari is the Hindu Caste group particularly living in Nepal, India and other places. == Origin of Sodari Caste == Some Chand, who migrated from Kannauj to Katyoor state in the north-west to save religion and culture, made his strong social presence in Katyoor (Kalikumaon, Garhwal, Champawat) after the Muslims ended the Dynasty in the Kannauj, ruled by Gautam Gotri Chand. Then the Sultan Chand cleverly occupied the Katyoor kingdom and established the rule of the Chand dynasty. Chand dynasty was established in the 11th century and ruled over 800 years in Katyoor. The Chand dynasty seems to have established rules over Kumaon, Garhwal, Champawat, Kangra and the former Mahakali, Doti through the Karnali river. During this period, the descendants of Randhaula Chand and Ganadhaula Chand, Ranadeau, Udaydeu, Bhanadeau and Jasudeau who came to Baitadi from Kumaon Garhwal area in the 14th century, have a history of living in different areas of Baitadi. In this way, the four brothers, who came to Baitadi from Kumaon Garhwal, middle brother Udaydeu Chand lived in the Swarad area of Baitadi while the elder Ranadeau lived in the mid-Baitadi area. Similarly, Bhanadeau headed east to Baitadi, but the younger brother Jasudeu who had returned to Kumaon said that Baitadi did not look right. In this way, the descendants of Udaydeu Chand, who lives in Swarad of Baitadi, spread to the Swarad area. About 300 years ago, from the lower Swarad of Baitadi. Hari Chand one of the descendants of the Udaydeu migrated to Kalagaun in the north- west of Headquarter Mangalsen in Achham district.There are different views based on different people's efforts on this point. Some say that Chand's three brothers came from Swarad, Baitadi and settled in Dyanla Land near Badpipalbazar of Kalagaun and some say that they first went to Dullu of Dailekh District and settled in the Nimayal of Sigaudi, Dailekh for some time after that they migrated to the Dyanla Land of Kalagaun. The land where Chand Brother was living was named as Dyanla Land. It was said that Sodari's ancestors have faced different challenges in terms of living here. while three brothers were returning from Paduka pilgrimage, during the fight with the ruler of Binayak It is said that one of the brothers of Chand Thakuri was cut off. It is still disputed that one of the three brothers was cut off. Some say that the oldest brother has been cut off, while others say that the middle brother has been cut off. However, the Gautam tribe, Madhyayani Branch, three prawar Soradi Chand Thakuri have been living in the present Kalagaun of Achham District. Ruling ruler and caste-majority people forced Chand Thakuri to marry Jupal Rawal and other castes due to which Chand Thakuri had changed caste to Swaradi. Thus, there is evidence that the ancestors of Jupal Prithu Rawal changed Chand Thakuri caste to Swaradi and during the period it was misread as Sodari but before 1990 B.S., Caste was written as \\"Swaradi\\", it is mention in the Kashyapatra of 1991 BS. As the descendants of Sodari grow in Kalagaun, Achham, the water, land, and forests of the place seem to have taken over. Because there are so many fields for rice, corn, wheat, and millet. In due course of time, sodari from Kalagaun VDC migrated to Thana, Jupu, Veragaon of Batulasain VDC, Toli, Layati, Dhanras of Surkhet district, Solta, Katase, Baunia, Lamki, Dhangadhi, Chauri, Khairifanta, Tikapur, Shantipur of Bardia District, Banke, Katasipur of Dang District and Kathmandu etc. So far, the population of Sodari has been 3000-4000. == Local Governance of Sodari Caste == Thus, as the descendants of Hari Chand move forward, Balbhadra Sodari is said to have used Jimwali in Kalagaun of Achham. Balrame, the eldest son of Jimwal Balbhadra, has a history of using his Jimuwali throughout the area. He used his Jimmwali between Banatoli and Jupu VDCs from the Judikha Stream to Pacela of Santada VDC. Then the vocal tradition began. The history of Kapore Sodari, Gangu Sodari, Mane Sodari, Dhanapati Sodari, Dhan Singh Sodari, Nand Singh Sodari, Bal Bahadur Sodari has been used chiefly by their heads, prices, penalties, distinctions respectively. Among these chiefs, the most famous of the jimuwal and Mukhiya is Balarame Sodari and Nand Singh Sodari. During his tenure, he was known to counterparts up to Doti, Achham, Bajura, Jumla, Kalikot and Dailekh. In 1990 BS, During the Rana regime Pati Pauwa was constructed in Kalagaun. During the Rana regime, the prisoners were brought in, the robbers were brought in, and the government officials or employees came to live in the area. The prisoners were kept in a room on the south side of the building. It is one floor high and has got 2 rooms in ground floor and 3 room in first floor. There was no light in the room, and in the middle room there is a large pole that binds the prisoner. In front of it is a place to put a horse. The upper rooms are made up for living purpose. The building is still there. Nowadays it is used as post box office. Since the building was a physical infrastructure and the area lies center of Achham district, the goods office was set up to make the headquarter. Due to the short-sightedness and inability of the local leaders of that time, the goods are reported to have gone to Mangalsen after a long time and became the headquarter. == References == Category:Ethnic groups in Nepal Category:Nepali-language surnames Category:Hindu communities Category:Khas people Category:Kshatriya communities Category:Castes Category:Ethnic groups in India ","title":"Sodari (caste)"},{"id":"60377091","text":"Kashani Island is a small uninhabited island located close to the shore of the Tanzanian island of Pemba.

Soon following his arrest in connection with the murder of maid Augusta Steinbach, Schmidt committed suicide in his jail cell. After searching through his properties, he was connected to the murders of three more women, with additional located jewelry and watches indicating possible other victims in New York and Missouri. ==Biography== ===Early life=== Born as the illegitimate son of a Prussian junker, Schmidt was reportedly educated in Heidelberg, and often engaged in duels, resulting in several scars on his face. He escaped military service by moving to America, arriving in Lakewood Township, New Jersey with his wife Anita Darsch and daughter Gertrude in 1913, under the name of Emil Braun. He opened a small jewelry shop in the town and established his home in a small rented cottage. Shortly after his arrival, his wife disappeared, with Helmuth claiming that she had returned to Berlin, along with the female servant Margaret \\"Greta\\" Darsch, with whom he had a love affair. When Darsch vanished, Schmidt explained to his daughter that she had married and travelled to Denmark. Schmidt later married Adele Ulrich from New York through a matrimonial advertisement, buying a house using her money. He later abandoned Ulrich and left Lakewood in 1914, after collecting $1,500 by fraudulently selling his home. When she was later questioned, Ulrich revealed that on one night, he tried to kill her by ramming their automobile into a tree. She was thrown out of the car, and while laying on the ground, Schmidt began savagely beating her. Ulrich was barely saved, as at that moment a car passed by them. She later told of the event to the attending physician, who threatened to have Schmidt arrested if she were to disappear. Not only that, but Ulrich also informed the police of another time when he flew into a violent rage with threats of taking her life, as a result of her inquiry about why the old well in the house wasn't used. From there, Schmidt moved to Royal Oak, Michigan, assuming the name of Herman Neugebauer and finding himself work as a mechanic in one of the local Ford factories. ===Murder of Steinbach and suicide=== In 1916, with the help of George Rolfe and his wife, Schmidt put out two matrimonial ads in the New York Herald, one under his assumed name of Neugebauer. These ads attracted the attention of 40-year-old domestic servant Augusta Steinbach, who, after corresponding with Rolfe for a few months, set out to marry the mysterious man, bringing with herself around $500 and some jewelry. In February 1917, she told her long-time friend and fellow servant Agnes Domanie about her intentions to marry the man in Detroit, departing to the city in March. A few days after she left, she wrote to Ms. Domanie, describing enthusiastically her husband-to-be, as well as asking her friend to send three trunks of clothes stored in a nearby warehouse. Domanie complied with the request, but three months later, her package was returned by the company, with them explaining that they couldn't locate the woman. Following this, Ms. Domanie wrote to the authorities in Detroit. Three months after her request, she was visited by Sheriff O. H. P. Green who spoke with her, but failed to locate Steinbach. He soon committed suicide, burning all papers related to the case. Despite this, Ms. Domanie continued to insist on the police listening to her. Eventually, Glen Gillespie, the District Attorney of Oakland County, came to visit her. After carefully examining the case, he located the elusive man from the ads: Helmuth Schmidt. Upon his arrest, Helmuth confessed that he had burned Steinbach's body, but alleged that she had killed herself with poison following his refusal to instantly marry her and a subsequent quarrel on March 11. Fearing that his wife and daughter would return soon from the cinema, Schmidt dragged the body to the cellar, lifted it through a window and then buried it under his porch. Three months after the incident, he claimed that he dug up the body, cut it up with a cleaver and then burned the pieces in the furnace. However, the family's strange actions were recalled by suspicious neighbors who thought they were German spies or murderers. On the night that Steinbach had disappeared, a woman's shrieks were heard from the Schmidt household, and soon after, a huge fire was lit in their furnace. The fire was so furious, that smoke and sparks were reported as coming out of the chimney. The following morning, Mrs. Schmidt was seen carrying a pan full of ashes and other matter, which she dumped into a small stream. After his confession, the authorities decided to go for a lunch break. However, ten minutes later, a large crash was heard from the cell area. Schmidt had crawled under his bed, lifted it and then dropped it on his head, crushing his skull. His funeral was later attended only by his former wife, Adele Ulrich. ===Investigation=== Despite Schmidt's death, the police continued to investigate the deceased's history, discovering several other previous marriages, along with other women who've gone missing who had connections to him. Among them were the following: * Mrs. John Switt of New York - claimed that Schmidt had married her under the name John Switt in 1914. * Mrs. Emil Brown of New York - a stenographer for the Hupfel Brewing Company, married Schmidt in 1915 at Lakewood; he later claimed she deserted him and took money * Irma Pallatinus - housekeeper; accompanied him from Lakewood to Detroit in 1915, disappeared soon after. * Mrs. Helmuth Schmidt of Chicago - she married him in 1916, after which he robbed her of $2,000 and then deserted; when she was later shown a picture of him, she identified Schmidt as her husband. According to the authorities, Schmidt planned to accumulate money in order to return to Germany, where he would live as an aristocrat. Not only that, but one of his former wives, Adele Ulrich, also alleged that he was a German spy, tasked with making sketches of fortifications in New York's harbor. County authorities continued investigating Schmidt's properties, planning to excavate several places in them. Among them was the abandoned well, in which prosecutor Richard Plumer believed lay the bodies of both Anita Schmidt and Greta Darsch. However, a kitchen had been built over it, so the authorities would have to excavate it. Aside from the well, the floor of the barn and an entire cement floor from the cellar would also be removed. ===Discovery of bodies=== Under the direction of Constable William T. Mason, a gang of men was mobilized to search the Schmidt household in Lakewood, but nothing was found that could shed light on the disappearances. The search party then attempted to examine the well using grappling hooks, but they got caught up at the bottom of the well, postponing the investigation until the next day. The barn was later examined, but it was determined through the undisturbed soil that nobody had been buried at that location. Despite this, Prosecutor Gillespie wrote to Mr. Plumer, detailing the house and suggesting possible hiding spaces for where the bodies could be. The following day, a diver was sent in to investigate the well, an event which gathered a large crowd. Eventually, one of the hooks caught on to something that refused to budge, further increasing the crowd's excitement. The diver gave a little slack to his rope and jerked it quickly, with the resulting sound making it clear that there was nothing more than metallic structures at the bottom. After this discovery, Prosecutor Plumer set his eyes on a garage which was on the property. Soon after the officials gave up on excavating the property, a workman throwing up his last shovel of dirt uncovered a body wrapped up in a canvas under the cemented floor of the garage. The body was later identified as that of Irma Pallatinus by her sister, Mrs. Edward Rederer, using a strand of her hair. Further examination revealed that she had been strangled with a clothes line. While discussing the case, Adele Ulrich noted that Schmidt had allowed her to take a small peek into the cellar, where she later alleged the authorities would most likely find the bodies of Anita Schmidt and Greta Darsch. == See also == * List of serial killers in the United States ==References== ==Bibliography== * * Category:1876 births Category:1918 deaths Category:Male serial killers Category:American serial killers Category:American male criminals Category:American mass murderers Category:German mass murderers Category:German serial killers Category:20th- century criminals Category:German emigrants to the United States Category:American people of Prussian descent Category:Serial killers who committed suicide in prison custody Category:Suicides in Michigan Category:People from Rostock Category:American confidence tricksters ","title":"Helmuth Schmidt"},{"id":"60377241","text":"Alte Hehlenriede is a river of Lower Saxony, Germany.

The computer was designed as an alarm center allowing use of several CPUs (6502, Z80, 8086, 68000) and operating systems. The company introduced an IBM PC compatible in early 1986 and the West PC-800 line was phased out. ==History== West Computer AS was founded in late 1983 by Tov Westby, Terje Holen and Geir St√•le S√¶tre. In early 1984, the company presented its computer then called Sherlock at the Mikrodata'84 fair. The new computer had both 6502 and Z80 CPUs, promised rich expansion capabilities and included two rather unusual features: a wireless keyboard and an alarm device reporting fire, flood or burglary via phone and the built-in modem. The machine was released in Autumn 1984 at the Sj√∏lyst \\"Home and Hobby\\" fair. West PC 800 did not sell as well as expected, probably due to weak Apple II position in Norway, and West Computer AS announced in late 1985 an IBM PC compatible West PC 1600. In March 1985, price of basic computer was NOK10,200. Additional package with one floppy disk drive (200 KB unformatted capacity), 3 applications and 3 games was available for NOK3,750 and another floppy disk drive for NOK3,300. ==Features== West Computer designed its computer primarily as an alarm center with emphasis also as a game machine (thanks to the Apple II compatibility). From ca. serial no. 100 the machine became Apple II Plus compatible due to an updated BIOS. Built-in software included two BASIC variants (one for 6502, one for Z80), but available was only an old basic variant for 6502 (for full Apple Basic compatibility). Disk drives are controlled by West DOS (similar to Apple DOS), whose commands are accessible directly from BASIC. However, ProDOS - at the time of the machine introduction - was not compatible with the West DOS. Z80 CPU was available for CP/M compatibility. As access to the Z80 is via 6502, its performance is crippled by design. The company offered additional CPU cards (e.g. Z80B 6 MHz) to improve the performance. Alarm system is independent on the machine and has its own CPU and memory. Supplied 300/300 baud modem can work as an autodial modem, included is also telephone number database. Modem can be connected to sensors and during an alarm situation, the machine will dial selected number(s). Alarm system works also with wearable \\"panic button\\" with an infrared transmitter - computer may even dial another number, if the first desired is not responding. Keyboard offers 20 function keys and Caps Lock, with another key to turn keyboard ON and OFF. Wireless keyboard is able to operate up to 12‚Äì15 meters from the machine for about three hours (recharging takes 16 hours). West PC-800 can take several CPU cards including MS-DOS package (NOK3,000) and Motorola 68000 (NOK7-12,000) expansion cards. There was even a Motorola 6809 CPU card for OS-9 compatibility. The computer allows cassette and floppy disk drive data storage. Standard floppy disk drive (FDD) had 142 KB formatted capacity (Apple II compatible) and there were several other storage options e.g. additional FDD 655 KB, 128 KB RAM disk or hard disk drives up to 20 MB. West PC-800 offers rich expansion capabilities thanks to the Apple II compatible expansion bus with 7 expansion slots (some are occupied in the standard configuration e.g. by an alarm card or RF modulator). === Hardware details === * 4 microprocessors: ** Z80A 4 MHz CPU for CP/M ** 6502 1 MHz CPU for Apple II ** 8400 CPU for alarm and modem (300 baud) ** 8035 CPU for in the keyboard * 64KB RAM (expandable to 192 kB or up to 1 MB with additional CPU card) * 18KB ROM (10 KB BASIC, 2 KB system monitor, 2 KB character set, 4 KB alarm/modem) * Ports: ** Joystick.

Especially lauded were alarm features and high flexibility of the machine design. On the other hand, graphics capabilities were found dated by 1985 standards and support for some of the platforms rather rudimentary (e.g. supplied only an old MSDOS version, issue with Z80 speed without another CPU card, limited data transfer on available floppy disk drive). Review in Hjemme-Data magazine concluded, it is hard to judge the computer, as it stands too outside of the regular market. == Marketing == The PC-800 campaign in 1984. West Computers choose the advertising agency N√¶ss og M√∏rch with J√∏rgen Gulvik as Creative Director for the introduction campaign for this new home computer before the Christmas sales 1984. Together with Founder Tov Westby and CEO Fredrik Stange they designed this ad, which won in 1985 an award from the Norwegian Advertising Association as the best advertising for consumer products in 1984. Apple would use the same picture in their advertising for the Think Different campaign in 1997. ==Notes== == References == == External links == * Facebook group for discussing the West PC-800 * More pictures of the West PC-800 * West PC-800 emulator * *Vision and concept for the development of Norway's first home computer with immediate benefit!

At the 2016 World Junior Curling Championships, Ramsfjell led his team of Bendik Ramsfjell, Magnus V√•gberg, Elias H√∏stm√¶lingen and Eskil Vintervold to a 5-4 round robin record, missing the playoffs. At the 2017 World Junior Curling Championships, his team improved to a 6-3 round robin record, which put them in a tiebreaker game against Canada's Tyler Tardi rink for the final playoff spot. They beat Canada in the tiebreaker game, but lost to Scotland's Cameron Bryce in the 3 vs. 4 game. This put them in the bronze medal game, where they faced Scotland again. This time, they would beat the Scots to claim the bronze medal. At the 2018 World Junior Curling Championships, Ramsfjell would skip a new team which consisted of Kristian Foss, Michael Mellemseter, Andreas H√•rstad and J√∏rgen Myran. This team would be less successful, finishing with a 4-5 record, missing the playoffs. The team played in the 2019 World Junior Curling Championships (with Foss off the team). The team squeaked into the playoffs with a 6-3 record. However, they lost to Canada (Tardi) in the semifinal and Scotland (Ross Whyte) in the bronze medal game to finish fourth. A month after the 2019 World Juniors, Ramsfjell skipped Team Norway at the 2019 Winter Universiade. His team of Martin Sesaker, Bendik Ramsfjell and Gaute Nepstad went on to win the gold medal. Later that month, Ramsfjell and his junior rink would compete at the 2019 World Men's Curling Championship, finishing 12th with a 2-10 record.

Each Story card also contains a short piece of narrative that players can use to inspire their own story-telling. For example, one card reads, \\"Inside, Wallace found himself face-to-face with a once friendly acquaintance.\\" ** and Pace cards (usually with one word or phrase printed on them such as Unexpectedly, Just As, Afterward, etc.) * a sheet of rules * a plastic ziplock bag In 1985, a 16-page magazine was added that included rules for 4 players in two teams; rules for solitaire play; supplementary cards; and a sample character sheet. ==Gameplay== Two players vie over the fate of a fictional character. One of the players takes the role of \\"Life\\" and the other \\"Death\\". The players first choose who will play which role, Life or Death. Life gets more points for playing Locality, Neutral Character, and Escape cards; Death gets more points for Evil Character, Danger, and End cards. Both players receive the same number of points for playing Start, Save, Atmosphere, and Threat cards. The players draw one Story card each from the deck and then work together to invent a fictional character and background. Once the character has been created, Life draws another Story card, and then can either lay down one Story card on the table, tallying points for it; or pass on the opportunity to play. If Life plays a card, the player creates a narrative about the fictional character in keeping with the card played. Death then draws a Story card and can either play a card or pass, adding to the narrative story if a card is played. Play alternates between the two. Each Story card has a symbol indicating what types of Story cards can be played after it. For example, the Story card quoted above about Wallace meeeting a former friend can only be followed by an Escape card or a Death card. Players who cannot play a legal card after drawing from the Story deck must pass, increasing the number of cards in their hand by one. A player can also pass in order not to play a card that would be advantageous to the other player. A player can only hold a maximum of five cards. If, due to several instances of passing, a player's hand grows to 6 cards, the player is penalized 3 points, and then discards any number of cards. Players also have an opportunity to discard any number of cards at the end of each story segment, when the protagonist escapes, is killed or is saved. Some Story cards have a symbol indicating that the next player must play a card from their hand before drawing a card from the Story deck. If the player is unable to play a legal card or has no Story cards, the player draws and plays a Pace card, which awards no points to either player. The game ends when the Story card deck is exhausted. If the protagonist is killed before the deck is exhausted, the players make up another fictional character and continue with the game. The player who has tallied the most points when the Story deck is exhausted is the winner. ==Reception== In the Jan-Feb 1985 edition of Space Gamer (Issue No. 72) Frederick Paul Kiesche III and Warren Spector liked the game, saying, \\"Dark Cults gets the highest recommendation. It is quite addictive, and can be used as inspiration for horror RPG scenarios. [...] Dark Cults isn't going to be everyone's cup of tea, but if you're a budding writer, or a roleplayer who enjoys the roles as much as the playing, or if you're just a lover of ghost stores, Dark Cults may be what the doctor ordered. Just don't play it in the dark.\\" In the April 1989 issue of Games International (Issue #4), Paul Mason calls this \\"like no card game you ever played before.\\" Mason believed that the great strength of the game lay not in the play of cards but in the narrative aspect, calling the points scoring \\"merely a sideshow to the main attraction.\\" He did warn that the story-telling aspect would appeal to some and not others, saying, \\"It's certainly not one for the gamer who likes the anonymity of burying himself in piles of rules [...] You'll like the game in direct proportion to the extent you like exercising your imagination.\\" He concluded by giving the game an above-average rating of 4 out of 5. In the April 1994 edition of Dragon (Issue 204), Lester Smith considered the game \\"worthy of attention\\", although he disliked the name Dark Cults since it \\"doesn‚Äôt really have much of anything to do with cults.\\" Smith's only criticism of the game was that the story never ended on a satisfactory note since the game abruptly ended when the Story deck was exhausted. But he concluded by giving the game an above average rating of 5 out of 6, saying, \\"That is a relatively minor complaint to make, considering how much fun the game is overall.\\" ==References== Category:Card games introduced in 1983 ","title":"Dark Cults"},{"id":"60377725","text":"Ahmed Chahrour is a Syrian wrestler.

Hoya bilobata is just one of over 200 species of the genus Hoya. == Description == Hoya bilobata is an evergreen perennial that is generally found trailing, but can have a climbing habit that grows to 24 inches or longer. H. bilobata can be considered either an epiphyte or a lithophyte. The H. bilobata leaves have a variable, sub- orbicular or broadly elliptic shape, with the leaf base being rounded to sub- acute and the leaf apex being obtuse-rounded. The adaxial surface of the leaves are a dull, olive-green colour with the abaxial surface being a lighter green. Leaves are generally 1.7‚Äì2.2 cm in length and 1.3‚Äì1.8 cm in width. Previous to the discovery of Hoya minutiflora, H. bilobata had the smallest recorded flowers of a Hoya. The flower clusters, or umbels, of H. bilobata have light pink petals that spread apart, with the tips curving upwards, to expose their yellow/pink central crowns. H. bilobata flowers have a mild, sweet fragrance. Each umbel can have up to 25 flowers. The umbels are produced from a peduncle 1‚Äì3 cm in length, with the petals of the flowers being only 6‚Äì7 mm in diameter. == Taxonomy == Hoya bilobata was originally collected on the Philippine island of Mindanao, and sent to Dr. Rudolph Schlechter, a German economic botanist, who first described it in 1906. H. bilobata is one of the many small leaved and flowered Hoyas belonging to Schlechter's section Acanthostemma. Acanthostemma species are characterised as having flowers with hairy corollas, coronas with outer lobes ending in two inward turning lateral extensions, and petal lobes that are completely revolute. A study by Wanntorp et al. (2006) found Hoya bilobata to be most closely related to Hoya heuschkeliana, as far as recognised species go, through sequencing of nuclear and chloroplast DNA. == Cultivation == Hoya plants often mislabelled as Hoya bilobata or Hoya tsangii in garden centers and big-box stores are actually Hoya sp. DS-70. This happens because the foliages of the three species so closely resemble each other, it is nearly impossible to differentiate between them without seeing the blooms of the plant. The difference between H. bilobata and H. sp. DS-70 is that the leaves of bilobata are non-pubescent and the flowers are smaller. This makes finding an actual H. bilobata more difficult to find than the H. sp ds70. Hoya bilobata prefers temperatures between 60‚Äì95 ¬∞F. Outdoors, it can be grown in a bright shaded area, and indoors it does best in bright indirect light. Like most hoyas, Hoya bilobata should be potted in a light, airy potting medium. A good mix is equal parts sphagnum moss, perlite, and orchid bark which will allow for sufficient drainage to prevent root rot. Hoya species tend to grow better in smaller pots, which allows for their roots to become pot-bound. This can also encourage flowering. Propagation can easily be done by separation or stem cuttings. Cuttings must have at least one node from which roots can grow from. Cuttings can be rooted directly in soil although this does not tend to be as successful, or they can be rooted in water or dampened sphagnum moss and then transferred to soil once adequate roots have been established. == References == bilobata ","title":"Hoya bilobata"},{"id":"60377781","text":"The 1989 Big Eight Men's Basketball Tournament was held March 10‚Äì12 at Kemper Arena in Kansas City, Missouri.

The broadcast operation is widely used in parallel algorithms, such as matrix-vector multiplication, Gaussian elimination and shortest paths. The Message Passing Interface implements broadcast in \`MPI_Bcast\`.MPI: A Message-Passing Interface StandardVersion 3.0, Message Passing Interface Forum, pp. 148, 2012 == Definition == A message M [1 .. m]of length n should be distributed from one node to all other p-1 nodes. T_\\\\text{byte}is the time it takes to send one byte. T_\\\\text{start}is the time it takes for a message to travel to another node, independent of its length. Therefore, the time to send a package from one node to another is t = size*T_\\\\text{byte} + T_\\\\text{start}. p is the number of nodes and the number of processors. == Binomial Tree Broadcast Michael Ikkert, T. Kieritz, P. Sanders Parralele Algorithme - Script (German), Karlsruhe Institute of Technology, pp. 29-32, 2009 == Binomial Tree Broadcast With Binomial Tree Broadcast the whole message is sent at once. Each node that has already received the message sends it on further. This grows exponentially as each time step the amount of sending nodes is doubled. The algorithm is ideal for short messages but falls short with longer ones as during the time when the first transfer happens and only one node is busy.

The time needed to distribute the first message piece is p t = \\\\frac{m}{k} T_\\\\text{byte} + T_\\\\text{start} whereby t is the time needed to send a package from one processor to another. Sending a whole message takes ( p + k )( \\\\frac{mT_\\\\text{byte}}{k} + T_\\\\text{start} ) = (p + k) t = p t + k t. Optimal is to choose k = \\\\sqrt{ \\\\frac{ m (p-2) T_\\\\text{byte} }{T_\\\\text{start} } } resulting in a runtime of approximately m T_\\\\text{byte} + p T_\\\\text{start} + \\\\sqrt{m p T_\\\\text{start} T_\\\\text{byte}} The run time is dependent on not only message length but also the number of processors that play roles. This approach shines when the length of the message is much larger than the amount of processors. Message M := [m_1, m_2, ..., m_n] id = node number for (i := 1; i <= n; i++) in parallel if (id != 0) blocking_receive m_i if (id != n) send m_i to node id + 1 == Pipelined Binary Tree Broadcast == Pipelined Binary Tree Broadcast This algorithm combines Binomial Tree Broadcast and Linear Pipeline Broadcast, which makes the algorithm work well for both short and long messages. The aim is to have as many nodes work as possible while maintaining the ability to send short messages quickly. A good approach is to use Fibonacci trees for splitting up the tree, which are a good choice as a message cannot be sent to both children at the same time. This results in a binary tree structure. We will assume in the following that communication is full-duplex. The Fibonacci tree structure has a depth of about d \\\\approx log_\\\\Phi(p)whereby \\\\Phi = \\\\frac{1+\\\\sqrt{5}}{2}the golden ratio. The resulting runtime is (\\\\frac{m}{k}T_\\\\text{byte} + T_\\\\text{start})(d + 2k - 2). Optimal is k = \\\\sqrt{\\\\frac{n (d-2) T_\\\\text{byte} }{ 3T_\\\\text{start}}}. This results in a runtime of 2mT_\\\\text{byte} + T_\\\\text{start} log_\\\\Phi(p) + \\\\sqrt{2m log_\\\\Phi(p) T_\\\\text{start} T_\\\\text{byte}}. Message M := [m_1, m_2, ..., m_k] for i = 1 to k if (hasParent()) blocking_receive m_i if (hasChild(left_child)) send m_i to left_child if (hasChild(right_child)) send m_i to right_child == Two Tree Broadcast (23-Broadcast) Michael Ikkert, T. Kieritz, P. Sanders Parralele Algorithme - Script (German), Karlsruhe Institute of Technology, pp.33-37, 2009P. Sanders (German), Karlsruhe Institute of Technology, pp. 82-96, 2018 == Visualization of Two Tree Broadcast === Definition === This algorithm aims to improve on some disadvantages of tree structure models with pipelines. Normally in tree structure models with pipelines (see above methods), leaves receive just their data and cannot contribute to send and spread data. The algorithm concurrently uses two binary trees to communicate over. Those trees will be called tree A and B. Structurally in binary trees there are relatively more leave nodes than inner nodes. Basic Idea of this algorithm is to make a leaf node of tree A be an inner node of tree B. It has also the same technical function in opposite side from B to A tree. This means, two packets are sent and received by inner nodes and leaves in different steps. === Tree construction === Examples of tree structures depending on the number of processors The number of steps needed to construct construct two parallel- working binary trees is dependent on the amount of processors. Like with other structures one processor can is the root node who sends messages to two trees. It is not necessary to set a root node, because it is not hard to recognize that the direction of sending messages in binary tree is normally top to bottom. There is no limitation on the number of processors to build two binary trees. Let the height of the combined tree be . Tree A and B can have a height of h -1 . Especially, if the number of processors correspond to p = 2^h - 1 , we can make both sides trees and a root node. To construct this model efficiently and easily with a fully built tree, we can use two methods called \\"Shifting\\" and \\"Mirroring\\" to get second tree. Let assume tree A is already modelled and tree B is supposed to be constructed based on tree A. We assume that we have p processors ordered from 0 to p-1 . ==== Shifting ==== Tree construction using \\"Shifting\\" The \\"Shifting\\" method, first copies tree A and moves every node one position to the left to get tree B. The node, which will be located on -1, becomes a child of processor p-2 . ==== Mirroring ==== Tree construction using mirroring \\"Mirroring\\" is ideal for an even number of processors. With this method tree B can be more easily constructed by tree A, because there are no structural transformations in order to create the new tree. In addition, a symmetric process makes this approach simple. This method can also handle an odd number of processors, in this case, we can set processor p-1 as root node for both trees. For the remaining processors \\"Mirroring\\" can be used. === Coloring === We need to find a schedule in order to make sure that no processor has to send or receive two messages from two trees in a step. The edge, is a communication connection to connect two nodes, and can be labelled as either 0 or 1 to make sure that every processor can alternate between 0 and 1-labelled edges. The edges of and can be colored with two colors (0 and 1) such that * no processor is connected to its parent nodes in and using edges of the same color- * no processor is connected to its children nodes in or using edges of the same color. In every even step the edges with 0 are activated and edges with 1 are activated in every odd step. === Time complexity === In this case the number of packet k is divided in half for each tree. Both trees are working together the total number of packets k = k/2 + k/2 (upper tree + bottom tree) In each binary tree sending a message to another nodes takes 2*i steps until a processor has at least a packet in step i. Therefore, we can calculate all steps as d := log_2 (p+1) => log_2(p+1) \\\\approx log_2(p) . The resulting run time is T(m,p,k) \\\\approx (\\\\frac{m}{k}T_\\\\text{byte} + T_\\\\text{start})(2d + k - 1). (Optimal k = \\\\sqrt{\\\\frac{m (2d-1) T_\\\\text{byte} }{ T_\\\\text{start}}}) This results in a run time of T(m,p) \\\\approx mT_\\\\text{byte} + T_\\\\text{start} * 2log_2 (p) + \\\\sqrt{m *2log_2 (p) T_\\\\text{start} T_\\\\text{byte}}. == ESBT-Broadcasting (Edge-disjoint Spanning Binomial Trees)Michael Ikkert, T. Kieritz, P. Sanders Parralele Algorithme - Script (German), Karlsruhe Institute of Technology, pp.40-42, 2009P. Sanders (German), Karlsruhe Institute of Technology, pp. 101-104, 2018 == In this section, another broadcasting algorithm with an underlying telephone communication model will be introduced. A Hypercube creates network system with p = 2^d (d = 0,1,2,3,...) . Every node is represented by binary {0,1} depending on the number of dimensions. Fundamentally ESBT(Edge-disjoint Spanning Binomial Trees) is based on hypercube graphs, pipelining( m messages are divided by k packets) and binomial trees. The Processor 0^d cyclically spreads packets to roots of ESBTs. The roots of ESBTs broadcast data with binomial tree. To leave all of k from p_0, k steps are required, because all packets are distributed by p_0 . It takes another d steps until the last leaf node receives the packet. In total d+ k steps are necessary to broadcast m message through ESBT. The resulting run time is T(m,p,k) = (\\\\frac{m}{k}T_\\\\text{byte} + T_\\\\text{start})(k+d). (k = \\\\sqrt{\\\\frac{m d T_\\\\text{byte} }{ T_\\\\text{start}}}). This results in a run time of T(m,p) := mT_\\\\text{byte} + dT_\\\\text{start} + \\\\sqrt{mdT_\\\\text{start} T_\\\\text{byte}}. == See also == * Reduce (parallel pattern) * Reduction Operator == References == Category:Parallel computing Category:Algorithms ","title":"Broadcast (parallel pattern)"},{"id":"60378327","text":"The Shepherd Lassie of Argyle is a 1914 British silent drama film directed by Laurence Trimble and starring Florence Turner, Rex Davis and Hector Dion.Low p.300 ==Cast== * Florence Turner as Mary Lachan * Rex Davis as Alan MacPherson * Hector Dion as The MacPherson * Clifford Pembroke as Lachlan * Isobel Carma as Isobel * Arnold Rayner as The Maniac ==References== ==Bibliography== * Low, Rachael.

Initially held in January, the event has been set in March or April since 2006. FLUKE aims to maintain a smaller environment than other, larger comic conventions. Initially held at the now- defunct bar Tasty World, the festival has taken place at Athens' 40 Watt Club for many years. It has been considered a premier destination for alternative comics in the Southeastern United States. ==Background== Fluke was established in January 2002 by cartoonist T. Edward Bak. He founded the festival after the previous year's Small Press Expo was cancelled in the wake of the September 11 attacks. The name of the festival comes from the fact that its genesis was by chance, or a fluke. For its second year, Bak asked for help organizing the event from cartoonist Patrick Dean and 'zine publisher Robert Newsome, who ended up absorbing the festival from him and serving as its organizers in the years since. The mission statement for the festival states: The 2018 FLUKE fest Co-organizer Newsome has described Fluke as a \\"glorified zine swap\\". For much of its first decade, FLUKE was held upstairs in Tasty World, a local bar and music venue. Since 2011, it has been held at the 40 Watt Club. It took place in January each year initially until an ice storm struck the day of the show, after which it was moved to March‚ÄìApril. The 40 Watt keeps an open bar during the event, and some years have featured complimentary cake for exhibitors. In addition to up-and-coming creators, FLUKE often features appearances from local established artists such as Joey Weiser, Eleanor Davis, and Drew Weing.

Zainab Salbi called her \\"Tina Fey of the Arab world\\" during an interview with the young actress, in New York at the Woman in the World Summit. After earning an MFA degree in producing and screenwriting at RSICA, Shomali joined the YouTube show Bath Bayakha, where she was first recognized for her work as a writer and actress. Later in 2012, she founded her own production company which she called Filmizion Productions, and through the company, she created and starred in her first Web series titled Femaleshow. The show attracted millions of viewers from across the region online, which led to it being aired on different TV stations around the region. Becky Anderson described her as a national phenomena in a CNN interview with the young filmmaker. Currently, she is working on creating the second original Arabic Netflix series, in collaboration with her Jordanian production company Filmizion Productions, titled AlRawabi School for Girls. == Education == Shomali graduated from the University of Jordan with a BA in Business Administration and Finance, since none of the universities in Jordan at the time were offering film courses. However, after she earned her BA degree, she started participating in workshops and seminars offered by the Jordanian Royal Film Commission. After making her first short film, she applied to an MFA program at Red Sea Institute of Cinematic Arts (RSICA) that started operating in Aqaba in 2008. She graduated with an MFA in screenwriting and producing. == Career == After graduating from RSICA, Shomali made her debut as a comedy writer and lead actress in the local online comedy show Bath Bayakha. The show gained 11 million viewers on YouTube and became a huge success in the region. Shomali's success in Bath Bayakha led her to start her own production company in 2012 called Filmizion Productions. She created her own online show, which she titled Femaleshow. It started off as a show that conducted social experiments in the streets of Amman, which then Shomali would comment on through comedic monologues and skits that she wrote herself. Without attempting to change the stereotype that exists in the Arab world that claims women are not funny, Shomali became one of the most well known comedian actors in Jordan. Later, Shomali transformed Femaleshow into a fictional romantic comedy series about a couple's life through dating, engagement, marriage and pregnancy from a woman's point of you. The show attracted more than 25 million viewers, and was rated as one of the top five web series to watch in the Arab region. Shomali wanted to make Femaleshow relatable, and wanted to use it to tackle issues in Jordanian society, without speaking about the problems directly. She made her content comedic and relatable so she could place emphasis on the reality that women and Arabs in general are a part of, and change the stereotypes that exists about Arabs in the world at large. Shomali became one of the most familiar faces in the industry, and was titled one of the \\"100 Under 40: The World‚Äôs Most Influential Young Arabs\\". Shomali gained thousands of followers on her social media pages (Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter) and all her social media accounts were verified. She uses her social media influence to promote causes that she believes in, such as humans right to education, women empowerment, and youth empowerment. In 2015, Shomali went behind the camera. She started by producing a TV series titled Zain alongside Saba Mubarak. After that she worked alongside Zainab Salbi on her show Nida'a as the supervising producer. She was invited as a guest on one of the episodes of Nida'a to discuss the nature of relationships and marriage in the Arab world openly. Shomali went back in front of the camera when she hosted an entertainment chat show in the UAE called Dardachat that was aired on Al-Emarat Channel. As her career moved forward in 2017, Shomali was featured in Netflix's campaign ‚ÄúShe Rules\\", by creating a short video that challenges the stereotypes that Arab women and women around the globe are constantly being associated with. In 2018, Shomali hosted Sadeem, a reality show that brings in young contestants together to compete for the title of the next digital superstar. On April 13, 2019, Shomali announced to her followers on Facebook that she is working on creating an original Arabic Netflix series, in collaboration with her Jordanian production company Filmizion Productions, titled AlRawabi School for Girls. As the show runner, writer, and director of the second original Arabic Netflix series ever, Shomali wanted to tell a story about women in the region. Working alongside the writer Shirin Kamal, the two writers created a full female cast drama series, that takes place in an all girls school and explores the ideas of revenge and bullying. The story is about a girl who gets bullied by other girls in her school, and decides to take matters into her hands in order to get revenge. When asked about the show, Director of International Originals at Netflix Simran Sethi said: > ‚ÄúWe are extremely proud to partner with Tima again to produce what is > essentially the first Middle Eastern young adult series that celebrates the > role of women, not only on screen, but behind the scenes as well. The story > brings a fresh perspective to Middle Eastern content, and we are absolutely > excited to shareAl Rawabi School for Girls with our global audiences in over > 190 countries.‚Äù Shomali's first project with Netflix was ‚ÄúShe Rules‚Äù campaign. The campaign's main goal was to celebrate women on and off screen in the television industry. When asked about the show she commented: > ‚ÄúAlRawabi School for Girls is a very dear project to my heart. It depicts > the stories and struggles of young Arab women in a light that we hadn't yet > seen before in the region, particularly with this age group. It's a show > that stems from the eyes of women about women and I am really pleased to > collaborate with Netflix and have the opportunity to tell the stories of > young women in our region on such a global platform.‚Äù == References == ==External links== * Filmizion Productions * Femaleshow Youtube channel Category:Living people Category:Jordanian film people Category:1985 births ","title":"Tima Shomali"},{"id":"60378516","text":"Werckmeister v. American Tobacco Co., 207 U.S. 375 (1907), was a United States Supreme Court case in which the Court held a copyright holder is limited to one action to collect infringing copies and statutory damages because the act's remedies are penal and must be observed without construction. Additionally, The United States is not required to be a party to copyright infringement litigation. The Copyright Act of 1870 does not specify what sort of action a litigant must bring to remedy copyright infringement. Werckmeister won an infringement claim against American Tobacco Company and United States Marshalls collected the infringing copies from the Company. Werckmeister took American Tobacco Company back to court to get the monetary damages enumerated by the Copyright Act. In the United States, a successful penal (criminal) suit may collect property and money as restitution. Because the Court determined that the infringement damages were penal, Werckmeister had the opportunity to collect the property, as they did, and the money. They were thus limited to only one action to collect both property and money, because the statute only provided for one action. == References == ==External links== * Category:1907 in United States case law Category:United States copyright case law Category:United States Supreme Court cases Category:United States Supreme Court cases of the Fuller Court ","title":"Werckmeister v.

Campbell Art Co., 214 U.S. 236 (1909), was a United States Supreme Court case in which the Court held, under the International Copyright Act of 1891, A copyright cannot be granted to a non-citizen whose country has not been acknowledged as in a reciprocal copyright arrangement with the United States by a formal presidential proclamation. Because the non-citizen is not granted a copyright, they cannot assign a copyright for a work to a citizen of a country with American copyright privileges. That citizen cannot register a copyright for the work. The case concerned the painting \\"Dolce Far Niente\\" by Daniel Hern√°ndez Morillo, a citizen of Peru. Because Peru had not entered into a mutual copyright arrangement with the United States, Hern√°ndez gave the painting to a German man named Bong. Germany had entered into such an arrangement with the United States in 1892, so Bong applied for a copyright on the painting in 1902. He wrote \\"Copyright by Rich. Bong\\" on the painting to comply with the notice requirement. Alfred S. Campbell Art Company printed 1000 copies of the painting, retitled as \\"Sunbeam\\", with the copyright notice and attributing it to Hern√°ndez. Bong sued for copyright infringement. At one point, he asserted that Hern√°ndez was Spanish because Spain had copyright relations with the United States. He also contented that the copyright should be valid because both Peru and the United States were part of the Montevideo Union, an international copyright arrangement. The Court determined that the copyright originates with the original creator, in this case Hern√°ndez. Because Hern√°ndez's citizenship mean that his works were ineligible for United States copyrights, he could not assign a right he did not possess to Bong. Bong's copyright was thus void and the painting was in the public domain when Campbell Art Company made its copies. Additionally, the Court said that the proclamation from the president was required for a country's citizens to apply for American copyrights. The United States' membership in the Montevideo Union was not sufficient without the explicit proclamation. The Court cited heavily from American Tobacco Co. v.

The company specialized in the design and manufacture of fiberglass racing sailboats.Sherwood, Richard M.: A Field Guide to Sailboats of North America, Second Edition, pages 190-191. Houghton Mifflin Company, 1994. The company was founded by Terry and Peter Alsberg in 1982 and went out of business in 1988. Terry Alsberg had previously worked for Moore Sailboats. ==History== Two Express 37s on San Francisco Bay Express 27 on San Francisco Bay The Alsberg brothers founded their company to build the Express 27, one of the first designs to be built using the vacuum bagging process. This boat was intended to compete with designs like the Moore 24 and the Olson 30 as an ultralight racer. Earlier designs in this class had proven fast on reaches and downwind, but did not go well to windward. Designer Carl Schumacher drew the Express 27 design and the company was formed to build it. The resulting boat became a quick commercial success and 117 were completed. Designer Schumacher explained the 27's design origins in a 1985 interview in Latitude 38, \\"Terry and I started off with the idea of building a boat the same weight as a Moore 24, but two feet longer. But we eventually decided on the largest possible boat that could use a single speed (Barient 10) winch for the jib, which turned out to be 27 feet.\\" The company expanded to produce two more Schumacher designs, the Express 34 and 37, both enlarged versions of the basic Express 27 design. The company went out of business in 1988, as a result of the effects of launching the company into the 1981 and 1982 recessions, plus low pricing. Founder Terry Alsberg explained, \\"we'd been building custom boats and selling them at production prices\\".

He used overseas family networks to maintain trade routes with Canton, Hong Kong, Singapore and Saigon, and later expanded into rice milling and insurance. Tan settled in Bangkok in 1871 and married a daughter of the Poshyananda family.

Although it is close to the Solar System - at 26.5 light years - it is not the closest known star in its constellation, since Gliese 661 is 20.9 light years away. The closest system to this star is the bright Œº Herculis, at 4.5 light years. They are followed by GJ 1230 and Gliese 673, at 7.2 and 7.6 light years respectively. Gliese 686 is one of the many red dwarfs in the Solar System neighborhood with a spectral type of M1V, and has an effective temperature of about 3600 K. Its brightness in the visible spectrum is equal to 0.82% of that of the Sun, while its total luminosity is equivalent to 2.7% that of the Sun, since a significant amount of the radiation emitted by these stars is infrared invisible light. Considering only this last parameter, Gliese 686 is considerably brighter than other known red dwarfs; thus, it is 6.5 times more luminous than Ross 154 and 15 times more than Proxima Centauri, the closest star to the Solar System. Gliese 686 has a radius approximately equal to half the solar radius. Its projected rotation speed is 2.5 km / s, its rotation period being equal to or less than 10.3 days. It has a metallic content lower than that of the Sun; various studies estimate its index metallicity between -0.25 and -0.44. It has an approximate mass between 45% and 49% of the solar mass and is a star with characteristics comparable to that of Lacaille 9352. == Planetary system == Gliese 686 has one known super-Earth planet detected by radial velocity. ==References== Category:Hercules (constellation) Category:M-type main-sequence stars 0686 086287 Category:Planetary systems with one confirmed planet ","title":"Gliese 686"},{"id":"60379232","text":"Brian Leigeb (born October 2, 1978) is a former professional American football defensive back.

On 19 September 1960, the DC-6, carrying American service members and dependents, collided with Mount Barrigada during the second leg of the flight, killing 80 of the 94 people on board. The disaster was Guam's deadliest aviation accident until Korean Air Flight 801 crashed on Nimitz Hill in 1997. ==Overview== The accident aircraft was manufactured in January 1956. It was originally in service with American Airlines as a freighter until World Airways purchased it sometime after October 1959. At the time of the accident, the aircraft had accumulated 12,746 flight hours. The Captain was 46-year-old Rudy J. Holman, who had logged 15,681 flight hours, including 2,548 hours in the DC-6. He had completed a proficiency check in the DC-6 the month before the crash. The first officer was 31-year-old Clayborne P. Claunch, who had logged 6,317 flight hours, including 217 hours in the DC-6. The remaining flight crew consisted of 29-year-old flight engineer Robert E. Davis and 27-year-old navigator Edgar W. Schwoyer. ==Flight== The aircraft took off from Agana Naval Air Station's runway 6L at 6:00am. The pilot made a right turn during the climbing procedure and collided with Mount Barrigada 50 seconds after takeoff. The aircraft then slid for about into thick underbrush before coming to a stop. 73 of the 86 passengers and 7 of the 8 crew members on board perished. Most of the casualties were caused by a fire that broke out shortly before the aircraft came to a stop. ==Investigation== The Civil Aeronautics Board determined that the crash was caused by the pilot's failure to adhere to standard departure procedures by making a right turn before the aircraft had climbed to 1,000 ft (305 m). ==References== Category:Accidents and incidents involving the Douglas DC-6 Category:World Airways accidents and incidents Category:Aviation accidents and incidents in the United States in 1960 Category:1960 in Guam ","title":"World Airways Flight 830"},{"id":"60379311","text":"The Gotcha Group LLC, doing business as Gotcha, is an electric bike and scooter-sharing company based in Charleston, South Carolina. Gotcha began operating bike share systems on college campuses in the United States and later expanded to scooter-sharing and other electric vehicles such as electric trike scooters. ==History== Gotcha first offered dockless bike sharing systems on college campuses and certain housing developments, and later offered taxi- like rides in electric vehicles for select markets. As scooters became popular, Gotcha expanded to scooters in some markets. Citing caution about the long-term durability of light-weight two-wheeled scooters, Gotcha began expanding service to electric trike scooters which it believed were more durable, and would allow two riders at a time. Gotcha continues to be based in Charleston, South Carolina, and also has offices in Los Angeles, Atlanta, and San Francisco. ==Equipment and usage== Gotcha offers bikes, scooters, and rides in electric vehicles to various areas, and has announced electric trike service in certain areas. Because the company operates its bike and scooter share systems in conjunction with other organizations, the rates of service vary, but typically include a per-mile rate and sometimes an initial usage fee.

He added the name Wexionensis in honor of his birthplace. His father was Magnus Petri who was vicar in V√§xj√∂. His mother was Ingerd J√∂nsdotter and had a total of eleven children, all males who became church leaders. He was educated in V√§xj√∂ and Link√∂ping and later studied at Uppsala University. After the death of his father from the plague, he left for Germany where he remained for ten years. He studied for a master's degree in Wittenberg in 1610, which studied where partly financed through a royal scholarship. Upon his return to Sweden in 1614, Wexionensis was appointed ethics professor in Uppsala University. ==Professor in Uppsala== As a professor of ethics, Wexionensis was in conflict with those who defended Ramism, including Laurentius Paulinus Gothus who was backed by the chancellor of the university Johan Skytte. In 1620, Wexionensis' ethics professorship was changed into the professorship in history, a consequence of the importance Wexionensis gave to Aristotle, above that of Petrus Ramus. However, in the 1620s, Johan Skytte's philosophical views concerning Aristotle shifted and consequently, he appointed Wexionensis as the professor of theology in 1624, a post he undertook two years after the appointment. ==Bishop== During his time at the university, he served as head for three times. He was nominated as Archbishop of Uppsala in 1636 but Axel Oxenstierna, the Lord High Chancellor of Sweden, did not view him as having the necessary authority to be Archbishop. Nevertheless, in 1640 he was appointed Bishop of Skara. He was consecrated in Stockholm on January 13, 1641 by Archbishop Laurentius Paulinus Gothus and was commissioned to commence his episcopacy in Skara on March 3. In 1641 he founded the Katedralskolan, Skara, which was also approved by Queen Christina on August 31 of the same year. In 1647 he was once more nominated for the Archbishopric of Uppsala, however he received 39 votes and was defeated by Johannes Canuti Lenaeus whom he then consecrated.Hjalmar, Holmquist (1910).

Its flagship shop is located at the corner of College Avenue and Clayton Street in downtown Athens, and is the oldest continuously operating record store in the state. The company was founded by Dan Wall and Mark Methe, and has operated several locations over the course of its history. Methe operates a shop under the Wuxtry name in Decatur, Georgia, which opened in 1978. The name also extends to Bizarro-Wuxtry, a comic shop that operates on the top floor of the Athens location, that focuses on rare comics, unusual toys and other novelties. Wuxtry has played a large role in the culture of Athens and its eclectic music scene for over four decades. Many notable musicians and artists have worked at the shop, including Peter Buck of R.E.M., Kate Pierson of the B-52's, and Danger Mouse. Wuxtry has been routinely named as one of the best and most influential record stores in the U.S. by Rolling Stone and USA Today, among others. ==Background== Wuxtry Records was founded by Dan Wall and his business partner Mark Methe, both of whom moved from Chicago with the intent of opening a record store in a college town. The duo had little training in running a business, but were fans of music and records. They first nearly settled on Morgantown, West Virginia, home to West Virginia University, but on the recommendation of a friend they passed through Athens, Georgia, and decided to stay. The name of the store originates from the comic Boy Commandos by Joe Simon and Jack Kirby, which featured paperboys fighting Nazis‚Äîtheir Brooklyn accents turned \\"extra\\" into \\"wuxtry\\". The first iteration of Wuxtry opened on Foundry Street in Athens on March 1, 1976. It sold new LPs and cassettes, as well as buying and selling used records, books and comics. The store moved to its current spot on Clayton Street three months later, where it has remained since. Methe opened a location in Decatur, Georgia, east of Atlanta, in 1978, and also continues to operate it to this day. The company also opened a third location on Baxter Street in Athens that year which has since closed. Wuxtry moved into a larger adjacent storefront in 1989, and began stocking posters and T-shirts in addition to records and CDs. In 1992, it spun off its books-and-comics operation into Bizarro-Wuxtry‚Äînamed for Bizarro World from DC Comics‚Äîwhich opened upstairs. The very small original corner location now operates at Sidecar, which exclusively sells discounted vinyl and opened in 2013. Wuxtry is notable for having employed numerous famed musicians over the course of its history. Guitarist Peter Buck started at the Decatur location and transferred to the Athens shop, where he met vocalist Michael Stipe. The two bonded over their taste in punk rock music, and founded the band R.E.M. in 1980, which became one of the best-selling rock bands in history. Kate Pierson was one of the company's first employees, and garnered acclaim in the 1980s as part of the B-52's. Brian Burton‚Äîlater known as the Grammy Award-winning musician and DJ Danger Mouse‚Äîworked at the store in the mid to late 1990s. John Fernandes, of many Athens groups, including the Olivia Tremor Control, has worked at Wuxtry for over two decades. Other artists who have at times worked for Wuxtry include Mike Richmond of Love Tractor, Mike Green of The Fans, and Dana Downs of Go Van Gogh. The shop has been named one of the best record stores in the U.S. by Rolling Stone, Vinyl Me, Please, Business Insider, and USA Today. == See also == *Record collecting *R.E.M. ==References== ==Further reading== *Brown, Rodger Lyle.

It is more heavily calcified and inhabits smaller mollusc shells than most hermit crabs. == Taxonomy == This species was first collected during the exploratory expedition by HMS Blossom (1825‚Äì1827) off the Kamchatka Peninsula, in eastern Siberia. The specimens collected were sent to London where this hermit crab was first described in 1839 by the English naturalist Richard Owen, curator of the Museum of the Royal College of Surgeons. He named it Pagurus splendescens, becoming Labidochirus splendescens in the seventies when the subgenus Labidochirus, of which it was the type, was raised to generic status. == Description == Labidochirus splendescens can grow to a carapace width of about . The carapace is armed with dorsal spines and is more heavily calcified than is the case in most hermit crabs. The walking legs are relatively long and the crab \\"wears\\" a mollusc shell that appears to be too small. The crab's body and legs are brown or pinkish and have a reddish iridescent sheen. == Ecology == === Distribution and habitat === This hermit crab is native to the northeastern Pacific Ocean and Arctic Ocean, its range extending as far south as Puget Sound in Washington state. It occurs from the shallow subtidal zone down to about ; it frequents open sandy or muddy places. === Association with hydroids === Because L. splendescens has a well-calcified carapace, the gastropod mollusc shell which it inhabits is only needed to provide protection for its soft abdomen. However, the crab almost exclusively chooses shells in which to live on which stinging colonial hydroids in the genus Hydractinia are growing; these are likely to provide extra protection to the hermit crab, but it is unknown whether the association is mutually beneficial. The hydroids are lightly calcified and may grow so thickly as to extend or even partially replace the mollusc shell as the hermit crab's shelter; X-raying such a \\"shell\\" sometimes shows gastropod-like spiral growth of hydractinians extending from the original shell, while little remains of the gastropod shell itself. == References == Category:Hermit crabs Category:Crustaceans described in 1839 ","title":"Labidochirus splendescens"},{"id":"60379462","text":"Forrest Galante (born March 31, 1988) is an American outdoor adventurer and television personality. He works in the field of wildlife biology, specializing in the exploration of animals on the brink of extinction. He is the host of the television show Extinct or Alive on Animal Planet. == Early life == Shortly after his birth in California, Galante and his family moved to Harare, Zimbabwe, where his mother ran a safari business. He and his sister were raised on a farm that cultivated flowers and fruit, and served as a home to livestock and wild African animals. Throughout his youth, Galante spent time exploring the African bush, learning to wrangle snakes, trap small animals, and snorkel the reefs of the Bazaruto Archipelago. In Zimbabwe, he attended an English boarding school and headed up the Junior Herpetology Society, studying native flora and fauna. In 2001, following the political uprising in Zimbabwe, which led to the invasion and burning of the family farm, Galante was forced to return to California. He resumed his education in Santa Barbara, where he graduated from high school and later earned a degree in biology from the University of California at Santa Barbara. Galante's interest in wildlife and conservation continued into his adulthood. \\"After university, I set out to explore the world looking for the most beautiful, remote and wild places on the planet,\\" he said. \\"I have been bitten by a venomous snake, in a plane crash, mauled by a lion, charged by a hippo, stung by a man-of-war jellyfish, bitten by a shark, in a car wreck, tumbled off a waterfall and stabbed by a stingray.\\" == Career == In 2013, Galante made his first foray into television with an appearance on the Discovery Channel's Naked and Afraid, where he participated in the show's 21-day survival challenge. He completed the challenge‚Äîbeing dropped with a stranger in the remote section of northwestern Panama‚Äîand scored one of the highest PSR (primitive survival rating) in the show's history. In 2016, Galante and his photographer were among the first to ever swim with crocodiles, wearing special suits that mimic the crocodile's scaly skin and block the body's electrical current, allowing them to capture the reptile's natural behavior. The duo came within inches of the crocodiles, filming them in their authentic habitat for their film Dancing with Dragons.https://www.stuff.co.nz/business/85609105/scaly-suit-wins-over-crocs On June 10, 2018, Galante's docu-series, Extinct or Alive premiered on Animal Planet. The show sought to reveal whether animals believed to be extinct can potentially still be found. In each episode, Galante explored the habitats of these animals, often seeking protection to help preserve the species and encourage their continued survival. Destinations have included Taiwan (to search for the Formosan clouded leopard), Newfoundland (to explore the White Wolf), and Madagascar (to search for traces of the giant Pachylemur). Forrest Galante has stated that he is committed to uncovering the thylacine and, after two expeditions, will continue searching. Galante produced the History Channel show Face the Beast where two men attempt to retrace the steps of predators going on unexplained, killing rampages against humans. In 2019 he appeared on 24 episodes of Natures Strangest Mysteries: Solved. Galante has also made media appearances on The Joe Rogan Experience, The Nightly Show, Shark Week, and The TODAY Show. As well as GQ, CNN, HLN, and NowThis. In 2019, Galante testified in front of the US Congress to promote legislature change and increase funding for conservation. == Notable Discoveries == In his search for unique wildlife, Galante has visited over 60 countries. During filming for the show in 2018, a camera trap caught apparent footage of a Zanzibar leopard on Unguja Island. The animal appeared smaller than specimens from the mainland, and seemed to have smaller, more solid spots than normally seen on African leopards. Further investigations are planned in order to confirm whether or not this is a Zanzibar leopard, and whether a viable population still exists. During the shooting of a Shark Week special on the island of Sri Lanka, Forrest's wife Jessica discovered a pair of deceased sharks that had previously been killed by fishermen. Although one of the sharks turned out to be a bull shark, DNA testing of the second specimen suggested that it could be a Pondicherry shark, a species that hadn't been seen since 1979. Although some regional experts are confident that the shark found in the episode is a Pondicherry shark, additional molecular confirmation is needed before the shark's identity can be confirmed. While shooting footage for Season 2 on the remote Gal√°pagos Islands chain in February 2019, the team discovered a single female Fernandina Island Gal√°pagos tortoise, presumed extinct since 1906. Members of the Turtle Conservancy later analyzed the findings, saying that pending genetic confirmation, the photos \\"almost undoubtedly\\" show the lost animal. The tortoise was described as being ‚Äúin good health‚Äù but ‚Äúunderweight,‚Äù and was transported to the Fausto Llerena Tortoise Breeding Center in Isla Santa Cruz for the purpose of conservation and genetic tests. Trace evidence found on the expedition indicated that more individuals likely exist in the wild, and new searches were being planned to find a male Fernandina Tortoise that could potentially save the species. Washington Tapia- Aguilera, a biologist at the Galapagos Conservancy and director of the Giant Tortoise Restoration Initiative, disputes these events, saying he, not Galante, actually decided where to look for the tortoise and Ecuadorian park ranger Jeffreys M√°laga was the one that knew the land, tracked the tortoise, and ultimately made the discovery before calling over the rest of the team. \\"Forrest and his team first are not scientists nor were they part of the scientific expedition,\\" Tapia-Aguilera said.\\" While shooting footage for Season 2 on the island of Borneo in April and May 2019, the team caught five pieces of footage on a camera trap overlooking a mineral spring that clearly showed the Miller's grizzled langur, presumed extinct since 2011, at both day and night. While shooting footage for Season 2 in Zimbabwe in 2019, the team collected DNA samples from an abnormally large lion that had recently been sighted in the area. Upon analyzing the DNA, the male was found to have 14% different DNA from a typical African lion, suggesting that it may have remnant genetics from the Cape lion population, which went extinct in the 1800s. The team theorizes that, through continued breeding, a pure Cape lion might one day be brought back. While shooting footage for Season 2 at Dong Mo Lake in Vietnam in 2019, the team, along with members of the Asian Turtle Program (ATP), captured footage of a Yangtze giant softshell turtle, a functionally extinct species with only three known surviving individuals, surfacing from the lake for a brief period. Although efforts to bring a surviving female of the species to the lake to possibly breed with the individual recorded in the episode failed due to her death in April 2019, the team hopes that their findings could contribute to a possible rescue of the species from extinction. While shooting footage for Season 2 in Colombia, the team caught and collected confirmed DNA samples from multiple individuals, including juveniles, of the Rio Apaporis caiman, a subspecies of Spectacled caiman that had been believed to be extinct for over 30 years, suggesting that a healthy breeding population may exist in the area. A Colombian scientist named Sergio Balaguera-Reina had discovered the caiman prior to Galante's excursion and published a paper on it in 2019. Balaguera-Reina further disputes the claim that the caiman was believed to be extinct, saying, \\"We never thought that this caiman was extinct. But the political situation in Colombia prevented biologists from safely accessing the animal‚Äôs habitat to confirm that it‚Äôs still there.\\" \\"The ongoing conservation work by an in-country scientist like Sergio is the best news of all,‚Äù Galante remarked. During the shooting of a Shark Week special off the coast of South Africa, Galante was initially targeting two species and ended up finding three lost shark species. His first species was the whitetip weasel shark. He captured footage on a camera trap that he suspected was the whitetip weasel shark. He brought in an expert, Dr. Dave Ebert, who confirmed it was indeed the whitetail weasel shark. His next target was the ornate sleeper ray. He initially used an underwater drone to look for the ray with no success. He got a lead on a new species thought lost forever from his expert, and he moved to a new location to target the flapnose houndshark. While targeting this shark he got a call from a local divemaster who had footage he had captured on a recent night dive. His footage showed footage of Austin's guitarfish, a recently described species by Dr. Ebert, and an ornate sleeper ray feeding. Forrest found a good habitat and attempted night fishing, and was able to catch and tag a flapnose houndshark.https://meaww.com/shark- week-2020-extinct-or-alive-land-of-the-lost-sharks-three-species-rediscovered- forrest-galante == References == == External links == * * Forrest Galante on IMDb Category:1988 births Category:Living people Category:Participants in American reality television series Category:Survivalists Category:University of California, Santa Barbara alumni ","title":"Forrest Galante"},{"id":"60379511","text":"Jordan Deangelo Davis (born June 6, 1997) is an American-Azerbaijani basketball player for UCAM Murcia of the Liga ACB.

There are three versions of the saga based on at least two translations, and it is extant in more medieval and post-reformation copies than any other saint's legend. Its popularity appears in part to be due to the text's use in childbirth contexts, which was a uniquely Icelandic development of a popular European tradition. The date of the legend's first translation into Old-Norse Icelandic is unknown, but based on the dating of its earliest manuscripts it is taken to have occurred some time before 1300. There is no date or location for the origin for the veneration of Margaret in Iceland. However, Cormack notes that the first Icelander named Margr√©t is recorded in Landn√°mab√≥k as dying in 1216, and that images of Margaret in the diocese of H√≥lar pre-date the dedications to Margaret in Sk√°lholt. == Bibliography == A comprehensive bibliography can be found in Wolf's The Legends of the Saints in Old Norse-Icelandic Prose. === Editions === ====Margr√©tar saga I==== * Haugen, Odd Einar (1994) ‚ÄúMargr√©tar saga‚Äù, in Norr√∏ne tekster i utval, ed.

The family Neoscopelidae is one of the two families of the order Myctophiformes. Neoscopelidae can be classified by the presence of an adipose fin. The presence of photophores, or light-producing organs, further classify the species into the genus Neoscopelus. N. macrolepidotus tends to be mesopelagic until the individuals become large adults, which is when they settle down to the bathypelagic zone. The species Neoscopelus macrolepidotus is described as having a dark grey ventral surface, a greyish-silver head, pinkish-red fins, and rows of photophores along the ventral portion of the body and along the sides of the tongue. These photophores produce and emit light in the process of bioluminescence. The species generally does not exceed 25 cm in length and is found exclusively in marine environments, along various parts of the Atlantic, Indian and Pacific Oceans on continental shelves. == Range == Neoscopelus macrolepidotus was originally discovered at Madeira, an autonomous region of Portugal, by English naturalist James Yate Johnson in 1863. Madeira is an archipelago, or island chain, located southwest of Portugal‚Äôs mainland. After this initial species discovery, N. macrolepidotus was documented in various oceans and regions around the world, reaching as far as 51¬∞N latitude. The majority of the species, however, lives in tropical and subtropical regions, not exceeding 45¬∞ latitude in the Northern and Southern Hemispheres. The species also lives a majority of its life between depths of 300 and 1100 m, which most directly correlates to the mesopelagic, or intermediate depths of the sea. Since the mesopelagic zone allows some light penetration, one of the biggest limiting factors of the fish population in this zone is predation. This limiting factor is especially present in the daytime, when more light is penetrating the water column and there is generally more visibility. == Adaptations and behavior == Marine organisms in the mesopelagic zone must adapt to the environmental and behavioral constraints present as light is diminished. These constraints force species to use various senses, such as sight and smell, in order to navigate and survive. For instance, Neoscopelus macrolepidetus and other closely related lanternfishes are evolutionarily fit to have greater visual capabilities in the mesopelagic due to the presence of larger eyes. These larger eyes help increase sensitivity to the light reflected through the water column above and the light of other bioluminescent organisms. The presence of a larger mouth with a posteriorly expanded jaw also helps aid in feeding. The known feeding habits of the Neoscopelus genera are limited, however, a common behavior of micronekton is diel vertical migration. This type of migration includes a daily routine of navigating through the bathypelagic zone during the day and swimming up to the mesopelagic at night. This behavior is an attempt to avoid large-scale predators during the day while having the ability to feed on smaller organisms, such as zooplankton, at night. Since the species Neoscopelus macrolepidotus has rows of small teeth, the feeding capabilities can be expanded to other types of micronekton, such as smaller fishes or crustaceans. == Bioluminescence == As mentioned before, Neoscopelus macrolepidotus contains photophores that allow the emission of light. These bioluminescent structures were first exclusively found on the ventral surface of the body, until a scientific study conducted by Seishi Kuwabara examined photophores found in the tongues of individuals belonging to the species Neoscopelus macrolepidotus and Neoscopelus microchir. Neoscopelus microchir is the second species comprising the genus Neoscopelus. Prior to the experiment, the species Neoscopelus microchir was distinguished from Neoscopelus macrolepidotus by having more photophores and a larger head and pectoral fin. Based on Kuwabara‚Äôs experiments, there were larger photophores and more of them in the tongues of N. microchir, which allowed for another distinguishing factor from the otherwise extremely similar species. These morphological differences in species are subtle, which can make it difficult to distinguish the difference between the species N. macrolepidotus and N. microchir when working in the field. In terms of functional use, the photophores on the ventral surface of the fish are most likely used to aid in ventral counter-illumination. This is a form of camouflage that fish use to match the intensity of light in the mesopelagic zone in order to hide their silhouettes from larger predators below. This camouflage can be seen as a necessity for species such as Neoscopelus macrolepidotus, since their ventral surface is darker and therefore their body contrasts more with the downwelling light from above. The use of the photophores found in their tongues is unknown, but could be a possible aid in feeding and species recognition in the dim mesopelagic and the dark bathypelagic. The bioluminescence is done endogenously, meaning that light is produced from their own bodies instead of from symbiotic bacteria in photophores. == References == Category:Myctophiformes ","title":"Neoscopelus macrolepidotus"},{"id":"60379702","text":"Official relations between the two countries of Palestine and the Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic (Western Sahara) do not exist, being as neither country is fully recognised internationally.

George Habash, one of the founders of Palestine's PLO, met with Brahim Ghali in 1979 and indicated solidarity with the Western Saharan cause. Both countries share similar styles of struggling, including conducting guerrilla warfare, against both Israel and Morocco.
