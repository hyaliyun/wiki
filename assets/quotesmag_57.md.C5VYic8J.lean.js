Life  Navarre, also known as Antoinette-Genevi√®ve Navarre or simply Genevi√®ve Navarre, was born in Paris (1737) and studied art there with the pastel master Maurice Quentin de la Tour, a royal portrait artist admired for \\"endowing his sitters with a distinctive charm and intelligence.\\" With her \\"compelling pastel portraits,\\" Navarre became known as one of the \\"most esteemed pastellists of the 18th century.\\" Pastel portraiture became popular in France with the arrival of Rosalba Carriera from Venice, an artist of the Italian Rococo who was in great demand in Paris for her portraits in 1720 and 1721. Navarre followed in her footsteps, and as she gained prominence, \\"her pastel portraits were appreciated for their skill, realism, and warmth.\\" In the mid-18th century, it was problematic for female artists to exhibit their work; the prestigious Acad√©mie Royale seldom admitted work created by women. Therefore, many women sought exhibition opportunities at the Acad√©mie de Saint-Luc, which was more welcoming, counting 130 women among its 4,500 artist-members. Navarre was able to exhibit her paintings and drawings on three occasions at the Acad√©mie, and twice more at the Hotel d‚ÄôAligre in the Rue St. Honor√© in Paris. A critical review of Navarre's work published in Almanach des peintres (1776), commented favorably on her 1774 Acad√©mie exhibition, which included portraits in both pastels and miniatures. The critic concluded that the pastels were \\"superior to her miniatures\\" and went on to say that \\"in seeing her pictures, one could assess her talent exactly, since they were executed without help - unlike those of other young ladies.\\" Navarre was in demand for more than her original pastels. She was also frequently engaged as a copyist to create a faithful replica of another work of art. One client request from November 1764 has been preserved. > \\"Is it possible for you to get me over a Copy of my picture anyhow? ‚ÄîIf so I > would write to Mlle.

History Ethiopia regained a coastline on the Red Sea when Eritrea was federated with Ethiopia in 1952. However, it was not until 1965 that the Ethiopian Shipping Lines was established as a joint venture with the American company Towers Perrin. A Dutch company was contracted to manage the line along the lines of the then- ongoing arrangement with TWA to manage the flag carrier airline Ethiopian Airlines. Operations commenced in 1966 with three ships called Queen of Sheba, Lion of Judah and Lalibela. The line quickly faced serious challenges when the Suez Canal was closed in 1967. When Suez Canal was closed, the vessels had to go all around the Cape. The size of the vessels were not appropriate for such long voyages, and the line ran into a loss. Since then, the ESL has focused mainly on the designated line of import and export, so as to promote foreign trade. It has generally been profitable.

He is the youngest billionaire from Canada according to Forbes. Early life and background Szulczewski grew up in the Warsaw neighborhood of Tarchomin. Upon the collapse of the Soviet Union, his parents emigrated to Waterloo, Ontario, Canada, about west of Toronto. He studied mathematics and computer science at the University of Waterloo, where he met Danny Zhang. Just before graduating from the University of Waterloo in 2004 at the age of 23, Szulczewski relocated to Palo Alto, California and commenced a four-month internship coding for Google. He then became a full-time employee for Google, where he wrote the prototype algorithms for keyword expansion, a feature which aids in searching for products from advertisers. Career In June 2007, Szulczewski moved to South Korea to work in the new Google office. The Korean market demanded more detailed search portals than the minimalist ones used by Google in the West, and effectively trained Szulczewski in how to cater for the public. In 2009, he saved enough money to leave Google and spent six months at home writing code for an ads recommendation platform that analyzed at a person's browsing behaviors to predict their interests. He set up a software company, ContextLogic, that in September 2010 received $1.7 million in investments and involved Yelp CEO Jeremy Stoppelman. Jerry Yang, the cofounder of Yahoo! and an investor in Wish through his angel fund, AME Cloud Ventures, recalls that Szulczewski was highly ambitious. In May 2011, Szulczewski invited his old friend Danny Zhang, then at Yellowpages.com to join the new business as a cofounder and they relaunched the company as Wishwall.me. Facebook learned of the new technology and offered $20 million for ContextLogic but Szulczewski refused the offer. Szulczewski states that with Wish.com his primary aim is to create \\"the largest, most convenient and most affordable shopping mall in the world\\" and to target low-income households. By 2016 Wish.com had over 5 million daily visitors. In 2016, Szulczewski was listed at #21 on America's Richest Entrepreneurs Under 40 list and in 2019, #1605 on Forbes's list of Billionaires. In 2019 he was cited as the 34th wealthiest person and youngest billionaire from Canada, and the 5th wealthiest Polish billionaire. Despite his success, he stays out of the spotlight and rarely gives interviews. He was interviewed for the first time by the Polish media in November 2017.

In the 16th century it belonged to the Wesl√≥w, Zaliwski, and Ossoli≈Ñski families who erected the Gothic church of St. James (Jakuba).Encyklopedia Warszawy.

(in Polish) Mostowski Palace The Tarchomin estate historically included the villages of Tarchomin, DƒÖbr√≥wka Szlachecka, DƒÖbr√≥wka Grzybowska, Kƒôpa Tarchominska and ≈öwidry. In the second half of the 19th century, there was a court residence and several farms in the Tarchomin area. In the 17th century, during the Ossoli≈Ñski rule, the Mostowski palace and park complex was built near the church. In the interwar period, the village of Tarchomin was part of the Jab≈Çonna commune.

The office had been vacant de jure since the new government was sworn into office in May 1996, but Rodr√≠guez exercised as de facto spokesperson by attending press conferences held after the councils of ministers until his resignation and Piqu√©'s subsequent appointment. *On 19 January 1999, following the nomination of Javier Arenas and Esperanza Aguirre to become new secretary-general of the People's Party (PP) and President of the Senate of Spain, respectively, a cabinet reshuffle ensued which saw Manuel Pimentel being named as new Minister of Labour and Social Affairs, whereas Mariano Rajoy replaced Aguirre in Education and Culture. √Ångel Acebes was appointed to fill Rajoy's vacancy in the Public Administrations ministry. *On 30 April 1999, Jes√∫s Posada replaced Loyola de Palacio in the Agriculture, Fisheries and Food portfolio after the latter was nominated on 22 April to run as the PP leading candidate in the 1999 European Parliament election. *On 21 February 2000, Manuel Pimentel resigned as Minister of Labour and Social Affairs as a result of a scandal involving irregularities conducted by one of his closest collaborators, Juan Aycart, leading Aznar to appoint Juan Carlos Aparicio as a replacement. Council of Ministers The Council of Ministers was structured into the offices for the prime minister, the two deputy prime ministers, 14 ministries and the post of the spokesperson of the Government. {  style=\\"font-size:97%;\\" -  colspan=\\"7\\" bgcolor=\\"#F2F2F2\\" align=\\"center\\" ‚Üê Aznar I Government ‚Üí (6 May 1996 ‚Äì 28 April 2000) - !

He was succeeded in his office by Mariano Rajoy, who in turn was replaced in the Presidency ministry by Juan Jos√© Lucas. *On 10 July 2002, a major cabinet reshuffle saw Ana de Palacio replacing Josep Piqu√© as Minister of Foreign Affairs, who in turn replaced Anna Birul√©s as Minister of Science and Technology. Rajoy was reassigned the Ministry of the Presidency as well as the functions of Spokesperson of the Government, with √Ångel Acebes being appointed for the Interior portfolio. Jos√© Mar√≠a Michavila filled the vacancy left by Acebes in the Ministry of Justice, whereas President of the Valencian Government Eduardo Zaplana replaced Juan Carlos Aparicio as Minister of Labour and Social Affairs. Javier Arenas replaced Jes√∫s Posada as Minister of Public Administrations and Ana Pastor replaced Celia Villalobos in Health and Consumer Affairs. Aznar attempted to draw Convergence and Union (CiU) into a coalition government, with little success. *On 3 March 2003, Elvira Rodr√≠guez replaced Jaume Matas as Minister of Environment, who stepped down in order to run as the PP leading candidate for President of the Balearic Islands in the 2003 Balearic regional election. *On 4 September 2003, Josep Piqu√© and Mariano Rajoy were dismissed from the government as a result of being nominated as the PP leading candidates for the 2003 Catalan regional and 2004 Spanish general elections, respectively. This prompted a new reshuffle which saw Rodrigo Rato being promoted to First Deputy Prime Minister, Arenas becoming new Second Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of the Presidency, Zaplana being assigned the functions of Spokesperson of the Government, Julia Garc√≠a-Valdecasas becoming new Minister of Public Administrations and Juan Costa filling Piqu√©'s vacancy in the Science and Technology ministry. Council of Ministers The Council of Ministers was structured into the offices for the prime minister, the two deputy prime minister, 15 ministries and the post of the spokesperson of the Government. Until July 2002, the latter's officeholder had the rank of minister without portfolio and an office of its own. {  style=\\"font-size:97%;\\" -  colspan=\\"7\\" bgcolor=\\"#F2F2F2\\" align=\\"center\\" ‚Üê Aznar II Government ‚Üí (28 April 2000 ‚Äì 18 April 2004) - !

There were a total of seven ships of this class made by the authorization of the Royal Navy. History The first three ships were ordered in 1856 as units of the preceding although was quickly converted to a fourth rate later, but was first the Jason-class corvette. The authorization to make these ships came from the surveyor at that time, who was in charge of making the . Two ships from the North Star class were then converted into their own class, the Jason class. They had covered decks and it was approved on 23 January 1860. Six more vessels were then brought into the Jason class and ordered by the Royal Navy to be made in 1860. An additional pair was also added in 1861. However, all of these but were made the rest were Jason class and only Menai survived to become a North Star-class vessel. The remnants of the North Star-class ships were then called the Jason-class ships which were used mostly in Australia to patrol or other duties. Characteristics These corvettes were open battery ships, first 21 (then 17) guns. This 21 gun design were of the Surveyor Departments design and they were approved on 10 February 1858. All of these ships were referred to as \\"Troop Frigates\\", all of them were ship-rigged with telescopic funnels. The Armstrong breech-loading guns that were on the ships were removed in 1864 following a string of catastrophic accidents. In the big picture, 4x8 guns were replaced by 4x4pdrs (28cwt/8 ft), then all the surviving quartet were all reduced to 17 guns instead of 21 by 1869. Jason had eight 64 pdrs and eight 8in shells and to add it had a 110 pdr Armstrong cannon. Wolverine and Barrosa had 17 64 pdrs; while Rattlesnake had a fair 9 x 64pdrs (8 x 8in shells) which of course was pivot mounted. Some of the ships had severe engine problems such as Wolverine its engine was never satisfactory.

It is located on the grounds of the Paraguayan Olympic Committee and was purpose-built to be the host venue of the 2019 FIFA Beach Soccer World Cup. Construction Paraguay's bid to host the 2019 FIFA Beach Soccer World Cup was all but confirmed as successful on 1 October 2018. The Paraguayan Football Association (APF) put the stadium's construction contract out to tender on 15 October which ultimately went to the consortium of Cima-Ritter. Engineer Dionisio Lovera was tasked with coordinating the works, whilst Rub√©n Garc√≠a is credited as the stadium's architect. The constructors subsequently broke ground on the designated greenfield host site, on land belonging to the Paraguayan Olympic Committee, in early January 2019, with the full works scheduled to last for seven months. By mid-April, all foundations had been laid, structural columns were in place and the main stand was partially complete, with other stands beginning to be raised; work was described as being on schedule. On 16 July, the site was visited by APF president, Robert Harrison and a selection of FIFA delegates who viewed the progress of works firsthand. In early August, construction had entered its \\"final phase\\"; all structural elements were complete, the pitch drainage system functional, and work was now focused on aesthetic and broadcasting elements. The stadium reportedly cost US$1.5 million to build, with investment from both FIFA and the APF. Its construction created around 200 jobs; the workforce and materials used were all nationally sourced, with the sand comprising the playing field sourced from the banks of the Paraguay River. The structural framework of the stadium is that of reinforced concrete and brick. Opening The arena, now completed, first hosted the Paraguayan national team for training on 6 September and then hosted the 2019 Copa Libertadores de Beach Soccer tournament from 14‚Äì21 September. However, it was not officially opened until 9 November, two weeks before the World Cup for which it was primarily commissioned, during a ceremony in which FIFA president Gianni Infantino inaugurated the stadium under the name \\"Los Pynandi World Cup Stadium\\" (Los Pynandi meaning \\"barefoot\\" in Guarani, the nickname of the Paraguayan national team). Alongside him was the president of Paraguay, Mario Abdo Ben√≠tez, CONMEBOL president Alejandro Dom√≠nguez and APF president Robert Harrison, among others, who all made positive statements regarding the design and execution of the construction. Facilities The stadium satisfies FIFA requirements for beach soccer venues: the main stand, the only roofed section, includes four changing rooms for players, two changing rooms for referees, a medical area, a press room, offices, a multipurpose space, an anti-doping room and VIP area. There is also designated seating for VIPs, press and high profile/FIFA delegates. Public bathrooms are available in all stands. Regarding access, the main stand houses an elevator designed for wheelchairs, meanwhile another stand features a special access ramp and an area adapted to accommodate the disabled; consideration has also been given to ambulance and fire access. The stadium is equipped with TV platforms and floodlights operating at up to 2000 lux. In total, the floor area of the stadium encompasses around 5000m2, with the playing surface accounting for 1,880m2. FIFA reports the final seating capacity figure at 2,820. Future At the time of its construction, Ricardo Torres, president of the APF Beach Soccer Division claimed the stadium was the first and only beach soccer stadium of its kind in the world, being of concrete. It is a permanent stadium intended to leave a \\"legacy for Paraguayan and regional sports\\". The arena is slated to host the 2019 South American Under-20 Championship as well as the beach soccer and beach volleyball events at the 2022 South American Beach Games in Asunci√≥n.

It succeeded the second Gonz√°lez government and was the Government of Spain from 7 December 1989 to 14 July 1993, a total of days, or . Gonz√°lez formed a continuity government, maintaining the same composition of the preceding cabinet as established in 1988. This came as a consequence of the pending legal challenges on election results in some constituencies sparking an apparent \\"provisionality feeling\\" on the new government, a situation which had already led to an unprecedented investiture session with 18 deputies being prevented by judicial courts from taking their offices. The government included two members of the Socialists' Party of Catalonia (PSC)‚Äîinitially Narc√≠s Serra, later joined by Jordi Sol√© Tura‚Äîand four independents (Claudio Aranzadi, Jorge Sempr√∫n and Rosa Conde‚Äîwho would end up joining the PSOE in November 1990‚Äîas well as Pedro Solbes from March 1991). The government was automatically dismissed on 7 June 1993 as a consequence of the 1993 general election, but remained in acting capacity until the next government was sworn in.

This led to a limited cabinet reshuffle, seeing Luis Mart√≠nez Noval replacing Chaves in his ministry post on 2 May. *On 12 January 1991, Alfonso Guerra announced his resignation as Deputy Prime Minister of Spain, effective on 14 January, as a result of a financial scandal involving his brother Juan Guerra and which had been ongoing for over a year; but also after a stark erosion in the relationship with Prime Minister Felipe Gonz√°lez had seen Guerra's standing in government weaken. Gonz√°lez used the opportunity of Guerra's resignation to arrange a major cabinet reshuffle, which was materialized in March 1991. The reshuffle saw Narc√≠s Serra becoming new Deputy Prime Minister; the incorporation of Tom√°s de la Quadra-Salcedo (Justice), Josep Borrell (Public Works and Transport), Pedro Solbes (Agriculture, Fisheries and Food), Juan Manuel Eguiagaray (Public Administrations), Jordi Sol√© Tura (Culture) and Juli√°n Garc√≠a Valverde (Health and Consumer Affairs); the farewell of Enrique M√∫gica, Javier S√°enz de Cosculluela, Carlos Romero, Joaqu√≠n Almunia and Jorge Sempr√∫n; Juli√°n Garc√≠a Vargas becoming new Minister of Defence succeeding Serra and the split up of Jos√© Barrionuevo's Transport, Tourism and Communications ministry between the Public Works and Industry departments. Of the new incorporations, Jordi Sol√© Tura was a member from the Socialists' Party of Catalonia (PSC) since 1988, whereas Pedro Solbes was an independent. *On 10 January 1992, Juli√°n Garc√≠a Valverde submitted his resignation as Minister of Health and Consumer Affairs as a result of alleged embezzlement and tax fraud accusations during Valverde's time as president of Renfe between 1985 and 1991. Felipe Gonz√°lez accepted Valverde's resignation on 13 January and appointed Jos√© Antonio Gri√±√°n as a replacement. *On 16 June 1992, Felipe Gonz√°lez accepted Francisco Fern√°ndez Ord√≥√±ez's resignation as Minister of Foreign Affairs because of a deteriorating health resulting from the cancer affection he had been developing since 1988. Ord√≥√±ez had been on leave of absence since 31 May as a result of a physical impossibility to keep on his duties as minister, being replaced in his post by Javier Solana on 24 June; in turn, Solana was replaced in the Education portfolio by Alfredo P√©rez Rubalcaba. Fern√°ndez Ord√≥√±ez died on 7 August 1992, only a month and a half after his resignation. Council of Ministers The Council of Ministers was structured into the offices for the prime minister, the deputy prime minister and 17 ministries, including the ministry for the spokesperson of the Government. The number of ministries was reduced to 16 after the Transport, Tourism and Communications portfolio was split and merged into the Public Works and Urbanism and Industry and Energy ministries in March 1991. The office of the deputy prime minister was left vacant from January to March 1991. {  style=\\"font-size:97%;\\" -  colspan=\\"7\\" bgcolor=\\"#F2F2F2\\" align=\\"center\\" ‚Üê Gonz√°lez III Government ‚Üí (7 December 1989 ‚Äì 14 July 1993) - !

It succeeded the third Gonz√°lez government and was the Government of Spain from 14 July 1993 to 6 May 1996, a total of days, or . Gonz√°lez's fourth cabinet was an important change compared to the previous one: only five members remained in their previous ministries, four changed of portfolio and eight were new. It was described as the least political cabinet out of the four Gonz√°lez governments, with up to six independent figures, as well as the one with the most female ministers (Carmen Alborch, √Ångeles Amador and Cristina Alberdi). The sole deputy prime minister's office under Narc√≠s Serra from the Socialists' Party of Catalonia (PSC) was maintained with increased competences on economic affairs. The parliamentary defeat of the 1996 General State Budget bill on 25 October 1995 led to the virtual downfall of Gonz√°lez's government, which was forced to prorogue the 1995 budget and ultimately decided to dissolve parliament and call a snap election. It was automatically dismissed on 4 March 1996 as a consequence of the 1996 general election, but remained in acting capacity until the next government was sworn in.

Corcuera's resignation was accepted on 24 November, and the following day Antoni Asunci√≥n was appointed to replace him at the helm of the interior ministry. *On 6 May 1994, Juan Alberto Belloch and Luis Mar√≠a Atienza were assigned the responsibilities of the Interior and Agriculture, Fisheries and Food ministries after the resignations of Antoni Asunci√≥n and Vicente Albero. Asunci√≥n announced on 30 April his intention to step down from his post after it transpired that former Director-General of the Civil Guard Luis Rold√°n, suspected of amassing a fortune through fraudulent means during his years of service and whose monitoring was responsibility of the Interior ministry, had fled Spain to escape legal prosecution. Concurrently, Albero resigned as agriculture minister on 4 May after he became involved in a tax fraud scandal. Prime Minister Gonz√°lez accepted both ministers' resignations on 4 May 1994. As a result of the reshuffle, the Justice and Interior departments were merged into a single ministry. *On 12 June 1995, a major scandal unveiled after it transpired that the Superior Center of Defense Information (CESID), the main Spanish intelligence agency at the time, had been recording and keeping the taped telephone conversations of dozens of prominent public figures for years, including politicians, businessmen, journalists or the King himself, apparently without the cabinet's knowledge. The scandal brought about the resignations of Juli√°n Garc√≠a Vargas, Minister of Defence since 1991 and under whose authority the CESID was responsible to, but also of Deputy Prime Minister Narc√≠s Serra, who had been the defence minister in the 1982 to 1991 period. Prime Minister Gonz√°lez accepted the resignations on 28 June 1995, but despite earlier speculation on a larger reshuffle, the government changes were limited to replacing Garc√≠a Vargas by Minister of Education Gustavo Su√°rez Pertierra and the incorporation of former President of the Valencian Government Joan Lerma into the cabinet in the Public Administrations portfolio, replacing Jer√≥nimo Saavedra who, in turn, filled Su√°rez Pertierra's vacancy in Education; no replacement for Narc√≠s Serra as deputy prime minister was appointed. *On 19 December 1995, Javier Solana was replaced by Carlos Westendorp in the Foreign Affairs portfolio after the former was elected as new Secretary General of NATO. Council of Ministers The Council of Ministers was structured into the offices for the prime minister, the deputy prime minister, 16 ministries and the post of the spokesperson of the Government. The number of ministries was reduced to 15 after the ministries of Justice and Interior were merged in 1994. The office of the deputy prime minister was left vacant from 1995. {  style=\\"font- size:97%;\\" -  colspan=\\"7\\" bgcolor=\\"#F2F2F2\\" align=\\"center\\" ‚Üê Gonz√°lez IV Government ‚Üí (14 July 1993 ‚Äì 6 May 1996) - !

Series overview   Episodes   Season 1 (2018‚Äì2019)   Season 2 (2019‚Äì2020)  Shorts Disney Channel has released several shorts connected with the series on their YouTube channel. These include seven Country Kids in the City shorts, eighteen Random Rings shorts, seven Road Trip shorts, nine Miss Tilly's Fun Time TV Minute shorts, and three standalone shorts titled \\"Gramma Theme Song Takeover\\" (released September 23, 2019), \\"Queen of Nice\\" (released October 7, 2019), and \\"Stuck at Home\\" (released June 15, 2020).  Country Kids in the City (2018)  These shorts primarily focus on Cricket and Tilly and are no longer than a minute in length.  Random Rings (2019)  These shorts feature prank calls by Cricket, and occasionally others, which have been set to Adobe Flash animation. The series began crossing over with other Disney Channel shows.  Big City Greens: Road Trip (2019)  Tilly wins free tickets to Breakfast Land, a food themed amusement park, and the family go on a long aggravating road trip. While the shorts were released separately on television, they were compiled together online. Miss Tilly's Fun Time TV Minute (2020) Based on the episode \\"Dream Weaver\\", Tilly hosts her talk show by interviewing Disney Channel stars. As stated in the Ariel Martin episode and in between commercials promoting Big City Greens \\"back-to-back\\" weeknights for the month of May, these take place within Tilly's dreams and are considered \\"not canon\\" with the rest of the series.

It lies one mile to the south of the Great Wall of Gorgan, which was a fortification built between the Caspian Sea and the Kopet Dag Mountains between 420 AD and 530s AD by the Sasanian Empire, on the northern edge of their empire. The fort may have served as a barracks for soldiers defending the wall or may have been used by civilians, but its neat layout suggest it had a military origin. The fort A magnetometer survey of Qaleh Kharabeh was made in 2007 and 2008. The fort had a formal and precise, military-style layout. A central crossroads was found with evidence of buildings on either sides of the roads, these being more easily discernable near the crossroads. Nearby these were pits and places where fire pits may have been located. On the eastern side of the fort were rows of what appeared to be small enclosures; perhaps these were where gullies had been dug surrounding tents or other temporary buildings. Other parts of the site had no discernible structures, apart from the remnants of the field divisions that pre-dated the fort. Pottery found during excavations indicates that the fort was occupied for a relatively short period, during the earlier part of the wall's history. The diet of the occupants included fish, presumably transported from the Caspian Sea which lies to the west. Qaleh Kharabeh is one of several forts to be found in the plain south of the Great Wall. This hinterland south of the wall probably receives sufficient natural precipitation for rain-fed agriculture to take place, and the canals which are a feature of the area were built, not for irrigation purposes, but to supply the needs of the military garrison and for the brick kilns that were used to manufacture the bricks of which the walls and the forts were built. It is thought that Qaleh Kharabeh was used to garrison the troops stationed on the wall. The pottery fragments found at the fort and other sites associated with the wall are giving researchers a clearer picture of the sequence of events associated with the wall and the settlements in the area.

She became a Guggenheim Fellow in 1926. Biography Comstock was born in Waterford, Connecticut. Comstock earned a B.A. from Mount Holyoke College in 1910, followed by a master's degree from Columbia University in 1913. At that time, she began teaching as an instructor in economics and sociology at Mount Holyoke College. During the summers of 1914 and 1915, she was a statistical expert for the Massachusetts Minimum Wage Commission. She was promoted to the rank of Associate Professor at Mount Holyoke in 1917. The archive of her papers held at Mount Holyoke contain letters written between 1915 and 1922, including those reflecting her \\"intense and affectionate relationship with a Mount Holyoke student, Helen Graves Fisk, class of 1917.\\" In 1921, she completed a Ph.D. at Columbia University. In 1926, Comstock was awarded a Guggenheim Fellowship, with the stated purpose \\"to make a study of the League of Nations‚Äô financial reconstruction work in Hungary, with especial reference to taxation and the use of the international loan.\\" By 1927, she had become a full professor at Mount Holyoke teaching economics. She chaired the American Association of University Women (AAUW) for five years. In 1930, Comstock published a book, Taxation in the Modern State, which was reviewed by the Journal of Political Economy, the Journal of the Royal Statistical Society, and The Economic Journal. The book analyzes the changes in taxation in the United States, Great Britain, Germany, France, and Italy after World War I. The reviews were lukewarm, generally observing that it had identified an important subject but not developed it in sufficient depth: in the words of one reviewer, \\"The accounts of these tax methods, in a part only of a small book, are necessarily very brief... and one does not find very much light on the question of how they are really made to work.\\" However, the overall information was considered correct and useful, and it was recommended for use as a textbook \\"written in an unusually lucid and interesting style.\\" One reviewer mistook Comstock for a man, mistakenly referring to \\"the author\\" as \\"he.\\" In 1954, some of Comstock's former students from Mount Holyoke published a collection of essays as a festschrift for her, titled \\"Those Having Torches...\\" Economic Essays in Honor of Alzada Comstock. A reviewer praised the volume for being unusually cohesive and readable for a festschrift volume, \\"Perhaps because of the influence of the personality and teaching of Alzada Comstock.\\" The economics research presented in the volume was on timely subjects, with historical rather than theoretical or deeply mathematical methodology, \\"presented with clarity and in language devoid of technical jargon,\\" also reflecting Comstock's influence. The reviewer also reflected on the gender of the authors, concluding the review with the observation: \\"For those interested in women's education, the notes on the contributors and their experience are striking evidence of the opportunities open to women today, and are a record of which, as well as of their tribute to her, Miss Comstock may well be proud.\\" Comstock died in 1960, at age 72.

Both laws have been controversial.  Language Act of Aragon (2009)  The Law of the Languages of Aragon, officially known as Law 10/2009 of December 22nd, for the use, protection, and promotion of the proprietary language of Aragon was a law of Aragon (Spain) that regulated the languages spoken in the autonomous community, awarding official recognition to Aragonese and Catalan as proprietary languages, moreover the law established the official status of the Spanish language in all parts of the territory. The law was repealed with the introduction of the new Law of the Languages of Aragon on the 24th of June, 2013.

This bill advocated for creating three linguistic zones in Aragon, and included a list of municipalities considered Aragonese-speaking and those considered Catlan- speaking. Despite what the Legal Advisory Commission had recommended months before, the text of the draft law established the co-officiality of Aragonese and Catalan in their respective zones of linguistic predominance. * 2003: Year 2003: Survey of linguistic uses in the eastern regions of Aragon, carried out by the Aragonese Institute of Statistics * 2004: A study on the Statistics of Linguistic Uses in the Aragon Strip is carried out by the Generalitat of Catalonia. * December 22, 2009: Approval of the first Aragonese Language Law, regulating the use, protection and promotion of Aragonese and Catalan as Aragon's own languages.  Contents  Paradoxically, the development of the law caused extraordinary controversy both inside and outside of Aragon, even though the majority of the articles of the new legal text contain content substantially identical to that of the 2009 law, in some cases the articles being the exact same text. With that said, in terms of the regulation of linguistic rights and activity of the Aragonese public administration in relation to the proper historical languages, the new law covers practically the same content that was covered by the 2009 law for materials on anthroponomy, granting of public instruments, use of the proper historic languages of Aragon in local government administrations, teaching, presence in media, protection of material and immaterial linguistic patrimony, etc. The law only introduced light modifications to minor relative aspects of the regulation of place names (toponyms) and the use by citizens of their own historical languages to address Aragonese institutions. In this way, the legal text of 2009 foresaw the possibility that the official denomination of the place names (toponyms) for predominant linguistic zones of Aragonese and Catalan could be in those languages, meanwhile the 2013 text covers this same possibility that the places are named in their proper historical languages, but in a bilingual system (in the proper historical language and Castellano). With regards to the rights of speakers to address Aragonese institutions in their own historical languages, the law replaces the obligation of these speakers to answer to citizens in Aragonese with the option to instead use their own historical languages. The new law modifies the official naming of Aragonese languages, changing with them the standardized section and institutional relevance of said languages stated in the 2009 law. Furthermore, the title of the law indicates that these languages are formed by linguistic modalities with their proper identities, similarly to how the law substantially changed the linguistic zoning established by the previous law.  Naming of the languages  The chosen denominations for the proper and historical languages of Aragon in the 2013 law was the most controversial theme during the process of creating the law as well as after its passing. Thus, the law eliminated the naming of Aragonese and Catalan, which the 2009 text contained in order to refer to these languages, and substituted them for circumlocutions: Aragonese language typical of the Pyrenean and pre-Pyrenean areas to refer to Aragonese, and Aragonese language typical of the Oriental area to refer to Catalan. Additionally, the law highlights the fact that these two languages are constituted by their own linguistic modalities. The new law suppresses the Superior Advisor of Aragonese Languages, the Aragonese Academy of the Catalan Language, and the Academy of the Aragonese Language, with them being replaced by the Aragonese Academy of the Language which with be accredited with the responsibility of normalization and consultation. In relation to the names adopted by the law to refer to the proper languages and in a simultaneous manner to the parliamentary debate, it was rapidly popularized at a social and newspaper level the acronyms LAPAPYP or lapapyp, and LAPAO or lapao. The Aragonese government signaled that these acronyms are not official and do not appear in the text of the law and the belief is held that they are invented by the opposition and by Catalan sectionists.  Linguistic zoning  The new rule will continue to use the legal concept of linguistic zoning, or linguistic predominance, as an instrument to guarantee diversity and linguistic pluralism in the autonomous community. However, going against the complete linguistic zoning of the 2009 law, which recognized the Aragonese territory as being divided into four different linguistic zones (predominantly Aragonese, predominantly Catalan, predominantly mixed Aragonese-Catalan, exclusive use of Castilian), the new legal text of this law limits recognition to the particular existence of two specific linguistic zones: * A zone of the historically predominant use of the Aragonese language native to the Pyrenees and pre-Pyrenees, with their linguistic modalities (region of historic Araganese usage) * A zone of the historically predominant use of the Aragonese languages native to the eastern region, with their linguistic modalities (region of historic Catalan usage) This new law, similar to that of 2009, does not delineate zones, however it leaves the regulatory development and determination of each one of these two zones to the individual municipalities; this follows the precedent of the draft bill of the Languages Act of Aragon (2001), which outlines a concrete relationship between the municipalities of predominantly Aragonese and Catalan linguistics.  Reception  This law is rather controversial, whose controversy began before its approval. There was an internet petition to stop the process of approval that reached more than 4,828 signatures. Also there have been petitions, like that of the Academy of Good (Letters) in Barcelona, asking for the restoration of the Catalan denomination, or that of the Role of Aragonese Studies with ‚Äúa protest signed by more than 600 language experts of Spain and Europe defending the existence of Catalan and Aragonese in Aragon.‚Äù Its supporters affirm that the new law has been made with ‚Äúa social and cultural criterion‚Äù that the previous law lacked. Additionally, they point out that the implementation of the previous law would have resulted in an outlay of up to 39 million euros that would be inadequate in a moment of economic crisis. The opposition, on the contrary, argues that the denominations of the native languages within the law lack ‚Äúacademic rigor‚Äù and describe the endorsement as ‚Äúridiculous and embarrassing‚Äù and accuse the coalition government of not having pursued any consensus on the approval of the law, being that all of the amendments presented by the opposition (73 from PSOE, 53 from CHA, and 42 from IU) were rejected. The law has been expressly supported by the We Do Not Speak Catalan Platform, which does not accept the denomination of ‚ÄúCatalan‚Äù to refer to the native language of Aragon, including its western stripe. In addition to the parliamentary opposition in Aragon Courts, outside of the autonomous community, other political parties oppose this law, including the CDC, the Catalonian Majority, C's, the PP, ICV-EUiA, CUP, and the PSC, which registered a resolution in the Catalonian Parliament to urge the Aragonese government to step back on this issue. In the days after the approval of the law, the Aragonese media and national media criticized the law particularly for its use of the term ‚Äòlapao.‚Äô The defenders of the law maintained that the term ‚Äòlapao‚Äô had been invented by its critics, and that the inhabitants of these areas give their dialects names. For example, the dialect in Fraga is called ‚Äúfragati,‚Äù while the dialect of Tamarite de Litera is referred to as ‚Äútamaritano.‚Äù The lack of reference to Castilian Spanish in the law has also been the target of criticism, as the previous version of the law referenced it. The political party Union for Progress and Democracy (UPyD) criticized the omission for having political ends. In June 2013 the six associations tasked with the preservation, teaching, and spread of Aragonese signed a manifesto in favor of the Aragonese language and against the new language law. Six other organizations (the Council for Spoken Aragonese, The Nogara Association, the Society of the Aragonese Language, the School of Aragonese Philosophy, and the League of Aragonese Speakers) participated in writing the manifesto but ultimately decided not to sign it. For their part, the government of Spain declared that they respected the approval of the law and reaffirmed the ability of the autonomous communities to regulate their co-official languages. Days before the law was scheduled to be approved, the government of Alcampell rejected the law and gave sole official status to Catalan. The Provincial Government of Huesca also approved a resolution favoring the repeal of the Law of Languages for failing to recognize the trilingual nature of the community. On June 1, 2013 various councilors and mayors of municipalities of Franja met in Mequinenza (evoking the meeting 30 years earlier) and signed the Declaration of Mequinenza to show their opposition to the law of 2013 for failing to recognize Catalan under its own name, but only by the moniker ‚ÄúEastern Aragonese.‚Äù  Consequences  The approval of this law overrode the earlier Law of Languages of 2009. It eliminated the Superior General of the Aragonese Language and created the Academy of Aragonese Language. The Academy aimed to determine official troponins and names for the community, so as to standardize their use of the languages and dialects.

The book won a number of awards and was adapted into an animated television film in 1982 which is an annual fixture at Christmas. The book is entirely wordless, and illustrated with only pencil crayons. Briggs said that it was partly inspired by his previous book Fungus the Bogeyman: \\"For two years I worked on Fungus, buried amongst muck, slime and words, so... I wanted to do something which was clean, pleasant, fresh and wordless and quick.\\" Plot One snowy winter's day, a boy builds a snowman who comes to life at the stroke of midnight. He and the boy play with appliances, toys and other bric-a-brac in the house, all while keeping quiet enough not to wake his parents. After they play with the lights on the family car, he prepares a feast that the duo eat by candlelight. The snowman takes the boy outside and they begin to fly over the South Downs and watch the sun coming up from Brighton pier before returning home. When the boy wakes in the morning, he finds that the snowman is gone. In a 2012 interview for Radio Times, Briggs noted \\"I don't have happy endings. I create what seems natural and inevitable. The snowman melts, my parents died, animals die, flowers die. Everything does. There's nothing particularly gloomy about it. It's a fact of life.\\" He refutes the idea that the book is a Christmas book, noting that it was only the animated adaptation that introduces this element. Awards In the United Kingdom, it was the runner-up for the Kate Greenaway Medal from the Library Association, recognising the year's best children's book illustration by a British writer. In the United States, it was named to the Lewis Carroll Shelf Award list in 1979. Adaptations The book was adapted into a half-hour animated television film in 1982, which debuted on Channel 4 in the United Kingdom on 26 December. The Snowman film was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Animated Short Film and has become an annual festive event, inspiring multiple spin-offs including a concert work, stage show,\\"The Snowman @ The Lowry\\" (no date).

Each NBO is decomposed into the percent composition of valence s and p orbital contributions. R3C‚Ä¢ and R3Si‚Ä¢ calculated at B3LYP/6-311G**++ and R3Ge‚Ä¢ calculated at B3LYP/cc-pVDZ++ using Jaguar (NBO 6.0). These values differ slightly from that calculated using the shell analysis based on pseudo-orbital theory, however the trends remain. Changes in composition of these orbitals is well described by Bent's rule. A trivalent group 14 radical (also known as a trivalent tetrel radical) is a molecule that contains a group 14 element (E = C, Si, Ge, Sn, Pb) with three bonds and a free radical, having the general formula of R3E‚Ä¢. Such compounds can be categorized into three different types, depending on the structure (or equivalently the orbital in which the unpaired electron resides) and the energetic barrier to inversion. A molecule that remains rigidly in a pyramidal structure has an electron in a sp3 orbital is denoted as Type A. A structure that is pyramidal, but flexible, is denoted as Type B. And a planar structure with an electron that typically would reside in a pure p orbital is denoted as Type C. The structure of such molecules has been determined by probing the nature of the orbital that the unpaired electron resides in using spectroscopy, as well as directly with X-ray methods. Trivalent tetrel radicals tend to be synthesized from their tetravalent counterparts (i.e. R3EY where Y is a species that will dissociate).  Stability  While the trivalent triphenylmethyl radical, which was the first organic radical described, has been known for over 100 years, characterization of transient, persistent, or stable radicals of heavier tetrel compounds have been only accessible in recent years (from the 1960s to the present). The most recent large advance has been the characterization of the first stable trivalent lead radical, as described in 2007. Such developments have only been made in recent years because these compounds tend to be highly reactive (with respect to reactions such as dimerization and radical chain reactions). There have been two main approaches for stabilization. Firstly electronic stabilization, the tetrel is connected to an electron-rich atom such as oxygen, nitrogen, or fluorine. Secondly steric stabilization, the tetrel is surrounded by bulky ligands (such as -Y(SiMe3)2 (Y = N, CH), -Si(SiMe3)2Et (-Ebt), or -Si(SiMe3)3 (-Hyp)). It has become convention to describe a radical that can persist long enough for spectroscopic or chemical analysis as persistent and a radical that can persist indefinitely as stable. Trivalent tetrels can also synthesized in a cyclic structure (e.g. Ar3Ge3‚Ä¢). This class of molecules tends to be slightly more stable than the acyclic analogues as there is a stabilization through the delocalization of the unpaired electrons within the œÄ-system.  Synthetic Methodology  Trivalent radicals can be prepared from the tetrel hydride (for arbitrary radical species Z). :Z‚Ä¢ + R3EH ‚Üí ZH + R3E‚Ä¢ They can also be formed by oxidation of the salt (typically with GeCl2‚Ä¢dioxane in Et2O). :R3ENa + ECl2‚Ä¢dioxane ‚Üí R3E‚Ä¢ They can be formed via photolysis. :R3EH + hŒΩ ‚Üí R3E‚Ä¢ :R3Si-SiR3 \\\\+ hŒΩ ‚Üí 2 R3E‚Ä¢ Or they can be formed via thermal disproportionation (thermolysis) of the related dimeric species. :R2EER2 ‚Üí ER3‚Ä¢ + ER‚Ä¢ These can also be formed via gamma-irradiation of an ER4 complex. :R4E + hŒΩ ‚Üí R3E‚Ä¢ + R‚Ä¢ As well as by a reduction pathway. :R3ECl + Na ‚Üí R3E‚Ä¢ + NaCl  Spectroscopy and characterization   Electronic spectroscopy  Information about the structure of these trivalent tetrels has been determined by mainly EPR spectroscopy and X-ray crystallography, however the geometry of transient small molecules has been determined via resonance-enhanced multiphoton ionization, transient UV absorption spectroscopy, and microwave spectroscopy by determining vibrational and rotational resonance frequencies.  ESR/EPR spectroscopy  The correlation of the spin density in the valence s orbital (calculated by the ratio of the isotropic hyperfine coupling constant to the theoretical hyperfine splitting in a pure s orbital) against the g-shift (normalized by the spin-orbit coupling constant). (Black) Si, (Blue) Ge, (Red) Sn, and (Green) Pb. (Circles), (Triangles), (Square). Spin-orbit coupling constants from Electron paramagnetic resonance has been paramount for the study of trivalent tetrels as the hyperfine coupling to the tetrel reveals the orbital in which the unpaired electron resides, and the orbital composition directly correlates to the structure of the molecule. The isotropic component of the hyperfine coupling to the central tetrel scales proportionally with the spin density in the valence s orbital on that atom (see the Figure on the right). By comparing this isotropic hyperfine coupling constant to the theoretical hyperfine splitting of an electron in a pure valence s orbital, one can calculate the percent of the unpaired spin density in the valence s orbital. Similarly, the ratio of the anisotropic hyperfine coupling constant to the anisotropic hyperfine coupling of a single electron in a pure atomic p orbital reveals the percent of spin occupation in a valence p orbital. However, measurement of the anisotropic component of the hyperfine tensor are more difficult and not as frequent in literature. The percent of spin occupation in the valence s orbital can be used to directly probe the structure of these molecules. If the spin occupation 100% in a p orbital, then the molecule will have a Type C planar structure. However, if there is 25% s orbital and 75% p orbital occupation, then the molecule will have a pyramidal Type A structure. Any intermediate value is possible and would correspond to a Type B structure. Values of greater than 25% s orbital contribution can also be found upon coordination of a tetrel to electronegative ligands (-OR, -F, -NR2, -Cl). There is also a correlation between the g-shift (‚àÜg = gmeas \\\\- ge) and the geometry for series of compounds with ligands of similar electronegativities. More electronegative ligands correspond to more tetrahedral geometries. Lower g values correlate more with pyramidal structures, while higher g values correlate with planar structures. It has also been demonstrated using tris(trialkylsilyl)silyl radicals that the more bulky the ligands are, the more a planar structure will be favored, and the lower the hyperfine coupling constant will be.  Theoretical calculations  It has been shown that there are two main factors that dictate whether a complex will be a Type A, B, or C structure. The lighter the tetrel, the more it will have a tendency to remain planar. This has been ascribed due to the pseudo Jahn‚ÄìTeller effect, as the E-R anti-bonding orbitals (of R3E‚Ä¢) can more significantly mix with the non-bonding SOMO (singly occupied molecular orbital) due to a more electropositive and diffuse central atom. The barrier for inversion has been calculated at the NL-SCF/TZ2P level to be increasing for EH3‚Ä¢ C, Si, Ge, Sn at 0.0, 3.7, 3.8, 7.0 kcal/mol (the barrier for inversion of methyl radical is zero as it is most stable in a planar Type C structure).

Tripp Jr. as a coastal cruising sailboat and first built in 1970. The Columbia 34 Mark II's hull molds were later used to develop the Coronado 35 and also the Hughes 36 and the Hughes-Columbia 36. Production The Columbia 34 Mark II was a new design built by Columbia Yachts in the United States as a follow-on to the unrelated Columbia 34. The company produced 352 examples of the Mark II between 1970 and 1975, but it is now out of production. Design The Columbia 34 Mark II is a recreational keelboat, built predominantly of fiberglass, with wood trim. It has a masthead sloop rig, a spooned raked stem, a reverse transom, an internally mounted spade-type rudder controlled by a tiller or optional wheel and a fixed fin keel, or optional shoal draft keel or stub keel with a centerboard. Accommodation includes a bow \\"V\\"-berth, a main cabin dinette table that drops to form a double berth, a main cabin settee for a single berth, a quarter berth opposite the galley. The galley includes a stainless steel sink, four teak drawers, a gimballed two-burner alcohol-fired stove, a top-loading icebox. Refrigeration and pressurized hot and cold water were factory options. There is a main cabin navigation table that slides out of the way when not in use. Engine access requires removing the companionway steps. An anchor locker is fitted in the bow.

Columbia 34 MKII first came out it ... it was billed as \\"The Seven Sleeper for Seven Footers\\", and \\"The room of a 38 footer for the price you would expect in a 32 footer\\". Both slogans capture the allure of the MKII Columbia 34.\\" He notes, \\" The boat does not have a generous sail plan (about the same sail area as a Columbia 30), so it doesn‚Äôt perform well in light air. With the high freeboard, it isn‚Äôt as good up wind as some other designs, and it likes to be reefed early when going to windward. A cute little characteristic of the 34 is that the galley and head sinks slip below the waterline when the boat is heeled beyond 15 degrees, so you learn to close these through hull fittings before sailing or risk letting in a lot of water.\\" See also *List of sailing boat types Related development *Coronado 35 *Hughes 36 *Hughes-Columbia 36 Similar sailboats *Beneteau 331 *Beneteau First Class 10 *C&C; 34 *C&C; 34/36 *Catalina 34 *Coast 34 *Creekmore 34 *Crown 34 *CS 34 *Express 34 *Hunter 34 *San Juan 34 *Sea Sprite 34 *Sun Odyssey 349 *Tartan 34 C *Tartan 34-2 *Viking 34 References External links * Category:Keelboats Category:1970s sailboat type designs Category:Sailing yachts ","title":"Columbia 34 Mark II"},{"id":"62410019","text":"upright=1.5 Saint George and the Princess is a late 15th century tempera on panel painting, attributed to Antonio Cicognara and now in the Pinacoteca Tosio Martinengo in Brescia.

It was first described to science in 1840 by Ludwig Karl Georg Pfieffer. The animal is likely named after conchologist Johann Hieronymus Chemnitz.  Description  Multiple perspectives on Notocochlis chemnitzii The shell is smooth. There are four to five whorls with a short spire. It is grayish-blue to grayish-yellow, with arrow-shaped bands of brown and white. Some individuals may have a white band on the upper part of their whorls. The interior of the shell is brown. The shell has a maximum length of 33 mm (1.3 inches) and a diameter of 31 mm. The operculum is white and smooth.  Distribution  These snails are found from Baja California Sur to Peru, including the Gulf of California. This species is also found in the Galapagos Islands. They live in the intertidal zone, down to 3 meters (10 feet) deep, on sand and mud flats.  Life history  This moon snail preys on small bivalves. It is actively mobile, hunting on soft seabeds for buried clams. It uses an abrasive appendage called a radula to drill into the shells of small clams. Once inside, it secretes digestive fluids and then feeds on the clam slurry that results. There is some evidence that one of the species it preys on is Chionista fluctifraga, the smooth Venus clam.

The case arose following the discovery of footage in a phone belonging to one of the alleged aggressors showing an unresponsive girl lying in a van being subjected to groping and mockery. The victim, who has little memory of the elapsed time, let a friend know that \\"something had happened\\" to her, but knew of the sex abuses she suffered only after officers from the regional police of Navarre showed her the evidence, deciding in turn to report. On 4 June 2020, the perpetrators Alfonso Jes√∫s Cabezuelo, Jes√∫s Escudero and Antonio Manuel Guerrero were found guilty of sex abuse and offense against intimacy, and condemned to prison terms of two years and ten months each, with Jos√© Angel Prenda being convicted also of diffusing the images on Whatsapp with a prison term of four years and six months. The case received media attention due to the fact that the defendants were the same aggressors of the La Manada gang rape which took place in Pamplona, Navarre, against a 18-year-old girl from Madrid two months later in July 2016, for which they were convicted and imprisoned. The hearings commenced in November 2019. The prosecutor petitioned a three-year prison term each for sex abuse, and four years more for offence to privacy, for recording and posting the footage. Alfonso Jes√∫s Cabezuelo, a military officer at the time of the events, was requested an additional 12 euros fine per day over two months for injuring the girl with a smack. She remembers getting into the van with the military officer and later waking up naked on the rear seat. He allegedly asked the girl to give oral sex, which she refused, for which he slapped her and hit her on the arm, let her out in the street on her own, insulting her, as she reported. The following day she took pictures of her leg with bruises on it to keep as evidence. She thinks she may have been drugged, which is consistent with comments shared by the defendants on Whatsapp, citing \\"burudanga\\", used to spike drinks. On 4 June 2020, the jurisdictional tribunal of Cordova issued the sentence, convicting Alfonso Jes√∫s Cabezuelo, Jes√∫s Escudero and Antonio Manuel Guerrero of sexual abuse and offense against intimacy, with prison terms of two years and ten months each. Jos√© Angel Prenda received a higher prison term of four years and six months for also diffusing the images recorded on two Whatsapp groups. The group against gender violence in Cordova immediately reacted to the sentences, labelling them 'disgraceful' and calling a public meeting to show their rejection of the sentence.

He is a Professor of Molecular Biosciences and Director of the NSF-Simons Center for Quantitative Biology.  Education and early career  Carthew received his B.Sc. degree in biology at Queen's University in 1978. There, he pursued his interests in ecology by performing research under the supervision of Prof. Ted Brown on the environmental adaptation of cyanobacteria. Carthew continued his studies at University of Toronto, where he received a M.Sc. degree in botany with Prof. Johann Hellebust. At the same time, he pursued training in music composition at the Royal Conservatory of Music in Toronto. Upon completion of his degree, Carthew worked for two years as a research technician under the supervision of Prof. Jack Greenblatt at the Banting and Best Department of Medical Research in Toronto. In this time, Carthew studied the biochemistry of eukaryotic gene transcription and decided to forgo a career in music for one in the biomedical sciences. In 1982, Carthew began his PhD studies at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology where he performed his thesis research in the lab of Prof. Phillip A. Sharp. During his doctoral career, Carthew transformed the Electrophoresis Mobility Shift Assay or EMSA into an assay that could detect sequence-specific DNA-binding proteins from crude cell extracts. Using this method, he identified and studied the HeLa cell transcription factor USF and its role in regulating gene transcription. Carthew also played a role in popularizing the now-common use in the biomedical literature of having multiple authors of a paper as \\"co-first authors\\". Carthew and fellow graduate student Lewis Chodosh decided to adopt this mechanism for their joint publication in Cell, inspired by its use by Andrew Fire and Mark Samuels. This novel feature of their paper was noticed by many, and subsequently adopted in other papers. Following his graduate work, Carthew pursued post-doctoral research at the University of California Berkeley as a Helen Hay Whitney Fellow. Carthew worked under the direction of Prof. Gerald M. Rubin on the molecular mechanisms of compound eye development in Drosophila melanogaster. He showed that the RING finger domain protein Seven in Absentia is essential for multipotent eye cells to adopt an R7 photoreceptor cell fate. In subsequent work, he showed that Seven in Absentia is activated by the Ras signal transduction pathway and acts as an E3 ubiquitin ligase to rapidly degrade a transcriptional repressor of R7 cell differentiation.  Faculty career  Carthew started his independent research group in 1992 at the University of Pittsburgh in the Department of Biological Sciences. He became a tenured associate professor in 1998 and full professor in 2001. In 2001, Carthew moved to Northwestern University and became a full professor in the Department of Molecular Biosciences, which is located on the Evanston campus. He was appointed the Owen L. Coon Professor of Molecular Biology in 2006. Carthew served as leader of the Chromatin and Nuclear Dynamics Program in Northwestern‚Äôs Robert H. Lurie Comprehensive Cancer Center from 2012 to 2018. He served as director of the NCI funded Oncogenesis and Developmental Biology Training Program from 2007-2014. He currently serves as director of the NIGMS funded Training Program in Cellular and Molecular Basis of Disease at Northwestern. In the early phase of Carthew lab research, a number of firsts were achieved. The Carthew group was the first to establish the Drosophila eye as a model system to study planar cell polarity. It was the first group to use Drosophila as a disease model to screen and test small molecule drugs for potential efficacy in disease treatment. It was the first group to provide genetic evidence that Frizzled proteins were Wnt receptors in vivo. In 1998, the group discovered that Drosophila were capable of RNAi or RNA interference. The labs of Andrew Fire and Craig Mello had just demonstrated a key role for double-stranded RNA as the trigger for RNAi in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, a discovery culminating in a Nobel Prize for Fire and Mello in 2006. By showing that RNAi also existed in another animal species, the Carthew group stimulated the search for RNAi in mammals, as well as the adoption of Drosophila as a premier model to study the biochemical and genetic mechanisms of RNAi. The Carthew group also developed the first and second generations of transgene systems for performing RNAi against any Drosophila gene at any stage of the life cycle in a tissue- or cell-specific manner. The second generation system was later expanded into a genome-wide collection of transgenic lines targeting all annotated genes. The Carthew lab has continued pursuing the mechanisms and functions of the small non-coding RNA world that was first glimpsed through the lens of RNAi. The group has been addressing how and why small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) and microRNAs (miRNAs) regulate gene expression. Since 2004, the Carthew group has also pursued questions related to quantitative issues of development. Inspired by the mathematical biologist D'Arcy Thompson and his seminal book On Growth and Form, the group showed that the topology of epithelial cells in the Drosophila eye is constrained due to a tendency for the cells to minimize surface energy. This pioneering work emerged at the same time as other groups around the world also began addressing physical aspects of morphogenesis. Recent work in the Carthew lab has turned to dynamical features of gene expression as cells undergo lineage restriction during development. This work has focused on the importance of time as a dimension in animal development and how gene regulatory networks are designed to provide temporal flexibility to development. The Carthew group found that when developmental tempo is slowed down by limiting cell metabolism, gene repressors become redundant during lineage restriction, and the entire microRNA family is rendered non-essential for development in general.  NSF-Simons Center for Quantitative Biology  In July 2018, Carthew became Director of the newly founded NSF-Simons Center for Quantitative Biology at Northwestern University. Co-funded by a public-private partnership between the National Science Foundation and Simons Foundation, the Center for Quantitative Biology contains 12 Northwestern faculty members who are experts in developmental biology, applied mathematics, and pure mathematics. The Center's mission is to greatly expand the application of mathematics to study of important questions in developmental biology. This is done by supporting interdisciplinary research within the Center and stimulating interdisciplinary research and training activities across the United States. These efforts are augmented by the efforts of three other NSF- Simons Centers located across the country.

One urn was around a foot in diameter and the other two were 5¬Ω inches in diameter and six inches in height, with zig-zag lines around the rim.

A height of 5 to 6 feet measured in 1820 with stones possibly removed previously for road building, etc. The site was wooded in 1779 as shown on the Lainshaw Estate map. The cairn with its contents of three cinerary urns was exposed when trees were being removed by uprooting them from this small plantation in around 1810 to 1826. These urns or beakers are recorded to have contained bones.Paterson, James (1863-66). History of the Counties of Ayr and Wigton. V (II) - Cunninghame. Edinburgh: J. Stillie. p. 578 The Black Hill Cairn is a Bronze Age burial site near Kirkfieldbank in the Clyde Valley and is set in a similar location to Cairnduff at the highest point in the area. History The Lainshaw Estate map of 1779 shows a Cairnduff Park and below it a Bonfire Park running down to the Annick Water. The cairn itself is not named or indicated and only a small clump of trees is shown in its location, lying just outside the Lainshaw Estate on the lands of High Peacockbank. Circa 1810 or 1826 Mr John Deans of Peacock Bank (sic) decided to extract some small trees from his plantation on Carnduff Brae when he exposed three urns or beakers that contained bones. The position of the urns within the cairn was covered with a considerable quantity of stones and earth. The stones would have had to be collected and carried to the site, probably from the river as many are rounded and river worn. No detailed description of the urns survives other than some details of the size and their present location is not recorded. By 1857 Mr. James Neilson Provan of Peacockbank was the landowner. The urns contained bones and relics and these vessels were found enclosed in small excavations that were close to the original ground level. One urn, around a foot in diameter, was broken whilst being removed. The remaining two urns had a diameter of 5¬Ω inches and were six inches in height. They were made from coarse clay.Scotland's Places. The field name 'Bonfire Park' suggests that the cairn, located at the highest point of ground overlooking Stewarton, may have been the site of traditional bonfires, such as those related to Halloween. The typical burial ritual of the time involved the corpse being laid under a funeral pyre and burnt, together with any artefacts. Once cremated the surviving bones were carefully separated from the ashes and placed inside an urn that was inverted and buried in a pit. The ashes, charcoal and other remains of the pyre may have been buried in a pit nearby. The whole was covered in stones and earth to form a cairn.

Buzzard is the child of Steve Buzzard, a former judge of the municipal court of Chehalis, Washington, and Missy Buzzard, the town's former mayor. He graduated from Centralia High School and Eastern Washington University, and later earned a Juris Doctor cum laude from the Seattle University School of Law. He also has a Master of Business Administration from City University of Seattle. Career R.W. Buzzard was admitted to the bar in 2000. In 2003, he was appointed to the municipal court of Centralia, Washington and, the following year, was selected to the bench of the Lewis County District Court. Buzzard was the subject of considerable criticism in 2018 after reports revealed that he drank liquor in his judge's chambers and in violation of law and Courthouse policy kept a loaded firearm in an unlocked drawer of his desk. According to Buzzard, he kept the firearm for personal protection as one of his judicial duties was to ride circuit to the remote town of Morton, Washington. Critics noted that county ordinances prohibited carrying firearms into the Lewis County Courthouse by anyone except security personnel, while former Judge Buzzard tried to argue, unsuccessfully, that because as judge he had \\"ultimate responsibility\\" for order in his court. As a result, Buzzard agreed to begin keeping personal armaments in a locked safe at the courthouse. Buzzard has criticized the lack of security in the judicial facilities of Washington which have a high rate of courtroom violence; the state has the eighth greatest number of annual courtroom security incidents in the United States, eclipsing even that of New York despite the latter state having three times Washington's population. In 2018, Buzzard personally intervened in a fight that erupted in his courtroom after a civil defendant punched an attorney. Buzzard responded to the assault by descending from the bench and physically restraining the man. The following year, Buzzard again descended from the bench to give chase after two criminal suspects attempted to escape his courtroom. When the two men fled, Buzzard ripped off his judicial robes and pursued the suspects through the courthouse, ultimately grappling and restraining one of the two. The second man was later apprehended by deputies of the Lewis County Sheriff. Personal life Buzzard is a member of the Benevolent and Protective Order of Elks and is Methodist.

Early life and education  Muhler was born in Fort Wayne, Indiana. He attended Indiana University from 1942 to 1944 until he was drafted into the Navy. He returned to Indiana University as a dental student through the support of the Navy. In 1948, he received his D.D.S and in 1951, he received his Ph.D. in chemistry. He joined the IU faculty in 1951 as an assistant professor. In 1978, he was named research professor of dental science and director of the dentistry's research institute. While at Indiana University, he assisted in the development of the school's first preventative dentistry program until his retirement in 1984.  Crest Toothpaste  Muhler was a biochemist who led a team at Indiana University that came up with the original formula for Crest Toothpaste. He studied over 150 fluoride compounds for the purpose of finding a compound that protected teeth from cavities and decay. With help from Harry G. Day, Grant Van Huysen, and William H. Nebergall, he found that stannous fluoride was a very effective compound for protecting teeth. After years of studies, they found stannous fluoride to be 50% more effective than sodium fluoride. Procter & Gamble was impressed with their research and decided to underwrite their formula and sell it as Crest Toothpaste in 1956. Crest Toothpaste became the first toothpaste to earn the American Dental Association (ADA) endorsement. Muhler and his team received royalties from Procter & Gamble which they used to help establish the Oral Health Research Institute at Indiana.  Accomplishments  In 1976, the American Chemical Society (ACS) recognized stannous fluoride toothpaste as one of the 100 greatest discoveries of the previous 100 years. Muhler died on December 24, 1996, at St. Joseph Medical Center in Fort Wayne, Indiana. In 2019, 23 years after his death, both he and William H.

It is situated west-northwest of Coquihalla Summit, and its nearest higher peak is Steinbok Peak, to the northwest. Precipitation runoff from the peak drains into tributaries of the Anderson River. The mountain was named for the gamuza, the Spanish name for the Pyrenean chamois, as part of the ungulate theme for several other nearby peaks that were submitted by Philip Kubik of the first ascent party. The mountain's name was officially adopted on February 5, 1976, by the Geographical Names Board of Canada. Geology The history of the formation of the Cascade Mountains dates back millions of years ago to the late Eocene Epoch. With the North American Plate overriding the Pacific Plate, episodes of volcanic igneous activity persisted. In addition, small fragments of the oceanic and continental lithosphere called terranes created the North Cascades about 50 million years ago. During the Pleistocene period dating back over two million years ago, glaciation advancing and retreating repeatedly scoured the landscape. The \\"U\\"-shaped cross section of the river valleys are a result of recent glaciation. Uplift and faulting in combination with glaciation have been the dominant processes which have created the tall peaks and deep valleys of the North Cascades area. The North Cascades features some of the most rugged topography in the Cascade Range with craggy peaks and ridges, deep glacial valleys, and granite spires. Geological events occurring many years ago created the diverse topography and drastic elevation changes over the Cascade Range leading to various climate differences which lead to vegetation variety defining the ecoregions in this area. Climate Based on the K√∂ppen climate classification, Gamuza Peak is located in the marine west coast climate zone of western North America. Most weather fronts originate in the Pacific Ocean, and travel east toward the Cascade Range where they are forced upward by the range (Orographic lift), causing them to drop their moisture in the form of rain or snowfall. As a result, the Cascade Mountains experience high precipitation, especially during the winter months in the form of snowfall. Temperatures can drop below ‚àí20 ¬∞C with wind chill factors below ‚àí30 ¬∞C. The months July through September offer the most favorable weather for climbing Gamuza Peak.

Life Brzezi≈Ñski was born in Warsaw, the son of Teofil Brzezi≈Ñski and his wife Henryka, n√©e Ma≈Çecka. He graduated from secondary school in Czƒôstochowa, and then began his studies at the Warsaw University of Technology. Brzezi≈Ñski made his stage debut in 1904 in the role of Plumkett in Flotow's Martha at the Teatro del Corso in Bologna, Italy. From 1904 to 1906, he studied singing with Witold Aleksandrowicz and performed with the Lviv Theatre of Opera and Ballet. In 1906, his first role at the Warsaw Opera was Sylvio in Leoncavallo's Pajamas, and he remained a leading baritone at the house for two decades. He appeared there in the title roles of Rossini's Il barbiere di Siviglia, Verdi's Rigoletto, Tchaikovsky's Eugene Onegin and Rubinstein's The Demon. He also performed in Moniuszko's The Haunted Manor, as Scarpia in Puccini's Tosca and Nevers in Meyerbeer's Les Huguenots, among others. In the 1911/12 season, Brzezi≈Ñski performed in southern Italy and Sicily, where he was praised as Rossini's Figaro and Verdi's Rigoletto. From 1916 to 1917, he partnered with Adam Dobosz and Adam Ostrowski, eventually becoming the manager of the Warsaw Opera (now Grand Theatre, Warsaw). He retired from the stage in 1926 due to a heart disease.

Near shore, thinned continental crust shows signs of complicated stress patterns, while basalt oceanic crust lies beneath deep water offshore. Geologists have debated whether the bay opened in a simple rotation \\"scissor pattern\\" or through left-lateral strike slip faulting. Structural geology Much of the geologic structure of the Bay of Biscay is interpreted from seismic profiles. A series of analyses published between 1987 and 1990 found thin layers of Mesozoic and Cenozoic sediments and the Moho around 33 kilometers deep. Different reflections suggested possible thrust sheets related to the Variscan orogeny and signs of foreland deformation down into the mantle. North of La Rochelle the seismic reflection became scattered, marking north-dipping features related to South-Armorican south-vergent thrusts. The Basque-Cantabrian Basin is a large sedimentary basin on thinned continental crust that lies onshore and offshore along the southern margin of the Bay of Biscay on the north coast of Spain. Rifting broke up Jurassic carbonate \\"ramps,\\" leading to the erosion of some of these carbonate units. When the basin first formed, it was partly separated from the neighboring Pyrenean basin by the Landes high-ground, although this feature later got underthrusted and buried by Cretaceous sediments offshore. The faulted offshore Biscay synclinorium is believed to be an extension of the onshore Pyrenean fault zone, by way of the Leiza fault. This structural feature was buried by deep-sea volcanic eruptions during the Aptian. Oil and natural gas The Bay of Biscay is a potential target area for deep water oil and gas drilling.

He was born in the city of Nagoya, but spent most of his life in Kyoto. He took a nine-year hiatus from his artistic career that began when he was drafted into the military. During this time he also got married. In 1951, he died from tuberculosis.  Career   1919  Began studying y≈çga at a private art school under Kanokogi Takeshiro.  1930  Studied at another art school run by proletarian painter Seif≈´ Tsuda, where he further practiced western-style painting, landscape, and figure painting. He also contributed works for exhibition to two art associations: the Nikakai and Dokuristu bijitsu kyokai.  1939  Became a founder of the Bijutsu Bunka Ky≈çkai (Art culture association).  Style  Kitawaki worked mainly in the style of Japanese surrealism, automatism, proletarian art, and later Constructivism in the late 1930s. Rather than dreams and psychoanalysis that distinctly marks European surrealism, the Japanese surrealism that Noboru showed in his work focused on the pairing of opposites: \\"nature and the supernatural, reality and hyper- reality\\". For Kitawaki, this style served two main purposes. One was to give insight to his own experiences. Through surrealism, he could offer critique on a society that had undergone the effects of both world wars. The other was to understand and interpret the order and structures of natural phenomena that already existed within reality. For this he painted surrealist diagrams in which he included information from areas of science and philosophy that he believed to best give an explanation for these things. These included morphology, physics, mathematics, color theory, and Chinese divination. Within many of his paintings he also utilized the combination of an open space or landscape with various other forms, usually biological or zoomorphic figures that served to represent other structures. This can be seen for example in his 1937 painting View of a Shell , where the macroscopic depiction of two barnacle shells appear as mountains in an underwater seascape.

History  The earliest library collection associated with the college was that of the Royal College of Chemistry, which opened in 1845. The collection was open not only to students, but also benefactors of the college, as a way of attracting funding and backing. The college went on to form part of the Royal School of Mines and then the Normal School of Science, with each having their own libraries, often part of larger museum collections. A central library at Imperial College dates back to the construction of the Royal College of Science's building after the formation of Imperial in 1907, part of which became home to the Science Museum library. Although this was not part of the college, it was used extensively by members of the college, acting as a reference library for items departmental collections did not cover. Bookplate from the Lyon Playfair Library For most of the early 20th century the college's collection was spread out over the various constituent colleges and departments. The City and Guild's College building was home to a technical collection, with the Royal College of Science building containing a chemical reference library. Early on some professors, including Harold Maxwell-Lefroy, let students access their private collections due to the lack of extensive provisions at the college, however, in time the departmental libraries grew with donations of books from their leading academics, whose name they generally took, including the Egerton-Hinchley library at the Department of Chemical Engineering and the Department of Geology's Watts Library, the latter of which had by 1934 a collection of nearly 7000 books. Books left by students in Beit Hall were collected into a circulation library of around 400 items for personal non-academic recreational reading in the Union Building; this became known as the Haldane Library, named after Richard Haldane, who had been involved in the formation of the college. It eventually moved out of the Union to a larger college facility, growing to 4500 volumes by the mid-1950s. The college also had access to the University of London's library at Senate House for further material. In 1959 the first central library at Imperial was opened, known as the Lyon Playfair Library, at 180 Queen's Gate. It was named after Lord Playfair of St Andrews, who had been a professor of chemistry at the Royal School of Mines. The initial collection was focused on engineering, as it was formed out of the Unwin Library, created through the amalgamation of many of the engineering department libraries. Although for the time being most science departments retained their own collections, the library expanded swiftly to cover the rest of the college's activities. In the 1960s Imperial College quickly expanded in both facilities and population as part of an expansive programme of government investment. This resulted in the construction of new purpose built facility for the central library, which was completed in 1969 along with the adjoining College Block, today the Sherfield Building, with the Science Museum Library moving to the new building the same year. It was originally proposed for the Science Museum Library to be fully subsumed by the college's, however this plan was dropped by 1971. Top floors and main stairs In 1992 the college's and the Science Museum's collections were merged into a single library. Following a consultation with Foster and Partners in 1994, the library was renovated and a Waterstones bookstore opened as part of an expansion of the ground floor in 1997. Two additional modern glass-clad floors were added to the top of the building, with the extension designed by John McAslan + Partners. By the same year the Haldane collection, formed earlier from the amalgamation of the Haldane library in the Central Library, had over a collection of over 40 000 items. The Science Museum Library finally closed in 2014, with resources being moved to the Dana Centre on Queen's Gate and off-site archives. From 2017 through to end of summer 2018 the library underwent significant renovations, including the introduction of air conditioning, at a cost of ¬£11 million.  Building  The Central Library building was opened in 1969 with the rest of what is today known as the Sherfield Building, and extensively uses exposed concrete surface as was common with British architecture at the time. The top two floors are more modern, with an open-plan interior and glass exterior walls, being built in 1997. The library contains training facilities, groups study areas, and an IT cluster and service desk. The Library Caf√© is on the ground floor, next to the main entrance.  Access  Central Library primarily serves students and researchers at Imperial, with the library open 24 hours a day all week, excluding Friday night. However, the library accepts requests from members of the public for access to specific materials, and requests for inter-library loans.

After the war he enrolled mechanical engineering faculty in Zagreb, among other things he studied with Werner von Braun's students, who taught as visiting professors in Zagreb. One of his teachers became head of the Aerospace Center in Stuttgart. Pavle Saviƒá, head of the Yugoslavis nuclear research program, recommended Obrad Vuƒçuroviƒá to Paris for two courses. There he studied weapons and nuclear technology. In Paris he obtained knowledge on rocket trends in west and some of modern basics of rocket technology. Upon his return, he served in military as officer in the garrisons of Cetinje, Kotor, Zagreb and Belgrade, until he got permanently position as head of rocket department at the Military Technical Institute (VTI) in Belgrade and became director in the sector of the Joint Development of the Land Forces at VTI (1981-1987).–í–£–ß–£–†–û–í–ò–ã –¥—Ä –û–ë–†–ê–î –≥–µ–Ω–µ—Ä–∞–ª-–º–∞—ò–æ—Ä (1922-2013) ¬ª He is highly decorated general for his numerous scientific and military achievements. In Yugoslavia, the development of military missile technology goes back to the work of Obrad Vuƒçuroviƒá. In the early 1960s, he was involved in the development of a liquid-powered Yugoslav surface-to-air missile called R-25 Vulkan (eng. Volcano) that could fly up to 25km attitude. The Yugoslav army had allegedly bought 6pcs of the Japanese research rocket Kappa (rocket) together with launch pad and radar that was used as basis of research for domestic anti aircraft rockets. In secret Japanese rocket served as a study object for domestic military development. Modeled on the Kappa (rocket), Obrad Vuƒçuroviƒá had the Volcano booster engine built at the Pretis (Vogosƒça) military plant in Sarajevo. Together with Vladimir Ajvaz he developed the engine of the second stage of the Volcano on the basis of a liquid rocket in the \\"SOKO\\" aviation company in Mostar. With the purchase of the Kappa, Yugoslavia also got new basics formula for rocket fuels. Later SPS Vitez plant produced finished blocks of smokeless solid fuel from the chemical raw materials supplied from ZORKA (≈†abac) and Vitkoviƒái (Gora≈æde), which contributed to the further development of the engine of the R-262. Obrad Vuƒçuroviƒá enjoyed a particularly prestigious position within the hierarchy of generals of the Yugoslav People's Army due to his engineering knowledge about completely new technology's in rocket construction. He was responsible not only for the development of weapon systems, but also for the series production of the military-industrial complex. Due to Obrad Vuƒçuroviƒá, some of the large arms factories constructed in Yugoslavia had reached high technological and quality standards for military products, which some factories could no longer maintain after the collapse of the country.≈†ta je to srpski ‚Äûplamen‚Äú ‚Äî tajni recept za neutralnost dr≈æave - Sputnjik Srbija As a pioneer of Yugoslav rocket development, his greatest achievements was the development of the R-262 rocket and the Yugoslav M-87 Orkan multiple rocket launcher system.  Rocket and missile system designs   R-25 Vulkan  R-25 Vulkan was surface to air rocket with development started in 1958. and Obrad Vuƒçuroviƒá as led engineer.  M-63 Plamen  M-63 Plamen was developed in 1963 as multiple rocket launcher in 128mm caliber with Obrad Vuƒçuroviƒá as project manager and chief engineer of development.  M-77 Oganj  M-77 Oganj self-propelled multiple rocket launcher development started in 1968. with Prof. Obrad Vucureviƒá, who leaded developing and managed construction and production of the M-77 Oganj.  M-87 Orkan and M-96 Orkan II M-87 Orkan is 262mm self-propelled multiple rocket launcher development started as part of KOL-15 project in 1978. Obrad Vuƒçuroviƒá had for KOL-15 significant financial backing both from Yugoslavia and Iraq. New rockets, launchers and vehicles where developed. Professor had practically all components designed by his engineers according to his plans, without paying to much attention to the costs as goal was to get best multiple rocket system at given time. The vehicle was also specially built in 8x8 configuration by FAP Priboj. From Germany, new equipment was bought from company Leifield for processes of cylinder press rolling for the formation of rocket engine chambers at the Pretis plant. The SPS Vitez imported new equipment for the extrusion of 160 kg of mew two-base smokeless solid fuel (NGR 375) for the chamber of the rocket engine. In total, in Yugoslavia, over 100 factories in the metal, chemical and automotive industries, telecommunications and electronics in Slovenia, Bosnia and Herzegovina and Serbia worked on the individual components of the weapon system KOL-15 and Orkan. The final montage on vehicles were don in factory \\"Bratstvo\\" in Novi Travnik, while complete rockets with detonators and fuel were finalized in Pretis-Unis (Vogo≈°ƒça). Special new alloys were required when choosing the steel and aluminum alloys in order to withstand pressures by new rocket engine. In particular, the launchers' pipes had to meet the highest requirements. For them, high-performance steels were produced in the Ravna steel mill in Slovenia, and the finished pipes were further processed in Pretis-Unis Bosnia nad Herzegovina. During initial tests few versions where developed and more than 500 missiles were fired. In addition to the Prevlaka and Lu≈°tica military test sites, it was Krivolak in the then Republic of Macedonia where the weapon system was also tested. The final tests for export customer took place in Iraq. A problem with the tests was the use of Cluster munition in rockets. It was not possible to use them at Prevlaka and Lu≈°tica over the Adriatic sea in order to see their deployment and explosion solid ground was needed. In Krivolak, several villages and all livestock had to be evacuated beforehand, as the sub-munitions often in test covered more area than planned. The Orkan M-87 was publicly presented on December 18, 1987. After delivery in Iraq in 1990 in the 0th series started, production stopped in 1991. Besides Iraq Turkey used Orkan M-87 as basis of their TOROS artillery rocket system after illegally obtained launcher and blueprints form Muslims in Bosnia during war.

Dauway was co-inventor of the use of radioactive seeds in the breast to localise non-palpable breast cancers and the first in Australia to use magnetic seeds instead of radioactive seeds. This technique replaces hookwire or needle localisation improving patient safety, outcomes and satisfaction. The method was patented by the University of South Florida while Dauway was a fellow of surgical oncology. The method has been used since 1999 and has improved with the development of modern equipment. Dauway is also a Yoga Instructor, a Keynote speaker and is founder/director of Restore More, a non- profit initiative which provides education and funding to women in regional and geographically disadvantaged areas for breast cancer treatment and reconstruction.  Education  Dauway graduated from Long Beach Polytechnic High School, Long Beach CA in 1983. She then studied for a Bachelor Degree, Natural Science from Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore MD, graduating in May 1987, and obtained a Doctorate of Medicine from the University of Illinois College of Medicine, Rockford IL in 1992. Dauway then completed an Internship/Residency in General Surgery at Ochsner Medical Foundation Hospital, New Orleans LA, from June 1992 to May 1997. She completed a Fellowship in Surgical Oncology from University of South Florida, H.L. Moffitt Cancer and Research Institute Tampa FL, from June 1997 to May 1999.  Career  Dauway has been employed in medical academic appointments and medical clinical appointments. She was employed as an Assistant Professor of Surgery from June 1999 to April 2001, at the West Virginia University Robert C Byrd School of Medicine, Dept. of General Surgery Division of Surgical Oncology, Morgantown, West Virginia, USA. In 1999, Dr Dauway and Dr Charles Cox presented the results of a pilot study to the Clinical Congress of the American College of Surgeons. Results from that study indicated that the surgeons had discovered a safe new method of taking biopsies from lesions in the breast. The use of radioactive seeds allowed surgeons to more accurately locate tumors, allowing less tissue to be removed. From April 2001 to December 2005 Dauway worked as a General Surgeon/Surgical Oncologist at the Virginia Mason Medical Center, Seattle, Washington, USA, in the Dept. of General, Thoracic, Vascular Surgery. Then she took the position of Chief of Surgery/Surgical Oncologist at Wilcox Memorial Hospital, Kauai, Hawaii, USA, from December 2005 to July 2012. From June 2007 to June 2012 she was Assistant Professor of Surgery at Texas A & M Health Sciences Division of Surgical Oncology, Temple, Texas, USA and Clinical Instructor of Surgery at John Burns Medical School, Hawaii, USA, from June 2012 to Dec 2014. Her last appointment in the USA, was Chief of Breast Surgery at Scott and White Healthcare, Texas, USA, from July 2012 to December 2014. In 2014, IntraMedical Imaging LLC, licensed a key patent from the University of South Florida for the new breast cancer treatment co-invented by Dauway and Dr. Charles Cox, McCann Foundation Endowed Professor of Breast Surgery. The seed localization technique had been further refined and allowed surgeons to be guided by mammography, to place small radioactive seeds inside the patient‚Äôs breast lump. The seeds are tracked to guide the surgeon to the lump, which minimizes the volume of breast tissue removed, resulting in a less invasive surgical option for patients, and better outcomes. This means that surgeons can locate and excise smaller tumours in the breast without the need for a mastectomy. In January 2015, Dauway moved to Australia and was employed as a Specialist General Surgeon/Surgical Oncologist/Consultant at the Gladstone Mater Hospital and the Gladstone District Hospital, in Gladstone, Queensland, with her time divided equally between the two hospitals. The partnership between the two hospitals allowed each hospital more opportunities to employ specialists and provided better after-hours coverage. From October 2015 to 2018 Dauway was also employed in the academic position of Senior Lecturer at the University of Queensland School of Medicine, in the Faculty of Medicine and Biomedical Sciences, Brisbane, Qld, Australia. Dauway continued to make advances in oncoplastic surgery. She was the first surgeon in Australia to offer Magseed localization for breast cancer surgery, using small magnetic seeds, the size of a grain of rice, instead of radioactive seeds or the more traditional use of hook-wires. This seed can stay in place for up to 30 days winch allows more flexibility in timing. With the increased risk of infection with hook-wire technique, women from rural areas often had to travel to have this implanted and it needed to be done on the same day as the breast surgery. The first Magseed localisation was done on a breast-cancer patient from Middlemount, Queensland. Dauway left Gladstone in January 2020, to take up a position as Specialist General Surgeon/Surgical Oncologist/Consultant at the Hervey Bay Hospital & St. Stephens Private Hospital, Queensland.  Philanthropy and community involvement   Restore More  Dauway founded Restore More, a non-profit organisation, to provide education and funding to women in regional and geographically disadvantaged areas, to allow better access to breast cancer treatment and reconstruction. After working in Central Queensland, Dauway noticed that rural and remote patients had barriers preventing them from accessing the full range of reconstruction options open to those living in cities. Reconstruction is not just cosmetic as those who have had one breast removed can suffer from muscular-skeletal problems and issues with balance. Reconstructive surgery can reduce issues caused by asymmetry and this is a vital part of treatment and recovery. Long distances and the expense of travel and accommodation can reduce reconstruction options for some patients. Only one in ten Australian women will be offered reconstructive surgery and Dauway aims to increase awareness of options and improve access. Fundraising events help provide funds for Restore More to continue this work.  The holistic approach  Dauway believes that treatment of cancer requires a holistic approach. In her practice, as well as removing the cancer, she aims for the person to be restored mentally and physically in order to live a quality life after treatment. She is a certified Yoga instructor and incorporates Yoga, diet and mindfulness techniques into surgical practice. She regularly taught at Epic Yoga and Lifestyle, in Gladstone, Queensland. Dauway believes that all patients should have access to reconstruction options.  Surgical volunteerism  When possible, Dr Dauway spends a few weeks each year working with surgical missions in various countries (listed below). The missions provide her with opportunities for teaching and learning. * Restore More- Nepal, Dhulikhel Hospital, 2019 * IMA Helps- Paraguay, General Surgery, 2017- 2019 * IMA Helps‚Äì Nicaragua, General Surgery, 2016 * IMA Helps ‚ÄìEl Salvador, General Surgery, July 2014 * FLMMC Cameroon, Medicine & development of a new medical facility, January 2014 * IMA Helps‚Äì Peru General, Surgery, July 2013 * IMA Helps‚Äì Nicaragua, General Surgery, July 2012 * Haiti, General Surgery, July 2010  Professional memberships  * Fellow Royal Australian College of Surgeons * Fellow American College of Surgeons * Fellow Society of Surgical Oncology * American Society of Breast Surgeons * Breast Surgeons Australia New Zealand * Association of Women Surgeons  Awards and recognition  In 2019, at the Regional Women's Network, CQ Inc (RWN), Dauway won the Inspirational Woman of the Year 2019 award and was the first to receive the Ann Augusteyn Trophy.

The mall, later renamed Meadowlands Xanadu, was nearly complete in 2009 when construction stopped due to a lack of funding. In 2011, the New Jersey Sports and Exposition Authority formalized an agreement with Triple Five Group, which assumed ownership of the mall and renamed it \\"American Dream\\". The revised mall plans included an amusement park and a water park. DreamWorks Animation CEO Jeffrey Katzenberg announced in July 2012 that some of the amusement attractions would be themed upon DreamWorks productions. In September 2016, Triple Five announced that the indoor amusement park space would be occupied by Nickelodeon Universe, and that DreamWorks Animation would work in partnership to develop the water park. Triple Five stated in June 2018 that the water park would open in the end of 2019. By November 2018, the mall's vice president of Communications announced that the water park would open in September 2019. However, by that date, DreamWorks Water Park's opening had been delayed to November 27, 2019. In October 2019, surfers began testing the wave pool. Six days before the scheduled opening, Triple Five announced that they were postponing the water park opening again due to undisclosed reasons. On February 25, 2020, the New Jersey Department of Community Affairs announced that 18 of the 27 rides at the park had been inspected and approved for opening. Of the other nine, four had completed engineering review and were ready for inspection, and the last five rides were still in engineering review. On February 27, 2020, DreamWorks Water Park announced an opening date of March 19, 2020. However, due to the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic in New Jersey, its opening was delayed once again. On September 3, 2020, American Dream announced the new opening day for the waterpark, which opened along with the rest of the mall on October 1, 2020.

After a false start as a portrait artist, he became known as a food writer and gourmet. For his writing career his preferred spelling of his own name was Iles Brody; other sources sometimes anglicized his name as Elias Brody. Early life Brody was born in Budapest, Hungary, the youngest son of writers S√°ndor Br√≥dy and Isabella Rosenfeld. His family was of Jewish descent. After serving in the Hungarian cavalry in his youth, he travelled extensively throughout Europe. In 1927, he married American Follies dancer Vera \\"Kittens\\" Leightmer (n√©e Robertson, 1899‚Äì1997). The couple had met in Paris, married in Budapest, and settled in New York City, but the marriage proved tumultuous and ended in divorce in 1932: Brody (then described as a portrait artist) had reportedly bashed Leightmer prior to their engagement, and attempted suicide several times during the course of their relationship. The couple was also involved in a highly publicized court case when Leightmer unsuccessfully sued a prominent American banker, Jefferson Seligman, for breach of promise. In 1932, after separating from Leightmer, Brody was convicted in London, England of blackmailing two American sisters, Mildred Reid Burke and Constance Reid Netcher. Although he maintained his innocence, he was jailed for ten months and was deported from England after serving his sentence. In 1938, after returning to the U.S., he married Marie Hollingsworth in Virginia. This marriage appears to have also ended in divorce prior to 1949. Later writing career In the late 1930s, Brody returned to New York City, where he became a regular columnist for Esquire magazine. As a former cavalry officer, his early contributions were on equestrian sports and horsemanship. He later became a food writer, with a long-running column called \\"Man the Kitchenette\\", which ‚Äì somewhat unusually for the era ‚Äì offered culinary advice intended for a male readership. He also wrote for Gourmet magazine. Brody published two books relating to gastronomy: On the Tip of My Tongue (1944) and The Colony: Portrait of a Restaurant and its Famous Recipes (1945), a history of the noted New York restaurant. His third and final book, for which he is probably best remembered, was Gone with the Windsors (1953), a best-selling expos√© of and Wallis Simpson, the Duke and Duchess of Windsor. American critic E.V. Durling described it as \\"the most brilliantly written book so far dealing with the lives and loves of the Duke and Duchess.\\" Other reactions were less favorable: the British tabloid The People denounced the work as \\"scurrilous\\", called attention to Brody's 1932 blackmail conviction, and discouraged Brody's prospective British publishers from publishing the book in Britain. Brody had struggled for three years to find a U.S. publisher for Gone with the Windsors, and was reportedly pressured by associates of the Duke and Duchess not to publish the book. The Duchess of Windsor is reported to have expressed relief when Brody died shortly after its publication. Death Brody died suddenly of a heart attack on November 11, 1953, while staying at the Palace Hotel in San Francisco. He was survived by his third wife, Sanna Klaveness, whom he had married in 1949.

In 2018, the Spanish video game market posted a revenue of ‚Ç¨1.53 million, up from ‚Ç¨1.35 million in 2017. The country's audience of game players was 16.8 million that year; demographically, it was 59% male and 41% female. Reportedly 80% of people aged 6-to-10 played video games, while 24% of those in the 45‚Äì64 age range did so. Early history: 1972‚Äì1982 The Palson CX-302, manufactured by Electr√≥nica Ripoll√©, was an early Spanish video game console packaged with Pong Researchers Manuel Garin and V√≠ctor Manuel Mart√≠nez cite the appearance of Pong in Spain as a key milestone for video games in the country. The game grew popular, and was \\"blamed ... for a decline in the flourishing‚Äîand mostly national‚Äîslot machine industry\\". Spanish firm Electr√≥nica Ripoll√© released the Palson CX video game console in 1977, which allowed users to play Pong in a home setting. Garin and Mart√≠nez compare the console to the Interton Video 2000 from Germany. Video games continued to grow in popularity through the early 1980s, and the Atari 2600 became successful in Spain. By 1981, Spain reportedly accounted for 5,000 jobs in the video game industry. Some of the earliest Spanish-made games were developed by Cidelsa, an arcade cabinet firm based in Madrid. Among these titles were Altair and Destroyer in 1980, as well as Draco in 1981. Garin and Mart√≠nez argue that \\"game development arrived a bit late to Spain\\" compared to countries such as the United States, but that Spanish development was \\"intense\\" once it began. Golden age of Spanish software: 1983‚Äì1992 In Spain, the period between 1983 and 1992 is traditionally designated the \\"golden age of Spanish software\\". The first Spanish video game magazine, ', began in 1983. That year also saw the release of Bugaboo (also known as La Pulga), often cited as the first video game developed in Spain. Designed by , Bugaboo saw success in the United Kingdom following its initial Spanish launch. Garin and Mart√≠nez state, \\"Spanish artists, programmers, and musicians gradually became interested in game design, and a young and thrilling scene evolved.\\" A series of domestic companies‚Äîsuch as Topo Soft, Opera Soft, Zigurat and Dinamic Software‚Äîsoon entered the game industry. An important game released in the period was Dinamic's Yenght (1984) for the ZX Spectrum, credited as the first adventure game developed in Spain. Garin and Mart√≠nez cite Army Moves by Dinamic, La Abad√≠a del Crimen by Opera Soft and ' by as key releases, and note that they \\"all ... became hits in the 8-bit European market.\\" According to researcher Joaqu√≠n Mar√≠n Mont√≠n, Dinamic's Fernando Mart√≠n Basket Master (1987) was another major success, which led the company to develop a series of games based on sports celebrities in Spain. Topo Soft followed with ' in 1988, whose high sales of 100,000 units likewise inspired the company to pursue licensed sports titles. According to Garin and Mart√≠nez, international games were less popular and less respected in Spain than domestic products during the golden age, among both video game players and video game magazines. The researchers write, \\"Indigenous games were more appreciated and vindicated than foreign imports, as well as cheaper to develop, publish, and buy‚Äîa unique, pro- national situation that never again occurred throughout the history of video games in the country.\\" Changing landscape: 1990s Spain's game industry of the 1980s collapsed in the early 1990s. Researchers have cited multiple reasons for the crash, including poor marketing and distribution chains, the rising popularity of game consoles over microcomputers and the inability of Spanish teams to adapt to the changing nature of game development itself. Garin and Mart√≠nez write, \\"Many indigenous companies and game studios went into bankruptcy, and while other countries were already adapting to the aesthetic and technological challenges of a new generation of consoles and computers, moving from 8-bit to 16-bit machines, the game industry in Spain seemed to enter a dark age.\\" However, the researchers highlight five Spanish companies as \\"exceptions\\" to the industry's malaise in the 1990s: Bit Managers, Dinamic Multimedia, Gaelco, Pendulo Studios and Pyro Studios. Dinamic's PC F√∫tbol series, which began in 1992, became one of the most successful Spanish game products during the 1990s. The series launched a new game annually, and made use of sales at newsstands to reach a wider audience. Garin and Mart√≠nez characterize the PC F√∫tbol series as \\"both a sales hit and a social phenomenon.\\" The 1998 entry, PC F√∫tbol 7, achieved sales of 400,000 units. Dinamic also branched into basketball with the similar PC Basket franchise. Garin and Mart√≠nez cite Pyro Studios' game Commandos: Behind Enemy Lines (1998) as \\"[t]he most distinguished Spanish game of the 1990s\\". The game was an international hit, reaching global sales of 600,000 units after roughly five months. In the German market, it was the fourth-best-selling computer game of 1998. Commandos was also a hit in the United Kingdom, where it spent 15 weeks at #1 on the computer game sales lists. According to publisher Eidos Interactive, the game's global sales surpassed 1.5 million copies by May 2000. In 2001, GameSpot Spain declared Commandos the biggest hit in the history of Spanish games. Pendulo Studios, founded in 1993, debuted with the graphic adventure game Igor: Objective Uikokahonia in 1994. It has been cited as a landmark Spanish release in the genre. While Spanish developers like Aventuras AD had released interactive fiction games during the 1980s, including those with graphics, a graphic adventure game like Igor had never been made in Spain. The game \\"encouraged other [domestic] companies to devote themselves\\" to the genre, according to GameLive PC; and Alejando Alcolea of HobbyConsolas retrospectively highlighted Igor as one of the two most important domestic games, alongside Commandos, to be released in the 1990s. Pendulo continued to develop games in the adventure genre, following Igor in 1997 with Hollywood Monsters, a long-term commercial hit. A writer for MarcaPlayer summarized it in 2011 as \\"one of the most played and best-selling adventures in Spanish software\\" history. In 1996, developer Revistronic released 3 Skulls of the Toltecs, the first Spanish adventure game to see significant success outside its home country. According to GameLive PC, it achieved sales of 25,000 units in Spain and 200,000 across Europe.

History   Interwar years  The regiment was formed on 15 September 1936 in Montorio Veronese as 2nd Tank Infantry Regiment with four battalions: IV, V, and XI assault tanks battalions and the III Breach Tanks Battalion. The assault tanks battalions fielded L3/35 tankettes, while the breach tanks battalion fielded Fiat 3000 light tanks. The regiment's structure at its foundation was as follows: * 2nd Tank Infantry Regiment, in Verona ** IV Assault Tanks Battalion \\"Monti\\", in Bolzano (L3/35 tankettes) ** V Assault Tanks Battalion \\"Venezian\\", in Trieste (L3/35 tankettes) ** XI Assault Tanks Battalion \\"Gregorutti\\", in Udine (L3/35 tankettes) ** III Breach Tanks Battalion, in Verona (Fiat 3000 light tanks) ** 2nd Tank Training Center, in Verona ** 2nd Tank Materiel Maintenance Workshop, in Verona The regiment was renamed 32nd Tank Infantry Regiment on 1 December 1938.  Cold War  On 24 May 1964 the army raised the XXII Tank Battalion \\"Serenissima\\" in San Vito al Tagliamento, which on 25 October 1964 entered the newly raised Lagunari Regiment \\"Serenissima\\". The battalion's number was chosen to commemorate the XXII Tank Battalion \\"L\\", which had operated in Italian Libya in the interwar years and had entered the 33rd Tank Infantry Regiment on 6 November 1939. With the regiment the battalion operated in Dalmatia and Venezia Giulia in 1940, before being sent to North Africa for the Western Desert Campaign. = 22nd Tank Battalion \\"M.O. Piccinini\\" = During the 1975 army reform the Lagunari Regiment \\"Serenissima\\" was disbanded on 20 October 1975 and its XXII Tank Battalion became the 22nd Tank Battalion \\"M.O. Piccinini\\". As the war flag of the 2nd Tank Infantry Regiment had passed to the 32nd Tank Regiment, the 22nd Piccinini was granted a new war flag and a coat of arms on 12 November 1976 by decree 846 of the President of the Italian Republic Giovanni Leone. Tank and armored battalions created during the 1975 army reform were all named for officers, soldiers and partisans, who were posthumously awarded Italy's highest military honor the Gold Medal of Military Valour during World War II. The 22nd Tank Battalion's name commemorated IV Tank Battalion \\"M14/41\\", 133rd Tank Infantry Regiment Captain Vittorio Piccinini, who was killed in action on 25 October 1942 during the Second Battle of El Alamein. Equipped with Leopard 1A2 main battle tanks the battalion joined the Mechanized Brigade \\"Gorizia\\". For its conduct and work after the 1976 Friuli earthquake the battalion was awarded a Bronze Medal of Army Valour, which was affixed to the battalion's war flag and added to the battalion's coat of arms. In 1992 the battalion was elevated to regiment without changing size or organization, but already in 1995 the regiment was disbanded and its war flag transferred to the Shrine of the Flags in the Vittoriano in Rome.

The orogeny slowed or even stopped for a period of time and resumed during the early Cenozoic. Sequence of the orogeny In the late Jurassic, fragments of continental crust from the small content Cimmeria collided with Eurasia. Earlier, in the mid-Jurassic remnant oceanic crust formed ophiolites along the coast of Cimmeria. The oceanic crust of the Neotethys ocean subducted between the newly compounded Cimmerian-Eurasia continent, but obducted some more ophiolites onto the edge of the Cimmerian crust. Tectonic activity resumed in the early Cenozoic when the small Apulia plate collided with the Cimmerian- Eurasian rocks causing intense imbrication and the deposition of the Pindos flysch. The final phase of the process came in the Miocene and Pliocene, during the Mesogean orogeny, when the combined Mesogean-African plate subducted beneath what is now Greece, the Aegean and parts of western Turkey. In the process, the Crete and southern Peloponessus core complexes were exhumed to the surface. Structural geology The Hellenic orogen is made up of three orogenic belts. The Cimmerian orogenic belt in Greece comprises the Serbomacedonian, Circum Rhodope, Axios, Pelagonian and Rhodope zones, while the Bayburt, Sinop, Kirklareli and Sakarya zones are situated in Turkey. The Alpine orogenic belt includes Neo-Tethys oceanic sedimentary rocks, the Pindos-Subpelagonian ophiolites and the External Hellenides. Apatite and zircon analysis in the southern Aegean suggests that metamorphism in the Cenozoic phase of the orogeny never exceeded 300 degrees Celsius.

Hormones associated with lactation and breastfeeding can variably and unreliably inhibit processes involved with fertility. Because of the high variation of this process, breastfeeding is not recommended to be a method of contraception by medical providers. The physiological importance of this inhibition is so that women who are breastfeeding have a decreased likelihood of a subsequent pregnancy while they are still wanting to breastfeed.  Reliability  Breastfeeding is not a sole method of postpartum contraception that is recommended by medical providers, because it is so highly variable. There are many factors that contribute to the reliability of using breastfeeding as a method of postpartum contraception. The amount and frequency of breastfeeding, natural or artificial, affect all of these factors. Additionally, they all vary in duration and potency of their effect on fertility. The time in which a lactating woman does not menstruate is called lactational amenorrhea. Amenorrhea is the medical term that means ‚Äúno menstruation.‚Äù If a woman is not menstruating, her uterine lining is not proliferating and shedding. The purpose of uterine lining proliferation is to provide a favorable environment for a potential fertilized zygote. A thick uterine lining is rich in grooves and blood vessels. The grooves increase the surface area inside the uterus, giving the fertilized zygote many different options for locations to implant. Blood vessels provide the implanted zygote with the sufficient amount of nutrients necessary for its development. Without uterine proliferation, implantation is extremely rare. The length of time in which a postpartum woman does not ovulate is another factor. During ovulation, an egg develops, leaves the ovary, and travels down the fallopian tube. There, it will most likely get fertilized if sperm cells are present. If ovulation does not occur, there is no egg present to be fertilized and become a developing zygote. Hormones present during breastfeeding can inhibit ovulation and uterine proliferation. The level of inhibition is highly variable in potency and is not uniform from woman to woman. Time since delivery contributes to the fertility of a postpartum woman as well. There is a direct relationship between time and fertility. As time increases, fertility also increases. Each woman‚Äôs body is different and therefore there are no set percentages or data on how much time would increase fertility and by how much. This is why medical providers do not recommend using breastfeeding as a primary method for contraception. Other contraceptive use contributes to postpartum fertility as well. Medical providers will often recommend that sexually active postpartum woman be on some form contraceptive to avoid a subsequent pregnancy if desired, due to the low reliability of breastfeeding as a contraceptive.  Physiology  During pregnancy, levels of estrogen and progesterone are high and stimulate the production of dopamine. Dopamine inhibits the production of prolactin. Because of this, prolactin is not produced during pregnancy. After childbirth, levels of estrogen and progesterone plummet, no longer stimulating the production of dopamine. Without dopamine present, prolactin‚Äôs production is no longer inhibited. Both prolactin and oxytocin are needed for breastfeeding to occur. Oxytocin secretion is stimulated by suckling. Suckling sends sensory input to the central nervous system where higher brain centers block dopamine and release oxytocin. The presence of oxytocin triggers the secretion of prolactin. Prolactin regulates the production of milk and delivery of that milk into the alveoli of breast tissue where it waits to be excreted. Oxytocin regulates the excretion of milk by targeting the layer of smooth muscle cells that surround the alveoli, causing them to contract. As this muscle contracts, milk is forced out of the alveoli, through ducts, and out of the breast via the nipple. The prolactin that is being secreted during one round of feeding is making milk for the next round of feeding. Oxytocin is expelling milk that was made during the last feeding. A breastfeeding mother‚Äôs fertility is decreased because higher amounts of prolactin inhibit GnRH through a direct relationship. The less prolactin there is secreted, the less inhibition occurs. Inhibition and fertility have an inverse relationship. The less inhibition that occurs, the higher the fertility rate will be. If there are fewer suckling events, there will be less prolactin production. If suckling ceases, prolactin levels will return to those of a non-pregnant woman.  Importance  If breastfeeding did not have any effect on fertility, then newly postpartum women would have an increased likelihood of getting pregnant. If they were to become pregnant again within the period of time in which they are breastfeeding their newborn, their next pregnancy would inhibit the production of milk as explained above. Breastfeeding‚Äôs inhibitory actions prevent, variably and limited as explained above, the occurrence of a subsequent pregnancy.

While being one of the newest rivalries in the NFL due to the Texans' formation in 2002 and the Colts' reallocation to the AFC South division that year, this rivalry has increased in intensity over the late 2010s despite being lopsided in favor of Indianapolis during the 2000s. Though Colts fans generally view the Texans simply as a divisional opponent, many Texans fans see the Colts as their top rival due to their long period of dominance in the series. Indianapolis won the first nine games in the series as they were a perennial Super Bowl contender under quarterback Peyton Manning while the Texans struggled in their first years in the NFL, finally attaining their first winning season in 2009 and becoming a playoff contender through much of the 2010s. Since then, the Colts and Texans have often squared off for the top spot in their division. The Colts lead the overall series, 28‚Äì9. The two teams have met once in the postseason, with the Colts winning 21‚Äì7 in the 2018 Wild Card round.  History  Formation of the Texans and the AFC South Houston's first NFL Team was the Houston Oilers, who had moved to Memphis, Tennessee and later Nashville, Tennessee to become the Tennessee Titans. Bob McNair then spearheaded an effort to get the NFL to create an expansion team in Houston to replace the Oilers and even out the league's teams at 32. In 1999, the NFL officially awarded the 32nd franchise to McNair. The Texans began playing in 2002. The formation of the Texans necessitated the reorganization of the league's divisions. The AFC South was created with the Texans joining as an expansion team, the Titans and Jacksonville Jaguars joining from the former AFC Central, and the Colts joining from the AFC East. The Titans and Jaguars were already rivals coming into the division, but the Colts and Texans would have to develop new divisional rivalries, as Indianapolis would leave behind its old rivalries from the AFC East, including a developing rivalry with the New England Patriots. 2002‚Äì2010 Efforts for Houston to develop any heated rivalries in the 2000s were for naught, as the Texans were one of the NFL's bottom tier teams for much of their first nine years of playing. Indianapolis, on the other hand, was one of the NFL's powerhouses, featuring a stellar offense with quarterback Peyton Manning and receivers Marvin Harrison and Reggie Wayne. The Colts won the division 7 out of 9 years during this period and managed to make the playoffs each time. The Colts and Texans first met on September 22, 2002 at Reliant Stadium in Houston, with Manning passing for 272 yards and two touchdowns while Texans rookie quarterback David Carr struggled, only amassing 99 yards, an interception, and a 47.3 passer rating as the Colts routed the Texans 23‚Äì3. The Colts wound up winning each of the first nine meetings between the teams, including a 49‚Äì14 victory at the RCA Dome in 2004, before Houston finally beat Indianapolis in week 16 of the 2006 season. Peyton Manning wound up having a 16‚Äì2 record against the Texans while with the Colts before being released and signing with the Denver Broncos after sitting out the 2011 season due to injury. 2011‚Äìpresent: Fight for AFC South supremacy The Texans routed the Manning-less Colts 34‚Äì7 in Houston in during opening day of the 2011 season, but were upset during the rematch in Indianapolis after Colts backup quarterback Dan Orlovsky completed a last-minute pass to Reggie Wayne for a touchdown, allowing Indianapolis to win 19‚Äì16. By the second game, both starting quarterbacks had been placed on injured reserve for the teams; in addition to Manning missing the whole season, Texans starter Matt Schaub had been sidelined with a Lisfranc injury, forcing rookie T. J. Yates to play in his stead. Nonetheless, the Colts suffered a 2‚Äì14 season without Manning, while the Texans still made the playoffs despite Schaub missing the last six games of the season, winning the AFC South for their first division title and playoff berth in franchise history. The Colts then obtained the first overall pick in the 2012 NFL draft, which they then used to select Stanford quarterback and Houston native Andrew Luck to fill in the void left by Manning. The Texans dominated the Colts during Luck's first game in the rivalry, clinching a second consecutive divisional title with the 29‚Äì17 win in week 15 of 2012. However, this would be Indianapolis' last divisional loss until 2015, as the Colts would win the next six in a row against Houston. Houston broke the streak with a 16‚Äì10 win at Lucas Oil Stadium on October 8, 2015, which was the first time the Texans beat the Colts on the road, ironically with longtime Texans receiver Andre Johnson on the Colts. The following year, quarterback Brock Osweiler led the Texans to their first ever season sweep of the Colts in his only season with Houston. Despite the growing animosity between the two teams, many players and executives from the Colts organization helped the Texans with donations and fundraising in the aftermath of Hurricane Harvey at the start of the 2017 season. After both teams struggled in 2017, they met in the playoffs for the first time the following season. Houston had won the division thanks to strong play from quarterback Deshaun Watson and the defense, while Indianapolis had overcome a 1‚Äì5 start, including a 37‚Äì34 overtime loss to the Texans in which new head coach Frank Reich called a failed fourth-down conversion that ultimately led to Houston's game-winning field goal, to clinch a wild-card berth at 10‚Äì6. The Colts won the game thanks to effective play from Luck, running back Marlon Mack, and their defense, keeping Houston scoreless until the fourth quarter with a 21‚Äì7 win. Prior to the playoff game, there had been some banter between Colts receiver T. Y. Hilton and several members of the Texans defensive secondary, as Hilton was called a \\"clown\\" after making disparaging comments about the Texans. In 2019, the Texans and Colts were both in position to contend for the AFC South title, despite Indianapolis losing Andrew Luck to a sudden retirement prior to the season. The Colts won the first meeting 30‚Äì23 thanks to four touchdown passes from new quarterback Jacoby Brissett, but the Texans won 20‚Äì17 in week 12 thanks to two touchdown passes from Watson to receiver DeAndre Hopkins.

Aldan Shield () is a shield in Siberia. It is an exposed basement of the Siberian Craton. Together with the Anabar Shield further to the northwest, the Aldan Shield is one of the main features of the craton. The Aldan Shield geological region coincides geographically with the Aldan Highlands, located at the southern end of the Sakha Republic, between the Aldan River and the Uchur River.Google Earth The exposed crust parts of the shield date back to the Archean and reflect the first phases of accretion of the crust. They only emerge in a few areas, the eastern and northern sectors of the shield being largely covered by sediments accumulated between the end of the Precambrian and the Cambrian, while in the western and southern regions they have undergone processes of tectonic rejuvenation that have brought about the formation of new structures above and below.The Aldan Shield of Siberia, USSR: the age of its Archaean components and evidence for widespread reworking in the Mid-ProterozoicSiberian craton - a fragment of a Paleoproterozoic supercontinentPrecambrian granulites of the Aldan shield, eastern Siberia On the Aldan Shield there is the only charoite deposit known in the world - the Sirenevyi Kamen (Lilac Stone).

He shot on the European live-bird circuit between 1896 and 1908, winning numerous prizes and recognition as a world champion. In 1992, he was posthumously awarded Olympic gold and bronze medals for pigeon- shooting events deemed to form part of the 1900 Summer Olympics. However, the International Olympic Committee (IOC) later reversed its decision and reclassified the events as non-Olympic. Personal life Mackintosh was born on 22 September 1866 in Rockbank, Victoria. He was the son of James and Isabella Mackintosh, who had immigrated to Australia from Scotland. Mackintosh married Elizabeth Hartwell of Hobart on 6 October 1900. Their only son Donald James Roy Mackintosh was born in 1902, but died of measles in Menton, France, in December 1907. Outside of shooting, Mackintosh enjoyed photography and poetry, writing verse under the pen name \\"The Rambler\\". Later in life he went blind in one eye, which was eventually removed and replaced with a glass eye. He died on 8 September 1951 in Essendon, Victoria, aged 84. Shooting career Early career As a young boy, Mackintosh learnt to shoot with an old muzzleloader, using it to hunt crows and rabbits with lead and black powder. At the age of 10 he joined the Bacchus Marsh Shooting Club, shooting his first competition in 1882. He joined the Melbourne Gun Club in 1889, and within six months had attained the maximum handicap of , which he held for the rest of his career. In 1890, Mackintosh won the Melbourne Gun Club ¬£1000 Cup Handicap, killing 33 birds in a row. He also won the club's ¬£50 Challenge Cup three years in a row. His success allowed him to earn a living as a professional shooter, and he travelled around Australia participating in competitions. Mackintosh participated in live bird shoots at least three days per week, and much of the rest of his time was spent hunting game, especially quail. He trained a pet fox as a retriever and developed an interest in taxidermy. European circuit Mackintosh left Australia in 1896 to travel on the more lucrative European shooting circuit, participating in tournaments in England, Belgium, France, Monaco, Spain and Italy. He won the London Gun Club Challenge Cup three times, the Grand Prix at Monte Carlo twice, the Belgian championships, and the grands prix of Italy, Aix-les-Bains, Milan, and Madrid. Mackintosh was widely regarded as a world champion, with the Paris sporting journal Jockey writing that \\"Mackintosh's performances at Monte Carlo, together with his records made in England and Australia, are such that, in a word, we declare him the champion of the world\\". He was said to have won 30 gold medals and over ¬£20,000 in prize money, equivalent to approximately A$4 million in 2014. =1900 Olympics= Contestants in the Grand Prix de l'Exposition of 1900, sometimes classed as part of the Olympics: Maurice Faur√© (France, runner-up), L√©on de Lunden (Belgium, champion), Mackintosh (Australia, tied for third) Mackintosh has been cited by the Australian Olympic Committee (AOC) as one of three Australians who competed in the 1900 Summer Olympics in Paris, along with swimmer Frederick Lane and runner Stan Rowley. There was no official team or selection process, and each man raised their own funds to compete. Mackintosh entered two live-pigeon shooting events at the 1900 Exposition Universelle in Paris, which was held simultaneously with the Olympics. These have been described by historian David Wallechinsky as \\"the only time in Olympic history when animals were killed on purpose\\". The first was the Grand Prix du Centenaire, which was held from 19‚Äì20 June and attracted 166 competitors. Mackintosh shot 22 birds in a row, one more than the Spanish runner-up; each shooter was eliminated after missing one bird. In the second event, the Grand Prix de l'Exposition held from 25‚Äì27 June, he tied for third place by shooting 18 consecutive pigeons, three behind the winner L√©on de Lunden. When all but the last four shooters had been eliminated, the remaining competitors agreed to split the prize money equally between them. As a result, they each received 7,340 francs. Mackintosh and the other pigeon- shooters did not regard themselves as Olympians, and he was initially omitted from Olympic reference works. In 1956, Hungarian historian Ferenc Mez≈ë was commissioned by the International Olympic Committee (IOC) to compile a comprehensive list of Olympic champions. Mez≈ë included Mackintosh as a gold medallist, but incorrectly listed the event as archery rather than shooting. This error was not brought to the attention of the IOC until 1987, when Australian historians Reet and Max Howell conducted further research. However, the IOC did not formally confirm Mackintosh as an Olympic gold medallist in shooting until 1992, following a visit from the AOC's official historian Harry Gordon to IOC headquarters. In 2012, The Australian reported that the IOC had \\"quietly removed\\" Mackintosh from its list of Olympic medallists, without informing the AOC. This reclassification means that Patricia Dench is now officially regarded as Australia's first Olympic shooting medallist, for a bronze medal at the 1984 Summer Olympics. Later years in Australia Mackintosh c. 1908 Mackintosh decided to retire from competitive shooting after his son's death in 1907. He and his wife left Italy in September 1908 and returned to Australia, where he opened his own gun shop. In 1922, Mackintosh participated in an exhibition of clay pigeon shooting in order to raise money for a library in Rockbank, his birthplace. He recorded a 100-break, the first Australian to do so with clay targets. He later became one of the founders of the Australian Clay Pigeon and Trap Shooting Association (ACPTSA), the predecessor of the current Australian Clay Target Association (ACTA). He served as the patron of ACPTSA from 1936 until his death. In 1939, Mackintosh donated a trophy worth 100 guineas for an international trap tournament, to be contested between teams from Australia and the Home Nations. The Mackintosh Trophy is contested annually across four divisions and is now open to all Commonwealth countries. Mackintosh was posthumously inducted into the ACTA Hall of Fame in 2010, and into the Sport Australia Hall of Fame in 1987.

Together with the North Sea the Norwegian Sea has become highly researched since the 1960s with the discovery of oil and natural gas in thick offshore sediments on top of the Norwegian continental shelf. Geological history The metamorphic crystalline basement rock underlying the continental shelf in the Norwegian Sea is related to the ancient continent Baltica, which now forms the stable East European Craton. The sequence of events in the Mid-Norwegian Shelf is perhaps most relevant to the geological history of the Norwegian Sea. Early rifts began in the late Paleozoic between what is now Norway and Greenland during the time of the Caledonian orogeny. Rifting seemingly continued through the Carboniferous, Permian and into the Mesozoic, but subsequent tectonic activity and thick overlying sediment complicates the record. Large offshore sandstone deposits suggest a high-energy shallow water environment during the early Jurassic. The Harstad, Troms√∏, Bj√∏rn√∏ya and S√∏rvestsnaget basins all developed during the late Jurassic and into the Cretaceous as the rifting which formed the Atlantic ocean propagated northward and began to open the Norwegian Sea. Fine-grained clastic rock filled in the V√∏ring and M√∏re basins by the mid-Cretaceous while coarser material continued to fill in the V√∏ring basin during the Cenomanian and Campanian. The rifting which finally completed the opening of the sea from 60 to 55 million years ago created the Utgard High and Fles Fault Complex, uplifted southwestern Norway and led to the eruption of large volumes of lava for almost six million years. After this period, the continental shelf became a more passive margin. Reverse faults and the formation of domes and anticlines at some point in the mid-Cenozoic and the Molo Formation indicate some mild tectonic activity and a slight uplift of western Scandinavia. Oil and gas exploration Oil and gas exploration on the Mid-Norwegian Shelf began in 1980, with fields producing since 1993. The Halten and D√∏nna terraces of the nearer shore Tr√∏ndelag Platform were first to be explored. Most drilling in the \\"Haltenbanken\\" targeted the complicated fault blocks and horst and graben features of the Halten Terrace, particularly the Spekk Formation. Other rocks include the sandstones and shales of the √Öre, Tilje, Tofte, Ile and Garn formations. Hydrocarbons are as much as four or five kilometers deep in the Kristin and Sm√∏rbukk fields. In the late 1990s, exploration shifted further offshore. Initially, there were concerns that when thick layers of lava deposited they may have superheated the rocks, perhaps generating natural gas. However, Cretaceous rocks in the V√∏ring and M√∏re basins are incredibly thick, ranging between six and seven kilometers. Jurassic source rocks matured by the time Cretaceous rocks were done being deposited. Subsequently when the Helland Hansen Arch, Ormen Lange Dome and Gjallar Ridge formed some gas was trapped at depth. The Ormen Lange natural gas field started producing from Cretaceous and Paleocene sandstones sometimes over a kilometer beneath the water and beneath Storegga slide debris in the M√∏re basin. Throughout the 1990s the Norwegian Deepwater Program conducted research on the debris field of this massive underwater landslide, 8000 years ago, to determine if oil and gas development would be safe in the field. https://www.geologi.no/images/NJG_articles/NGT_4_09_Ottesen_scr.pdf References Category:Norwegian Sea ","title":"Geology of the Norwegian Sea"},{"id":"62412347","text":"Diletta is an Italian female given name.

The HKMLE is stipulated by the Medical Registration Ordinance. The HKMLE is held twice per year. The HKMLE is occasionally referred to by its official name the Licensing Examination of the Medical Council of Hong Kong. Candidates for the HKMLE are supported by a independent, non-profit professional body, known as the Licentiate Society. Graduates of local medical schools in Hong Kong, i.e., HKU and CUHK, are currently exempt from the HKMLE.  Purpose  According to the Medical Registration Ordinance, the purpose of passing the HKMLE shows the achievement of a standard acceptable for registration as a medical practitioner in Hong Kong. In order to qualify to take the HKMLE non-local medical graduates must first apply and undergo vetting of their medical education and training by the Medical Council of Hong Kong. Apart from passing the HKMLE, such doctors must also undergo a period of assessment in Hong Kong. Satisfactorily completion of the process results in award of the LMCHK qualification.  Parts  The exam consists of three parts: Part I) Examination in Professional Knowledge, Part II) Proficiency Test in Medical English, and Part III) Clinical Examination. From 2009-2019, the average percentage of test takers with a passing result was 24%, 85%, 37%, for Parts I-III respectively.  Preparation  Candidates for the HKMLE typically spend several months preparing for each of Parts I and III of the exam. Some have criticized the exam to be excessively difficult. The Medical Council has responded that the examination is set at the same level as the final MB examination of the HKU MBBS/ CUHK MBChB, with questions taken from the same question bank. In order to facilitate preparation for the exam, the Medical Council launched an exam portal on 11 October 2018 with suggested readings and topics, instructive videos, and other information about the exam. In 2019, an independent, non-profit medical association known as the Medical Licentiate Society of Hong Kong (Licentiate Society) was founded. An important part of the Society's mission is to support candidates in their efforts in sitting the HKMLE.

Overview  The surviving manuscripts of the Man'y≈çsh≈´, an 8th-century Japanese anthology of waka, are broadly divided into three groups: the koten-bon, the jiten-bon, and the shinten-bon. The koten (Âè§ÁÇπ, \\"old glossing\\") refers to the readings of the Five Men of the Pear Chamber (Kiyohara no Motosuke, Ki no Tokibumi, ≈ånakatomi no Yoshinobu, Minamoto no Shitag≈ç and Sakanoue no Mochiki) from when they were commanded, in 951, to prepare readings of the Man'y≈çsh≈´ poems during their compilation of the Gosen Wakash≈´. Of the 4,500-odd poems of the collection, they prepared readings for around 4,100, which included virtually all of the collection's tanka (poems with a 5-7-5-7-7 metre) and roughly half of the sed≈çka (5-7-7-5-7-7), but hardly any of the ch≈çka (longer poems with an indefinite number of 5-7 verses and concluding 5-7-7). The original koten manuscript no longer survives, but the shinten (Êñ∞ÁÇπ, \\"new glossing\\") texts sometimes include colour-distinguished annotations, and in such texts the poems written in black and without agreement are almost all poems that would have been included in the koten text (the \\"koten poems\\", Âè§ÁÇπÊ≠å), so such texts are referred to koten texts, or koten-bon. Jiten (Ê¨°ÁÇπ, \\"following glossing\\") refers to glosses that were produced after the Five Men of the Pear Chamber but before Sengaku in the 13th century. The names of several of these \\"middle\\" annotators are known to history: in the notes to the koten text are Fujiwara no Michinaga, \\"the ≈åe family\\" (possibly ≈åe no Sukekuni or ≈åe no Masafusa), Fujiwara no Atsutaka and Fujiwara no Kiyosuke; from prefaces Koremune no Takatoki (ÊÉüÂÆóÂ≠ùË®Ä) and ; and from commentaries (etc.) , , Fujiwara no Mototoshi, , and so on. Jiten texts are those that contain different coloured readings and that have the black overwritten in red where the two agree. Between 193 and 355 poems (the \\"jiten poems\\", Ê¨°ÁÇπÊ≠å) have such glosses, and the texts of that level are the jiten texts, or jiten-bon. They differ from the shinten texts in that they typically contain glosses written in hiragana on a separate line from the main text, although exceptions such as the Kasuga-bon and Koy≈ç Ryaku Ruij≈´-sh≈ç (Âè§ËëâÁï•È°ûËÅöÈàî) give readings in katakana beside the Chinese characters. No full manuscripts of all 20 books of the anthology survive from this period, and information on the jiten readings is gleaned from quotations in poetic treatises (') such as Kensh≈ç's Sh≈´ch≈´-sh≈ç (Ë¢ñ‰∏≠ÊäÑ) and from Man'y≈çsh≈´ poems that were included in imperial and personal collections. Around the middle of the Kamakura period, the shogun Kuj≈ç Yoritsune commanded the monk Sengaku to continue the work that had been begun by . The work that Sengaku produced, based on a collation of between ten and twenty manuscripts to which he had access, not only included the main text with revised readings, but included readings for all the poems that had not been covered in the koten or jiten texts. These readings are called the Sengaku-shinten or shinten readings, and the poems covered by them but not by early editions (between 96 and 152 in total) are the Sengaku-shinten poems or shinten poems (‰ªôË¶öÊñ∞ÁÇπÊ≠å or Êñ∞ÁÇπÊ≠å). Among the shinten texts that include colour-distinguished readings, the ones whose readings are given in red are the shinten poems, while those in black are the koten or jiten poems, and the readings in blue are Sengaku's revised readings therefor. Manuscripts derived from Sengaku's version are referred to as Sengaku shinten-bon, Sengaku-bon or shinten-bon. Sengaku's work took place in four phases, in Kangen 4 (1246), Bun'ei 2), Bun'ei 3 and Bun'ei 10 (1265, 1266 and 1273 respectively), producing four textual lines called the Kangen-bon, Bun'ei Ninen-bon, Bun'ei Sannen-bon and Bun'ei J≈´nen-bon, named for the eras/years they were produced. Manuscripts in three of these four textual lines are extant, with the one that has not survived being the Bun'ei Ninen-bon. The names koten, jiten and shinten are used in the postscript for the Bun'ei texts, etc. The shinten texts by-and-large have their readings in katakana, written vertically on the right of the main text. The exception is the Kangen-bon, which puts the koten and jiten readings on the right and Sengaku's own on the left. The Bun'ei texts place the reading Sengaku thought the correct one on the right, be it koten, jiten or shinten.  Koten   Katsura-bon  The Katsura-bon, named for its having formerly been in the possession of the Katsura-no-miya house, is the oldest surviving Man'y≈çsh≈´ manuscript, having been copied around the middle of the Heian period. It consists of 175 poems and an index of another 37, contained on a single scroll of roughly 1/3 of Book IV and a fragment occasionally called the Toganoo-gire. It was likely copied by , although there are several other theories. It is written on beautifully decorated, coloured paper, and shows hardly any influence of jiten readings, instead preserving the vestiges of the koten readings. The stylized seal imprinted on the reverse indicates that it was in the holdings of Emperor Fushimi. The scroll was held by Maeda Matsu, the wife of Maeda Toshiie, and in the time of Maeda Toshitsune entered the holdings of the Katsura-no-miya household.

Maxime Crochemore and Dominique Perrin invented this algorithm in 1991. The preprocessing time is linear to the needle size. It has a linear worst-case performance at 2n‚àím comparisons. Breslauer has two improvements with fewer comparisons: one with constant space and n+floor(1+eps/2 √ó (n‚àím)) comparisons, the other with log(m) space and n + floor((n‚àím)/2) comparisons. As with KMP and BM, the algorithms utilizes shifts based on partially repeating periods in the pattern. However, it does so via partitioning (critical factorization) of the needle into two halves, so that only one value needs to be remembered from preprocessing. The algorithm is considered fairly efficient in real-world conditions, being cache-friendly and containing operations amenable to replacement by library functions. It is selected as the glibc (and the derived newlib; str-two-way.h) and musl algorithm for the memmem and strstr family of substring functions. However, as with most advanced string-search algorithms, there tends to be a break-even point in the size of both the haystack and the needle, before which a naive quadratic (memchr-memcmp) implementation is more efficient. Glibc provides the Breslauer algorithm in both forms.  Critical factorization  Before we define critical factorization, we should define: * Factorization: a string is considered factorized when it is split into two halves. Suppose a string is split into two parts , then is called a factorization of „ÄÇ * Period: a period for a string is defined as a value such that for any integer , . In other words, \\" is a period of if two letters of at distance always coincide\\". The minimum period of is a positive integer denoted as . * A repetition in is a substring of such that: ** is a suffix of or the other way around; ** is a prefix of or the other way around; *: In other words, occurs on both sides of the cut with a possible overflow on either side. Each factorization trivially has at least one repetition, the string . * A local period is the length of a repetition in . The smallest local period in is denoted as . For any factorization, . * A critical factorization is a factorization of such that . For a needle of length in an ordered alphabet, it can be computed in comparisons, by computing the lexicographically larger of two ordered maximal suffixes, defined for order ‚â§ and ‚â•.  The algorithm  The algorithm starts by critical factorization of the needle as the preprocessing step. This step produces the index (starting point) of the periodic right-half, and the period of this stretch. The suffix computation here follows the authors' formulation. It can alternatively be computed using the simpler Duval's algorithm, which is slower but also linear time.

She was born in Hyderabad, India, to a British colonial officer and the descendant of an Indian princess. Despite her Indian heritage, she is almost always referred to as an \\"Englishwoman.\\"\\"Carl von Ossietzky,\\" from Nobel Lectures, Peace 1926-1950, Editor Frederick W. Haberman, Elsevier Publishing Company, Amsterdam, 1972. Originally written in 1935. She was active in the British suffragette movement in her youth.  Life with Carl von Ossietzky  In Hamburg (or perhaps Fairhaven, England) on 19 August 1913, she married Carl von Ossietzky, a pacifist and later a writer for and editor-in-chief of the leftist German weekly Die Weltb√ºhne (The World Stage). The couple met in 1912 in Hamburg, but not much is known about their early life together. It seems that her wealthy family opposed the marriage. Early in their marriage, she paid a fine on his behalf after he published an anti-war article. Surviving letters attest to Carl's devotion to his wife. While Carl served in World War I, he wrote Maud a letter that described her as an igniting force in his life: \\"You are the magnet that first touched the rigid iron.\\" In 1922, he wrote to her that he \\"blessed the fate that sent her.\\" Their daughter Rosalinde was born on 21 December 1919. While Carl worked as a writer and political activist, Maud organized lectures for him. In 1931, Carl von Ossietzky was imprisoned for \\"treason and espionage\\" because of his role in publishing details of German remilitarization; he was released in 1932.Haberman, Frederick W. Peace 1926‚Äì1950 (1999), World Scientific, pg. 211. After the Reichstag Fire in April 1933, von Ossietzky wanted to flee Germany, but her husband chose to remain. He was quickly arrested by the Gestapo and imprisoned in a series of prisons and concentration camps. Whether she was a supportive wife or incapable of helping her husband, neither she nor her husband's famous international friends could release him from Nazi concentration camps. In 1936, Carl von Ossietzky contacted tuberculosis and was moved to a hospital in Berlin. He was awarded the 1935 Nobel Peace Prize during this period, though his sickness did not allow him to accept it in person. His wife nursed him until he died on 4 May 1938. Carl von Ossietzky was buried in a municipal cemetery, and Maud would spend the next years fighting to move his body to a cemetery in the Berlin neighborhood of Pankow. Von Ossietzky spent time in a psychiatric clinic after his death. One author has claimed that the Gestapo ordered her to stop using her late husband's name and lived as \\"Maud Woods.\\" Von Ossietzky invested the money awarded with the Nobel Peace Prize with lawyer Kurt Wannow, but Wannow embezzled the sum in 1937.  Historical Inconsistencies  Many sources state that by the time the Nazis imprisoned her husband, von Ossietzky was an alcoholic, with one writing that her alcoholism \\"caused [her husband] great pain ... but may have protected her from retribution under the Nazis.\\" Others have claimed that her husband's death caused her alcoholism. Their daughter has blamed Die Weltb√ºhne for her mother's (unspecified) \\"illness.\\" During World War II, Rosalinde was sent to a Quaker boarding school in England through the support of Ernst Toller and the Quakers. Another source claims that Maud and Rosalinde emigrated to Sweden via England, though there are no other sources that place Maud in Sweden. A third source states that Maud remained in Berlin when Rosalinde traveled from England to Sweden. Rosalinde died in Sweden in 2000 or 2001. German sources tend to ascribe Maud a more positive and active role, while English-language scholarship often describes her in less complimentary terms.  Later Life  On 1 June 1946, Die Weltb√ºhne reappeared in the Soviet sector of Berlin with Maud von Ossietzky and Hans Leonard listed as editors. Leonard, her neighbor, had a career in publishing ended by Nazi antisemitic discrimination. Von Ossietzky and Leonard revived a Weimar-era publication that endures to this day. In 1966, von Ossietzky published her memoir, Maud von Ossietzky erz√§hlt: ein Lebensbild (Maud von Ossietzky Explains: a Life Story). German academic Wolfgang Schivelbusch describes the book as \\"admittedly unreliable,\\" while Istv√°n De√°k calls it \\"charming and straightforward.\\" She died in 1974 in Berlin and is buried next to her husband in Pankow.

They were largely employed as scribes, clerks and administrators from early Hindu kingdoms up to the Muslim conquests of North India. Chitraguptavanshi Kayasthas and Bengali Kayasthas were traditionally responsible for writing Indic eulogies, known as prashastis for Hindu kings in the early medieval kingdoms.  Etymology  According to Merriam-Webster, the word KƒÅyastha is probably formed from the Sanskrit kƒÅya (body), and the suffix -stha (standing, being in). The suffix vanshi is derived from the Sanskrit word vansh (‡§µ‡§Ç‡§∂) which translates to belonging to a particular family dynasty.

It comprises the coastal side of the Uretiti Recreation Reserve and Uretiti Scenic Reserve, and is served by a Department of Conservation (DOC) campground within the Recreation Reserve. Uretiti Beach is popular for swimming, surfing, and fishing, and a well-known clothing-optional beach and gay cruising site.  Name  The name Uretiti dates to before the British colonization of New Zealand. DOC consulted with the local Patuharakeke hap≈´ before setting the official names of the reserves, but were given no advice on the meaning of Uretiti. In MƒÅori, ure means \\"penis\\", and titi means \\"peg\\" or \\"to poke\\".  Physical geography  Uretiti Beach faces almost due east into Bream Bay. Its northern and southern extremities are defined by DOC boundaries rather than topographical features; it shades into RuakƒÅkƒÅ Beach adjacent to RuakƒÅkƒÅ township at the northern end, and into the Waipu Wildlife Refuge near Waipu town at the southern end. The stretch of beach thus defined is approximately long. Northeast of RuakƒÅkƒÅ, Bream Bay ends at Marsden Point, marking the mouth of Whangarei Harbour. Southeast of Waipu town are further beaches including Waipu Cove and Langs Beach before the Bay ends at Bream Tail. The Hen and Chicken Islands lie approximately offshore to the east.  Recreational use  Uretiti is a popular site for surfing, fishing, swimming, and walking. Its water consistently passes water quality tests for swimming safety. It is not patrolled by lifeguards. The beach is a section of the Te Araroa walking trail, which runs the length of the country. The main access to the beach is via the DOC campground, which provides 300 unpowered tent sites and facilities described as \\"basic\\" ‚Äì toilets, water taps, and cold showers (hot showers are coin-operated). DOC warns visitors to clean their shoes upon leaving to avoid spreading kauri dieback disease, and notes that wasp nests are a hazard in the area. Uretiti is a popular site for New Year's Eve revelry; visitors wishing to camp during the peak of the season are advised to book in advance. New Year revellers and other visitors frequently light fireworks or bonfires on the beach despite total fire bans in the area; fireworks are believed to be responsible for a fire which claimed of scrub in 2016.  Nudity  Uretiti is Northland's most popular beach for naturism. In general, naturists use the southern half of the beach; however, this is a custom rather than an enforceable rule. Public nudity is legal on any New Zealand beach where it is \\"known to occur\\". Nudity is not permitted within the DOC campground; campers found in breach of this rule are asked to dress or leave the site. Uretiti is an established site for gay activity, including gay naturism and cruising in addition to rainbow-themed New Year parties.  Tensions over crab-fishing  Tensions have arisen between visiting crab-fishers and local residents, who allege that the fishers frequently leave animal carcasses, used as crab bait, on the beach. A number of fishers drowned in the late 2010s while setting crab pots in small dinghies. As a large proportion of these fishers are of East Asian origin, calls for crab-fishing to be banned in the area have become racially charged.

He began his YouTube channel in June 2018, documenting the Indian subcontinent and the post-Soviet states. As of September 2020, his channel has more than 2 million subscribers and over 287 million total views. Career Born in Brighton, Rich had a long history of travelling before his YouTube channel became popular. In March 1993, he went on a backpacking trip to India, flying into Delhi's Indira Gandhi Airport for what was supposed to be a one-month backpacking journey, but became so interested in Indian culture that he stayed there for four years and opened up a small hotel. He has expressed his interest in the post-Soviet states. He has stated that his admiration started with an interest with Belarusian gymnast Svetlana Boginskaya during his adolescence, but it was during a two-month long stay in Moscow in 1993 that his interest in the place started, as he was there to witness the 1993 Russian constitutional crisis. On 12 April 2018, Rich released the book The Burning Edge: Travelling Through Irradiated Belarus, under the pen name Arthur Chichester, which describes his experiences travelling through the parts of Belarus affected by the Chernobyl disaster. Rich joined YouTube under the username \\"bald and bankrupt\\" on 12 June 2018. His first video, uploaded that same day, was titled \\"I ‚ô• India's Policewomen\\". He predominantly films on a small Sony FDR X3000 and his smartphone. He is noted for aiming to \\"show the lives of real locals, away from the tourist spots and Starbucks coffee\\". Rich and his Youtube channel were featured in The Daily Express June 2019 article \\"World War 3: The secret underground nuclear bunkers hiding below forest revealed\\". On 5 July 2020, Rich revealed via Instagram that he had been in intensive care in Serbia for nine days with double pneumonia triggered by COVID-19, and stated that he now faced months of lung rehabilitation in order to breathe properly again. He admitted that he was \\"blas√©\\" about the pandemic and warned people of all ages to take the pandemic seriously.  Reception  Rich's content has attracted coverage in various national media, particularly publications in the towns and regions he visits. New Delhi publication The New Learn reported on Rich's travels in India in January 2019. They praised his visits to refugee camps for Hindus in North Delhi stranded following the crisis in Pakistan, and described his videos as \\"introducing the world to an India that is real and authentic, where people still open up their lunch boxes to strangers, where tea is the beginning of lifelong associations, where trust means more than money and where there is vibrancy everywhere\\". In March 2019, Hindustan Times reported on how he exposed scams against tourists in Delhi Airport, from inflated prices to rickshaw drivers and false claims. In June 2019, Rich was discussed in the Slovak press for his visit to Lun√≠k IX, which he described as \\"Europe's largest poor Roma neighbourhood\\". The article described how, despite warnings about the estate being among the most dangerous in Europe, he was welcomed by local people who spoke fluent English and invited him to their surprisingly modern and clean homes, which he described as \\"better than [his] apartment in Britain\\". Swedish YouTube personality Pewdiepie stated in a July 2019 podcast that Bald and Bankrupt is his favourite YouTube channel. Afisha Daily journalist Lyubava Zaitseva wrote about Rich's interesting choice of Russian destinations in September 2019, stating that even its Russian readers had \\"not seen such Russia\\" and praising him for \\"trying to distance himself from tourist places\\" and showing cities \\"from the inside, communicating with local residents\\". In November 2019, Russia Beyond named Rich's channel in its list of six YouTube vlogs \\"where foreigners show you real Russia\\". It noted his \\"openness to local people and unpredictability\\". Incidents Rich's video about a trip to Patamanta in Bolivia was reported by Gizmodo Espa√±ol as \\"more scary than entering Chernobyl\\". In the video, he informed a local woman that he was a tourist, prompting her to warn him that \\"people burn people\\" in the area. Two men later approached Rich, inspected his passport, and gave him 30 minutes to leave the area. Following a November 2019 video filmed on a train to Chechnya, in which Rich joked about an opportunity to share a train compartment with a Chechen \\"chick\\", he was forced to apologize on camera by Chechen authorities, which is a common practice in Chechnya.https://eng.kavkaz-uzel.eu/articles/49042/ Publications * Chichester, A., (9 April 2018).

It is revealed that Gunjan lost his voice when she was young, in an accident, and therefore cannot speak. Yogi and Gunjan bond at their first official meeting. Yogi's father strictly tells him to not meet Gunjan before marriage. One day, when Gunjan was passing by their house in a rickshaw, Yogi follows her on his cycle. Unlike before, Gunjan is aware about it and appreciates his effort. His happiness is short-lived as he again collides with Park's scooty. Pari gathers people so that Yogi can't escape this time.

Gunjan tries to help him but when he sees Prakash coming and she quickly escapes in the rickshaw as Yogi and she were not supposed to meet before marriage. Prakash intervenes in Yogi and Pari's fight. Prakash tells Pari that Yogi indeed can't speak or hear. But this doesn't change her mind. She still manages to take money from Prakash for Yogi damaging her scooty which indeed was not so damaged. Prakash blames Yogi for the money he had to give away to Pari. Pari revealed to be a very bubbly, modern girl and a dedicated doctor. She is from Kolkata and loves Bengali food. He often goes partying with her friends and also likes drinking occasionally. Because of her habit of coming late night from parties, her land lord throws her luggage out of the house. While she was riding the scooty with all her luggage, she collides with Yogi's grandfather Om Shrivastava. He gets a bit injured and Pari offers to drop him home. When they reach home, Yogi and Prakash identify her. While she was inside the house doing Om's dressing, her luggage disappears from her scooty. She creates a big scene in front of the entire neighbourhood. Her pleas melt Om and Geeta's heart and they allows her to stay with them as a paying guest. However, Yogi and other family members are against the idea. Finally Pari is given Yogi's room which is on the terrace and Yogi has been shifted to the drawing room. Yogi is terrified to see Pari working in the hospital when he secretly tries to meet Gunjan there. Pari collides with Yogi and Gunjan while walking in the corridor and the three of them fall, Pari again creates a scene claiming Yogi of following her everywhere in front of his in-laws. Khushi and Yogi somehow control the situation. Initially at loggerheads, Yogi and Pari eventually become friends when Pari offers to make Yogi meet Gunjan in her hospital. Pari even saved Yogi and Gunjan from embarrassing situations and helped him propose to Gunjan. Slowly, Pari begins to bond with the entire Shrivastava family. One day, Pari overhears that she would have to go from the house when Yogi will get married because Gunjan and he will live in Yogi's room. Pari gets scared and tries to convince Gunjan to allow her to live in the Shrivastava house who in turn convinces Yogi. Yogi shifts Pari with her sister, Khushi. On the day of the engagement, Pari accidentally wears the engagement ring for Gunjan following a hilarious set of events in which Yogi tries to chop Pari's finger, Gunjan pretends to faint, Pari roaming around wearing surgical gloves in the house full of guests.

However,Shiv Sharma gets angry as Yogi could have shouted and saved Gunjan much before but since he can't speak he put Gunjan's life in danger. He thinks that Yogi is not a suitable match for Gunjan and cancels the wedding on the day of the wedding.

Bilu (Áï¢Á•øÂ±±), within Taroko National Park. Administratively, it is located in Xiulin, Hualien County near the border with Nantou County.  Description  Dayuling is located at the intersection of Central Cross-Island Highway and Provincial Highway 14A. As the highest point of the Central Cross- Island Highway, Dayuling is typically considered as the dividing point of the highway into its west and east sections. To the west, the highway passes through a short one-way tunnel known as the Hehuanshan Tunnel (ÂêàÊ≠°Â±±ÈößÈÅì) before descending to Lishan. To the east, the highway passes through Tianxiang before dropping into Taroko Gorge. Meanwhile, Highway 14A branches away to the south, climbing to its peak at Wuling. Dayuling's surrounding area is known for its high-altitude agriculture, producing high-mountain tea, apples, and peaches.  History  Originally, a trail was built by the Atayal people passed near Dayuling. During the Japanese occupation of Taiwan, the Governor-General of Taiwan, Sakuma Samata, ordered the construction of a road through the same trail as part of the five years plan to governing aborigines to better transport supplies in the Truku War. After the change of power to the Kuomingtang, the Nationalist government began building the Central Cross- Island Highway between 1956 and 1960. Chiang Kai-shek visited the pass in 1958, renaming the site as \\"Dayuling\\" after the story of Great Flood of Gun-Yu (Gun-Yu is alternatively known as Dayu) as a reference to the difficult construction.  Geology  Dayuling is located within a stratum known as the Dayuling Formation (Â§ßÁ¶πÂ∂∫Â±§), a subset of the Bilu Formation (Áï¢Á•øÂ±±Â±§). The stratum was first identified by geologist Zhaoxia Chen (Èô≥ËÇáÂ§è) in 1979. The 2,200 meter thick layer is composed of slate, phyllite, and quartzite. Nummulite fossils were found near Dayuling, the first in Taiwan. Due to the foliation of the rock, the construction of Hehuanshan Tunnel at Dayuling proved to be difficult and prone to collapse.

Oscar Ho, the curator, considered the Lo Ting (a fictional tribe of half-man, half-fish creatures) as a purported ancestor of the Tanka tribes from whom the indigenous Hong Kongers descended. Drawing inspiration from archaeological findings, anthropological interpretations of myths and stories, paleobiological data, and literature sources, the curator invited artists to create ‚Äútangible and intangible evidence‚Äù of the Lo Ting and outlined an alternative version of local histories. It was the second installment of a series of Lo Ting exhibitions. The history of Lo Ting was first presented in the exhibition Museum 97: History, Community, Individual (23 June - 12 July 1997, Hong Kong Art Centre). Hong Kong Reincarnated ‚Äì New Lo Ting Archaeological Find was an ambitious attempt to further elaborate on the historical narratives of the mythical creature that enabled visitors to decipher the historical discourses and the processes related to local identities.  Myth of the Lo Ting  According to New Narratives of Guangdong by the Qing scholar Qu Dajun, the Lo Ting, a half-man, half-fish hybrid, were living around the Lantau Island area. The aquatic creatures looked human with yellowish-dark eyes and bodies covered with short, brownish hair. The story tells of a man who brought a female Lo Ting onto the land, offering her food and clothes and teaching her to talk. Curiously, Lo Ting does not appreciate such kindness and wants to return to the sea, choosing an \\"uncivilised form of living\\".  Exhibition Concept  In creating a fictional but convincing narrative, this exhibition intended to adopt a disembodied, omniscient voice of authority, to offer ‚Äúobjective‚Äù readings of the presence and absence of archaeological findings. First, it addressed participating artists as members from Team 20, a department of excavation affiliated with the Research Centre of Ancient History in Nanhai. They were assigned to be involved in the curatorial process at different organisations, such as the fictional Hong Kong Lo Ting Research Association and Friends of Lo Ting. These ‚Äúunofficial organisations‚Äù were ingenious appropriations of the academic units that had conducted surveys and investigations on Chek Lap Kok Island, the archaeological site of the rich relics from the Middle Neolithic period, about 6,000 years ago. The curatorial team meticulously designed the exhibition space to look like a modernist museum. Exhibits were shown in glass cases with wooden frames and miniature models, and maps were used to illustrate the geographical environment of the Lo Ting settlements. The ‚Äúartifacts‚Äù were framed within the disciplinary context of archaeology, using photographs, diagrams, documents, and scientific data (such as the measurements of objects) to demonstrate how the artifacts were excavated and to depict their historical significance. By blurring the boundaries between historical facts and imaginative fabrication, many of the creative works were flawed in some way to allow audiences to question the ‚Äúmuseum presentation‚Äù as a constructed convention. Thus, it created a condition for audiences to examine, verify, and interpret the historical narratives based on their thoughts and beliefs.  Participating artists  The artists include AU Kawai, CHAN Chihang, CHAN Kachun, HO Yuenleung, LAU Ying, LEUNG Wanyee Janice, LIU Chiwai, Luke CHING, NG Chiwai, NG Tszkwan, NG Waiming, SHEK Mingfai Phil, SIT Likhoi, WAN Laikuen Annie, YAN Patto, YAU Puiwah, YEUNG Waikeung, and YU Chiushan.

The surface consists of black and white cobblestones whose structure is reminiscent of a typeface. The pixel writing establishes a reference to the present and shows the title \\"Deutsche Trib√ºne\\" as a detail. The \\"D\\" of \\"Deutsch\\" is missing so that Wirth's struggle for German unity is not associated with dull nationalism. Before the inauguration, the then Federal President Roman Herzog remarked: \\"This will double the number of republican monuments in Germany\\". In 2012, the monument was removed from its original location in the city centre and a second, smaller version was erected near the Freiheitshalle.  Honours  Johann Georg August Wirth's Ehrengrab at the Frankfurt Main Cemetery The in Kulmbach, an institution for journalist training, has been awarding the Johann Georg August Wirth Prize since 2009.

Life Gentleman was a son of Thomas and Joan Gentleman, of Southwold, in Suffolk, England; Thomas Gentleman's father William was a merchant and shipowner. He wrote that he was \\"borne a fisherman's sonne by the seashore,\\" and spent his \\"youthful time about fisher affaires, whereby I am more skilfull in nets, lines, and hookes then in Rethoricke, Logicke, or learned bookes.\\" About 1612 he was consulted by John Keymer, a writer on economics, who was collecting information about the herring fisheries with a view to stimulating their development. Gentleman gave Keymer the benefit of his experience, but, nothing having come of the scheme, Gentleman determined to publish his ideas himself. The result appeared in 1614, published by Nathaniel Butter of London, under the title England's way to win wealth, and to employ ships and marriners, or, A plain description what great profite, it will bring unto the Commonwealth of England, by the erecting, building, and adventuring of busses, to sea, a-fishing. With a true relation of the inestimable wealth that is yearely taken out of his majesties seas, by the Hollanders, by their numbers of busses, pinkes and line-boates ‚Ä¶ and also a discourse of the sea-coast townes of England. It was dedicated to Henry Howard, 1st Earl of Northampton and warden of the Cinque Ports. Later history of the book Nothing more is known of Gentleman. In 1660 a new edition of his book, with an address to the reader instead of the dedication, and other alterations, appeared as The Best Way to make England the richest and wealthiest country in Europe by Advancing the Fishing Trade. It was also included in The Harleian Miscellany (editions of 1744 and 1808). Gentleman's scheme was similar to that propounded by the military writer Robert Hitchcock in his Politique Platt for a Prince (1581), and both Hitchcock and Gentleman are commended by Thomas Mun. Gerard de Malynes gives an abridgement of Gentleman's book in his Lex Mercatoria (1622) (chapter xlvii).

Originally the regiment, like all Italian tank units, was part of the infantry, but on 1 June 1999 it became part of the cavalry. Operationally the regiment was last assigned to the Infantry Division \\"Granatieri di Sardegna\\".  History   Formation  The regiment traces its history back to the Armed Tanks Regiment () formed on 1 October 1927 in Rome, which moved in 1931 to Bologna. The regiment was disbanded on 15 September 1936 and in its stead four tank infantry regiments were raised: * 1st Tank Infantry Regiment, in Vercelli * 2nd Tank Infantry Regiment, in Verona * 3rd Tank Infantry Regiment, in Bologna * 4th Tank Infantry Regiment, in Rome The 3rd Tank Infantry Regiment retrained three battalions: VI and VII assault tanks battalions and the I Breach Tank Battalion. The assault tanks battalions fielded L3/35 tankettes, while the breach tanks battalion fielded Fiat 3000 light tanks. The regiment also controlled the Mechanized Company \\"Zara\\" in Zadar, which fielded a mix of Lancia 1ZM armored cars and L3/35 tankettes. The regiment was the central training center for all officers and ranks destined for tank units and fielded three separate training battalions. Additionally the regiment was administratively and logistically responsible for all tank units deployed in the Italian colonies of: Libya, Eritrea, and Somaliland. The regiment's initial structure was: * 3rd Tank Infantry Regiment, in Bologna ** VI Assault Tanks Battalion \\"Lollini\\", in Treviso (L3/35 tankettes) ** VII Assault Tanks Battalion \\"Vezzani\\", in Florence (L3/35 tankettes) ** I Breach Tanks Battalion, in Bologna (Fiat 3000 light tanks) ** Tank Officers Training Battalion, in Bologna ** Tank Non-Commissioned Officers Training Battalion, in Bologna ** Tank Specialists Training Battalion, in Bologna ** Mechanized Company \\"Zara\\", in Zadar (Fiat 3000 light tanks and Lancia 1ZM armored cars) ** 3rd Tank Training Center, in Bologna ** 3rd Tank Materiel Maintenance Workshop, in Bologna In 1936 the regiment received the XXIII Assault Tanks Battalion \\"Stennio\\", and XXXII Assault Tanks Battalion \\"Battisti\\" after their return from Libya. On 15 July 1937 the regiment ceded the I Breach Tanks Battalion for the formation of the 31st Tank Infantry Regiment, while on 6 January 1939 the regiment ceded the VI Assault Tanks Battalion \\"Lollini\\", XXIII Assault Tanks Battalion \\"Stennio\\" and XXXII Assault Tanks Battalion \\"Battisti\\" to the forming 33rd Tank Infantry Regiment. During 1939 the regiment received the V Assault Tanks Battalion \\"Venezian\\" from the 32nd Tank Infantry Regiment, and ceded the VII Assault Tanks Battalion \\"Vezzani\\" to the 31st Tank Infantry Regiment. In April 1940 tank battalions were renamed and so the regiment entered World War II with the following structure: * 3rd Tank Infantry Regiment, in Bologna ** V Tank Battalion \\"L\\" (L3/35 tankettes) ** Tank Officers Training Battalion, in Bologna ** Tank Non-Commissioned Officers Training Battalion, in Bologna ** Tank Specialists Training Battalion, in Bologna ** Mechanized Company \\"Zara\\", in Zadar (Fiat 3000 light tanks and Lancia 1ZM armored cars) ** 3rd Tank Training Center, in Bologna ** 3rd Tank Materiel Maintenance Workshop, in Bologna  World War II  During December 1940 the V Tank Battalion \\"L\\" was sent to North Africa, where it joined the 17th Infantry Division \\"Pavia\\" for the Western Desert Campaign. For its conduct during Operation Crusader the V battalion was awarded a Bronze Medal of Military Valour. During the war the regiment trained all personnel destined for tank units and managed the training grounds at Bologna, Porretta, Riolo, Vergato, Asiago, and Futa. The regiment was also the central research and test center of the army's armored vehicles. In spring 1941 the regiment raised the IX Tank Battalion \\"M\\" with M13/40 tanks, which arrived on 29 July 1941 in Libya and joined the 32nd Tank Infantry Regiment. As with the V Tank Battalion \\"L\\" before, also the IX distinguished itself during the Western Desert Campaign and was awarded a Bronze Medal of Military Valour. After Italy changed sides with the Armistice of Cassibile on 8 September 1943 the 3rd Tank Infantry Regiment was disbanded by the Germans.  Cold War  During 1963 the regiment was raised again as 3rd Armored Infantry Regiment in Persano in Southern Italy and joined the Infantry Division \\"Granatieri di Sardegna\\". Besides being the armored component of the \\"Granatieri di Sardegna\\" division the regiment was also the training unit of the Mechanized and Armored Troops School in Caserta. Therefore the regiment, unlike the other three armored infantry regiments of the army, fielded its own reconnaissance squadron and was assigned a self-propelled artillery battery. * 25px 3rd Armored Infantry Regiment, in Persano (detached to the Mechanized and Armored Troops School) ** Command and Services Company, in Persano (includes an anti-tank guided missile platoon) ** IV Bersaglieri Battalion, in Persano (M113 armored personnel carriers) ** IX Tank Battalion, in Salerno (M47 Patton tanks) ** 1st Squadron \\"Cavalleggeri di Alessandria\\", in Persano ** 7th Battery, in Persano (M7 105mm self-propelled howitzers, detached from the III Self-propelled Field Artillery Group, 13th Field Artillery Regiment) = 9th Armored Battalion \\"M.O. Butera\\" = During the 1975 army reform the 3rd Armored Infantry Regiment was disbanded on 1 October 1975 and its IV Bersaglieri Battalion became the 67th Bersaglieri Battalion \\"Fagare\\", while the IX Tank Battalion was disbanded. On the same day the IV Mechanized Battalion of the 17th Infantry Regiment \\"Acqui\\" based in L'Aquila was renamed 9th Armored Battalion \\"M.O. Butera\\" and received the war flag and traditions of the disbanded 3rd Armored Infantry Regiment. The battalion's number commemorated the IX Tank Battalion \\"M\\", which the 3rd regiment had raised and which had distinguished itself during the Western Desert Campaign. Tank and armored battalions created during the 1975 army reform were all named for officers, soldiers and partisans, who were posthumously awarded Italy's highest military honor the Gold Medal of Military Valour during World War II. The 9th Armored Battalion's name commemorated 4th Tank Infantry Regiment Soldier Gaetano Butera, who had joined a partisan unit in Rome and was murdered on 24 March 1944 in the Ardeatine massacre. Equipped with M47 Patton tanks and M113 armored personnel carriers the battalion joined the Motorized Brigade \\"Acqui\\". On 1 October 1991 the 9th \\"Butera\\" left the brigade and moved to Monte Romano, where the unit took over management of the Monte Romano Training Range. With the end of the Cold War the Italian Army drew down its forces and on 29 September 1995 the battalion was disbanded and the war flag of the 3rd Armored Infantry Regiment transferred to the Shrine of the Flags in the Vittoriano in Rome.

The unit acts in conjunction with the Control and Reporting Centre (CRC) at RAF Boulmer in Northumberland, but also detaches staff to overseas locations when the Royal Air Force is engaged in operations. Some of these postings are permanent, such as in the Falklands Islands and at Cyprus. 1 ACC's remit is to protect the United Kingdom's, and deployed airspace, from hostile aircraft. History No. 1 Air Control Centre started out as No. 9 Signals Unit (9 SU) at RAF Rattlesden in Suffolk in 1964. A year later it was renamed as No. 1 Air Control Centre, and remained at Rattlesden. In 1967, it moved to RAF Wattisham, where it remained until 1979 until it moved to Nancekuke in Cornwall (later RAF Portreath and then RRH Portreath). Between 2006 and 2009, No. 1 ACC was deployed to Afghanistan on Operation Herrick. In 2008, plans were announced in Parliament to relocate 1 ACC from RAF Kirton in Lindsey and the CRC from Scampton to RAF Coningsby in Lincolnshire. Whilst this move did not proceed as intended, 1 ACC moved to RAF Scampton in 2012 and the technical site at RAF Kirton in Lindsey was sold off, although the domestic site was retained for RAF personnel. In 2018, the RAF announced that RAF Scampton would close by 2022, which would involve moving all units out of the station to other locations. 1 ACC will move before the station closes to RAF Boulmer. Staffing of the unit fluctuates with demand and role, but in 2015, the number of personnel at the unit was around 220. Role The main role of 1 ACC is to provide deployed air control operations, both in the United Kingdom and on deployed operations worldwide. Whilst working in the United Kingdom, 1 ACC feeds into the CRC at RAF Boulmer and helps to protect UK airspace from hostile aircraft.

Blanche had a consistent modus operandi - when he spotted the victim, he would break into their house at night, bound her hands and got her to his car, driving to the outskirts of the city, under the threat of a knife. He then began terrorizing his victim, raping her once or repeatedly, usually in the middle of the countryside. His impulses now appeased, he started behaving as a friend or even a considerate companion, bringing his victim back to their home. In 1992, Blanche was imprisoned for the first series of rapes. He was released in 2002, despite the warnings of the adverse psychiatric expertise, and he resumed raping in 2003. He was rearrested, and his second trial made it to the national headlines, because the French police could not proceed with his arrest, since Blanche acted in several departments that did not share their judicial information. The national mediatization of the case lead to the creation of the automated judicial file for perpetrators of sexual offences.  Biography  Jean-Luc Blanche was born in February 1958, the sixth in a family of 14 children. Like many of his brothers and sisters, he was placed in another family at a young age, after suffering abuse at the hands of his parents. At age 8, he returned to his family in Pauvres, in Ardennes. At 17, Jean-Luc found a job as a farm boy, and here got his first conviction. He stayed in prison several times for thefts and falsifying checks. In addition, he also stole bank cards and cars. In 1982, Blanche left Ardennes, got married and moved to Caen, in Calvados, where he continued his crimes. His wife eventually filed for divorce in 1990, after his seventh conviction.\\"Enter the Accused\\" in May 2009 and January 2011, Jean-Luc Blanche, the Backpacker Rapist, on France 2\\"Crimes\\", on December 9, 2013 - \\"...in Champagne-Ardennes (second episode: The Backpacker Rapist)\\", on NRJ 12  First series of rapes  On August 27, 1990, Jean-Luc Blanche kidnapped his ex-wife, driving her to a forest where he raped her several times. Then he tried to strangle her with a rope, which broke. He then decided to drive her home, but at a stop she opened the door and ran away. On September 7, on Des Jardins Street in Caen, Blanche broke into the house of a woman named Nathalie at night, threatening her with tear gas and a knife. He drove her to a forest, where he raped her, before driving her home, but like his ex-wife, she jumped out and managed to flee. On September 14, again on Des Jardins Street, Blanche broke into another woman's house, named Clara, at night, threatening her with a knife, tying her up and raping her. After the fact, he conversed with her a long while, before stealing the money in her purse and left the house, leaving her tied up. Blanche was sentenced in September 1992 by the cour d'assises of Caen and √âvry, to 20 years imprisonment. On September 25, 2002, he was released from Caen Prison with a remission and a pardon. The psychiatric experts said, however, that Blanche is a \\"narcissistic pervert likely to reoffend\\". He moved to Reims, in Marne, with his new companion (either called Laurence or Brigitte).  Second series of rapes  In late April 2003, in Vouziers in the Ardennes, Blanche molested Nadia, the 9-year-old daughter of his wife. He told her that he would \\"ziggle\\" the kid if she talked or complained about it. On June 21, in Reims, two students of a local school (12/13-year-old Aurore and an unnamed 17-year-old) ran away from class to attend a music festival. Jean-Luc Blanche and his brother, Bruno, lured them into their home, made them drink alcohol and then raped them. The next afternoon, one of the brothers brought the teenagers back to their homes. On July 12, Brigitte/Laurence decided to leave Jean-Luc. She went to the gendarmerie of Vouziers and lodged a complaint against him for the sexual abuse of her daughter, Nadia. The gendarmes summoned Blanche, and he was placed in custody the following day. After an interrogation, he was indicted in Charlville-M√©zi√®res, where Justice Paul-Andr√© Breton decided to place Blanche under judicial control, with no contact with his ex-wife, her daughter or the witnesses. The warnings of the psychiatric experts, however, were not present on Blanche's profile, and despite the criminal record and the unfavorable opinion of the prosecutor, the judge decided that there was insufficient evidence, and Jean-Luc was released. On July 27, at Fontaine-la- Soret in Eure, around 11 PM, in a rest area near the RN13, Blanche tried to strangle a woman named Charlotte. She struggled immensely, but he had the upper hand, raping her before fleeing. Charlotte didn't manage to remember his license plate because of the shock, but still filed a complaint to the gendarmerie in Bernay. On the night of August 9, Blanche entered his ex-wife's home in Vouziers through an open window. He took a knife from the kitchen, raped Laurence/Brigitte, then struck and knocked her down, also destroying some of the property around the house. A neighbor, alerted by the cries of coming from within the household, called the gendarmerie, but in the meantime, Blanche had run away. When they learned that it was Jean-Luc, gendarmerie realized several things, among them: he disrespected his judicial control; he hadn't shown up to work since July 13; he never went to his mother's house in Reims, nor did the weekly visit to the police station. On August 13, an arrest warrant was issued for Blanche on the FPR. On the night between August 25 and 26, between 4 and 5 PM, on Des Jardins Street, Jean-Luc Blanche entered the studio of 19-year-old student C√©line, which was on the first floor. He tied her hands behind her back, and asked her to go and withdraw money from a vending machine. They left the studio, with C√©line put in the back of a stolen car, a black Volkswagen Polo. Instead of heading to the city center, Blanche drove to the countryside, parking on a small dirt road near Pont-l'√âv√™que. He claimed to be a part of a network of human traffickers and must deliver her to his Russian or Turkish accomplices, so she could be prostituted in Eastern Europe. However, Jean-Luc suggested that he would not do that and release her, on condition that C√©line had sex with him. Blanche took her to a clearing, where he raped her. Then he tried to talk to her, attempting to make C√©line pity him by saying that his wife had left him. They left by car, with Blanche stopping on several occasions, submitting his victim to psychological blackmail by pretending to hesitate, telling her that if he released her, he would lose his contract and certainly the confidence of his accomplices. C√©line ended up giving in. He stopped the car on a farm road near a cornfield, where he raped her again for much longer, and in a more brutal manner. They then left in the direction of Caen, with Jean-Luc admitting that he had lied to her. C√©line how much she had handled, she was revolted. Blanche stopped the car and threatened her with a knife, then told her he would take her with him to southern France. C√©line removed the car key from the ignition, threw it out together with Jean-Luc's mobile phone and grabbed the knife. While he was outside getting back the key, C√©line searched through his bag and discreetly took her abductor's driving license and put it in her wallet. She threatened Jean-Luc with the knife, demanding they leave towards Caen. Blanche, helpless, promised that he would do nothing, and let her drive. She parked in front of her house, whereupon he took the driver's license she took and returned it to him. That same day, C√©line went to the police station in Caen. The police went with her to the places mentioned, and at the site of the second rape near the cornfield, they found condoms used by Blanche. They also found the mobile phone, which was thrown out of the car window by C√©line. On the night of September 1, in Orsay, Blanche entered the home of 38-year-old executive assistant Martine, through an open window. He forced her to drink alcohol before kidnapping her. Jean-Luc threatened Martine that he would place her in a brothel, taking her to Dijon in C√¥te-d'Or, where he raped her several times before taking her home, warning her that he would return if she told anybody. Ten days later, encourage by her aunt, Martine complained to the Besan√ßon police officers in Doubs. On September 4, at around 4 PM, in Saint-Loup- G√©anges in Sa√¥ne-et-Loire, Blanche entered the home of a 36-year-old real estate negotiator named Solange, whose husband had just gone to work. He threatened her with a knife, tying her hands behind her back and pulled her down the hall. The noise woke up Solange's two children, who asked the strange gentleman who is with her. She reassured them by telling that she was helping the man, whose car had broken down. The children went back to bed, while Jean- Luc forced her into his car. While driving, he told Solange of incredible stories about gambling debts allegedly incurred by her husband, then of gangs who took her husband's vehicle to commit a robbery, and were then ordered to kidnap her so they could ensure his silence. While driving down a forest path, he took the woman out the car, then he simulated a strangling gesture with some string. They then drove back to an old, isolated and uninhabited house in Dr√¥me, for which Blanche had stolen the keys. The man chained Solange's arms in front of the fireplace, forced her to drink strong alcohol, undressed her and passed the blade of a knife along her body. When she was dead drunk, Blanche released her, lay her on the bed and raped her, before acting tenderly towards her. On the next day, he offered Solange to shower and prepare breakfast. They left by car, towards her house. Blanche borrowed Solange's mobile phone to call her mother, so he could inform her that her daughter would be attending his birthday at his home in Reims. Jean-Luc then parked the car on a parking lot at the entrance of Chalon-sur-Sa√¥ne so he could smoke a cigarette. At this time, Solange managed to break free and phoned her husband, explaining where she was and telling him to come pick her up as soon as possible. Blanche, helpless, ran away.  Arrest  On September 7, Jean-Luc Blanche was arrested at his mother's apartment building in Reims, where his concubine, Rachida, also lived. In his car, authorities found the string with which he tied the hands of his victims, along with audio cassettes and a CD player with C√©line's voice recorded on them. During the interrogation, Blanche told the police that Solange (his last victim) was the \\"best shot of his life\\". He also stated that in June, Aurore claimed to be over 15 years old, and that both girls had consented. The rape of the 17-year-old was later not included at trial. Jean-Luc Blanche described to the examinating psychiatrist the traumatic memories of his childhood concerning his father, who: * broke a kerosene lamp on his mother's head, causing her burns * attacked his mother * had his mother eat dirt * raped his little sisters * locked him in the cellar for making an ink spot * hanged him by the feet and whipped him with a thong * put him outside at night naked and whipped him with nettles, when he was just 5 years old * attached a dog collar to him and made him eat excrements  Trial  On June 23, 2006, the trial of Jean-Luc Blanche and his brother Bruno began at the Charleville-M√©zi√®rs court. On each day of the trial, Jean-Luc entered the court after failed suicide attempt. The first day by slashing the veins of his left arm, the second by slashing his carotid artery, the third by banging his head against a wall and the fourth by trying to hang himself with the toilet chain in the bathroom, which broke. Jean-Luc refused having even harmed his victims, while Bruno denied raping Aurore. Bruno attempt to make the court pity him, because he was in mourning: his concubine, St√©phanie Baudin, had been found dead at home on June 9. Jean-Luc refused to apologize to Solange, his last victim, as he claimed that it was consentual. His defense tried to mitigate the circumstances through the child abuse, during which Blanche received no love or care, with his ultra-violent farm worker father punished his children harshly.\\"Perpetuity for the 'Backpacker Rapist\\" Article published on June 30, 2006 on LCI Pierrette Varin, their mother, was unable to say how many children she had had, nor could remember their names. In June 2006, Jean-Luc Blanche was sentenced to life imprisonment with a 22-year mandatory prison sentence by the Charleville-M√©zi√®rs cour d'assises. The whole cased was described as a \\"judicial blunder\\", which caused a lot of noise, contributing to the creation of the sex offender files.

It was organised by the Xiamen Dada group, one of the more radical avant-garde groups that emerged in China in the 1980s. The exhibition took place in the then Xiamen People's Art Museum (now The Cultural Centre of Xiamen) in Xiamen, Fujian Province, from September 28 to October 5, 1986. Participating artists included Huang Yongping (the co- founder of the Xiamen Dada group), Lin Chun, Ji Tairan, and Jiao Yaoming. The exhibition marked the art group Xiamen Dada's entrance into contemporary Chinese art history and was later transformed into an initiating exhibition in a three-stage event organized by Xiamen Dada in 1986.  Background  The exhibition is widely discussed and examined in the context of the 85 New Wave Movement in China, and Xiamen Dada as a ‚Äúquite unique group‚Äù in the Movement. Critiques also explicitly link the exhibition with political movements like the Cultural Revolution and the May Fourth Movement when commenting on the exhibition as a spiritual extension of reflections and critiques on Chinese culture.  Exhibition concept  A complementary text or concept note of the Exhibition was Huang Yongping's Xiamen Dada ‚Äî A Kind of Postmodernism? that he wrote for the art newspaper Fine Arts in China. Huang notes in the article that the exhibition ‚Äúserves as a fortunetelling one in terms of all kinds of possibilities localized Chinese modern art might have.‚Äù The text also connects the Xiamen Dada group with Dada the European avant-garde art movement and puts forward Huang's reinterpretation of Dadaism: ‚ÄúZen is Dada, Dada is Zen. Postmodernism is the modern renaissance of Zen. Both concepts make their names as the utmost candid and profound ‚Äî not in terms of the aesthetics, but in terms of the impossibility of the real, and extreme doubt and distrust.‚Äù The anti-art sentiment would be echoed in the exhibition, and the exhibition would later be characterized as a radical anti-art action in media coverages and critiques.  Participating artists  Fourteen artists participated in the Exhibition, according to Huang Yongping's retrospective recording of the event. These include: Huang Yongping, Lin Chun (ÊûóÊò•), Ji Tairan (Á∫™Ê≥∞ÁÑ∂), Jiao Yaoming (ÁÑ¶ËÄÄÊòé), Lin Jiahua (ÊûóÂòâÂçé), Cai Lixiong (Ëî°Á´ãÈõÑ), Yu Xiaogang (‰ΩôÊôìÂàö), Chen Chengzong (ÈôàÊâøÂÆó), Li Xiang (ÊùéÁøî), Li Yaonian (ÊùéË∑ÉÂπ¥), Huang Ping (ÈªÑÂπ≥), Wu Yanping (Âê¥ÁáïËêç), Liu Yiling (Âàò‰∏ÄËè±). A total of 83 works were exhibited.  Development  The Exhibition is widely regarded as the prologue in a three-stage event. * Xiamen Dada‚ÄîExhibition of Modern Art (1986.9.28-10.5, the then Xiamen People's Art Museum). * Xiamen Dada, Dismantling - Destruction - Burning (1986.11.20-11.23, in front of the then Xiamen People's Art Museum). Sixty works previously on show in the Xiamen Dada - Modern Art Exhibition was dismantled, destructed, and eventually burned in the square in front of the then Xiamen People's Art Museum. The burning took place on November 23, 1986, and lasted for about two hours. About 200 audiences were present at the event. * Xiamen Dada, Exhibition for Fujian Art Museum (1986.12.16-12.19, Fujian Art Museum). The Xiamen Dada group curated and installed the exhibition in two days (1986.12.14 - 1986. 12.15) with the help of professors and students from the Department of Art, Fujian Normal University. The exhibition featured found objects which were primarily found in the Fujian Art Museum's surroundings. It was up for about two hours before it was shut down by the museum officials.

She is also known as the Sholay Girl, as she played Hema Malini‚Äôs stunt double in Sholay. The film, The Sholay Girl, is a biopic about her life. She is also the first female to become a member of the Movie Stunt Artists Association. She has performed thousands of dangerous stunts in almost 400 films.  Career  Reshma began working as a stunt double when she was 14 when the Fight Director S. Azim offered her to join the film industry. She began her career by playing Laxmi Chaya‚Äôs double in the film Ek Khiladi Bawan Patte (1972). Reshma describes, \\"I started with 175 rupees per day. I got 100 rupees in hand. I was swindled of the transport money. But I was happy. I wouldn‚Äôt have been able to make this amount even if I was a graduate. Fulfilling the needs of my family was my priority\\" Reshma has played the stunt double for Waheeda Rehman, Rekha, Hema Malini, Sridevi, Dimple Kapadia, and Meenakshi Sheshadri, among Bollywood actress. She has also done stunts in many Bhojpuri and South Indian films and bilingual films like Gandhi, Mangal Pandey and The Warrior. She was the stunt woman for almost all film actresses through the 1970s and 80s in Hindi film industry.  Personal life  Reshma took to doing stunts in films in order to financially support her family. Fight Director S. Azim offered her to join the film industry. ‚ÄúI was a tomboy. Fight director S. Azim uncle had seen my antics in the area. Area ki behen banne ka bahut shauk tha. He suggested I do stunts,‚Äù she recalls. However, her father was against her performing stunts. He believed that the huge risk involved while performing a stunt could not be covered by any given amount of money. Eventually, she managed to convince her family. In 1980s, she married stunt director Shakoor Pathan. She and her husband faced great financial challenges when a law banning stunts in films was passed in 1984. ‚ÄúOne day I had no money for our next meal. I had the habit of leaving coins and rupees in nook and corners of the house. I frantically searched cups, boxes, containers‚Ä¶ hoping to find some money. I found some 1600 rupees and cried with relief,‚Äù she recalls. She believes that stunt-masters have an uncertain future and ensured that her sister's sons (whom she raised) and her own complete their education and got stable jobs. ‚ÄúOne is an engineer, the second a manager in a car company, while my son is a doctor.‚Äù She has actively spoken out against the sexism in the Indian film industry. She received many indecent proposals from men in her career and retorted harshly. \\"If you remain quiet the first time someone misbehaves, they‚Äôre encouraged. I tactfully used my tongue, though I could have used my fists to defend myself,\\" she told Filmfare.

Biography  He came from a theatrical family. His father, , was an actor with the Imperial Theatres. A grandfather and uncle were choreographers. His aunt, Maria Valberkhova, was also a dramatic actress, who later turned to comedy. He began to learn drawing in 1827, at the age of ten, from Fedor Solntsev at the Imperial Academy of Fine Arts. He received his first certificate in 1829 and became a regularly enrolled student in 1833. By this time, both of his parents were dead. Bust of Nikolai Gogol In 1836, he received a small silver medal for \\"sculpting from nature\\" and began to study with Boris Orlovsky. He completed his studies in 1839 as an \\"Artist 14th Class\\" and was awarded the right to travel abroad as a pensioner of the Academy. Before departing, he worked on a project at the Winter Palace and participated in creating monuments for Nikolai Karamzin (in Simbirsk), and Gavril Derzhavin (in Kazan). He left for Italy in 1843. In 1846, he was recalled to Russia as the result of a clash with the Papal Police. By the end of the year, he was offered a job as a teacher at the Moscow School of Painting, Sculpture and Architecture. He took up that position the following year, but soon had to attend to the sudden collapse of a statue he had made for the new . He returned to the school at the first opportunity and remained there for the rest of his life. In 1849, he was named an Academician and, in 1858, was elevated to Professor. Matvei Chizhov is, perhaps, his best-known student. For many years, he was employed by the literary journal, Moskvityanin and the Moskovskiye Vedomosti; writing biographies and obituaries of artists as well as notes on art exhibitions. Bas-Relief on the Monument to Nicholas I; depicting him quelling the Cholera Riots In 1866, he was forced to resign, for unknown reasons. He died the following year; leaving behind a widow, a son, and two daughters.

In addition to The Shanghai Murders (1998) and its four sequels, the character also makes a cameo appearance in Rotenberg's epic historical novel, Shanghai. The series and Shanghai have both received critical acclaim and sold well worldwide. View of Shanghai from The Bund, featuring the Monument to the People's Heroes erected in 1993 (right) and the Oriental Pearl TV Tower, completed in 1994 (left), then the tallest building in China. Synopsis The Shanghai Murders: A Mystery of Love and Ivory Panoramic view of the Pudong, Shanghai In or around 1993, Zhong Fong is the forty-four- year-old Head of Special Investigations for the District of Shanghai, and a widower. His investigation of brutal murders by the so-called Dim Sum Killer leads to a new inquiry into the death of his wife, in which the detective is himself implicated, causing emotional turmoil, exacerbated by the recent return to Shanghai of her lover, Canadian stage director Geoffrey Hyland. With help from the widow of one of the victims, the detective draws out the killer, but \\"police bosses resist his solution.\\" The chase ultimately leads to a confrontation in a construction pit in the Pudong, and a fight to the death with a master assassin. Now officially blamed for the death of his wife, Zhong is a \\"convicted killer\\" and a \\"traitor\\" condemned to two and a half years in prison and then exile \\"beyond the Wall\\" to a remote and impoverished village in northwestern China near the Mongolian border. The Lake Ching Murders: A Mystery of Fire and Ice Two years into his incommunicado exile, Zhong Fong receives a warning telegram from his friend Lily in Shanghai, and two Party men throw him into the trunk of a car. They drive south for two days to Xi'an, the ultimate destination Lake Ching, a large fresh water lake two hours west of Xi'an, where the authorities have a special assignment for him that \\"no one else wants\\" but which piques his own interest, partly because it may help restore his former status: the massacre of a boat-full of seventeen foreign scientists and businessmen months earlier and the more recent disappearance of the original investigator assigned to the case. As Zhong and his small team work through the case, he is drawn once again into Party politics. The Hua Shan Hospital Murders: A Zhong Fong Mystery Huashan Hospital, Shanghai Zhong Fong has been reinstated as head of Shanghai District's Special Investigations unit, is recently married, and has a baby girl, Xiao Ming. Two abortion clinics are bombed, one in Huashan Hospital, with notes found in English suggesting the bomber is motivated by religion. Zhong enlists the aid of Robert Owens, a lawyer turned antique smuggler searching for his orphaned sister. The Hamlet Murders: A Zhong Fong Mystery Zhong Fong finds himself involved once more with the theatre world when Geoffrey Hyland is found hanged in an apparent suicide, though the detective thinks otherwise, and that finding the killer may lead him to \\"a new knowledge of himself.\\" Because of Hyland's love affair with his wife, the detective is once again a murder suspect. Meanwhile, Zhong's inexpensive apartment is turned into a \\"very expensive condo.\\" Aerial view of the Port of Vancouver The Golden Mountain Murders: A Zhong Fong Mystery In or around 2002 (between 9/11 and the following Iraq War), the Office of Special Investigations is considered a model of modern Chinese efficiency. Zhong Fong follows a disturbing lead to rural Anhui, where he is shocked to confirm the anonymous informant's claim of blood trafficking and a \\"massive\\" outbreak of AIDS, the further investigation of which leads him to take the longest journey of his life, to Vancouver, Canada - \\"the Golden Mountain.\\" Meanwhile, he is being watched by the Master of the Guild of Assassins, who is intent on avenging the Dim Sim Killer, who died at the detective's hands nine years earlier. Another Canadian director and drama teacher appears, Hyland's teacher: Charles Roeg, who serves as a human \\"lie detector\\". Setting and characters Rotenberg's Shanghai is a \\"most unconventional setting\\" for the mystery genre, a city of many millions of people \\"making the tricky transition to capitalism.\\" The city as presented in The Shanghai Murders has been described by reviewers as \\"exactingly accurate\\", \\"taking readers right into the urban heart of Shanghai,\\" as Margaret Cannon puts it, with \\"conflicts between tradition and modernization.\\" As for the wider People's Republic of China, it has been described as a \\"character in and of itself\\". Catherine Thompson says Rotenberg \\"seems to have a great understanding of the people, their culture, politics and psychology.\\". Zhong Fong Readers describe series protagonist Zhong Fong as \\"smart\\", \\"compelling and sympathetic\\". Hyacinthe Miller calls Zhong a \\"complex, thoughtful character\\". By contrast, Donna Lypchuk calls Zhong an \\"unlikable curmudgeon\\" and a \\"self-absorbed cold fish\\". As the character's backstory is established, it is revealed that Zhong Fong grew up in \\"the slums of Shanghai.\\" In a related novel not published as part of the series (see below), Rotenberg offered readers a glimpse of Zhong's childhood, in which the four- year-old Zhong lives amid death and destruction shortly after the Chinese Communist Revolution. Zhong was married to Fu Tsong, an actress who performed in a Shanghai theatre, where they lived in an apartment in the building. Throughout the series, Zhong often relies on what he learned from observing her rehearsals, including those for a production of Twelfth Night in which she played Olivia, and had an affair with her director, Geoffrey Hyland. Despite her infidelity, Zhong is haunted by the \\"singularly brutal\\" untimely death of his wife and their unborn child. Between the second and third novels, he marries his long time colleague Lily, who bears him a daughter, Xiao Ming. The protagonist is named obliquely after Rotenberg's translator from his own time in Shanghai, Zhang Feng, whom he calls \\"the original Zhong Fong\\" in the acknowledgements to The Shanghai Murders. People in the theatre =Fu Tsong= An actress who performed in the Grand Theatre who was married to Zhong Fong until her death four years prior to the start of the series. She figures prominently in Zhong Fong's memory throughout the series. She had an affair with her director Geoffrey Hyland. =Geoffrey Hyland= A Canadian theatre director who had an affair with Zhong's late wife Fu Tsong. He is murdered in his second appearance in the series, but referenced occasionally later, as Zhong recalls what he learned watching his rehearsals with Fu Tsong. Richard Adler remarks that Geoffrey Hyland bears \\"more than a few similarities\\" to Rotenberg himself. Michael Handelzalts goes so far as to call him the author's alter ego. Rotenberg freely admits to having \\"integrated\\" knowledge of acting teaching into his novels through the character. On killing the character off, Rotenberg said: \\"it was more fun than I thought it would be (although the actual Geoffrey Hyland, a former student of mine who is a famous director in South Africa, was disappointed).\\" =Charles Roeg= Another Canadian theatre director who appears in the fifth novel of the series. He was Geoffrey Hyland's teacher, despite being younger than Hyland. He is also able to tell whether someone is lying and uses this talent to make money. Publication history Shanghai Theatre Academy Background In 1994, David Rotenberg was invited to direct the first Canadian play to be staged in the People's Republic of China. Rotenberg mounted a production of The Ecstasy of Rita Joe in Mandarin at the Shanghai Theatre Academy at a time when China was going through a \\"massive transition from a profoundly oppressive socialist state to a basically free market economy ‚Äì a thrilling time\\". Rotenberg had six weeks until rehearsals began, and used this time to explore the city with his translator: \\"Instead of visiting all the usual tourist sites, he went into all the small, dark alleys and chalked up impressions.\\" Rotenberg recalled: \\"Here was a city that was actively involved in moving from being ignored by the great powers in Beijing to becoming the centre of Asian capitalism... You could feel it all around you. Some of my actors would leave rehearsals because they were setting up kiosks to sell produce on the street.\\" The experience led to him beginning what became his second career, writing novels. Writing process and series publication As the Zhong Fong novels are police procedurals, Rotenberg purposefully had his writing space cluttered with images and books when he wrote it: \\"two large modern desks at right angles to each other ‚Äî the whole thing dominated by a large computer monitor. It felt that the job was to produce order from the chaos ‚Äî just as police officers must.\\" Zhong Fong first appeared in The Shanghai Murders, published in 1998 by the recently founded McArthur & Company. The next novels in the series were also published by McArthur & Co., in 2001, 2003, 2004, and 2005. Map of Shanghai, 1884 Relationship to Shanghai Just before The Golden Mountain Murders was published in 2005, Rotenberg received a lunch invitation from Penguin Canada publisher David Davidar and assumed that they would be discussing a sixth Zhong Fong novel, but Davidar had other ideas. \\"He wanted to know if I could do for Shanghai what James Clavell did for Hong Kong. It gave me pause because I love Clavell's writing.\\" Davidar said he had \\"long admired\\" how well the novels were written, and how they convey a \\"sense of place\\". Shanghai: The Ivory Compact (2008) is an epic novel spanning centuries. Sarah Weinman describes the scope and inspiration for the work: > Shanghai is jam-packed with story and adventure, tracing a line from a > narwhal tusk carved with possible prophecies in 207 BCE to how the city of > Shanghai transformed itself in the mid-1800s in light of the Opium Wars and > the arrival of Western immigrants looking for great fortunes. The kernel for > this mammoth timeline was Rotenberg's chance discovery of a children's book > that mentioned Silas Hordoon, an Iraqi Jew who arrived in Shanghai and soon > scandalized the city, first by marrying his Chinese mistress, and then when > they adopted almost 40 area orphans. Though Shanghai is not part of the Zhong Fong series, the character nevertheless makes a cameo appearance towards the end of the novel as a four- year-old. In 2008, Rotenberg talked about the possibility of a sixth Zhong Fong novel and a sequel to Shanghai set in post-Second World War Shanghai, contingent on a return visit to the city for more research. However, when Rotenberg was approached by Simon & Schuster \\"to write something other than about China\\", after what amounted to \\"eight novels about and around China\\" (Rotenberg counting Shanghai as three novels), he was \\"ready for a change\\", prompting the writing of the Toronto-set Junction Chronicles series. Jurgen Gothe reported in November 2009 that while part of a sixth novel \\"was in the works\\", Rotenberg had \\"moved on\\", and he concluded that there would be no more in the series. Reception Commercial performance and critical response The mystery series has been both a critical and commercial success. Zhong himself has \\"legions of fans around the world\\" according to Stephen Patrick Clare. It is a \\"personal favourite\\" of fellow crime fiction author Michael J. McCann, and as stated above, David Davidar is an admirer of the series. Less impressed is Donna Lypchuk, who condemned The Hua Shan Hospital Murders in her review for its attitude towards and depiction of \\"East Asian women\\" and Chinese people in general, asserting that it read \\"like a speedily written treatment for a movie\\" and that it was \\"riddled with stereotypes and clich√©s that make fun of Chinese people's mannerisms and the way they speak.\\" Accolade The Hua Shan Hospital Murders was shortlisted for the Arthur Ellis Award for the best crime novel of 2003. Adaptations In 2008, Rotenberg was working with the CBC on an adaptation of the series for television, suggesting this would have to be a co-production with either Taiwan or Hong Kong. More recently, the novels have been said to be under consideration by HBO.

Originally the regiment, like all Italian tank units, was part of the infantry, but on 1 June 1999 it became part of the cavalry. Operationally the regiment was last assigned to the Mechanized Brigade \\"Granatieri di Sardegna\\".  History   Formation  The regiment was formed on 6 November 1939 in Parma as 33rd Tank Infantry Regiment with four tank battalions, which were ceded by two tank infantry regiments: from the 3rd Tank Infantry Regiment arrived the VI Assault Tanks Battalion \\"Lollini\\" and XXXII Assault Tanks Battalion \\"Battisti\\", and from 1st Tank Infantry Regiment arrived the XXII Assault Tanks Battalion \\"Coralli\\" and the XXIII Assault Tanks Battalion \\"Stennio. On the same day the 33rd regiment, together with the 12th Bersaglieri Regiment and the 133rd Armored Artillery Regiment, entered the newly raised 133rd Armored Division \\"Littorio\\". In April 1940 battalions were renamed and the regiment entered World War II with the following structure: * 33rd Tank Infantry Regiment, in Parma ** I Tank Battalion \\"L\\" (L3/35 tankettes, former VI Assault Tanks Battalion \\"Lollini\\") ** II Tank Battalion \\"L\\" (L3/35 tankettes, former XXII Assault Tanks Battalion \\"Coralli\\") ** III Tank Battalion \\"L\\" (L3/35 tankettes, former XXIII Assault Tanks Battalion \\"Stennio\\") ** IV Tank Battalion \\"L\\" (L3/35 tankettes, former XXXII Assault Tanks Battalion \\"Battisti\\")  World War II  The regiment participated in June 1940 in the Italian invasion of France. The first Italian tankers of World War II were killed in action near the Little St Bernard Pass between France and Italy. In fall 1940 the I Tank Battalion \\"L\\" was sent to North Africa to reinforce Italian units in the Western Desert Campaign. To replace it the regiment raised on 22 December 1940 the VI Tank Battalion \\"M13/40\\", which was sent immediately to Africa to shore up the crumbling Italian 10th Army, which was retreating under pressure of the British Operation Compass offensive. The VI battalion arrived in Libya in early January 1941 and already by 6 February the battalion had been destroyed in the Battle of Beda Fomm and was declared dissolved. In April 1941 the regiment participated in the Invasion of Yugoslavia. On 30 July 1941 the III Tank Battalion \\"L\\" was disbanded and its two companies transferred to the regiment's I and II battalion. In August 1941 the regiment formed XIV Tank Battalion \\"M14/41\\". In October both \\"L\\" battalions left the regiment and moved to Sardinia to garrison the island. On 27 November 1941 the regiment was replaced in the 133rd Armored Division \\"Littorio\\" by the newly raised 133rd Tank Infantry Regiment. The regiment was now under the Military Zone Command \\"Piacenza\\" and consisted of the XIV Tank Battalion \\"M14/41\\", a training battalion, and two replacement battalions with troops but no equipment. On 1 February 1942 the regiment was reorganized and meant to receive three additional \\"M\\" battalions, but only the XVIII arrived from the 3rd Tank Infantry Regiment, while the XVII, raised by the 4th Tank Infantry Regiment, was transferred to the 31st Tank Infantry Regiment, which also retained command of the XIX battalion. At the time all three battalions fielded one M14/41 tank company and one Semovente 75/18 tank destroyer company. Beginning on 24 April 1942 the regiment began to rise battalions equipped with Semovente 47/32 tank destroyers: * IV Semoventi Battalion \\"47/32\\", raised on 24 April 1942, assigned to the 4th Infantry Division \\"Livorno\\", destroyed during the Allied invasion of Sicily in July 1943 * CXXXIII Semoventi Battalion \\"47/32\\", raised on 1 May 1942, assigned to the 6th Army, destroyed during the Allied invasion of Sicily in July 1943 * CCXXXIII Semoventi Battalion \\"47/32\\", raised on 1 October 1942, assigned to the 6th Army, destroyed during the Allied invasion of Sicily in July 1943 In August 1942 the XIV Tank Battalion \\"M14/41\\" was transferred to the 31st Tank Infantry Regiment, which departed for North Africa. At the same time the regiment received new M15/42 tanks for its XVIII Tank Battalion \\"M15/42\\", which the regiment transferred on 27 June 1943 to the 32nd Tank Infantry Regiment on Sardinia. After Italy switched sides with the Armistice of Cassibile on 8 September 1943 the Germans occupied Italy and disbanded the 33rd Tank Infantry Regiment soon after.  Cold War  On 1 September 1964 the Italian Army raised the VI Tank Battalion equipped M47 Patton tanks in Civitavecchia as the tank unit of the 1st Armored Bersaglieri Regiment. = 6th Tank Battalion \\"M.O. Scapuzzi\\" = During the 1975 army reform the 1st Armored Bersaglieri Regiment was disbanded and on 1 October 1975 the VI Tank Battalion became the 6th Tank Battalion \\"M.O. Scapuzzi\\", which received the war flag and traditions of the 33rd Tank Infantry Regiment. The battalion's number commemorated the VI Tank Battalion \\"M\\", which the 33rd regiment had raised and which had been destroyed during the British Operation Compass offensive. Tank and armored battalions created during the 1975 army reform were all named for officers, soldiers and partisans, who were posthumously awarded Italy's highest military honor the Gold Medal of Military Valour during World War II. The 6th Tank Battalion's name commemorated CCXXXIII Semoventi Battalion \\"47/32\\" Second lieutenant Luigi Scapuzzi, who was killed in action during the Allied invasion of Sicily in July 1943 . Based in Civitavecchia and equipped with M47 Patton tanks the battalion joined the Mechanized Brigade \\"Granatieri di Sardegna\\".  Recent times  With the end of the Cold War the Italian Army drew down its forces and the army began to reform single-battalion regiments for traditional reasons. On 1 September 1993 the 6th Tank Battalion \\"M.O. Scapuzzi\\" ceded the flag of the 33rd regiment to the 11th Tank Battalion \\"M.O. Calzecchi\\" in Ozzano dell'Emilia, which in turn ceded the flag of the 4th Tank Regiment to the 6th Tank Battalion, which on the same date reformed as 4th Tank Regiment. The 33rd regiment was now the tank unit of the Mechanized Brigade \\"Friuli\\". However as the Friuli was earmarked to become Italy's only Air Assault brigade the 33rd Tank Regiment transferred to the 132nd Armored Brigade \\"Ariete\\" in 1997. In 2001 the 33rd Tank Regiment was disbanded and its flag transferred to the Shrine of the Flags in the Vittoriano in Rome.

Until the district reform, which came into force on 1 July 1972, the municipality of Mittbach belonged to the district of Wasserburg am Inn. Since then it has belonged to the district of Erding until its dissolution in 1978. History The town was first mentioned as Mitapah in a document from Freising dated 9 December 870. A local nobleman (Otto de Mitepahc) appears around 1150 as a witness with a donation of the noble Wito of Zell to the Ebersberg monastery. Since the foundation of the Freising Burgrain dominion, Mittbach was a southwestern part of it. After its dissolution as a result of secularisation, the community of Mittbach was formed from the south-western quarter of the dominion in 1808 and came to the Wasserburg district office in 1818. In 1939, the municipality of Mittbach in the former administrative district of Wasserburg am Inn was separated from the municipality of Mittbach (south-)west (below) the forest slope of the Mittbacher Au with the lower situated local fields of Au, Berg, Kronacker, Oberkaging and Niederkaging, and was assigned to the municipality of Hohenlinden in the administrative district of Ebersberg. On 1 May 1978, Mittbach was assigned to Markt Isen as part of the municipal reform. Parish history Until 1450 the church of Mittbach belonged to the parish of Burgrain, then the parish was moved to Mittbach. Until the parish was dissolved in 1828, the branches Burgrain, Kronacker, Hohenlinden, Pyramoos and Wetting belonged to the parish. Then the parish seat was moved to Hohenlinden and Mittbach was integrated into the parish of Pemmering. Geography and location description Filial church St. Urban Mittbach (624 m) lies high above Hohenlinden (540 m) and the upper Isen valley (555 m), on the edge of the Mittbacher Au forest, a foothills of the extensive Gro√ühaag forest. Between Mittbach and the northern neighbouring village of Pemmering there is a free space of only 15 to 20 metres. Today Mittbach is a newer type of a Haufendorf (with a small old village centre), in the centre of which stands the village church. In the course of the first Bavarian survey, the village was chosen as the main triangle point due to its elevated location and surveyed in 1803.Adrian v. Riedl: Hauptdreiecksnetz zum topografischen Atlas des K√∂nigreichs Bayern, 1831, Bayerische Staatsbibliothek, Mapp. XI, 57ge, M√ºnchen Filial church St. Urban The original church was a Gothic building, which was probably built between 1475 and 1520, as the tower position reveals. This originally Gothic building (from which remains of the foundation were used) was strongly changed from 1709, in the style of the late Baroque. The interior of the church has a barrel vault with a cap, the frames and crossbands are stuccoed, as well as the ceiling fresco framing in the choir. The late baroque high altar and the left side altar date from around 1710, the right rococo side altar was built in 1765. Former municipal area The municipality of 11.66 km¬≤ with 684 inhabitants (state of the 1961 census) included the villages of Pemmering, Burgrain and Mittbach, the hamlets of Aich, Fahrnbach, Fleck, Giesering, Hub, Kemating and Reit, as well as the deserted villages of Daxau and Kuglm√ºhle.Bayerisches Statistisches Landesamt (Hrsg.): Amtliches Ortsverzeichnis f√ºr Bayern, Gebietsstand am 1.

The term was coined by Mark Simpson in 2014 to describe a man \\"who is influenced in his appearance by the stars of sport and pornography\\". It recognises young men who use \\"their toned bodies on social media as a means of feeling valuable in society.\\" Jamie Hakim has described this as a \\"power-shift of a segment of society who have historically defined themselves through their mind, whilst at the same time defining those they have subordinated - such as women - through their bodies\\". Simpson also coined the term metrosexual in 1994. Details The term originated in an article by cultural commentator Mark Simpson in 2014; Simpson's metrosexual is a portmanteau of metropolitan and heterosexual. He describes spornosexuals as frequently working class men who exercise at a gym in order to share eroticised selfies of their toned bodies on social media. Simpson considers spornosexuality as the second, more extreme, generation of metrosexuality, since the \\"uptake by men of products, practises and pleasures previously ring-fenced for women and gay men\\" has become normalised. Instead, Simpson claims, spornosexual men want to be recognised for their bodies rather than their clothes. Examples of such men include Dan Osborne, Thom Evans, David McIntosh and Cristiano Ronaldo. Jamie Hakim's research, \\"The Spornosexual: the affective contradictions of male body-work in neoliberal digital culture\\", was published in the Journal of Gender Studies in 2016. Hakim writes that young men defining their value through their body is a response to the effects of austerity on them since 2008, when the ability to create value through other means became harder. \\"This is all the more surprising because this use of body-image to derive social value has long been associated with groups men tended to be viewed as inferior.\\" HuffPost said this research \\"went as far as blaming the financial crisis for the rise of the 'Spornosexual'\\". Greg Wolfman has written about a proliferation of men's \\"consumer lifestyles\\", or \\"marketed manhoods\\", that includes spornosexual with lumbersexual and hipster.

Mythily Ramachandran gave it 2.5 out of 5 and said, \\"This is a film that you can enjoy with the family, popcorn and coke in hand. Meipporul certainly breaks away from the stereotypes and is a laudable effort by first-timers.

Synopsis Dillon, a small time gunman, seeks to make a big break, and he stumbles across other gangsters and their girls, with whom initially he strikes a chord but soon falls out. The book traces the ruthless and selfish journey of Dillon from nomadic gunman to rich Gangster in Kansas, and the consequences he faces on the way, with a never ending pursuit of crime after crime and adversaries to follow him. The moral of the book is \\"Crime never pays\\". Plot Ruthless gunman Dillon arrives in Plattsville town after being long off his activities, post his boss Nelson's demise. He is employed by good Samaritan store owner Abe Goldberg and comes in contact with Butch Hogan, a retired and blind ex boxer involved in setting up boxing matches in the town. Myra Hogan, Butch's glamorous young daughter is reckless and in love with Nick Gurney, one of Butch's henchmen. At one point, Butch catches her with Gurney and Myra is forced to attack her father. Butch has betted money on weaker boxer Sankey against a more efficient boxer Franks, and wants to fix the match for Sankey to win. Dillon does not want Abe's honest work and agrees to fix the match for Sankey by threatening Frank. But the undaunted Frank simply refuses to lose at the last moment and knocks down Sankey. With money on Sankey now lost, an enraged Butch with Sankey's manager and trainer confront Dillon at Butch's house, where Dillon simply shoots Butch dead. He then extorts money from Abe, and forces Gurney and Myra to accompany him, and left with no choice, they oblige. The trio set off to the unknown, with Dillon seeking money and trying to enter gangster circles. They stumble at an abandoned cabin, where Dillon forces Myra to cook and Gurney to work for him. He soon gets a car and Thompson gun and the trio succeed in robbing a bank. When Dillon does not give them a fair share in the money, Gurney and Myra get tired and decide to kill him. But Dillon escapes, and Gurney gets killed accidentally by Myra, and now totally left at his Mercy, she has no choice but to remain with Dillon. Dillon and Myra move to Kansas and find accommodation at a shady lodge. They meet Roxy, a small time offender trying to make it big with his compatriot offender Fanquist. Soon Dillon gets in touch with Hurst, the big time Don ruling half the city. When he and Myra save Hurst's life from adversary gangster Little Ernie's attempts to kill him, Dillon is given a job with Hurst. Months later Dillon is a rich gangster in Kansas under the aegis of Hurst, with a mob working under him, involved in extortion rackets in the city, with Myra now his mistress. Roxy approaches Dillon and is given a job. Dillon decides to further his gang and control, by taking over both Hurst and Ernie's empire as well. Soon Myra realizes that Dillon is keeping an affair with Fanquist. Enraged, she goes to warn Fanquist and kills her accidentally. Hurst is not pleased with Dillon's activities and confronts Dillon and Roxy, when Dillon shoots Hurst without a second thought. With Hurst's dead, Dillon loses the police protection he enjoyed. And Hurst's men now contemplate with Ernie and the cops to encounter him that very night. Dillon escapes with Myra and Roxy, killing more goons en route. They locate Ernie in his high-rise apartment, where Dillon and Roxy sneak in and throw him to his death below. Now the trio are again on the run. They meet Roxy's acquaintance Joe, who agrees to shelter them at his parents' isolated farmhouse for money. On route, they are attacked by a speeding biker cop, whom Dillon kills, but Myra is fatally shot. Dillon then kills Myra, buries her and proceeds with Roxy to the farmhouse. Hiding at the farmhouse, Dillon and Roxy now start to lose their nerve with fear and uncertainty. Joe's mentally retarded sister Chrissie at the farm takes a liking for Roxy though Roxy decides not to touch her and warns Dillon too, but Dillon had lustful eyes for Chrissie. Joe cons the duo into paying him more money for continued protection, saying that there's now a bounty on their heads back in the city. Dillon and Roxy find this untrue and go and kill Joe lest he turn them over, unbeknownst to his relatives back at the farmhouse. Later Dillon tries to molest Chrissie at the farmhouse but she escapes. A disgusted Roxy attacks Dillon for this but is killed. Dillon buries him away from the farmhouse but Chrissie sees this. Desperate and drunk, with almost everyone he knew now dead, crazy Dillon starts hallucinating visions of Chrissie. He enters her room at night, but is in for a shock when he sees Roxy's unearthed body placed on Chrissie's bed. Hiding in a corner with Roxy's gun in hand, Chrissie shoots Dillon.

However, some theologians and scholars of religious scripture insist on the difference between the soul and the spirit and their order of existence. This difference in philosophical discussions is of little concern because of its specific applications, but in Quranic culture the distinction is debatable. There are many reasons that have made this topic less controversial but the most important ones are the lack of scientific evidences, and the dispersion of ideas. Man has several spirits The discussions on the epistemology of soul have given rise to many fields of study from ethics, psychology, education, and philosophy to commentary of Qur'anic verses and relevant hadiths among which philosophical speculations have a special place. One critical question or a common subject raised by most philosophers is whether the soul is united or divided. Plato was the first to express an idea about multiplicity of souls arguing that \\"the reason for internal conflict in individuals is the existence of numerous souls within them.\\" The majority of Muslim philosophers, including Mulla Sadra (1571‚Äì1640), never believed that the soul is divided as it is distinct from the spirit. Sadra's ontological views about the creation of soul were sharply in contrast with the assumptions of Greek philosophers who considered the spirit as a primordial-immaterial and heavenly existent. In Sadraic philosophy the soul is defined bodily in its origination such that it is created along with the creation of the body. Sadra denied the existence of the soul before the body and tried to hold this view in spite of the counter-evidences from the Hadith. he also rejected Plato's theory of numerous souls on the basis that \\"the soul is the seat of all human faculties though it is simple in composition.\\" In talking about how the soul reaches a climax of perfection through a staged- process Sadra argues that \\"when the soul first enters the fetus it is at the developmental stage of a vegetative soul.\\" This vegetative soul next develops into an animal soul and has the potential to further develop into a rational soul and even, in some noble individuals, to the level of a \\"universal-divine\\" soul. The latter stage represents the highest level of human perfection; a transcendental stage in which, as concluded by philosophers, \\"the active intellect is joined\\" and, as observed by the mystics, \\"absorption in divine essence occurs.\\" The distinctness of the spirit In his more recent studies the psychologist Ahmad Zumurrudian has recognized that there is a distinction between the soul and the spirit, although more philosophical justifications still should be made to support the theory. Using the soul and the spirit synonymously is seen in almost all Qur'anic commentaries. Also, in commentaries based on the Hadith and tradition, using the two terms interchangeably is very common. In Islamic traditions, a distinction between soul, spirit and body is emphasized by addressing the actions of each part separately. According to a hadith from Imam Sadiq: > God created two connected worlds, the world of upper and lower, then > combined the two worlds into the son of Adam...Adam testified that there is > no god but God and created him with the soul and body and the spirit. The > spirit that does not leave him unless he leaves this world and the soul that > he can see dreams and stations by it and body which will be corroded and > returns to soil after death. The view for separation of soul from spirit and body is more strengthened by another hadith narrated by Muhammad Baqir Majlisi from al-Durr al-Manthur on the creation of Adam: > God created Adam as He wills...He created his flesh and blood, his bones, > hair, and his body from soil and water; this is the beginning of the > creation of Adam. Then He put the soul into his body. Then by the soul man > can stand and sit, listen and see, learn and know what animals can know and > beware of dangers. Then God put the spirit into the body. By the spirit Adam > knows right from wrong and guidance from error and he camouflages and learns > and manages all of his affairs. In Shi'a literature there are also a number of hadiths which exemplify prophets and imams as the most perfect models of creation, purporting that they have five independent spirits to guide them to the straight path. The believers with four spirits are the second in position and disbelievers and animals are last in the chain with three spirits. Two of these spirits are the holy spirit and the spirit of faith. However, the former belongs only to the prophets who used it to judge when they lacked information for normal judgement, while the latter was breathed into all human beings.

This species can attain a length of and a weight of > Distribution The banded rudderfish is a species of the western Atlantic Ocean where it is found from Nova Scotia to Santos, S√£o Paulo. Its presence in Cuba has yet to be confirmed. Habitat and biology The banded rudderfish is a benthopelagic fish which is found at depths of . It is found over hard substrates in both inshore and offshore waters but it normally inhabits shallower water than its congeners. The juveniles are found in association with floating mats of weed or debris, and have been known to follow sharks and other large fishes. The juveniles have also been recorded in association with jellyfish. The adults feed on fish and crustacea. Spawning takes place throughout the year in offshore waters. Species description Seriola zonata was formally described in 1815 as Scomber zonatus by the American physician, naturalist and politician Samuel L. Mitchill (1764‚Äì1831) with the type locality stated as New York Bay, New York.

Structural geology and sequence of events The rocks deformed during the Thomson Orogeny, referred to as the Thomson Orogen, underlie most of western and central Queensland in Australia. The rocks are mostly rich in quartz and metasedimentary, overlain by younger Mesozoic rocks and the Devonian backarc basin sediments of the Adavale Basin. Detrital zircon dating of Thomson Orogen rocks indicates ages between 510 and 495 million years ago, spanning the Cambrian to the Devonian. In the northern part of the Thomson Orogen, rifting in the late Neoproterozoic is recorded in the lower metamorphic rocks of the Anakie Province. a In the south, the Thomson Orogen borders the Lachlan Orogen, separated by the Olepoloko Fault in the west and the Louth-Eumarra Shear Zone in the east. Unlike the Thomson Orogen, the Lachlan Orogen has significant Silurian sedimentary rocks. The Thomson Orogen extends east under the Bowen Basin and based on seismic reflection data, seems to the underlie the western edge of the New England Orogen.

The mound is oval in plan, measuring 60m by 50m at its base and rises to 10m in height. It is located 400m south of the late neolithic palisaded enclosure at Dunragit. It has been suggested that the mound may have been used as a viewing platform for activities at Dunragit complex of monuments. The most well known parallel the site has is Silbury Hill in Wiltshire, but is closer in size to the less well known sites at Conquer Barrow, Willy Howe and Wold Newton. The mound was originally built with stepped sides on top of a sand dune. Excavation between 1999-2002 revealed a round cairn at the top of the mound, similar to the nearby Mid Gleniron A. The mound was assumed to be a medieval mote for a castle, but is different in structure and location to the motes in the surrounding area. In 2002, excavation and optically stimulated luminescence dating showed that the site was prehistoric, and probably placed within a date bracket associated with the Dunragit complex of monuments to the north. The site is still classified as a \\"motte (medieval)\\" on Canmore, the online database of ancient and historical monuments in Scotland. The complex of Neolithic monuments at Dunragit was identified in 1992 by Marilyn Brown of the Royal Commission on the Ancient and Historical Monuments of Scotland from aerial photographs. When these cropmarks were examined within the wider landscape, it was found that the Droughdool Mote was aligned on the entrance to the middle of three concentric rings at the Dunragit site. While this alignment may be coincidental, other Neolithic flat topped mounds, such as Silbury Hill, Hatfield Barrow and Knowlton in Dorset, are also associated with nearby large enclosures. A feature of these other sites, missing from Droughdool, is a ditch surrounding the mounds which was often filled with water. However, during the Neolithic, the sea level was considerably higher than it is today and at high tide, an area between the mound and the Dunragit enclosure (the Whitecrook Basin) would have been inundated by sea. Thomas proposes that this may have obviated the need for a ditch at this site. Sites linked by water are well known from the Neolithic. The most famous of these is the connection between Durrington Walls and Stonehenge linked by the River Avon. Thomas speculates that: > \\"In the case of Dunragit and Droughduil, passing out of the enclosure along > the entrance passage, and walking down into the Whitecrook Basin and then > through the water before climbing the mound might have been understood as a > journey of transition or transformation.\\" The site is a scheduled monument. It was excavated between 1999 and 2002 by Julian Thomas.

He is best known for his play Rumon: Sacrae Romae Origines, first performed in 1923. Early life Roggero Musmeci Ferrari Bravo was born in Palermo on Sicily on 2 March 1868. His father died when he was young, after which his mother moved with him to Rome. He gained a medical degree in surgery and a second degree in jurisprudence. He soon chose to not pursue a career related to his degrees, but to devote his time to becoming a writer. Literary career His literary output can be understood in the context of the anti-clerical tendencies during the Risorgimento and the fall of the Papal States. During this period, a part of the Italian intelligentsia entertained the idea of returning to paganism as a viable way forward. Musmeci adopted the pen name ignis, which is Latin for \\"fire\\", because he regarded himself as a creative spark that would help to revive the Roman mores and religion. He spelled the name with a lower case I to signify that he only was one of many such sparks. He participated in the intellectual milieu of the Caff√© d'Aragno, which included people such as Filippo Tommaso Marinetti, Giuseppe Ungaretti and Ardengo Soffici. Musmeci's poetry collection Carme a Roma, published in 1914, contains the theme of a Roman pagan renaissance as well as hostility toward the Catholic Church. Also in 1914, his play Quando le colonne rovinano premiered in Rome and Trieste. His most significant work is Rumon: Sacrae Romae Origines, a tragic play in five acts. It tells the mythological story of the founding of Rome, from the origin of Romulus and Remus, to Romulus' ascencion to the heavens. On 21 April 1914, Musmeci recited the play in his home to a small audience of invited bohemians and literary critics. It received positive newspaper reviews and there were discussions about staging the play outdoors on the Palatine Hill, but Italy's entry in World War I ended those plans. When the National Fascist Party came to power, Musmeci saw a new opportunity to get Rumon produced, thanks to the influence his friends Soffici and Giacomo Boni had on Benito Mussolini. After some compromises, the third act of Rumon was performed on the Palatine Hill on 6 May 1923, starring prominent actors of the day. The reception was positive and several critics compared the performance to a rite. The play was published in print in 1929, the same year as Mussolini signed the Lateran Treaty, which ended the hopes of those who like Musmeci had wished to see a pagan re-emergence under fascism. Later life Musmeci left the literary scene and became increasingly embittered with fascism. He devoted his time to study sculpture and divine proportions. In 1931 he published the book Appunti su la scoperta della \\"divina proporzione\\", which summarises his studies of Pythagorean numerology. He died in poverty in 1937.

It is native to the Finke bioregion (in the south of the Northern Territory and the north of South Australia).  Description  A. latzii is a shrub or tree which grows to a height of 3 to7 m. The branchlets may be smooth or have a sparse covering of minute flat lying hairs. The phyllodes (5‚Äì10 cm long by 2‚Äì4 mm wide) are narrowly linear and generally with a shallow incurving. They are leathery and a khaki to greyish green and like the branchlets may be smooth or have a sparse covering of fine hairs. They have many closely parallel veins. The inflorescences are two to five headed racemes with the raceme axes being 1.5‚Äì5 mm long. The flower stalks are 5‚Äì9 mm long and have a covering of fine hairs. The heads are globular (4 mm in diameter) with 13 to 18 flowers. The flowers are 5-merous and the sepals are free. The smooth, leathery pods are up to 15 cm long. The dull, brown-black, oblong seeds are 5.5 mm in length. It flowers from April to August and fruits from February to November.  Habitat  It is found growing in skeletal alkaline soil in gullies and on minor hill slopes. Conservation status It has been declared \\"vulnerable\\" under both Commonwealth and Northern Territory legislation. It is threatened by *increased fire exposure associated with Buffel Grass invasion; *seedling loss from browsing and trampling by cattle and feral herbivores; *vulnerable to decline due its small population and its fragmented distribution; *altered rainfall patterns (due to climate change) which may affect adult survivorship and decrease the rare recruitment events.

Early career  Dubrovinsky was born in the village of Pokrovskoye-Lipovets, in the Maloangelsk district of Orel, the second of four sons of a mechanic, who died in 1882, soon after the birth of the fourth son. His widowed mother, Lyubov, moved with all four boys to Kursk, then returned in 1895 to Orel. As a schoolboy in Kursk, Dubrovinsky joined a populist circle modelled on Narodnaya Volya, the group that assassinated the Tsar Alexander II, but later became a Marxist. From about the age of 18, he was a full-time revolutionary. He was arrested in December 1897, as an organiser of a workers' circle in Moscow, and the following year was sentenced to four years exile in Siberia. While there, he contracted tuberculosis. In 1902 he was moved to Astrakhan, where he made contact with the illegal newspaper Iskra, of which Lenin was the main organiser, and acted as its local distributor. He joined the Bolsheviks after the party split in 1903.  Role in the 1905 revolution  Arrested in February 1905, Dubrovinsky was released under amnesty in October. The Bolsheviks sent him to the naval base in Kronstadt, where, on 23 October, he addressed a crowd of thousands, who agreed resolution calling for better conditions for servicemen, and political demands for the overthrow of the monarchy and the creation of a democratic republic. The following day, thousands demonstrated, and for a couple of days Kronstadt was under rebel control, but martial law was imposed and thousands arrested, though Dubrovinsky slipped past the police by pretending to be blind drunk. He moved to Moscow, where he took part in the armed rising in December. He was arrested again in the summer of 1906.  Later career  Dubrovinsky was released in February 1907, and joined Lenin in Finland, which was under Russian rule. He was a delegate to the Fifth Congress of the Russian Social Democratic Labour Party in London, in May 1907 - the last major gathering before the revolution at which both Bolsheviks and Mensheviks were present, and afterwards was elected to the 15 member Bolshevik Centre. He was almost the only member of that Centre to back Lenin over the issue of armed robberies carried in Georgia by revolutionaries secretly directed by 'Koba' (later known as Stalin) to raise funds for the party, but he opposed Lenin over the question of whether to have a final break with the Mensheviks. After the Congress, he returned to Russia to try to rebuild the party organisation, shattered by the defeat of the 1905 revolution. In February 1908 he joined Lenin in Geneva, where he was part of a triumvirate, which also included Alexander Bogdanov, running the Bolshevik publication, Vperyod (Forward). When this group split up, he supported Lenin against Bogdanov. He returned to Russian jurisdiction, hoping to unite the various illegal Marxist groups, but was arrested in Warsaw in November 1908, and was deported to Solvychegodsk, in north Russia, in iron fetters that left deep wounds in his legs. He escaped and joined Lenin in Paris in 1910.  Death  Dubrovinsky returned to Russia, where he was arrested for the final time in June 1910, and exiled to Turukhansk in Siberia. Returning to Russia again, in 1910, he was soon arrested and exiled. on ! June, he drowned in the Yenisei River - ironically around the time when he stood a chance of being released under an amnesty to mark the Romanov Tercentenary. He left behind a library, which was appropriated by Stalin, who was also in exile in Turukhansk - an act which other exiles resented. There are two stories around his death. One is that his tuberculosis was so severe that he committed suicide. Lenin's widow, Nadezhda Krupskaya recorded that he was very ill he arrived in Paris, and needed extensive medical treatment. Another theory is that he went out in a boat and was swept under by the powerful current.  Personality  There is no doubt that if Dubrovinsky had lived a few years longer, he would have played a major role in the early years of Bolshevik rule in Russia. Lenin's widow recorded that the Bolshevik leader \\"saw how completely devoted Innokenty was to the revolutionary cause...(and) how resolute Innokenty was in the struggle ... prized Innokenty greatly for his fervent devotion to the cause...(and) became very attached to Innokenty.\\" In 1924, Stalin said that \\"of all the outstanding organisers I am acquainted with, I know only two, of whom, next to Lenin, our Party can and should be proud: I. F. Dubrovinsky, who died in exile in Turukbansk, and Y. M. Sverdlov, who worked himself to death in building the Party and the state.\\"  References  Category:1877 births Category:1913 deaths Category:Bolsheviks Category:Russian revolutionaries ","title":"Iosif Dubrovinsky"},{"id":"62414060","text":"Georges Leenheere (born 21 November 1919) was a Belgian water polo player.

The commandery was established in Qin dynasty on the former terrotories of Qi. From Qin to early Han dynasty, parts of Langya were separated to form three new commanderies, Jiaodong, Chengyang and Jiaoxi. From 181 BC to 180 BC, Langya briefly served as the fief of Liu Ze (ÂäâÊæ§), who became the king of Yan after the L√º Clan DisturbanceBook of Han, Chapter 35.. Later, the commandery's borders gradually expanded as marquessates split from nearby kingdoms were added to the commandery. In late Western Han, Langya covered 51 counties and marquessates, by far the most numerous among all commanderies.Book of Han, Chapter 28. After the establishment of Eastern Han, Chengyang was merged into Langya.Book of Later Han, Chapter 1. In 41 AD, the territory was converted to a kingdom/principality and granted to Liu Jing (Âäâ‰∫¨), son of the Emperor Guangwu. Jing's descendants held the kingdom until 217 AD, when the last prince of the lineage was killed by Cao Cao and Langya was converted back to a commandery.Book of Later Han, Chapter 42. In 140, Langya administered 13 counties, namely Kaiyang (ÈñãÈôΩ), Dongwu (Êù±Ê≠¶), Langya (ÁêÖÈÇ™), Dongguan (Êù±Ëéû), Xihai (Ë•øÊµ∑), Zhu (Ë´∏), Ju (Ëéí), Dong'an (Êù±ÂÆâ), Yangdu (ÈôΩÈÉΩ), Linyi (Ëá®Ê≤Ç), Jiqiu (Âç≥‰∏ò), Zeng (Áπí), and Gumu (ÂßëÂπï). The population was 570,967.Book of Later Han, Chapter 111. In 198, four counties (Ju, Gumu, Zhu, Dongwu) were transferred to the reestablished Chengyang Commandery. In 280, another commandery, Dongguan was separated from Langya. After the establishment of Western Jin, Langya became the fief of Sima Zhou, the fourth son of Sima Yi. After the death of Zhou, Langya passed to his son Jin (Ë¶≤), and then to Jin's son Rui, the future Emperor Yuan of Jin.Book of Jin, Chapter 38. In 280, Langya had a population of 29,500 households.Book of Jin, Chapter 15. Multiple new commanderies were established over the Sixteen Kingdoms and Northern Dynasties periods. In Northern Wei, Langya Commandery only administered 2 counties: Jiqiu and Fei (Ë≤ª).Book of Wei, Chapter 106. It was eventually abolished in early Sui dynasty. In Sui and Tang dynasties, Langya Commandery became the alternative name of Yi Prefecture. In 742, the commandery's territory covered 5 counties: Linyi, Fei, Cheng (‰∏û), Yishui (Ê≤ÇÊ∞¥) and Xintai (Êñ∞Ê≥∞). The population was 195,737, in 33,510 households.Book of Sui, Chapter 31.New Book of Tang, Chapter 38.

Francois Arago ordered this telescope from the telescope making firm Lebreours in 1839, and after a protracted development was completed by 1855. The name Lunette Arago (Arago refractor) is a modern name for the telescope, and other large refractor of Paris observatory, is the one at Meudon. It has gone by a variety of names having to do with various aspects of the telescope, such as its aperture, or location on the East tower of the Paris observatory, or its equatorial mount made by Brunner. In one journal report it was called the 'east equatorial' for example, in another instance '38 cm refractor'. In French language it has been called the La lunette √©quatoriale de 38 cm de l'Observatoire de Paris. The telescope had an objective lens 14 pouces across, which is a name for Paris Inches; this works out to about 38 cm (14.96 (usually rounded to 15) English inches). The original objective was completed by Lerebours by 1844. The equatorial mounting made by Brunner was delivered in 1859. The clock drive for the equatorial was made by Breguet. The equatorial mounting was not ordered until early 1850s, after the new dome work, completed in 1847, had been finished. The floor of the dome was also designed to move. The telescope was installed in the new east dome built for it, on top of the Paris Observatory building. There was some issue with the lens, and it was re-polished in 1874. In the early 1880s a new objective lens was installed, made by the Henry Brothers. Also the dome and mounting were modified at that time, including replacing an earlier wooden tube with one of iron. The telescope is known to have been used for observing double stars, minor planets (asteroids), and also some photographic astronomy in the late 19th century. When it made its debut in the late 1850s, it was noted for its 38 cm (15 inch) Lerebours objective, Brunner mount, and there was some discussion over its use for astro photography. This telescope is noted for its photometric observations of the Galilean Satellites (Io, Europa, Callisto, and Ganymede) in the 1880s. Corunu and Obrecht would photometrically detect the eclipses of Jupiter by its moons at Paris Observatory. Some of the photometers it was used with included different types, such as polarizing photometers. Some examples of photometers for the telescope in the late 19th and early 20th century include Photometers R, T, W, and H. Photometer R was a roughly half meter long brass tube, 5 cm in diameter with two prisms inside. The prisms were made of quartz. Photometer T on the other hand had a drum 12.5 cm in diameter and over 17 cm long. On June 23, 1878 the East Equatorial of Paris Observatory (the Arago) was first used for photometric detection of an eclipse of Jupiter's moons. The telescope was also used to photometrically study double stars with Photometer H. A Nicol prism was used at the eyepiece for certain instrumentation setups. Over 1800 double stars were observed with the 38 cm of Paris Obs. between 1966 and 1971. The telescope was used for PHEMU85 . PHEMU85 was international astronomical collaboration to view the moons of Jupiter in 1985.Arlot, J. & Thuillot, William. (1988).

It provides MR imaging to the patient in-time and on-site, for example, in Intensive care unit (ICU) where there is danger associated with moving the patient, in an ambulance, after a disaster rescue, or in a field hospital/medical tent.  Superconducting-magnet-based portable MRI The superconducting magnet is one of the main sources to supply a homogeneous main static magnetic field (B0) for MR imaging. Normally it ranges from 1 T to 7 T. To obtain mobility for a conventional MRI scanner that uses a superconducting magnet to supply B0, it is placed in a trailer.. The magnetic field strength of such a mobile MRI scanner is within the range of 1.5 T to 3 T. The weight of the scanner is the same as one sited in a hospital and the price is higher than a traditional one in the hospital, which is due to the mobility added to the scanner. It can be sited by a medical tent by a battlefield.  Electromagnet-based portable MRI The electromagnet is another source to supply homogeneous B0 for MR imaging. It offers mobility to MRI as electromagnet is relatively light and easier to move around compared to a superconducting magnet. Moreover, an electromagnet does not require a complicated cooling system. M. Rosen and his colleagues from Massachusetts General Hospital have developed an electromagnet-based system Mathieu Sarracanie, et al, ‚ÄòLow-Cost High- Performance MRI‚Äô, Nature scientific reports, 5:15177. It is room-sized, and it is for head imaging. Magritek has a table-top system using an electromagnet to supply B0 http://www.magritek.com/products/terranova/. The imaging volume is a cylinder with a diameter of 1-2 cm. The downside of using an electromagnet for MRI us the field strength. It is usually below 10 mT if the field of view (FoV) is relatively large, e.g. a diameter of spherical volume (DSV) of 20 cm for head imaging.  Permanent-magnet-based portable MRI A permanent magnet array (PMA) can supply B0 field for MRI S. Y. Huang, Z. H. REN, S. OBRUCHKOV, J. GONG, R. DYKSTRA, W. YU, \\" Portable Low-cost MRI System based on Permanent Magnets/Magnet Arrays\\", Investigative Magnetic Resonance Imaging(2019), 23 (3):179, http://dx.doi.org/10.13104/imri.2019.23.3.179. It does not require power nor a cooling system, which helps to simplify the hardware of a scanner favoring portability. To supply a homogeneous B0 within an FoV of 40-50 cm for a body scan, a PMA, usually in a C-shape or an H-shape, goes up to a room size and is heavy. The field strength is usually below 0.5 T. Siemens has a product, MAGNETOM C, which has a magnetic field of 0.35 T for a body scan. The scanner is a room-sized, 233√ó206√ó160 cm, and has a weight of 17.6 tons. Its FoV can go up to 40 cm with a homogeneity of less than 100 ppm. When the concept of body dedication is applied to a PMA-based system where the magnet and other apparatus are built around a targeted body-part under imaging (e.g. the angle, the knee, the shoulder, the arm), the size of the scanner can be reduced to half of a room-size O-scan, EsaoteTerada, Yasuhiko, et al. \\"Improved reliability in skeletal age assessment using a pediatric hand MR scanner with a 0.3 T permanent magnet.\\" Magnetic Resonance in Medical Sciences 13.3 (2014): 215-219J. McGinley, et al, ISMRM 2018 0944 for a homogeneous field for a DSV of around 10-15 cm. A C-shaped PMA was reduced to a table-top size to have a homogeneous field within a DSV of 1-2 cm for imaging E. Esparza-Coss and D. Cole, ‚ÄúA Low Cost MR/Permanent Magnet Prototype,‚Äù Second Mexican Symp on Med Physics. American Institute of Physics Conf. Proc., 1998. Using a PMA to supply a homogeneous B0 and relying on linear gradient fields supplied by gradient coils cannot give us a PMA with portability and a relatively large imaging volume simultaneously. Allowing magnetic field that has non-linear gradients to encode the signal for imaging leads to the possibility of having a relatively light PMA (tens to hundreds of kgs) and a relatively large FoV (15-25 DSV) at the same time J.

In July 1921, San Fernando Borough Council called a public meeting at Carnegie Library, the result of which was a unanimous request for elected representation. Similar demands subsequently came from Arima and Port of Spain. Within a few years, the British authorities agreed to a partly elected legislative council, although with voting limited to a restricted franchise. Electoral system The reorganised Legislative Council had 12 official members (civil servants), six nominated members, seven elected members and the Governor, who served as the legislature's speaker. The seven elected members were elected from single-member constituencies. The franchise was limited to people who owned property in their constituency with a rateable value of $60 (or owned property elsewhere with a rateable value of $48) and tenants or lodgers who paid the same sums in rent. The voting age was 21 for men and 30 for women, and all voters were required to understand spoken English. Anyone who had received poor relief within the most recent six months before election day was disqualified from voting.John, p8 Only 6% of the population were eligible to vote. The restrictions on candidates were more severe, with candidature limited to men that lived in their constituency, were literate in English, and owned property worth at least $12,000 or from which they received at least $960 in rent a year. For candidates who had not lived in their constituency for at least a year, the property values were doubled. Results Voter turnout was around 29%, with two constituencies having only one candidate.

He has been sentenced twice, the first time in 1983, to 15 years imprisonment for nine sexual assaults and rapes committed in Marseille. He was partially pardoned for these acts by the then-president, Fran√ßois Mitterrand, in 1987. Five years later, Tangorre was convicted of raping two American students and resentenced to 18 years imprisonment. In 2019, he was sentenced to an additional to three and a half years for sexually assaulting three minors.  First case   Rape in Marseille  On April 1, 1981, a 31-year-old woman named Sylviane was going home at 2 PM in the 8th arrondissement. She closed her car, took a few steps towards her home and then noticed a strange man, who immediately threatened her with a weapon and forced her to go back into the vehicle with him. Under the threat of what turns out to be a fake revolver, Sylviane entered the car and drove around the streets of Marseille with her kidnapper, stopping on a path upon request of the latter. There, the man raped her and then forced her to bring him back to the residence where, it seemed, his moped was.. Sylviane returned home and on the next day, she filed a complaint to the police station in Marseille for rape. She made a facial composite of her rapist (20‚Äì25 years old, wore white sneakers and a dark jacket), learning that she, in fact, had not been the only one to do so: between late 1979 and April 1981, nine other young women had reported being sexually assaulted in the 8th and 9th arrondissements. That same evening, another rape took place in Marseille, then another one just a week later.Jacques Pradel, \\"The case of Luc Tangorre\\", on \\"L'Heure du Crime\\" on RTL, June 4, 2013.  Arrest of Luc Tangorre  On April 12, a patrol of Marseille peacekeepers intercepted a man matching the composite sketch drawn by Sylviane, coupled with the fact that he behaved suspiciously. They called him for an identity check: his name was Luc Tangorre, he was 22 years old, a sports student, had a Citro√´n 2CV, and claimed that he was waiting for a friend to come. The police searched him, and found a wrapped knife on him. He was taken to the police station for interrogation, where he spent the next night and day. Sylviane came down to the police station so she could identify him, she believed to have recognized a man on the photo montage. A dozen days later, she was presented a bunch of suspects while behind a beam splitter, Sylviane said this about Luc Tangorre: \\"The individual fits perfectly, I recognize him so\\". The other assaulted women also come the station, and some of them formally recognized Tangorre, while others either hesitated or weren't sure. Tangorre denied everything, pointing out that he was the only aged 20 to 25, wore white tennis shoes and shorter than 1,70 cm. For him, he was framed by the police. The police searched his home the next day, and found a dummy revolver containing some dried mud, a moped and a khaki raincoat, crowned with suspicious spots. Those spots were examined, which later proved to be petroleum jelly. Authorities then went to the edge monument of the Morgiou parking lot, where the rapist had assaulted victims B√©atrice and Dominique in December 1980 and February 1981, to take samples from the ground to compare with those found on the dummy found at Tangorre's home. Moreover, one of the victims said that the attacker had brandished a revolver before raping her, and others testified that he had a small box of petroleum jelly in his pockets. A few weeks later, the examining experts explained that the first sample taken constituted \\"an element of presumption of great importance\\", while the second differed from the comparison sample. A controversy over the choice of barium arose, as the plastic revolver itself was made of that material, with the samples the rape scene of victim Aline. Moreover, the stains on Luc's jacket turned out to have the \\"characteristics of petroleum jelly\\", and one of the victims had stated that the rapist had used \\"a fatty substance taken from a cosmetic box\\" to rape her, later stating after Tangorre's arrest that \\"it could be petroleum jelly\\". Following identification from some of the assaulted women and the evidence against him, Luc Tangorre was referred before an examining magistrate and locked up. When friends and family learned what had happened to Luc, nobody believed the accusations: everyone described him as a simple, kind and considerate man, who could never do such things. On May 13, 1982, Tangorre started a hunger strike: a support committee was made on the following day. The case became so well-publicized, that even intellectuals began to defend Luc Tangorre, including historian Pierre Vidal-Naquet, writers Marguerite Duras and Fran√ßoise Sagan, and the politicians Robert Badinter, Albin Chalandon, Jean-Claude Gaudin and Dominique Baudis.  First trial  On May 19, 1983, the trial of Luc Tangorre opened before the cour d'assises of Aix-en-Provence. His family and friends firmly believed in his acquittal, with his defense being provided by Anne and Jean Dissler, Fran√ßois Chevallier and Paul Lombard. Of the seventeen alleged victims of Luc Tangorre, who were assaulted between December 6, 1979 and April 10, 1981, five victims testified before the cour d'assises. Their testimonies weighed heavily, while Tangorre defended himself by presenting alibis that could be hardly be proven or emanated from his entourage: among others, on the evening that he supposedly raped Sylviane, he was hospitalized. Similarly, he claimed that he was together with friends on the evening of the other attacks. The verdict of Luc Tangorre's trial was handed on May 24, when he was sentenced, including extenuating circumstances, to 15 years imprisonment. He, along with his entourage, all cried to the scandal of a miscarraige of justice. A large part of the press was not convinced either: a large daily in Marseille explained in one of its columns: \\"after the verdict was dissected, reviewed and corrected by the defense, we could not see any more truth sufficient to justify a conviction\\".  Incarceration and presidential pardon  Between December 1984 and February 1988, Tangorre was incarcerated at the Muret detention center, where, with the help of his parents, he attempted to get a retrial. The request for review was based on counter-expertise from across the country, which called into question the conclusions of the first examiners. Rumors circulated: his family financed this counter-expertise, and his brother gave a later testimony to justify the traces of the product that had \\"the characteristics of petroleum jelly\\", when a witness had largely explained the origin of these lipid spots observed on the raincoat from the beginning of the inspection. These observations annihilated the conclusions of the previous examiners because of \\"serious methodological errors\\". On July 21, 1987, after the rejection of an appeal in cassation, Tangorre obtained a presidential pardon from Fran√ßois Mitterrand, but only a partial one, which reduced his sentence to four years. On February 15, 1988, after serving almost seven years in detention, Luc Tangorre obtained parole through Albin Chalandon. A cohort of journalists were present during his exit, during which he made a statement signifying the continuation of his fight. After that, he moved to Lyon, where he opened a tobacco shop.  Recidivism   Rape of two American students  Coming from Paris so they could hitchhike on the C√¥te d'Azur for the weekend of May 21 and 22, 1988, 20-year-old Jennifer Mac Luney and 21-year-old Carol Ackermann, American students in Paris, went to Marseille at first, before moving to a beach in Les Sablettes in La Seyne-sur- Mer. On May 23, they hitchhiked again to return to the capital, where they were taking advanced French courses in an American college. They were standing at the outskirts of Marseille when a man driving Renault 4, aged 30, with brown hair and a friendly demeanor, offered to bring them to Lyon. Shortly before N√Æmes, the man claimed that he wanted to go pick cherries, so he deviated from the main route and stopped his apple-green 4L in an isolated cherry plantation, located about three kilometers from N√Æmes. There, under the threat of a weapon, he raped them for a long time, sodomizing them with engine oil to make things easier. He then abandoned the girls, without giving them a hundred francs to take a taxi, because \\"the roads are not safe\\". After walking through the fields for 35 minutes, they found a highway terminal, where they called the police, reporting that they had been raped.  Investigation  When the police questioned the American students, they revealed that they had an excellent memory: they accurately described the green 4L (license plate, a missing handle, the gas gauge not working) in which they were violated, the physique of the individual (in his 30s, wearing a yellow Lacoste polo shirt, a signet ring, white jeans and gray/black sneakers). In addition, they said that there was a pile of books in the trunk of the 4L, on which there were the words 'guilt' or 'guilty' and the face of a mustachioed man on the cover page; also, when the perpetrator saw the girls looking at the books, he quickly covered the pile with a blanket before raping them. The young women helped make a composite sketch of the man. Constable Alain Derbecq requisitioned the gyneological doctor of the Caremau Hospital in N√Æmes, whom concluded: for Mac Luney, \\"in total, the interrogation and the clinical examination are suggestive of rape with a rectal radio, although there are no traumatic lesions at the vulvar or the anal level\\", and for Ackermann \\"according to what the patient said, and according to the clinical examination, although there was no trauma, it may be thought that there was a rectal radio of force.\\" Doctors also noted the presence of \\"a greasy coating, probably oil\\" on Ackermann; no such observation was noted on Mac Luney, which they specified that the man \\"probably used engine oil\\". The next day, the examinations of the samples taken immediately after the rape highlighted the following: for Mac Luney, \\"spermatozoon in a relatively small proportion, most of which do not have flagellum\\" and for Ackermann, \\"very rare, small ovoid corpuscles without flagellum that may correspond to spermatozoon heads.\\" The police also searched for a book whose title contained the word 'guilt'. They also composed a list of all owners of green Renaults 4L and, in August 1988, a bookseller from Marseille called the police of N√Æmes, telling them that he had found a book that matched the one they were looking for: it was written by a CNRS biologist (Gis√®le Tichan√©, a friend of the Tangorre family) titled Guilty at any price: the Luc Tangorre case,. which also had the face of a mustachioed man at the bottom of the cover page. The gendarmes again became interested in Luc Tangorre, learning that he lived in Lyon, where he ran a tobacco shop on the Place Carnot, on Marigny, bought after his release with the help of his parents. Their investigation determined that he had a green Renault 4L. On letters of rogatory, Christian Lernould, investigating judge at the court of N√Æmes, ordered the gendarmes to bring in Tangorre for questioning on October 24. When arrested by the gendarmerie at Lyon, he shouted out his innocence when the police informed him that he was accused of two rapes. Luc claimed on the day of the day of the rapes it was Pentecost, and that he was at his parents' house for a family dinner after a baptism; he apparently remembered it very well, because it was the first family party since his release. He then said that he slept at his parents' house and noted his activities in his notebook, an alibi backed by his family and friends. To prove his innocence, Tangorre's parents even gave the police photos of the baptism: to their stupefication, in the photos, Luc was wearing jeans, the yellow Lacoste polo shirt and the gray/black sneakers, as described by the two girls. The police made the trip to Marseille-N√Æmes to find out if Luc Tangorre could have the necessary time to violate the two students. Modeled on the fluctuating declarations of the Americans, no less than four thirty-month retrospective trajectory trials were necessary to be conducted, taking into account the claims by the girls. It was concluded that Tangorre could have had the material time to carry out this course to violate them, even if, at the end of the third trial, the magistrates at the cour d'assises of Montpellier recognized the fact that \\"contradictions as they appear in the story of the initial journey, as described by the victims\\". Tangorre's five lawyers challenged the honesty of the fourth trial, and gave reasons in writing as to why they refused to participate. Finally, it was noted that the crime scene was a place where Luc came to play as a child, 2.5 km away from the \\"Daffodils\\" building in N√Æmes, his former place of residence, as discovered by the original 1981 investigation.. As soon as he was arrested, Tangorre asked the gendarmes and the judge for a genetic comparison based on the samples, as quickly as possible. Nevertheless, the evidence taken from both Mac Luney and Ackermann, which should logically exonerate Tangorre if tampered with or simply fixed, was rare and altered, which destroys all possibility of exploitation. Luc Tangorre was brought before the examining magistrate, while the two girls made the express trip from the United States to identify him. Once there, he insulted both victims after they formally identified him as their rapist. However, the claims about the rear seats of the green 4L on which the girls were raped were unusable, along with the claim that the gas tank had run 40 km as described by the accusers (it was not conclusively proven after the investigation), which weakened the credibility of the accusations. Tangorre argued that it was impossible to remain a virgin after the type of rape Ackermann had suffered, and that Mac Luney could not reasonably explain by what miracle she could, eight weeks after the fact, reproduce from memory the design of the jacket after her traumatic condition, with precision comparable to that of tracing. He also raised the following point: if there were only 35 minutes to reach the only possible passage to the motorway by the route starting from their very precise indications, all on the basis of a nocturnal labyrinth (various obstacles, barbed wire or entangled vegetables), this was precisely the shortest and most direct path: it would still be a miracle, and once again, this question was posed by Luc Tangorre's defenders. However, he was incarcerated and imprisoned at the N√Æmes prison, and when his supporters, most of whom had been with him since his first trial, learned about his possible involvement in the N√Æmes rapes, a part of them began wondering who was responsible for raping the nine young women in Marseille. In addition, Pierre Vidal-Naquet, who believed in his innocence in the first instance, said that if it turns out that Tangorre is guilty, he would publicly apologize. Before passing to the cour d'assises, the public prosecutor's office and Tangorre's lawyers solicited confrontations that they never got. As for Luc, he denounced in vain a fictitious accusation, intended to artificially ruin the efforts which previously lead to the review of the first trial.  Second trial  The second trial of Luc Tangorre began on February 3, 1992, before the cour d'assises of Gard and N√Æmes, under presiding Justice Maurice Malleval. As in the first trial at Aix-en-Provence, Tangorre cried out that this was a scandal. At the request of both victims, the trial was held in private. Besides his parents, fewer people still believed in his innocence. Like in the first trial, Tangorre defended himself viciously, but Ackermann and Mac Luney's testimony weighed heavily on the balance, after they claimed and confirmed that it was indeed Luc Tangorre who had raped them. The latter repeated that he would've done such thing. The psychiatric experts stated, in the event of his guilt, that it could be a case of dissociative personality disorder and that the \\"normal\\" Luc Tangorre could not admit he was forced to refer himself to under the hypothesis. The verdict of the second trial was announced on February 8, and Luc Tangorre was sentenced, with extenuating circumstances, to 18 years imprisonment. His parents, once again, screamed for scandal and miscarriage of justice.. Following the verdict, Vidal-Naquet apologized in a column published in Le Monde, recognizing that without the intervention of the support committee, Tangorre would not have been pardoned and the rapes of the two Americans would've never occurred.. This time, Tangorre was not released on parole. He only got two permissions granted within four months, before his release on September 1, 2000.  New offences  Domiciled in the Lyon area, since his release from prison in 2000,. Luc Tangorre became the talk of the town again on August 12, 2014, when he was indicted in Grau-du-Roi, on suspicion of sexually assaulting a 12-year- old girl.. The case experienced ramifications, as two other minors joined in the indictment, bringing the total number to three assaults in Gard.. Luc Tangorre was left free, with a travel ban on Gard, although the N√Æmes Procurate required that he be placed in provisional custody. In December 2017, Tangorre was indicted again, this time for corrupting a minor in Saint-Martin- en-Haut, in Rh√¥ne. He was placed, eight months later, under judicial control. On September 12, 2019, the N√Æmes Correctional Tribunal sentenced Luc Tangorre to three and a half years for sexually assaulting three minors between July 1, 2012 and July 19, 2019. His civil and civic rights were withdrawn for a period of five years, and after he was convicted of rape six times, he continues to proclaim himself a victim of a miscarriage of justice. Finally, contrary to what his lawyers suggested, he will appeal this decision. Luc Tangorre will soon appear in a Lyon court for similar events, denounced in 2018 by another teenager near Lyon.

Life Arnout Vosmaer was born in Rotterdam on 23 September 1720 and died in The Hague on 15 January 1799. Very little is known about his personal life. In 1756 Vosmaer became the director of a natural history collection started by Princess Anna, the wife of William IV, Prince of Orange and continued by their son William V. Vosmaer held the post until the Batavian Revolution in 1795. Works Vosmaer produced a series of 34 booklets describing animals that were published between 1766 and 1805 in both Dutch and French. Most were on species kept in Prince William V's menagerie. Each booklet included at least one and sometimes two plates engraved by Simon Fokke, many of which were based on watercolours by Aert Schouman.

A route to phenol analogous to the cumene process begins with cyclohexylbenzene, which is oxidized to a hydroperoxide, akin to the production of cumene hydroperoxide.

The operations lasted for around two months following the raid, displacing thousands of civilians and resulting in the deaths of around fifty civilians from various causes. Incidents The raid occurred on 4 April 2003 at around 1 AM, launched by an unidentified mob, against the armory of the Wamena District of the Indonesian Army. In the raid itself, 29 rifles were stolen by Papuan rebels alongside 3,500 rounds of ammunition. During the raid, two Indonesian soldiers were killed and one was heavily injured. Between April and June 2003, sweeping operations were launched around Wamena, affecting 25 villages. The National Commission on Human Rights (Komnas HAM) estimated that nine civilians were killed and 38 were heavily injured. Torture and destruction of property and public facilities were also reported. Around 7,000 villagers were forcefully displaced, and 42 died due to starvation during this period. Reports characterized the operations as not discriminating locals and those involved in the rebel movement. Aftermath Investigations of the human rights violations during the incident was launched by Komnas HAM following approval by then-president Megawati Sukarnoputri. However, as of 2019, the violations have not went to court. The events have been referred to as Tragedi Wamena Berdarah (Bloody Wamena Tragedy). Five men arrested and imprisoned for their alleged involvement in the 2003 raid were given clemency by Indonesian President Widodo during one of his visits to Papua in May 2015.

Selection process The team was chosen by a panel of 26 voters made up of coaches, team and front office executives, former players and members of the media between April and June 2018. New England Patriots head coach Bill Belichick and Pro Football Hall of Fame head coach John Madden were also two of the voters and were in charge of looking over film and issuing a report to the committee on players in the early years of the league. There was a vote to trim the list to 160 in mid-May 2018, after considering the \\"Golden Era\\" players recommended by Belichick and Madden. Another debate was held in May with the final votes due on June 15, 2018. Players were selected at each position group, and were voted in no order. There were 10 quarterbacks, 12 running backs, 10 wide receivers, five tight ends, seven tackles, seven guards, four centers, seven defensive ends, seven defensive tackles, six outside linebackers, six middle/inside linebackers, seven cornerbacks, seven safeties, two kickers, two punters, two kick/punt returners, and 10 coaches selected to the team. The roster was unveiled over six weeks on NFL Network by host Rich Eisen alongside Cris Collinsworth and Belichick.

Many of whom are from an Arab tribe, a branch of Bani Malik from Central Arabia. Bani Malik are named after the renowned army leader, Malik Al-Ashtar Al-Nakha'i,Al-Abakat Al-Amberyiah Fe Al-Tabakat Al- Ja'afaryiah, ÿßŸÑÿπÿ®ŸÇÿßÿ™ ÿßŸÑÿπŸÜÿ®ÿ±Ÿäÿ© ŸÅŸä ÿßŸÑÿ∑ÿ®ŸÇÿßÿ™ ÿßŸÑÿ¨ÿπŸÅÿ±Ÿäÿ© (The amber scent of the Ja'afarians), by Mohammad Hussein Kashif-Al- Gita'a and are a branch of Azd Mecca (the descendants of Khuza'a Ibn Amr). Azd Mecca are one of four branches of Azd (or Al-Azd), a major pre-Islamic tribes, a branch of Kahlan which was one of the branches of Qahtan the other being Himyar.Al-Iber (ÿßŸÑÿπÿ®ÿ± The Lessons), by lbn KhaldounNihayat Al-Arab Fe Ma'arifat Ansab Al-Arab ŸÜŸáÿßŸäÿ© ÿßŸÑÿ£ÿ±ÿ® ŸÅŸä ŸÖÿπÿ±ŸÅÿ© ÿ£ŸÜÿ≥ÿßÿ® ÿßŸÑÿπÿ±ÿ® (The ultimate information on Arab ancestry), by Al- Kalkashandi Most of Al-Ali tribe migrated by the end of the 16th century from what is now Saudi Arabia to different neighboring countries. Members of Al-Ali tribe live in Saudi Arabia, UAE, Qatar, Kuwait, Bahrain, Iraq and Jordan. Al-Ali tribe in Iraq The tribal pattern in Iraq for the last four centuries is such that tribes are grouped under different banners Rayat (ÿ±ÿßŸäÿßÿ™, sing. Raya) and areas of influence. These groups are not necessarily blood-related but they are tribal congregations, each one stems from its own ancestry and ruled by the Shaikh (ÿ¥ŸäÿÆ), and cooperate in war under the same banner. However, two or three tribes (Asheera ÿπÿ¥Ÿäÿ±ÿ© pl. Ashayer) may have the same ancestry and cooperate in war under one banner and commanded by one leader who is called Shaikh of the shaikhs (Shaikh al Mashayikh ÿ¥ŸäÿÆ ÿßŸÑŸÖÿ¥ÿßŸäÿÆ ). The shaikh's ancestors may not be the same as those of his tribe that he commands.Studies of the Iraqi tribes, by Hmud Al-Sa'idi Any tribe can have the name of the bigger group or keeps its name. Individuals too can do the same e.g. one can be called Al-Maliki (related to Bani Malik, the bigger tribe) and at the same time he is called Al-Ali (related to Al- Ali), which is one of Bani Malik offshoots. Some members of Al-Ali tribe call themselves Bani Hasan (the sons of Hasan) which is another offshoot of Bani Malik. This tribal system dates back to the pre-Islamic era. Habits of Iraqi tribes Every Shaikh of an Iraqi tribe has a guest-house called Madheef (ŸÖÿ∂ŸäŸÅ) for hosting of the tribe's guests and refugees fleeing their tribe, recreation of the tribe members and a court room too.History of Arabic Literature, by Ahmad Zaidan, 1/186 A settler Arab tribe has its own order of penalties and fines, called Swani (ÿµŸàÿßŸÜŸä), for crimes committed on its territory, in contrast to nomadic ones. Homicide and rape crimes are resolved by offering men of the victim's tribe a number of women to marry. If the assailant tribe is of another race, women are not accepted but instead they give \\"Diyya\\" (ÿØŸäÿ©) in form of money or cattle stock. Women can only be accepted from a white tribe allied to the assailant's black tribe. Al-Ali tribe They are one of the offshoots of Bani Malik (ÿ®ŸÜŸä ŸÖÿßŸÑŸÉ). In the 16th century they moved north from central Arabia to UAE, Qatar, Kuwait, Bahrain and Jordan, but others had relocated in Iraq as described. Al Ali tribe is known to be one of the richest tribes in the Middle East. In the 13th century they had 4000 warriors, but most of the tribesmen had died in the plague of 1247 AH (1887 AD) so the number of their warriors was reduced to 150 in 1260 AH (1900). During the reign of their shaikh, Isa ibn Ehdaib, there was a severe drought which made them leave their land on the eastern bank of Euphrates and migrated near AI- Hindyiah tributary of Euphrates River, to the village called Janaja and some migrated to AI-Shamyiah to a place called AI-Kharabah which was offered by Shaikh Thirib ibn Emghamis Al-Khaza'ali.Poems of Abu Al-Mahasin Al- Karbala'aie, by Ali Al-Yacoubi Many of AI-Ali's still live in that area around Um-Hayaya River in Najaf Governorate.Al-Ali Biography, \\"Al-Sahafi\\" Newspaper, Jordan, dated 29.03.1994 Al-Ali offshoots An offshoot is called Fakhd (ŸÅÿÆÿ∞) * Al-Mahasna * Al-Bkhair * Al-Daoud * Al-Hayachla * Al-Faraj (Al-Ali): The largest fakhd, a tribe in its own right, and they kept the name of the main tribe.

In 1948, the Holy See established the office of Delegate to Dakar to represent its interest in French colonial Africa. Following the decolonization of the region, the title of that position was changed to Apostolic Delegate to Western Africa on 23 September 1960 and given responsibility for Senegal, Upper Volta, Cote d'Ivoire, Dahomey (Benin), Guinea, Mauritania, Niger, Sudan, Togo, Ghana, Gambia, and Sierra Leone. Over the next decade, as the Vatican established relationships with individual countries, country-specific offices were created, including the Pro-Nunciature to Dahomey in 1972.

The fort was probably part of the defenses of the Main Limes, and also, as part of the Upper Germanic-Rhaetian Limes, but also of the older Odenwald Limes section of the Neckar-Odenwald Limes, but this has not been definitively proven archaeologically. Relation to other forts The starting point of the Odenwald Limes has not to date been definitively determined; one possibility is the fortress at Obernburg (ORL 35), built between 100 and 110 AD, but this question can only be resolved by further excavations. Some evidence also suggests that it may be W√∂rth (ORL 36), but significant dateable finds are lacking. What is certain is that the origin of the Odenwald Limes, whose next identified fort is Kastell Seckmauern (ORL 46b), is in the region between the two nearby forts of Obernburg and W√∂rth. Recent research suggests that the \\"Pfitschengraben\\", a deep wooded gorge that provides a direct connection between the Main and Kastell Seckmauern, may represent the beginning of this stretch of Limes. This would also explain the absence of any traces of watchtowers between Seckmauern and W√∂rth. Trennfurt Roman Fort (ORL 37), lying somewhat further along in the direction of the Main, is ruled out from consideration because it is more recent. It appears that W√∂rth was garrisoned only after the fort at Obernburg, and after the earth and timber fortifications of Seckmauern were constructed, since to date no late south Gaulish Terra Sigillata appears among the finds there. Pieces of this pottery are found, however, in other forts of the Odenwald Limes. This suggests that Seckmauern, never fortified in stone and later bisected by a palisade, was quickly abandoned and replaced by W√∂rth. Research and construction history W√∂rth was first identified in 1882‚Äì83, and archaeologically excavated from 1887 to 1890 by the Imperial Limes Commission (Reichs-Limeskommission) by section commissioner Wilhelm Conrady. The excavations found a stone numerus fort long and wide. The Porta Praetoria, the main gate of four, is to the northeast, towards the Main. The fort was secured by towers in each corner, and surrounded by a double moat, according to Conrady. In the interior only the Principia, the headquarters building, could be identified; all other buildings were constructed of wood and were not detectable by the excavation methods of the time. Through ageophysical survey at the beginning of the twenty-first century it was determined that a portion of the fortifications on the south side had fallen in a heap into the moat. The dates of construction and abandonment of the fort have not yet been identified. Scattered evidence and inscriptions point to a possible construction in the time of Domitian, but the majority of the total scant finds date from the middle second to the early third century. In addition, nothing is known about the auxiliary units stationed here. Possibly one may be the Numerus Brittonum et Exploratorum Nemanigensium (Troop of Britons and Scouts of the River M√ºmling). This assignment is somewhat problematic, however, as the same unit is identified at Obernburg. Today the fort is only visible to the trained eye through slight irregularities in the ground. A slight raised area in the southwest of the fort is located in cultivated land, and locally is called the \\"Obere Au.\\" Otherwise none of the structure is visible. A virtual reconstruction of the fort together with archaeological finds and information is located in the community center in W√∂rth. This permanent exhibit is affiliated with the W√∂rth Shipping and Shipbuilding Museum (Schifffahrts- und Schiffbaumuseum W√∂rth am Main). Around southeast of the Porta Principalis Dextra are the fort's baths, in the middle of a fenced orchard, of which nothing can be seen today. The baths went through several stages of rebuilding. The associated vicus was identified northwest of the fort in 2004 through a geophysical survey. Because of later building the original extent of the village is no longer visible in the topography. Course of the Limes between W√∂rth and Seckmauern From Kastell W√∂rth the Limes runs irregularly in a westerly direction. Until it reaches Seckmauern there are believed to be three unidentified sentry posts, based on topography and the distance between two identified watchtowers, but they have not been proven archaelogically. An additional watchtower (Wp 10/4 \\"Bei der feuchten Mauer\\") is believed to be located in the immediate vicinity of Kastell Seckmauern, but has not been identified. The course of the Limes itself is not completely known; at best the fosse is now a flattened depression deep and around wide. {  - !

The results of the election was announced from 18 to 25 June 1963. A total of 185,000 voters (72.7% of the registered electorate) cast votes in this election. A total of 998 candidates were vying for 429 district council seats in Sarawak. Background On 27 May 1961, Tunku Abdul Rahman, the prime minister of the Federation of Malaya, announced a plan to form a greater federation together with Singapore, Sarawak, Sabah and Brunei, to be called Malaysia. On 17 January 1962, the Cobbold Commission was formed to gauge the support of Sarawak and Sabah for the plan; the Commission reported 80 percent support for federation. As the target date 31 August 1963 for the creation of Malaysia was fast approaching , the four parties (Singapore, Brunei, Sarawak, and Sabah) were going nowhere on their negotiations with Malaya. Singapore prime minister Lee Kuan Yew had refused previous financial terms nearing settlement after a rift with Malayan Chinese Association (now Malaysian Chinese Association). The Sultan of Brunei also halted financial negotiation with Malaya. Sultan of Brunei was reported to questioned his precedence in the Malaysian Conference of Rulers and was apparently unsatisfied at his fourth position in the hierarchy. However, he later denied the breakdown of Brunei-Malaya talk was due to the issue of precedence. The political system in Sarawak was so new that defections and realignment of political parties can almost certainly be expected. There were three major political parties in Sarawak at that time: Sarawak United Peoples' Party (SUPP), Parti Negara Sarawak (PANAS), and Sarawak Alliance (Alliance). SUPP was led by Ong Kee Hui, who was a banking executive and also a Kuching Municipal Council chairman. Another prominent leader of the party, Stephen Young, was an English and Chinese educated barrister working in Kuching. However, SUPP was also infiltrated with communist supporters. Although the party was non-racial, the majority of its members were Chinese. On the other hand, PANAS was a member of the Alliance. PANAS broke away from the Alliance in April 1963 because of its dissatisfaction of alleged interference of local affairs by the Malayan Alliance Party. Although PANAS leadership was multi-racial, it became predominantly a Malay party. Meanwhile, Alliance comprised four parties: Sarawak National Party (SNAP), Parti Pesaka Sarawak (PESAKA), Barisan Ra'ayat Jati Sarawak (BARJASA), and Sarawak Chinese Association (SCA). SNAP was led by the party secretary, namely Stephen Kalong Ningkan, where he drawn his support from the Iban people of the second division of Sarawak (today Betong and Sri Aman Divisions). PESAKA was founded by Temenggung Jugah after his defection from PANAS in 1962. The PESAKA party drawn its support from the Ibans of the third division of Sarawak (today Sibu, Sarikei, Mukah and Kapit Divisions). BARJASA was representing Malays in the anti-cessionist faction. Lastly, SCA was founded by Ling Beng Siew. He was the former founder of PESAKA and was defeated in his own ward in 1959 elections. Electoral system Sarawak had an indirect three-tiered electoral system. The British colonial government installed such a system for the then politically immature Sarawak so that the legislators can have some governmental experience during their tenure in office. The state was divided into 24 local authority areas, each headed by a district council which composed of elected members from single-member constituencies. All the 24 districts then grouped together to form five divisions and each division was headed by a divisional advisory council elected by the respective district councils. The divisional advisory councils then functioned to elect 36 members into Council Negri (now Sarawak State Legislative Assembly). Meanwhile, the Council Negri would select 24 members of parliament to sit in the Parliament of Malaysia. Despite being elected as members of parliament, the representatives would still be answerable to Council Negri, divisional councils, and district councils below them. Results District councils Of the total 429 district council seats, Sarawak Alliance won 138 seats, SUPP won 116, independents won 116 seats, and PANAS won 59 seats. On the percentage of total votes, Alliance won 30.6%, independents won 29.7%, SUPP won 24.5%, and PANAS won 15.2% of the votes. SUPP became the dominant party representing the Chinese after the election. The party was initially troubled with allegations of communist infiltration. Besides, three newspapers in support of the party were banned by the government under the Preservation of Public Security Ordinance. SUPP also faced stiff competition with SCA where the latter enjoyed support from the Peninsular based Malayan Chinese Association (MCA). Although SUPP lost a substantial number of Chinese votes in four out of five urban centres (Kuching Municipal, Kuching Rural, Sibu Urban, Sibu Rural, and Miri), it did not prevent SUPP from winning district council seats in these areas. The party also enjoyed considerable support in several non-Chinese seats. At the same time, Alliance victory was built on the overwhelming support of the Iban people to SNAP and PESAKA. Alliance captured six out of eight Iban majority districts. Although PANAS was attacked by the Alliance for deserting the latter just before the election; PANAS was able to capture 53 out of 118 seats at the first and second divisions of Sarawak. Besides, the party was able to make inroads northwards into Bintulu and Miri districts. Therefore, PANAS was seen as the voice for the Malays in the first and second divisions of Sarawak. { class= style=text-align:right !colspan = \\"8\\"  Seats won by party - ! District councils !!

Although PANAS had the most number of seats in the first division, it required support of the three independents to form a majority in this division. The Alliance formed a clear majority in the second division, but required the support of independents in the third division in order to form a majority. In the fourth and fifth divisions, independents clearly had an upper hand when compared to other political parties. { class= style=text- align:right !colspan = \\"8\\"  Composition of the divisional councils - !

However, by 15 July, Alliance had an upper hand in third, fourth, and fifth divisions of Sarawak. Therefore, the Alliance was able to command 19 out of 36 seats in the Council Negri. With additional support from the independents, Alliance was able to command 26 seats in the Council Negri.

Although it was obvious that a Dayak from the principal parties (which was either SNAP or PESAKA) should become the first chief minister of Sarawak, Malaysian federal government suggested that Abdul Rahman Ya'kub (a Melanau Muslim leader from BARJASA) should become the chief minister despite his defeat in his own local ward. However, the federal government eventually accepted a compromise that the chief minister post will be held by a Dayak from SNAP named Stephen Kalong Ningkan. The Malaysian federal government also demanded that the both the chief minister and the governor post should not be held by the Dayaks simultaneously. Therefore, Temenggung Jugah, a Dayak from PESAKA, instead of becoming the first governor of Sarawak, was transferred to become the \\"Federal Minister of Sarawak Affairs\\".

Saint-Ange (English), Gastronomica 6:3:99f (Summer 2006) In the late 19th century, cooking schools such as Le Cordon Bleu and magazines such as La Cuisini√®re Cordon Bleu and Le Pot-au-Feu, emerged in Paris to teach cooking technique to bourgeois women. Pellaprat's La Cuisine de tous les jours (1914) and Le Livre de cuisine de Madame Saint-Ange (1927) come from those cooking schools. In the United States, Julia Child, who studied at the Cordon Bleu, followed with her Mastering the Art of French Cooking (1961, 1970).

The film follows a woman who finds a dangerous new love and the novice attorney who defends her in a sensational court case. Plot Jasmine Bryant (Bresha Webb) is a public defender who constantly takes plea deals in small town Virginia. Her husband Jordan (Matthew Law) is a police officer who is feeling down after one of his recent victims jumps off a roof to her death. Jasmine is given a new case by her boss Rory (Tyler Perry) to defend Grace Waters (Crystal Fox) the woman accused of murdering her husband Shannon (Mehcad Brooks). Grace insists that she is guilty and will agree to a plea deal if she goes to a prison close by her son Malcolm (Walter Fauntleroy). Jasmine is troubled by the details of the case, including the fact that Shannon's body was never found. Rory is not pleased that Jasmine wants to try the case because the department does not have the budget for a trial, in addition to the media frenzy. Grace‚Äôs best friend Sarah (Phylicia Rashad) tells Jasmine that Grace was feeling sad after her divorce and she pushed her to get out and meet someone new, which led her to Shannon. After researching the case some more, Jasmine and her colleagues Tilsa (Angela Marie Rigsby) and Donnie (Donovan Christie, Jr.) believe Grace is innocent. Grace tells Jasmine how she met Shannon at his artwork exhibition at an art gallery. They began dating as he charmed Grace with nice words and wine. After they married three months later, Shannon gradually became cruel and secretive from Grace. Eventually, Grace was fired from her job at the bank after Shannon secretly stole from her accounts using her passwords, and he also mortgaged her house with forged documents. Finally, Grace walked in on Shannon in their bed with another woman. That evening, in anger, Grace beat Shannon with a baseball bat multiple times and threw him down the stairs to her basement. Grace then drove to the middle of nowhere to call Sarah and inform her that she killed her husband. Sarah explains that she went to Grace's house and witnessed her son Malcolm leaving the house. Because Shannon's body is missing, Sarah believes that Malcolm helped Grace dispose of it. At the trial, Jasmine miserably fails at proving Grace's innocence. Calling Sarah as a witness backfires because phone records show numerous phone calls between the women on the night of the murder, and Sarah finally admits on the stand that Grace confessed to killing Shannon to her. Grace is found guilty by the jury. Feeling defeated, Jasmine stops by Sarah's house (a residence for old ladies) and notices an elderly woman named Alice (Cicely Tyson) trying to escape from the house. Alice wants to leave the house and reveals that other women have died there, including Shane Fieldman (Jordan's victim from the beginning of the film). When Jasmine discovers there are numerous elderly women locked up in the basement, she is kidnapped. Jordan discovers Sarah's criminal history and searches for his wife. Shannon turns out to be alive and is revealed to be Sarah's son. Jordan knocks on the door and asks Sarah if Jasmine is there and she denies it. When Jordan calls her, he hears her phone ringing from inside the house, so he bursts in, tussles with Sarah, handcuffs her, and then looks for Jasmine as Sarah escapes. Jordan and Shannon fight as Jasmine tries to break free. Shannon is shot and is presumably killed. As the police rescue the elderly women, it is revealed that Shannon's real name is Maurice Mills and Sarah is his mother Betty Mills, and they have been kidnapping elderly women and holding them hostage for their social security information for the past 25 years. Maurice is also wanted in several states for conning so many middle aged women out of their life savings, with Grace being one of those women. Grace ends up back in court with Jasmine showing off evidence of Grace being victimized by their scheme, which makes her free to go. While everyone celebrates Grace's freedom, Rory congratulates Jasmine for uncovering such a crazy scheme. Meanwhile, Betty hides from the police, having just been hired by a suspicious woman to care for her elderly mother. Cast Production Principal photography took place at Tyler Perry Studios in fall 2018, over the course of five days. Release A Fall from Grace was released in the United States by Netflix on January 17, 2020. The film was watched by 26 million during its first week which is a notable accomplishment. Reception , the film holds an approval rating of 17% on review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, based on 23 reviews with an average rating of 3.36/10. The website's critical consensus reads, \\"Drama for drama's sake does not a great movie make, but boy is it fun to watch A Fall From Grace unravel\\". On Metacritic, the film holds a rating of 34 out of 100, based on seven critics, indicating \\"generally unfavorable reviews\\". Many on social media have criticized the glaring errors in the film in the forms of seeing boom microphones, continuity errors, and extras staring directly into the camera and \\"miming\\" actions, possibly attributed to the very limited production schedule. The line \\"Ashtray, bitch!\\", has become something of an internet meme due to its forceful, yet unintentionally funny delivery. Tyler Perry claimed that the line was not in the script and something he had added on the spot stating, \\"that was my father doing stupid stuff\\".

Benjamin Brown French (1800 - 1870) was a politician, telegraph business leader, Clerk of the U.S. House of Representatives, and Public Commissioner of Buildings in Washington, D.C. He was a member of the New Hampshire legislature from 1831 until 1833. He moved to Washington, D.C., where he served as Clerk of the United States House of Representatives from 1845 until 1847 and was appointed Commissioner of Public Buildings. He compiled an album of salt print and albumen print photographs related to construction of the Capitol dome and other sites. He was also involved in the burgeoning telegraph industry developed by Samuel Morse and others. His journals were published posthumously in edited form as Witness to the Young Republic. The August 30, 1845, issue of the Baltimore Sun led to the composition of a ballad by French about Luther Fuller who died aboard the steamboat Erie. It was printed on September 5. He succeeded William S. Wood as Commissioner of Public Buildings in the fall of 1861. He was present at Abraham Lincoln's inauguration (and was president of the inaugural ball committee), and is reported to have physically restrained John Wilkes Booth, who had gained access to the capitol rotunda, and was trying to push through the crowd. Frenc was also present for the Gettysburg Address, and oversaw Lincoln's funeral. He gave the main speech April 14, 1868, at the dedication of the Abraham Lincoln statue at Washington's City Hall. He composed a hymn for the consecration of the National Cemetery at Gettysburg. Amos Tuck French was his great-grandson. His journals were donated to the Library of Congress by an heir. His Capitol Hill home had been next to where the library was built. The journals were edited into a book and published as Witness to the Young Republic. Historian Joanne B. Freeman drew extensively upon these journals as a resource when writing her 2018 book, The Field of Blood: Violence in Congress and the Road to Civil War.

It is taken by mouth in the form of capsules. Text was copied from this source which is ¬© European Medicines Agency. Reproduction is authorized provided the source is acknowledged. Contraindications The drug is contraindicated in people with hereditary hemochromatosis and other kinds of iron overload, as well as those repeatedly receiving blood transfusions and are therefore also at risk of developing iron overload. Side effects The most common side effects are flatulence (in 5% of people taking the drug), diarrhea (4%), constipation (4%), stool color change (4%), nausea (3%), vomiting (3%), and abdominal discomfort, bloating and pain (1%). Ferric maltol may cause serious side effects including increased risk of inflammatory bowel disease flare and iron overload in the body. Interactions No systematic interaction studies with ferric maltol have been conducted. Food reduces its uptake from the gut, as do calcium and magnesium salts and tetracycline antibiotics. Conversely, iron inhibits the uptake of many drugs, such as bisphosphonates, tetracycline antibiotics, quinolone antibiotics, levothyroxin, and levodopa. Combining the drug with intravenous iron can result in fast release of iron into the blood, potentially leading to low blood pressure or even collapse. Dimercaprol in combination with iron is toxic for the kidneys. The antibiotic chloramphenicol interferes with incorporation of iron into red blood cells and with iron excretion. Furthermore, iron can reduce the blood pressure lowering effects of methyldopa. Maltol is metabolized by the enzyme UGT1A6. It is not known whether inhibitors of this enzyme increase maltol concentrations in the body. Pharmacology Mechanism of action Ferric maltol acts as a source of iron, which is essential for oxygen transport in the blood and other processes in the human body. Pharmacokinetics The substance is a complex of iron with maltol, which is absorbed from the gut and then dissociates, releasing iron and maltol separately into the bloodstream. Iron is bound to transferrin and reaches its highest concentrations in the blood plasma one to three hours after ingestion. It is also bound to ferritin for storage. Maltol reaches its highest plasma concentrations after 1 to 1.5 hours. It is quickly metabolized to the glucuronide by UGT1A6 and eliminated via the urine with a biological half-life of 0.7 hours. 40‚Äì60% are excreted in the glucuronidized form.Ferric maltol . Accessed 2020-07-29.  History  Ferric maltol was approved for medical use in the European Union in February 2016. Ferric maltol was approved for medical use in the United States in July 2019, based on evidence from three clinical trials (trial 1, trial 2, and trial 3). All 295 participants had low iron stores in the body and consequent iron deficiency anemia. In the first two trials low iron was caused by participants' inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and in the last trial, by long standing (chronic) kidney disease. Trials were conducted at 79 sites in Europe and the United States.

Gunn, a 58-year-old African-American man, was shot and killed near his home after fleeing from a stop-and-frisk initiated by Aaron Cody Smith, a white police officer. Smith was charged with murder and indicted by a grand jury in 2016. The case came to trial in late 2019 following a change of venue to Ozark, Alabama. Smith was found guilty of manslaughter, and in January 2020, was sentenced to 14 years in prison.  Background  Gregory Gunn lived with his mother in the Mobile Heights neighborhood in Montgomery, Alabama. The neighborhood had experienced a number of burglaries around the time of the incident. According to Montgomery Police officer Aaron Cody Smith, Gunn matched the description of a burglary suspect: \\"dark clothing, black male\\".  Confrontation  Around 3:20am on February 25, 2016, Gunn was walking home unarmed from a card game when he encountered Smith, who was patrolling the neighborhood. Smith stopped Gunn and performed a stop-and- frisk; during the encounter, Gunn fled. Smith pursued, initially attempting to use a Taser to disable Gunn, and when that failed he began striking Gunn with his baton. According to Smith's later testimony, Gunn then picked up a painter's pole, which caused Smith to fire his service weapon in self-defense. Smith shot seven times, hitting Gunn five times and killing him.  Trial  Smith was placed on administrative leave following the incident and was arrested and charged with murder a week later following an Alabama Bureau of Investigation inquiry. A grand jury indicted him for murder in November 2016. He was originally going to be tried in Montgomery, but the trial was moved to Ozark in the white-majority Dale County at the request of his defense attorneys. In the request to move the trial, Smith's defense attorneys said that racial prejudice in Montgomery, media coverage of the shooting, and the actions of city officials would all affect the jury. They also described Smith as \\"the first and only Montgomery Police Officer ever to be arrested and charged immediately after an officer-involved shooting.\\" Eight judges recused themselves from the trial. During the trial, Smith testified that Gunn had grabbed a metal painter's pole during the fight, at which point he escalated to using his gun. Prosecutors argued that Gunn could not have picked up the pole based on photographs from the crime scene which showed a hat in Gunn's hand. A state investigator also testified that Gunn's fingerprints were not found on the pole. They also emphasized that Smith had given several different accounts of the fight in the years between the shooting and the trial. Smith had not turned on his body or dashboard cameras before the stop, so several details of the incident were unclear. On November 22, 2019, a jury found Smith guilty of the lesser included charge of manslaughter. Following the verdict, Gunn's brother Franklin said: \\"They brought this case to a very conservative county, expecting a different outcome...But I believe that we have seen the best of Alabama today. One bad apple in a bunch has been weeded out.\\" On January 29, 2020, Smith was sentenced to 14 years in prison. He was released on an appeal bond in March 2020 while appealing the conviction.  Wrongful death suit  The Gunn family filed a wrongful death lawsuit in federal court against the city of Montgomery in February 2016\\\\. The suit was settled in April 2020.

She is currently director of the doctoral program at Michigan, as well as the head of admissions.  Selected scholarship   The Collapse of International Trade During the 2008-2009 Crisis: In Search of the Smoking Gun (2010)  Together with Andrei A. Levchenko and Logan T. Lewis, Tesar explores the collapse in international trade during the most recent global recession. They analyse disaggregated data on U.S. imports and exports to shed light on the anatomy of the collapse. They find that the recent reduction in trade relative to overall economic activity is far larger than in previous downturns. During the examination of data, a 40% shortfall is revealed in quantities and prices of both domestic absorption and imports, relative to what would be predicted by a simple import demand relationship. They find that sectors used as intermediate inputs experienced significantly higher percentage reductions in both imports and exports while exploring a sample of imports and exports disaggregated at the 6-digit NAICS level. They also find support for compositional effects: sectors with larger reductions in domestic output had larger drops in trade. In contrast to the climate of opinion, they did not find support for the hypothesis that trade credit played a role in the recent trade collapse.  The Value of Control in Emerging Markets (2010)  This paper studies the economically large and statistically significant increase in acquiring firm's stock price when a developed country multinational firm acquires majority control of a firm in an emerging market. Along with Anusha Chari and Paige P. Ouimet, Tesar explores two decades (1986‚Äì2006) in which developed-market acquirers experienced positive and significant abnormal returns of 1.16%, on average, over a three- day event window. it is revealed that these positive acquirer returns and dollar value gains are unique to emerging-market mergers, and the gains are not replicated when the same acquirers take over firms in developed markets. The stock price increase is significantly more in two scenarios: the weaker the contracting environment in the emerging market and for industries with high asset intangibility.  Border Effect or Country Effect? Seattle May Not Be So Far from Vancouver After All (2009)  \\"Border effect refers to asymmetries in trade patterns between cities and regions of different countries that share a national border and those that are located in the same country. Usually, trade volume is much lesser between the former cities and regions.\\" Yuriy Gorodnichenko and Tesar re-examines the evidence on the border effect in this paper. They argue that if there is cross-country heterogeneity in the distribution of price differentials within a country, then there is no clear reference point from which to set a standard for the effect of the border. Due to the lack of a structural model or natural experiment, it is not possible to separate the \\"border\\" effect from the effect of trading with a country with different distribution of prices. This paper aims to prove that the \\"border effect\\" identified by Engel and Rogers (1996) is driven entirely by the difference in the distribution of prices in United States and Canada.  Trade, Production Sharing, and the International Transmission of Business Cycles (2008)  Ariel Burstein, Christopher Kurz and Tesar conclude in this paper that countries that are more engaged in production sharing exhibit higher bilateral manufacturing output correlations. They analyze data on trade flows between US multinationals and their affiliates, as well as trade between the United States and Mexican maquiladoras to measure production-sharing trade and its connection with the business cycle. They develop a quantitative model of international business cycles that generates a positive link between the extent of vertically integrated production-sharing trade and internationally synchronized business cycles. A key assumption that is made in the creation of the model is a relatively low elasticity of substitution between home and foreign inputs in the production of a vertically integrated good.

Preceded by the singles, \\"Daisy\\" and \\"Cry\\" featuring Grimes, Ashnikko's debut mixtape titled Demidevil will be released through Parlophone and WMG on November 13, 2020.  Early life  Casey was born on February 19, 1996 in Oak Ridge, North Carolina, and raised in the city of Greensboro where her parents exposed her to country music and Slipknot. She recalls becoming interested in music, specifically rap music, when she listened to \\"Bucky Done Gun\\" and Arular by M.I.A on her iPod Nano at the age of 11, claiming that it \\"blew [her] little brain away\\". As a teenager, her family moved to Estonia for her father's studies, spending a year there before relocating again to Riga, Latvia. At one point, she was the only American in the country to attend a Latvian public high school. As she is currently working in the UK, she is a \\"domestic\\" member of PRS for Music, but is represented in the U.S. by ASCAP.

Their debut album Curve of Earth was released in 2019. History Singer-songwriter Sam Swinson formed the band with Adam Pressley while in high school; they were later joined by multi-instrumentalist Nate Hahn. Despite initial popularity in and around Normal, Illinois, and several do-it-yourself releases, Swinson's heroin addiction and recovery caused the band to disintegrate. The band were subsequently mostly inactive from 2009 to 2016. Curve of Earth (2019) Ohtis' debut album Curve of Earth was released on March 29, 2019, 15 years after the band was first formed. The songs were written while Swinson was in drug rehabilitation and during relapse, and recorded after Swinson contacted Pressley and Hahn as part of a twelve-step program. The album also draws on religious themes, inspired by Swinson's early life spent in a cult. Chris Conaton of PopMatters described the album as characterised by \\"an unusual musical variety in the songs that makes it an intriguing listening experience\\" and praised \\"Swinson's raw honesty and the band's musical creativity\\". Marcy Donelson of AllMusic noted that despite the album's subject matter, its \\"lyrics are delivered throughout the album with a relaxed, affable tone befitting the group's twangy, sauntering indie rock\\", and characterized the album as \\"30-minute set that plays like a character-centered short story.\\" In a five-star review in NME, Jordan Bassett wrote that \\"These eight country songs course with pain and regret, although there‚Äôs a strong seam of hope and optimism too.\\" Bassett praised \\"Black Blood\\" and concluded that the album \\"contain[s] the chaos of addiction, crystallising mistakes into something much more beautiful. The result is extraordinary and life-affirming.\\" George O'Brien of London in Stereo wrote that the album \\"paints a picture of hope, through examining the bleakest moments\\", while Woody Delaney of Loud and Quiet described it as having an \\"aura that‚Äôs melancholic yet comforting\\". Reviewing the album in The Line of Best Fit, Evan Lilly wrote that \\"Curve of Earth is an intimate recollection that's meant to illuminate and heal our spirits, reminding us that even in dark times, light somehow manages to always pass through.\\" References External links * Official website Category:American alternative country groups Category:American country rock groups Category:Musical groups from Illinois Category:Musical groups established in the 2000s ","title":"Ohtis"},{"id":"62415477","text":"Ikorta castle is a historical castle of Ksani dukes (eristavs) in the eastern Georgia, near the city of Gori. The current remnants of the castle are Ikorta church and the citadel. Presumably dating to the 17th-18th centuries, the exact time of its construction is not known. The castle was built most probably when Ksani eristavs moved from Kvenipnevi to Akhalgori and obtained Ikorta as one of their residences. The Ikorta church served as the burial place for eristavs, and currently numerous gravestones can be found inside and around it. History The exact construction time is not known, and presumable dates to the 17th-18th century, when Ksani eristavs lead the rebellion against Iran. In 1732 Kartli was fighting against lezgins, who were completely defeated under the walls of Ikorta castle. In 1736 Iranian troops of Nader shah were defeated by Ksani eristav Shanshe by the castle. Architecture The castle consisted of two parts, the lower and the upper. The vast lower part contained the Ikorta church and probably the dukes' palace, and only fragmentary traces of the wall can be found scattered around, as well as a tower in the southeastern part. The upper citadel has a roughly rectangular shape, with two towers: one quadrangular and another circular. The quadrangular tower, in the northwestern part of the fortress, was built earlier than the circular tower, in the southwest. Only three stories remain in the quadrangular tower. It was made of stones. The entrance was from the south. Single and doubled arrowslits still can be seen on its walls. The circular tower was originally smaller than the current, which was restored in 18th century. The more preserved western wall is 4-5 m high, but its upper part was ruined. The eastern wall was connected to the lower fortress by wooden stairs. References –ó–∞–∫–∞—Ä–∞—è, –ü.

The two teams are the most popular football teams in Bulgaria associated with the railroad industry, representing Sofia and Plovdiv, respectively. Overall, Lokomotiv Sofia has been more successful, winning 44 games, compared to Lokomotiv Plovdiv‚Äôs 31 wins. Lokomotiv Sofia also has won more trophies in total. History The cities of Sofia and Plovdiv have traditionally been the biggest and most developed in Bulgaria, including sports wise. Lokomotiv Plovdiv were founded in 1926, fourteen years after their rivals, Botev Plovdiv. This derby has always been seen as the traditional rivalry for Lokomotiv Plovdiv, as the two teams are the strongest from Plovdiv. Lokomotiv Sofia, on the other hand, was founded in 1929. Prior to the creation of A PFG in 1948, Lokomotiv Sofia was among the most prominent Bulgarian teams, winning two national titles. Following the arrival of the communist regime in Bulgaria in 1948, all sports clubs became state-owned. This was based on the system used in the Soviet Union, as well as other communist states in Eastern Europe. Like in the USSR, sports clubs‚Äô names were changed to emphasize the new political regime. Lokomotiv Sofia was originally known as ‚ÄúRailroaders football club‚Äù, but was forced to change its name to the present one, ‚ÄúLokomotiv‚Äù. Lokomotiv Plovdiv followed a similar naming history. The first meeting between the two Lokomotiv teams came on April 16, 1950. The match was a friendly game, and Lokomotiv Sofia won 1-0. Since then, the two teams have almost always regularly played each other in the top tier of Bulgarian football, with brief relegations for both sides. The first of these relegations came in 1955, when Lokomotiv Plovdiv slipped into the second tier. Plovdiv did not return to the elite until 1962. During this period, Lokomotiv Sofia had established themselves as a strong contender for the title, finishing second in 1957 and third in 1960. When Lokomotiv Plovdiv returned in 1962, they were in the shadow of their Sofia-based rivals. Lokomotiv Sofia won the national title in 1963-64 season, claiming their third title overall, while Lokomotiv Plovdiv only finished eight. Starting from 1969, however, Lokomotiv Plovdiv became more successful, finishing in the top six between 1969 and 1976. On the other hand, Lokomotiv Sofia only displayed mediocre results. This even included a relegation in the 1968-69 season for Loko Sofia. They returned to the elite in 1972. Things changed, however, when Lokomotiv Sofia won their fourth national title in the 1977-78 season, surprising many. For Lokomotiv Plovdiv, however, dark times came. They were relegated for the second time in 1980, finishing second to last. The derby was not played in the following three seasons, until 1983, when Loko Plovdiv returned to the elite. This only lasted one season, as Lokomotiv Plovdiv were again relegated, finishing 15th once more. This time they returned after only one season in B PFG. The following years saw mixed performances from both teams, although neither was relegated. After 1989, the communist regime was overthrown, which resulted in the privatization of the economy, including football clubs. In 1992, Lokomotiv Plovdiv finished third, their highest placement since 1974. Two years later, Lokomotiv Sofia managed to finish second, which started a relatively successful decade for the Sofia club. On the other hand, Lokomotiv Plovdiv, began a downward spiral in terms of results, finishing behind their rivals in the following years. This ultimately resulted in relegation in 1999, a result of bad management in the club. Following this, the owners of Lokomotiv Plovdiv decided to save the club by merging with Belasitsa Petrich, but keeping their name. The new owners began investing heavily, and Lokomotiv Plovdiv returned to the first tier in 2002. The 2003-04 season was historic for Lokomotiv Plovdiv, as they won their first ever national title, while Lokomotiv Sofia only finished 9th.  Official match statistics  {   center;\\" ! !

His trial, held in 2009, was accompanied by debates on the treatment of sex offenders.  Biography and criminal record  Evrard was born on July 12, 1946, to a modest family of laborers in Roubaix, in which he was the only child. Francis claimed that he was sexually assaulted by a cousin at age 10, which became the cause of his later \\"impulses\\". After leaving school at the age of 12, he began committing minor thefts. His only school diploma is the certificat d'√©tudes primaires, which he obtained in prison. Evrard worked as an apprentice when he was 15‚Äì16 years old, in a school specializing in lightning equipment, but only for a few months, as he was dismissed for \\"lack of seriousness\\".. In 1962, he made his first victim, for which he was sent to a recovery center in Vosges. After release, Evrard left for Belgium, where he was arrested for carrying a plumb revolver and concealing burglary material, then emptying the poor boxes of churches. In 1969, he assaulted a young boy in Mouscron, for which he was interned for 4 years in a specialized institute, before being deported from the country. Despite this, he managed to obtain dual French-Belgian nationality, and returned to settle in Belgium. In 1975, he was sentenced to 15 years imprisonment for sexual violence against a minor, as judged by the cour d'assises of Douai in the North. He was released after 9 years, but reoffended in February 1984, and was given another 4 years. He was released after 3 years, and, yet again, reoffended as soon as he left the prison. Evrard was sentenced to 41 years imprisonment in 1987, for the aggravated rape of two boys, aged 7 and 8. Evrard was released from the Caen prison after 20 years, on July 2, 2007. He did not respect any of his obligations imposed by the law after the release. In total, he had eight convictions for sexual abuse of a minor, totaling 32 years in prison.  2007 case  Only six weeks after his release, Evrard abducted 5-year-old Enis K.. After approaching the boy in the street while he was playing outside his family home, Francis convinced Enis to follow him with the promises of toys. Evrard then led him to an apartment he rented, proceeding to drug and sexually abused the child. Enis' father informed the authorities about the disappearance, and the kidnapping alert was activated. Quickly found and placed in custody, Evrard admitted his crimes, additionally confessing to a total of 40 assaults. The man, after being released under judicial supervision, escaped any check-ups. He had to start hormone treatment for chemical castration, but on the day of his release, Evrard bought a box of Viagra from the pharmacy, with the order given by a doctor at the Caen prison before his release.  Trial  A few before his trial, Evrard wrote to the then-President Nicolas Sarkozy, so he could ask that he be treated by \\"removal of the testicles through surgery\\".\\"Pedophilia - Francis Evrard asks to be castrated permanently\\" Article by Bastien Bonnefous published on October 18, 2009 in France-Soir J√©r√¥me Pianezza, Evrard's lawyer, raised several damaging questions to the judicial and penitentiary authorities at the hearing: \\"Why have you released an offender under judicial supervision who presented a risk of reoffending? How can you prescribe Viagra so casually to a convicted pedophile?\\" The lawyer believed that it could not be possible to judge Francis Evrard fairly, without also considering what had happened before the crimes themselves. He was convinced that in this case, the authorities were still hiding something. At the hearing, Evrard described being inhabited by \\"impulses\\" from the rape he suffered at age 10.\\"Francis Evrard, a life of 'impulses'\\" Article by √âlise Vincent published on October 27, 2009 in Le Monde The majority of the experts described the accused as \\"incurable\\", because of his \\"habitual, deeply rooted pedophilic conduct\\".\\"Francis Evrard is incurable, according to some experts\\" Article published on October 30, 2009 in L'Express The lead prosecutor of Douai, Luc Fr√©miot, who was in charge of the case, requested life imprisonment, but Evrard was instead sentenced to 30 years imprisonment, including a 20-year mandatory prison sentence.\\"Francis Evrard will not appeal\\" Article by Delphine Tonnerre published on September 2, 2010 in Nord √âclair The trial was broadcast on France 2, on October 4, 2010, which received special permission to film. This case helped fuel the debate on recidivism, monitoring and hormonal treatment of sex offenders in France.\\"The Francis Evrard case relaunched the debate on sexual recidivism\\" Article published on October 26, 2009 in La D√©p√™che du Midi The family of Enis K. announced in 2010 that they intended to sue the state, for failing to take proper care of the pedophile.\\"The family of Enis, kidnapped in 2007 by Evrard, attack the State\\" Article published on September 3, 2010 in 20 minutes  Documentaries  * \\"Francis Evrard, the kidnapping of little Enis\\", in \\"Enter the Accused\\", presented by Fr√©d√©rique Lantieri on October 6, 2013 on France 2. * \\"Case of little Enis: kidnappy by a chronic offender\\" (first report) in \\"Chronques criminelles\\" on April 19 and 26, May 4, September 20 and 27, 2014, on NT1. * \\"The Evrard case: 5 days to judge\\" in \\"Duty of Investigation\\" broadcast on June 22, 2011, on La Une (RTBF). * \\"Race against death?\\" (first report) in \\"...in the North\\" on January 12, 19 and 27, and May 31, 2016, in \\"Crimes\\", on NRJ 12.

In Asian art a lotus throne, sometimes lotus platform, is a stylized lotus flower used as the seat or base for a figure. It is the normal pedestal for divine figures in Buddhist art and Hindu art, and often seen in Jain art.Pal, 39 Originating in Indian art, it followed Indian religions to East Asia in particular. The precise form varies, but is intended to represent the opening flower of Nelumbo nucifera, the Indian lotus; in some Buddhist legends the baby Buddha emerged from a lotus flower. The Indian lotus is an aquatic plant similar to a water lily, though not actually any close relation. Among other unusual characteristics, nelumbo nucifera has particular properties of repelling water, known as the lotus effect or ultrahydrophobicity. Among other symbolic meanings, it rises above the water environment it lives in, and is not contaminated by it, so providing a model for Buddhists.Pal, 39‚Äì42; Coomaraswamy, 21; Krishan & Tadikonda, 65; Rodrigues According to the Pali Canon, the Buddha himself began this often- repeated metaphor, in the A·πÖguttara NikƒÅya, saying that the lotus flower raises from the muddy water unstained, as he raises from this world, free from the defilements taught in the sutra.Pal, 39‚Äì40; Coomaraswamy, 21; the texts are: AN 10.81, \\"BƒÅhuna sutta·πÉ\\"; AN 4.36, \\"Do·πáa sutta·πÉ\\". In Sanskrit the throne is called either a padmƒÅsana (, , asana is the name for a seated position), which is also the name for the Lotus position in meditation and yoga, or padmapitha,Jansen, 18 padma meaning lotus and pitha a base or plinth.Pal, 45 History The earliest of the Vedas, the Rigveda, describes the other gods watching the birth of Agni, the god of fire, seated on lotus flowers; also the birth of Vasishtha.Coomaraswamy, 18‚Äì19; Pal, 40 In Hindu myth, the major deity Brahma emerged from a lotus growing from the navel of Vishnu.Pal, 40 Flower of nelumbo nucifera, the Indian lotus; its colour range is from white to red In art the form is first seen as a base for rare early images of Laxmi from the 2nd century BCE; many or most of these may have a Buddhist context.Coomaraswamy, 22; Krishan & Tadikonda, 78, note 89 However it first becomes common with seated Buddha figures in the Greco-Buddhist art of Gandhara around the late 2nd or the 3rd century CE.Moore & Klein, 149; Krishan & Tadikonda, 65 It may have reached the Deccan as early as the end of the 2nd century.Pal, 41; Walser, 80‚Äì87 At some point, probably around 200, and before his death in about 250, the Buddhist thinker Nagarjuna exhorted an unknown Buddhist monarch, very probably in the Deccan, to: > ... Please construct from all precious substances Images of Buddha with fine > proportions Well designed and sitting on lotuses ...Walser, 80, 86‚Äì87 for > the date ‚Äì suggesting this iconography was current by then. It is not clear from the language whether sculptures or paintings, or both, were meant.Walser, 81‚Äì83 In early Buddhist art it may be intended to specifically depict the second of the Twin Miracles in the legend of the Buddha's life. In some accounts of this, when engaged in a contest with sorcerers, the Buddha multiplied himself into other bodies, which sat or stood on lotus flowers.Krishan & Tadikonda, 67 It became used for other Buddhist figures, and adopted for other Hindu deities than Laxmi. Form The throne in art evolved to be rather distant from the actual plant. In historic sculpture there is very often a clear dividing line about halfway up; this type is called a \\"double-lotus\\" (vishvapadma) pedestal or throne.Lerner & Kossak, Nos. 68, 84, 88, 89, 92, 94, 97, 101 (for vishvapadma), 110, 111, 113 etc. Most often petal shapes both rise and fall from the dividing line, but sometimes the upper part of the throne represents the prominent flat-topped seed head as a base for the figure, perhaps with circles for the holes holding the seeds, as in maturing lotus heads.Lerner & Kossak, Nos. 133, 139, 140; HƒÅ·πá·∏çƒÅ, Omacanda, Gaddi Land in Chamba: Its History, Art & Culture : New Light on the Early Wooden Temples, 78‚Äì79, 2005, Indus Publishing, , 9788173871740, google books The bingdi lotus is a particular strain with two back-to-back flowers on each stem, but it is not clear if this influenced the form in art. In East Asian paintings, and also modern Hindu paintings, the lotus throne is often depicted more realistically in terms of its shape (though obviously not its size).

Sanchi, Stupa 3 gateway, probably 1st century CE The vast majority of lotus thrones just depict an isolated flower, or a group of flowers under different figures. But some images depict more of the plant. A famous relief of Gaja-Laxmi in Cave 16 at Ellora shows a pond of lotus leaves and budding flowers as a vertical panel below the throne.Michell, 362 Burmese wood and lacquer Buddha, 11th century Other compositions show stalks, buds and flowers reaching up beside a main figure.Lerner & Kossak, Nos. 116, 117, 119 These may terminate in a flower held by the main figure,Pal, 39 especially if it is Avalokitesvara or from the 5th or 6th century Vishnu, (both also having the epithet Padmapani, \\"lotus holder\\"),Pal, 41 or in another lotus throne behind the hand, if it is outstretched in a mudra. Alternatively, stalks may climb up to support lotus thrones underneath minor, smaller, figures, as in the early terracotta plaque illustrated above, where stalks rise at the side to support the elephants lustrating Gaja-Laxmi. This is seen in the 1st century BCE terracotta plaque illustrated above.Pal, 40 The Sanchi stone relief illustrated here shows a similar composition with Queen Maya, mother of the Buddha. Above or below the water, the stems may be supported by small naga figures.Coomaraswamy, 53 The lotus plant in lotus thrones is often imagined as growing out of the cosmic ocean, and a few images represent the plant below the water level, with a stem also representing the world axis.Coomaraswamy, 20, 53‚Äì55 Notes References *Coomaraswamy, Ananda, Elements of Buddhist Iconography, Harvard University Press, 1935, online text *Jansen, Eva Rudy, The Book of Hindu Imagery: The Gods and their Symbols, 1993, Binkey Kok Publications, , 9789074597074, google books *Krishan, Yuvrajmm, Tadikonda, Kalpana K., The Buddha Image: Its Origin and Development, 1996, Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan, , 9788121505659, google books *Lerner, Martin and Kossak, Steven, The Lotus Transcendent: Indian and Southeast Asian Art from the Samuel Eilenberg Collection, 1991, Metropolitan Museum of Art (New York, N.Y.), , 9780870996139, google books *Michell, George (1990), The Penguin Guide to the Monuments of India, Volume 1: Buddhist, Jain, Hindu, 1990, Penguin Books, *Moore, Albert C., Klein, Charlotte, Iconography of Religions: An Introduction, 1977, Chris Robertson, , 9780800604882, google books *Pal, Pratapaditya, Indian Sculpture: Circa 500 B.C.-A.D. 700, Volume 1 of Indian Sculpture: A Catalogue of the Los Angeles County Museum of Art Collection, 1986, Los Angeles County Museum of Art/University of California Press, , 9780520059917, google books *Rodrigues, H, \\"The Sacred Lotus Symbol\\", Mahavidya, 2016 *Walser, Joseph, Nagarjuna in Context: Mahayana Buddhism and Early Indian Culture, 2005, Columbia University Press, , 9780231506236, google books Category:Buddhist iconography Category:Hindu iconography Category:Indian art Category:Jain iconography ","title":"Lotus throne"},{"id":"62415586","text":"Janbolat Mamai () (born 15 June 1988) is a Kazakh journalist, political activist, leader of Democratic Party of Kazakhstan, editor of the Tribuna newspaper.

The main topic of the newspaper was the observance of the rights and freedoms of the citizens of Kazakhstan. Thus, the newspaper supported Max Bokaev and Talgat Ayan, human rights activists and civic activists who were sentenced to 5 years in prison for participating in a peaceful protest. Over the period of its existence, the publication has been repeatedly subjected to lawsuits against its publications. Several times, Tribuna was unable to pay for lawsuits, closed and then came out under a different name, retaining its direction. =Arrest and trial= On 10 February 2017, in Almaty, at the editorial office of the independent newspaper Tribuna, in the apartments and relatives of Mamai, Imanbai, the accountant of the newspaper, and the founder of the newspaper publishing company, searches were conducted in the house of politician Tulegen Zhukeyev as a part of investigative actions carried out by the National Anti-Corruption Bureau regarding the alleged theft of money at BTA Bank. Mamai was suspected of committing a criminal offense, however, he denied his guilt and on 11 February, made a statement that he considers his persecution to be politically motivated. In the late evening of 11 February, investigating judge Baidauletova announced the decision to arrest Mamai for two months for the period of the investigation, and on 20 February, the court of appeal of the civil panel of the Almaty city court upheld this decision.

It is a mark that indicates the acetylation at the 16th lysine residue of the histone H4 protein. H4K16ac is unusual in that it has both transcriptional activation AND repression activities. The loss of H4K20me3 along with a reduction of H4K16ac is a strong indicator of cancer.  Lysine acetylation and deacetylation  Lysine acetylation Proteins are typically acetylated on lysine residues and this reaction relies on acetyl-coenzyme A as the acetyl group donor. In histone acetylation and deacetylation, histone proteins are acetylated and deacetylated on lysine residues in the N-terminal tail as part of gene regulation. Typically, these reactions are catalyzed by enzymes with histone acetyltransferase (HAT) or histone deacetylase (HDAC) activity, although HATs and HDACs can modify the acetylation status of non-histone proteins as well. The regulation of transcription factors, effector proteins, molecular chaperones, and cytoskeletal proteins by acetylation and deacetylation is a significant post-translational regulatory mechanism These regulatory mechanisms are analogous to phosphorylation and dephosphorylation by the action of kinases and phosphatases. Not only can the acetylation state of a protein modify its activity but there has been recent suggestion that this post-translational modification may also crosstalk with phosphorylation, methylation, ubiquitination, sumoylation, and others for dynamic control of cellular signaling. In the field of epigenetics, histone acetylation (and deacetylation) have been shown to be important mechanisms in the regulation of gene transcription. Histones, however, are not the only proteins regulated by posttranslational acetylation. Nomenclature H4K16ac indicates acetylation of lysine 16 on histone H4 protein subunit: {  style=\\"text- align:center\\" -  Abbr.  Meaning -  H4  H4 family of histones -  K  standard abbreviation for lysine -  16  position of amino acid residue (counting from N-terminus) -  ac  acetyl group - } Histone modifications The genomic DNA of eukaryotic cells is wrapped around special protein molecules known as histones. The complexes formed by the looping of the DNA are known as chromatin. The basic structural unit of chromatin is the nucleosome: this consists of the core octamer of histones (H2A, H2B, H3 and H4) as well as a linker histone and about 180 base pairs of DNA. These core histones are rich in lysine and arginine residues. The carboxyl (C) terminal end of these histones contribute to histone-histone interactions, as well as histone-DNA interactions. The amino (N) terminal charged tails are the site of the post-translational modifications, such as the one seen in H3K36me3. Epigenetic implications The post-translational modification of histone tails by either histone modifying complexes or chromatin remodeling complexes are interpreted by the cell and lead to complex, combinatorial transcriptional output. It is thought that a histone code dictates the expression of genes by a complex interaction between the histones in a particular region. The current understanding and interpretation of histones comes from two large scale projects: ENCODE and the Epigenomic roadmap. The purpose of the epigenomic study was to investigate epigenetic changes across the entire genome. This led to chromatin states which define genomic regions by grouping the interactions of different proteins and/or histone modifications together. Chromatin states were investigated in Drosophila cells by looking at the binding location of proteins in the genome. Use of ChIP-sequencing revealed regions in the genome characterised by different banding. Different developmental stages were profiled in Drosophila as well, an emphasis was placed on histone modification relevance. A look in to the data obtained led to the definition of chromatin states based on histone modifications. The human genome was annotated with chromatin states. These annotated states can be used as new ways to annotate a genome independently of the underlying genome sequence. This independence from the DNA sequence enforces the epigenetic nature of histone modifications. Chromatin states are also useful in identifying regulatory elements that have no defined sequence, such as enhancers. This additional level of annotation allows for a deeper understanding of cell specific gene regulation. Importance Secondly, it can block the function of chromatin remodelers. Thirdly, it neutralizes the positive charge on lysines. Acetylation of histone H4 on lysine 16 (H4K16Ac) is especially important for chromatin structure and function in a variety of eukaryotes and is catalyzed by specific histone lysine acetyltransferases (HATs). H4K16 is particularly interesting because this is the only acetylatable site of the H4 N-terminal tail, and can influence the formation of a compact higher-order chromatin structure. Hypoacetylation of H4K16 appears to cause delayed recruitment of DNA repair proteins to sites of DNA damage in a mouse model of the premature aging, such as Hutchinson‚ÄìGilford progeria syndrome. H4K16Ac also has roles in transcriptional activation and the maintenance of euchromatin. Activation and repression H4K16ac is odd in that it is associated with both transcriptional activation and repression. The bromodomain of TIP5, part of NoRC, binds to H4K16ac and then the NoRC complex silences rDNA with HATs and DNMTs. There is also a reduction in the levels of H3K56ac during aging and an increase in the levels of H4K16ac. Increased H4K16ac in old yeast cells is associated with the decline in levels of the HDAC Sir2, which can increase the life span when overexpressed. Cancer marker The loss of the repressive H4K20me3 mark defines cancer along with a reduction of activating H4K16ac mark. It is not clear how the loss of a repressive and an activating mark is an indicator of cancer. It is not clear exactly how but this reduction happens at repetitive sequences along with general reduced DNA methylation.. Methods The histone mark acetylation can be detected in a variety of ways: 1\\\\. Chromatin Immunoprecipitation Sequencing (ChIP-sequencing) measures the amount of DNA enrichment once bound to a targeted protein and immunoprecipitated. It results in good optimization and is used in vivo to reveal DNA-protein binding occurring in cells. ChIP-Seq can be used to identify and quantify various DNA fragments for different histone modifications along a genomic region. 2\\\\. Micrococcal Nuclease sequencing (MNase-seq) is used to investigate regions that are bound by well positioned nucleosomes. Use of the micrococcal nuclease enzyme is employed to identify nucleosome positioning. Well positioned nucleosomes are seen to have enrichment of sequences. 3\\\\.

Despite continuous affirmations of the Vietnamese government to develop TCOB progress has stalled due to tensions over disputes in the South China Sea and border and naval clashes between 1979 and 1991. Sentiment among Vietnamese people to Chinese investment is generally positive. There is even sensitivity by the Vietnamese government to blending together the profiles of the TCOP and Belt and Road Initiative because of public perception.

(Georgia State Route 83) and Fairplay Rd. in Bostwick. The oldest historic resource is the Bostwick Cemetery, established around 1859. It was deemed significant partly as it is a \\"good example of a rural town in Georgia which developed from the cultivation and processing of cotton. The district is significant in the areas of agriculture and industry for its excellent collection of industrial buildings associated with the processing of cotton as well as for the remaining cotton fields located within the district. John Bostwick, Sr. (1859-1929), considered the founder of the town, started Bostwick Supply Company in 1892. In 1901, he started the Bostwick Manufacturing Company that consisted of a cottonseed oil mill and other buildings (cotton gin, granary, grist mill, warehouse, guano/fertilizer building) associated with the manufacturing of goods from cotton. (All these buildings still remain.) Historically, the region surrounding the small town of Bostwick was primarily planted in cotton. Currently, much of this land has been planted with other crops, such as pine trees and peanuts, or left open to be used as pasture land for grazing by cattle. The fields planted in cotton within the district still convey the historic significant pattern in Georgia of agricultural fields abutting the town development.\\" It was deemed significant also for its architecture, specifically \\"for its excellent examples of historic residences, commercial, and community landmark buildings representing architectural types and styles popular in Georgia from the late 19th century into the early 20th century. The significant architectural types include Georgian cottage, gabled ell cottage, Queen Anne cottage, hall-parlor cottage, and bungalow. The significant architectural styles include Colonial Revival, Neoclassical Revival, Craftsman, and Folk Victorian. The John Bostwick, Sr. House, built in 1902, is an excellent representative example of a Georgian House, a two-story house with a central hallway on each floor with two rooms on either side, representing the Neoclassical Revival style. The character-defining features of the house include a full-height entry porch with lower full-width porch, truncated hipped roof, and wide cornice band. The historic stores are good examples of attached and freestanding buildings representing the Folk Victorian style.

Samant played an important role in the covert operation called Naval Commando Operation X, which was instituted in 1971 during the Bangladesh Liberation War. Samant had also served as the first commanding officer of the submarine INS Karanj after being appointed to that post in 1969. After the 1971 war ended, he became the first Chief of Naval Staff of the newly-created Bangladesh Navy.  Early life  Samant was born in 1930. His domicile was Pune, Maharashtra.  Career  In 1969, Samant was appointed by the Indian Navy as the commissioning Commanding Officer of the submarine INS Karanj. In 1971, he became an officer attached to the Eastern Naval Command of the Indian Navy. During this tenure, his involvement in covert operations started. In April 1971, before the Indo-Pakistani War of 1971 started, the Naval Commando Operations (X) began training more than 400 Bengali college students and eight submariners as marine-warfare soldiers to carry out covert operations inside the erstwhile East Pakistan. The soldiers trained to swim with limpet mines and use them to destroy Pakistani shipping. Samant was involved in this training process, being the Staff Officer, G1 of the Naval Commando Operations (X).  Bangladesh Liberation War of 1971  = Operation X = Operation X was a covert operation run by the Indian Navy during the Bangladesh Liberation War of 1971. It involved attacking the vulnerable maritime shipping associated with East Pakistan to cutoff logistics and supplies to Pakistani forces in East Pakistan, thereby easing the advance of the Indian Army. The operation involved the marine-warfare soldiers trained by Samant and his colleagues preceding the War. Only three Naval officers and the Indian Prime Minister had the full knowledge of the operation. Commander Samant (who later became a Captain) was one of them and was responsible for the field execution of Operation X. The other two officers were Admiral SM Nanda, then chief of the Indian Navy, and Captain MK Roy, then director of India's Naval Intelligence. Damage or complete destruction was inflicted on about 60,000 tonnes of shipping during Operation Jackpot, which was executed by 176 soldiers under the leadership of Samant. Overall, the operation resulted in around 100,000 tonnes of logistical and supply shipping being sunk or damaged; the operation emerged as the largest covert maritime operation in history, being bigger than those which were undertaken during the Vietnam War and World War II. = Other engagements = Captain Samant led an attack involving three gunboats on Pakistani ships on the Pussur River during the period between 7‚Äì10 December 1971. Two of the boats were lost to friendly fire from the Indian Air Force. Samant rescued survivors and continued the attack.  First Chief of Bangladesh Navy  Samant subsequently became the first Chief of Naval Staff of the newly created Bangladesh Navy and was awarded the 'Friend of Liberation war' honour. He remained chief till early 1972 when he was succeeded by Nurul Huq. Later life and death Samant retired on 22 July 1974. He died after a cardiac arrest at the age of 89 on 20 March 2019 at 11.53 AM in the Arogya Nidhi Hospital located in the suburbs of Mumbai. He was accorded a military funeral.

Early life Emin was born on 15 May 1921 to a Crimean Tatar peasant family in Albat. When he was only seven years old his father died, after which he worked as a shepard on a collective farm to help his mother. After completing secondary school in Biyuk-Ozenbash he had begun writing for the Udarnik Newspaper, and later for the newspaper \\"Krasny Krym\\". World War II After the start of the German invasion of the Soviet Union, Emin volunteered for the Army and was deployed to Odessa, where he fought in the defense of the city until he was evacuated to Sevastopol. His experience during the siege of Sevastopol later influenced much of his work. During the later days of the defense of the city he was wounded and taken to a hospital, and after recovering he was sent to Tuapse, Adgeya. After being wounded multiple times in the Battle for the Caucasus he was declared unfit for military service. However, he managed to get permission to be sent to Crimea as a partisan, where he worked with other Crimean Tatar leaders and writers including Jebbar Akimov, Refat Mustafayev, and Shamil Aladin. After German troops were expelled from Crimea in April 1944 he continued to write for a Crimean newspaper until on 18 May 1944 he was deported from Crimea because of his Crimean Tatar ethnicity and deemed a \\"traitor\\" because of it, despite his many military awards from the war. Exile Upon arrival in Bekabad he worked in the construction of the Farhad hydroelectric station, where he organized a theater ensemble at the construction site. He later attended Central Asia University. Despite living under strict conditions and harsh penalties for defying the Soviet government, he participated in the Crimean Tatar Civil Rights Movement from his early days in exile, meeting in secret with other prominent Crimean Tatars, where they read poetry mourning the loss of their beloved Crimea and founding the National Movement of Crimean Tatars. After working as a cinema director he became an editor at the fiction publisher in Tashkent, where he worked from 1967 to 1972. His works included poems and short stories such as ¬´–ë–µ—è–∑ —á–µ—á–µ–∫–ª–µ—Ä¬ª, ¬´–ê—Ç–µ—à–ª–∏ –∫—É–Ω—å–ª–µ—Ä¬ª, ¬´–ö–æ–∑—å–ª–µ—Ä–∏–Ω–¥–µ –∫–µ–¥–µ—Ä —Å–µ–∑–¥–∏–º¬ª, ¬´–ë—É–ª—å–±—É–ª—å–Ω–∏–Ω—ä —ç–ª—è–∫ –æ–ª—É–≤—ã¬ª, ¬´–û –∫—É–∑—å —á–µ—á–µ–∫–ª–µ—Ä–∏–Ω–∏ —Å–µ–≤–µ—Ä —ç–¥–∏¬ª, and ¬´–•–∞—Ç—ã—Ä–ª–∞–≤¬ª. Having become a member of the Union of Writers of the USSR in 1967, he was admitted to the Union of Journalists of the USSR in 1968. He continued to write about Crimea in both Russian and Crimean Tatar, but his participation in the Crimean Tatar movement led to him having to leave Central Asia. He resettled in Novorossiysk, which was closer to Crimea, but due to the lack of a sizable Crimean Tatar population, his ability to participate in the Crimean Tatar movement was somewhat stifiled and it was harder to get his writings in Crimean Tatar published, since almost nobody in Novorossiysk was fluent in the language. For the next few years most of his writing was in Russian. He later continued his work with the Crimean Tatar movement, becoming one of the organizers for the July 1987 Moscow picket for the right of return, where he gave a speech. He later participated in the march from Taman to Simferopol, resulting in him being condemned by name in the newspaper Pravda Vostoka for his role in organizing the protest despite his membership in the Union of Writers of the USSR. After the publication of the newspaper, he and other participants in the march faced intense persecution for their role in it. Despite ongoing persecution of activists in the Crimean Tatar movement, he continued to support the cause; he eventually got his works published in Crimea in the late 1990s, but he lived in Novorossiysk for the remainder of his life. After he died on 21 March 2004 he was buried there, and in 2014 a monument in his hometown of Albat was erected in his memory. His poetry mouring the loss of his beloved Crimea remain popular today.

This was MLW's first event since Reloaded in 2004 thus marking the return of MLW. Nine professional wrestling matches were contested at the event. In the main event, Shane Strickland defeated Ricochet. In other prominent matches on the card, MVP defeated Sami Callihan and Tom Lawlor defeated Jeff Cobb. Although the event drew a crowd of only 200 people due to taking place in a small arena, it was an instant success as it was well received by critics and audiences throughout the world and due to its access worldwide via MLW.tv service, it led to MLW making its full-time return as a regular promotion as it continued to run more events. Production Background Major League Wrestling operated as a professional wrestling promotion between 2002 and 2004. In February 2004, just a month after holding its Reloaded event, MLW owner Court Bauer closed the promotion due to financial problems. On July 10, 2017, thirteen years after the closure of MLW, Sports Illustrated broke the news that MLW would be returning to produce a one-off event called \\"One Shot\\" on October 5 at the Gilt Nightclub in Orlando, Florida. MLW.com confirmed the news on the same day. On August 7, MLW launched a new over-the-top service MLW.tv and it was announced that One Shot would be streamed on the platform to be accessible for audiences worldwide. It was also confirmed that longtime hockey commentator Rich Bocchini as well as longtime World Championship Wrestling famous play-by-play announcer Tony Schiavone would provide commentary for One Shot, marking Schiavone's return to professional wrestling since WCW's closure in 2001. On October 2, Totino's became the official sponsor for One Shot. Storylines The card consisted of matches that resulted from scripted storylines, where wrestlers portrayed villains, heroes, or less distinguishable characters in scripted events that built tension and culminated in a wrestling match or series of matches, with results predetermined by MLW's writers. Ricochet was the first wrestler exclusively signed for One Shot and competed against Shane Strickland in the main event. On July 21, 2017, MLW announced that Ricochet would be the first wrestler signed to compete at One Shot. On July 24, MLW announced that his opponent would be Shane Strickland and the two would compete in the main event of One Shot, thus it also being the first match to be announced for the event. On July 31, MLW announced that Sami Callihan would be making his MLW debut at One Shot. On August 13, Miami Herald broke the news that former WWE and New Japan Pro-Wrestling star Montel Vontavious Porter would make his MLW debut as Callihan's opponent at One Shot. On August 17, Sporting News reported that Jeff Cobb would be making his MLW debut at One Shot. On August 28, Cageside Seats reported that Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC) mixed martial artist Tom Lawlor would make his return to professional wrestling and make his MLW debut as Cobb's opponent at the event. On September 5, MLW.com announced that Maxwell Jacob Friedman would compete at One Shot, with Jimmy Yuta named as his opponent on September 21. On September 7, MLW owner Court Bauer revealed on the Steve Austin Show Unleashed podcast hosted by Stone Cold Steve Austin, that Santana Garrett would be competing on One Shot. Mia Yim was named her opponent on September 21, thus setting up the only women's match at the event. On September 12, MLW.com announced that Jason Cade would be competing at One Shot. Darby Allin was named his opponent on September 25. On September 19, MLW.com announced that Barrington Hughes would compete at One Shot, billing him as the first super heavyweight to compete in MLW. On September 22, Martin Stone was also announced to be competing at the event. The final three names to compete at One Shot were announced to be Mike Parrow, Rhett Giddins and Seth Petruzelli. A tag team match was set up for One Shot pitting Giddins and Petruzelli against Parrow and Saieve Al Sabah. Event Preliminary matches The event opened with a match between Tama Tonga and Martin Stone. Tonga executed a Gun Stun for the win. Next, Rhett Giddins and Seth Petruzelli took on Parrow and Saieve Al Sabah in a tag team match. Petruzelli made Al Sabah submit to a cross armbreaker for the win. After the match, Parrow powerbombed Sabah. Next, Jimmy Yuta took on Maxwell Jacob Friedman. Near the end of the match, MJF faked a jaw injury and distracted the referee as he kicked Yuta in the groin and pinned him with a roll-up for the win. Shane Strickland defeated Ricochet in the main event of One Shot. Next, Barrington Hughes took on Markos Espada. Hughes immediately executed a Purple Crush on Espada and pinned him for the quick win. In the following match, Darby Allin took on Jason Cade. Allin raised his knees up to block a frog splash by Cade and then applied a figure four leglock on Cade and pinned him for the win. Next, the only women's match took place at the event pitting Santana Garrett against Mia Yim. Garrett nailed a Shining Star Press to Yim for the win. Later, Tom Lawlor took on Jeff Cobb. After a back and forth match, Lawlor raked Cobb in the eyes and then pinned him with a sunset flip for the win. Lawlor was interviewed after the match, during which he insulted the crowd for not cheering for him and challenged fellow mixed martial artist Matt Riddle to a match for MLW's next event Never Say Never. The penultimate match of the event saw MVP take on Sami Callihan. After a back and forth match, MVP nailed a fisherman suplex to Callihan for the win. Main event match The main event pitted Shane Strickland against Ricochet. Strickland blocked a kick by Ricochet and applied a cross armbreaker to force him to submit to the hold. Reception Jason Powell of Pro Wrestling Dot Net considered One Shot to be \\"a fun show\\". According to him \\"the first half of the night felt missable for the most part, but that half of the show was brief and they did introduce some personalities who may play bigger roles going forward.\\" He praised the main event match considering it \\"a strong close to the show\\". He praised the Tonga- Stone match, considering it to be \\"a nice opening match\\" and considered the MVP-Callihan to be \\"A fun hardcore brawl. It stood out nicely on a show filled with mostly straight forward wrestling and was well received by the live crowd.\\" He also appreciated MJF-Yuta, Allin-Cade and the women's match while criticizing the Barrington Hughes match as well as Lawlor-Cobb match. Larry Csonka of 411Mania rated the event 5.5 as he stated \\"MLW did a great job with the production of the show. The video quality was excellent, it was largely well shot and the promos (especially for Strickland vs. Ricochet) were tremendous.\\" He further wrote \\"The first portion of the show wasn‚Äôt very good at all, and it certainly picked up and has a great main event, but as an overall show, it wasn‚Äôt very good.\\" Sean Radican of Pro Wrestling Torch rated the event 7.0 as he stated \\"there wasn‚Äôt much thrilling on the undercard, but it closed with a great main event between Shane Strickland and Ricochet\\". According to him \\"Mia Yim vs. Santana Garrett was very good on the undercard, as was (Tom) Lawler vs. (Jeff) Cobb. They did a good job of giving Lawler a big win over Cobb. Lawler did a good job playing the heel, but he needs to do more to get the crowd against him on the mic.\\" He gave praise to the final two matches on the card by writing \\"The show ended on a high note with two really good matches. The crowd wasn‚Äôt super hot all night, but they were good for Sami Callihan vs. MVP and Shane Strickland vs. Ricochet. Strickland vs. Ricochet is worth going out of your way to see. They had a very mature match. They paced it well and told a good story with Strickland working over Ricochet‚Äôs arm throughout the match before submitting him in the end.\\" Aftermath One Shot was originally intended to be a one-off event but the success of the event led MLW to make its full-time return as a regular touring promotion as it announced its next supercard called Never Say Never for December 7. Matt Riddle responded to Tom Lawlor's challenge for a match via Twitter and signed a contract with MLW, thus accepting Lawlor's challenge for a match at Never Say Never. Parrow's attack on Saieve Al Sabah after losing their tag team match at One Shot would lead to a match between the two at Never Say Never. Shane Strickland and Sami Callihan were mysteriously attacked by two assailants outside Gilt Nightclub after One Shot. On October 27, an exclusive video was posted on MLW.com in which Darby Allin was revealed as one of the attackers. Jimmy Havoc was later revealed to be the second attacker. The duo of Havoc and Allin challenged Strickland to a hardcore tag team match at Never Say Never, which Strickland accepted and chose John Hennigan as his partner.

It is a member of the genus Macluravirus (recognized under the family Potyviridae by ICTV in 1988), and is transmitted through aphids (P. caladii) and infected rhizomes, the former in a non- persistent manner. Host and symptoms Green cardamom is one of the world's very ancient spices. Known as the ‚Äúqueen of spices‚Äù, because of their aroma and flavor, it is one of the most exotic and highly priced spices. It is the world's third most expensive spice after vanilla and saffron. Although India is the top producer of the spice, producing 31.1% of the world's cardamom followed by Guatemala and Nepal, Guatemala is the top exporter (exporting 43.6% of the world's cardamom) followed by Nepal and India. Cardamom suffers from several oomycetous, fungal, viral, nematode-induced diseases and pests that affect the productivity and the industry as a whole. Among them, \\"mosaic disease\\" or \\"katte disease\\" is one of the major diseases in cardamom that has resulted in a reduction in its production. The virus was reported at first in southern India in the 1900s by Mollison and it has also highly affected Guatemala and Sri Lanka. The disease is widely distributed among cardamom- cultivating regions. The cardamom production industry in some parts of Guatemala started showing symptoms of the disease, after which all nearby plantations of the southern-pacific coastal region (producing 60% of the total cardamom) were infected with the disease. Recent surveys conducted in cardamom-producing areas of India for CdMV have revealed its prevalence in most of the cardamom plantations in Karnataka. It has been reported that based on the time and stage of infection, there is a variation in yield loss due to CdMV. It has been reported that early infection at a young stage leads to almost 100%, whereas higher crop loss ranges from 38 to 68.7% from first to the third year for monocultured cardamom, leading to declining of the infected plants occurring within 3 to 5 years (the economic cycle of a healthy cardamom plant starts from the third year and can last up to 8‚Äì10 years). Chemical management practices, breeding for resistance and cross-protection show limited success against CdMV. Early detection of the virus, use of virus-free seedlings, and eradication of the vector and infected clumps are a few methods of CdMV disease management. Causal agent and its genome characterization Virions of the genus Macluravirus are non-enveloped, flexuous, and filamentous, measuring 650-660 nm lengthwise with a 10-12 nm diameter and pinwheel-type inclusion bodies relating it to the family of potyviruses. The CdMV genomes are single-stranded linear positive-sense RNA as reported by Jacob and Usha (2001). As a result of amplification, cloning, sequencing and gene expression, it can be reported that CdMV contains ~8.5kb of genomes, presence coding regions for partial Cytoplasmic Inclusion, CdMV encoded proteins: complete Nuclear Inclusion b (NIb) gene in the genome which is the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), Nuclear Inclusion a (NIa) Protease (Nia 1 protease) and a complete 6K2 genome-linked viral protein. The coat protein of potyvirus is a suitable carrier to display the epitopes of the pathogens. The sequencing of coat proteins and 3‚Äô UTR regions of different isolated strains of CdMV from different cardamom-growing geographical regions in India revealed that there are three different CdMV strains causing disease on the basis of severity of symptoms on young and matured leaves, transmission efficiency, effect on plant height and leaf area. The strains varied in the N-terminal region of coat protein in their sequence. Host range There is a long association between the infection of Macluravirus and spice crops. They have a narrow host range infecting families Amaranthaceae, Asteraceae, Iridaceae, Dioscoreaceae, Amaryllidaceae, Moraceae, Aizoaceae, Ranunculaceae and Zingiberaceae. For CdMV, the natural hosts are small cardamom (Elettaria cardamomum) along with their other hosts that belong to the family Zingiberaceae-Amomum connecarpum, A. invollucraltum, A. microstephanum, A. muricatum, A. pterocarpum, A. subulatum, Alpinia neutans, Alpinia mutica, Curcuma neilgherrensis, Hedychium flavescens, Zingiber cernuum, and Maranta arundinacea of family Marantaceae Symptoms The expression of symptoms associated with the disease varies according to the varieties grown, growing region and strain variations; these include mild to severe mosaic, overall chlorosis, chlorotic flecks and necrotic and ring spots. The virus infection is systemic in nature that gradually spreads to all tillers in a clump and can infect plants of all stages. The first visible symptom of the disease is seen on the youngest leaves of the affected tiller that appear as spindle shaped slender chlorotic flecks (2‚Äì5 mm in length). The flecks later develop into pale green discontinuous stripes that run parallel to the vein form the midrib to leaf margin. The mosaic symptoms are masked as the leaves mature. The next emerging leaves of the infected plant will show the characteristic mosaic symptoms over the entire lamina. The mosaic type mottling is often seen on the leaf sheaths and young shoots. The mature leaves formed before infection do not develop symptoms. As the disease advances, the size of the leaves eventually creating a negative effect in the plant's vigor and causing stunting of the clump with a few slender tillers and shorter panicles. The plants infected by mosaic or Katte can survive for many years and act as the source of inoculum. Virus Transmission and Spread The virus is transmitted through the aphid vector Pentalonia caladii (formerly P. nigronervosa f. caladii). They are also transmitted by infected rhizomes, infected clones, seedlings raised in the vicinity of infected plantations, volunteer plants, and a few of the infected zingiberacae.Naidu, R., & Venugopal, M. N. (2007). Epidemiology of'Katte'virus disease of small cardamom-II: Foci of primary disease entry, patterns and gradients of disease entry and spread. Along with P. caladii, various other species of aphid have been reported to transmit the virus. The virus can be transmitted by both the nymphal and the adult stages, but efficiency increases with age of the vector; alate and apterous form are the most efficient. In plantations, aphids are prevalent throughout the year, although a decline occurs during monsoon season. The migrating population was found to be the maximum during January‚ÄìFebruary, while the populations of alate vectors were found higher during November to May. The primary spread in the plantation occurs due to active viruliferous alate forms of the vector at random with a radius of 400‚Äì600 m from the virus source. The secondary spread is internal with low rate of spread and as the apterate adults become active, there comes a centrifugal influx of the primary source. The secondary spread was found to be gradient within 40m radius from the initial source in India while in Guatemala, the rate of disease spread was very fast (83% within 6 months of plantation). In the field, CdMV incubated from 20 to 114 days at different months; their expression is influenced by growth of the plants. When the plants are in active phase of growth (May‚ÄìNovember) the symptoms start expressing and develop on young seedlings (3-4 leaves stage) within 15‚Äì20 days of incubation, while, the expression is slowed due to prolonged incubation period (December ‚Äì March) and it expressed in the adults only after 30‚Äì40 days of incubation during active times (90‚Äì120 days during winter months). Although the aphid population increased during November to May in the field and decreased during the monsoon, they were found throughout the year. Control / management For successful management of any disease, an integrated disease management strategy needs to be developed. The following are some disease management strategies for CdMV: *Use of healthy plant material for further cultivation *Early detection using the methods mentioned above and accurate identification of the virus involved. *Regular monitoring, tracing out, rouging and elimination of infected clumps of cardamom, remnants of infected plants. *Use of virus free seedlings for large scale multiplication and planting. *The nurseries where the nucleus planting materials are grown should be kept in isolated locations and it should be obtained from disease-free plants. *Monitoring of the collateral hosts that may serve as the breeding sites of the vectors. *For aphids transmitting virus in non- or semi- persistent manner, chemical control measures are not considered effective for managing the viral disease. However, spraying recommended dose of insecticides after eliminating the infected hosts and also oil spraying the plants does increase the efficiency in controlling the vector. *The vector can also be controlled by spreading their predators or entomopathogens like Beauveria bassiana, Verticillium chlamydosporium and Paecilomyces lilacinus that feed on the aphids. *Resistance breeding in cardamom against CdMV has been in the process. For example, the lines NKE 9 and NKE 12 that are resistant to CdMV has been released for breeding in different parts of cardamom growing areas in India [11]. However, it is a lengthy, expensive and cumbersome process. Therefore, there are researches are still in progress to develop transgenic cardamom resistant to CdMV.

It was directed by Patricia Marcoccia and produced by Holding Space Films. It is an extended theatrical version of Marcoccia's documentary Shut Him Down: The Rise of Jordan Peterson which was broadcast in 2018. Background In 2015, Canadian filmmakers and husband and wife Maziar Ghaderi and Patricia Marcoccia started filming a documentary about Canadian psychology professor Jordan Peterson, who was little-known at the time. Marcoccia first became aware of Peterson's work while studying psychology at university in the early 2000s, where she discovered his first book, Maps of Meaning. Her interest in Peterson grew from there and in 2015, finally approached him with the idea of making a documentary, which he agreed to. The Rise of Jordan Peterson is Marcoccia's first feature film, having previously worked solely on short subjects. For the first year-and-a-half, the initial focus of the film was Peterson's personal and professional life as well as his friendship with Kwakwaka'wakw artist Charles Joseph. Its title at this stage was Mixala, a Kwak'wala word meaning \\"to dream\\". This changed in 2016 when Peterson posted a video on YouTube criticizing political correctness and Bill C-16, which went viral and led to his rise to prominence and as a \\"lightning rod for controversy\\". Marcoccia recalled: \\"If the order of events had been switched around and I had just heard about him through this controversy around him criticizing Bill C-16 and pronouns and political correctness, it probably wouldn't have been the story that I would've been chasing. So it was more like the controversy came to me.\\" As a result, the filmmakers changed the direction of the film to \\"documenting Peterson's new life as a best-selling author and TV star\\". Filming became increasingly difficult, as Ghaderi and Marcoccia had to work around Peterson's increasingly busy schedule. Until the latter part of 2017, Ghaderi and Marcoccia funded the project themselves, after which they were able to secure a budget to complete it. The Rise of Jordan Peterson is an extended theatrical version of Marcoccia's documentary Shut Him Down, which aired on the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC) Docs POV in 2018. Many hours of footage were not used in the film due to time constraints. One segment involved an interview with an anonymous private investigator who had started to collect evidence against Peterson in a case that was to be brought to the International Human Rights Tribunal. Having completed the documentary, Marcoccia intends to finish the initial film that she and Ghaderi had started in 2015, prior to Peterson's rise in fame. Reception The documentary has received reviews in Wired, Quillette, The Irish Times, and the National Review. Some scheduled screenings of the documentary have been cancelled, citing employee discomfort. Other venues hosting screenings have received threats of violence.

Founded in 1997 to encourage and promote women's ability to express their political and cultural realities through performing arts, it is a registered charitable trust. Soon after its founding, Magdalena Aotearoa organised a large international festival in 1999. Other activity is to host workshops, forums and international guests throughout New Zealand. Many participants from Magdalena Aotearoa events have gone on to attend related festivals and conferences in other countries that are all part of the original Magdalena Project, based in Wales.

From the left: Madeline McNamara, Helen Johnston, the chef, Sally Rodwell, Robin Nathan. Founding members Sally Rodwell and Madeline McNamara contacted the authors of Magdalena: International Women's Experimental Theatre, a book about a group of women in a creative theatre. This led to Rodwell and McNamara presenting their show Crow Station at the second Magdalena Project festival in 1994 in Cardiff, Wales. This began an enduring creative relationship between New Zealand theatre makers with many in this international network. In 1997, three years after attending the festival in Cardiff, Magdalena Project founder Jill Greenhalgh toured New Zealand and ran a series of workshops. Rodwell and McNamara formed the Magdalena Aotearoa charitable trust in the same year, with the intention of organising a Magdalena festival in New Zealand. Rodwell and McNamara had a producing and creative partnership: in the 1990s they produced, along with Sue Dunlop and Gloria Hildred, three women's performance festivals called Not Broadcast Quality at Taki Rua Theatre in Wellington (1990, 1992, 1997). Many people from these performances became involved in Magdalena Aotearoa. A foundation principle in the network was to have a partnership between MƒÅori and non-MƒÅori embedded into the working practice. The founding aims of the Magdalena Aotearoa Charitable Trust are: * To encourage and promote the work on women in the performing arts; * To create artistic, training and economic structures to enable women in theatre and related art forms to practise their craft; * To encourage innovative individual and collaborative projects in the performing arts; * To encourage the use of, respect for and knowledge of diverse theatrical forms and performance events expressing the political and cultural realities of the many different groups of women in Aotearoa; * To set up a programme of workshops and performance events enabling more women to acquire the confidence and skills required for them to take the initiative and create work situations for themselves; * To establish a network of artistic women both nationally and internationally; * To be guided by the principals of the Treaty of Waitangi in promoting an active working partnership between MƒÅori and tauiwi women in all of the Trust's work (the word 'tauiwi' denotes all those, other than MƒÅori, who have settled in New Zealand) * To host festivals that promote the above aims and to do any other act within Aotearoa that advances our charitable aims.  1999 International Festival, Wellington and PaekƒÅkƒÅriki  The Magdalena Aotearoa International Festival of Women's Performance was held 21 March ‚Äì 4 April 1999 and included performances of shows, workshops, installations, street events, music and cabaret, and an exhibition of fine art. The festival was structured into two sections: first a series of events across Wellington City, and second a shorter period in PaekƒÅkƒÅriki, a village north of Wellington. The PaekƒÅkƒÅriki section was curated and hosted by Magdalena MƒÅori, a group of MƒÅori women within Magdalena Aotearoa. In Wellington many of the events and performances were held at Circa Theatre on Wellington's waterfront. In a review of the festival Adele Chynoweth highlighted why a women specific festival is valuable: \\"Separate events such as the Magdalena Festival provide relief from the mainstream global arts markets, thus allowing women to negotiate their own politics and representation of identity.\\"  Programme of the 1999 Magdalena Aotearoa International Festival  The festival opened with a p≈çwhiri ceremony, and in the evening a free outdoor event held at Frank Kitts Lagoon called the Opening Spectacular. It was a big festival with many acts and parts to it. In Wellington city three theatre spaces were programmed, two at Circa Theatre, while Shed 11 (also on the Wellington waterfront) was converted into a theatre space. In addition there was an art exhibition in Shed 6, workshops, public lectures and street performances in the suburb of Newtown. In PaekƒÅkƒÅriki the festival was located at a holiday park where a marquee created a concert venue alongside artist Debra Bustin's Tent of the Universe, where daily workshops were held by MƒÅori tutors. International acts and artists featured included: * Ana Woolfe * Mary Salem (Australia) *Jill Greenhalgh (UK) *Peggy Shaw and Lois Weaver - Split Britches (USA) * Jolanta Krukowska (Poland) *Dah Theatre * Kirsten McIver * Gilla Cremer * Deborah Leiser * Regina Heilman * Julia Varley *Teatret Om * ARMAR * Teatro La Mascara * Geddy Aniksdal *Stella Chiweshe * Deborah Hunt * Verena Tay (Singapore) New Zealand acts and artists featured included: * Emma Buttle & Jules Novena Sorrel * France Herve (NZ and France) * NgƒÅ Tuahine * Louse Maich * all & sundry *Dianna Fuemana *Pacific Sisters * Lilicherie McGregor & Olivia Lory Kay * Roadworks * Miff Moore * Jo Randerson * Storm Davenport & Anitta Alexander * Tai Timu  Activities  Between 1997 and 2015 a number of women theatre artists were brought to New Zealand for performances and workshops for artistic exchange. * Geddy Aniksdal and Lars Vik (Norway), February‚ÄìMarch 2015 * Violeta Luna (Mexico/USA), workshop and performance, June 2014 * Jadranka Andjelic (Serbia) and Antonella Diana (Italy/Denmark), July‚ÄìAugust 2006 * Rosa Casado (Spain), June 2006 *Josefina Baez (USA/Dominican Republic), 2002 and 2004 * Birgitte Grimstad (Norway), 2002 * Teatro delle Radici (Switzerland), 2001 and 2005 * Jill Greenhalgh (Wales), 1997 Magdalena Aotearoa and the organisation Tii Kouka were represented at a Treaty of Waitangi conference called Treaty 2000.

It may be a descendant of Cassino which it resembles.  History  The game appears as early as an 1852 Viennese 'house calendar' where it is describe as a \\"social game\\" that is relaxing and entertaining to play. It is also published in a number of Viennese games compendia around that time, including the 1866 edition of the Neuestes Universal Spielbuch which carries an identical account of the rules. Despite its supposed English origin, possibly in a game called Quits, there appears to be no record of it being played there.  Equipment  The game is played with a French-suited Whist pack of 52 cards and no Jokers. Aces are low. There are 3 matadors which earn bonuses: the Jack, Ten and Two of Spades. The game was played for points and money. Each player needed a dish for their own chips or coins ('pool') and a larger dish for the pot was recommended. A basic stake of 1-5 chips or ¬º kreuzers was suggested.  Players  The game is described for two to eight players, however, the number of cards dealt to the players and the table at the start and the number of cards drawn by each player during each deal varies depending on the number playing. Four players could play in two teams of two, each sharing a common pool.  Rules  The following rules are summarised from the Vanderheid / house calendar account and assume four players and a stake of 4 chips.  Dealing  Deal and play are anticlockwise. Each player antes 4 chips to the pot. The dealer shuffles until the cutter is satisfied, indicating this by cutting the pack or saying \\"it's good\\" (gut ist's). The dealer looks at the bottom card; if it is a matador, the cards are reshuffled. The dealer then places 4 cards, in line and face up, on the table before handing the remaining stock to forehand, the player on his right. Each player in turn now draws the top four cards from the stock into his hand.  Playing  Once all the players have drawn their cards, the players, in turn and beginning with forehand, try to capture the table cards by matching or summing in accordance with the following rules: * Matching. Any court or number card held by the player may capture one or more cards of the same rank, regardless of suit e.g. a Queen may capture one or more Queens from the table and a Five may capture one or more Fives. * Summing. Any number card (2, 3... 10) may capture two or more number cards that add up to the number of the capturing card. Court cards have no numerical value so may not do this. Aces are only worth one so, again, cannot capture by summing. * Multiple captures A card may make multiple captures e.g. an Ace may capture two Aces; a Ten may capture a Ten, a Seven and a Three. * Skwitz If, in capturing cards, a player sweeps the table clear, he announces a \\"Skwitz!\\" for a bonus. * Trailing. A player unable to capture any cards must trail by playing a card alongside the existing table cards. Captured cards are placed face down in a pile next to the player who captured them. Each skwitz is recorded by turning one of the captured cards face up. Once all the cards have been played, the dealer clears any remaining cards from the table and announces \\"these are the last\\" (dies sind die Letzten).  Payments during the game  Payments are made during the game as follows: * Capturing a matador: every other player pays 2 chips to the captor and 2 to the pot * Making a skwitz: every other player pays 2 chips to the skwitzer and 2 to the pot The rules also list numerous instances of breaches for which the penalty is invariably the payment of half the stake (2 chips) to each of the other players.  Scoring and winning  One point is scored for each of the following: * Most cards * Most Spades * Each skwitz * Each matador captured * Last trick (i.e. the last player to capture a table card) As soon as a player reaches the agreed number of points (usually 7) he may declare \\"Out!\\" (Aus!) when it is his turn to play, whereupon everyone else pays 4 to the pot and 4 to the winner. In addition, any player with no points is 'in the mud' (matsch) and pays 4 to the pot and 4 to the winner. However, a player on 7 points may opt to play on to try and earn more through capturing matadors and making skwitzes. Once the payments for the \\"out\\" and matsch have been made, the current dealer passes the pot to the winner who places it beside him without emptying it and becomes the next dealer (this overrides the normal sequence in which the dealer rotates to the right if no-one has scored 7 points). If the same player wins again, he collects the contents of the pot after the payments for \\"out\\" and matsch have been made.  Footnotes   References   Literature  * _ (1852).

The clan is present also in Villaricca, Quarto, Pozzuoli, Qualiano and in the district Camaldoli of Naples (place of origin of the Polverino family). Outside Italy, the clan has a strong presence in Spain, in particular in Barcelona, M√°laga and Alicante. According to the investigations, the Polverinos are considered the successors of the Nuvoletta clan.  History  The organization was founded by Giuseppe Polverino, known as \\"Peppe 'o barone\\" in the 1990s. The clan started as a ramification of the Nuvoletta clan, but has become independent and one of the most powerful groups of the Camorra over the time, surpassing the Nuvolettas that in 90s were going through a very difficult time, thanks to the large efforts of the Italian police to overthrow the organization. Taking advantage of these years, Giuseppe had to start building his own clan, managing to bring to him, emerging members of the Camorra from Marano such as the Simioli and Ruggiero families. Giuseppe Polverino, was dubbed the 'hashish king', due to his monopoly on the importation of hashish from Morocco to Italy via Spain supplying not only all the Camorra clans, but also the 'Ndrangheta, the Sicilian Mafia and the Sacra Corona Unita. The Polverino clan had a monopoly of the hashish trade since 1992 until 2009. According to one of the pentitos of the clan, Domenico Verde, the hashish was cultivated in the region of Ketama, and arrived by mules in the beginning, but later was modernized and accessible on trucks and cars. According to the authorities in Spain, the Polverino clan is the most powerful Camorra clan acting in the country, due to the number of people they have installed and because of the potential of their structure. Among the cities with great influence of the organization are: Alicante, Tarragona, M√°laga and C√°diz. The clan is known to have a good relationship with the Cosa Nostra families from Palermo. A true lover of poker, women and the good life, Giuseppe Polverino's personal fortune is over 1 billion euros. Polverino has a great entrepreneurial capacity, investing in the tourism-hotel sector in Italy and Spain, one of the top money launderers of the clan was Luigi Esposito, that according to reports, was able to quadruple the money of the organization. Esposito, who for a long time was a trusted member of the Nuvoletta clan, started working for the Polverino clan, and was arrested in September 2019. Giuseppe Polverino was arrested on March 6, 2012 in an apartment in Jerez de la Frontera, Spain and extradited to Italy after two months. After his arrest, Giuseppe Simioli, his right-hand man, had taken the reins of the organization, but was also arrested in July 2017 for mafia association, drugs and arms trafficking.

Present day  In 2019, relatives of top members belonging to the clan claim three million euros to the Spanish State of compensation after their relatives were acquitted by the National Court of the crime of money laundering for which they were arrested in 2013 and tried in 2016. Among the assets seized were six yachts, two Ferrari Testarossa, one Lamborghini, one Harley-Davidson, bank accounts and real estate. The plaintiffs are all relatives of the late Giuseppe Felaco, who was allegedly an important member of the Polverino clan based in the Canary Islands, they assure that this Spanish police operation against their family has been a great economic damage, apart from a moral damage. On May 29, 2019 Raffaele Vallefuoco, an important member of the organization, was arrested in the Rabat region in Morocco. Vallefuoco is considered one of the biggest drug traffickers in Italy and was included on the list of the 50 most wanted fugitives. Also in 2019, the Italian police with the cooperation of the Spanish police, arrested two members of the clan, who belonged to a major transnational organizational structure, created by the Polverinos, based in Valencia and Naples, that between 2001 and 2012 imported hashish from Morocco via Spain to arrive in the Campania region. On December 6, 2019, Silvano Pennino and Nicola Di Nuzzo, two important drug traffickers working for the clan in Spain, were released from jail. According to the investigations, Pennino and Di Nuzzo were specialized particularly in the hashish trafficking. On December 11, 2019, Giuseppe Polverino and Giuseppe Simioli were sentenced to life imprisonment. They were held responsible for the murder of Giuseppe Candela, happened in July 2009. According to the investigations, Candela, who was a member of the Polverino clan, was killed because he was managing his business independently, and no longer responding to the clan. On May 26, 2020, 16 people belonging to the clan were arrested in an investigation by the DDA (Direzione Distrettuale Antimafia), including the alleged current leader of the clan, Vincenzo Polverino. On June 5, 2020, the Direzione Distrettuale Antimafia seized ‚Ç¨10 million of assets from the clan. Among the seized assets were two villas, two garages, two warehouse-depots, six commercial premises, three plots of land, a school building and a nursery.

It is situated north of the Canada‚ÄìUnited States border, southeast of Chilliwack, and northwest of Canadian Border Peak, which is its nearest higher peak. Precipitation runoff from the peak drains into tributaries of the Chilliwack River. The steep western slope of the peak plunges 1800 metres into Tamihi Creek. The mountain was originally known as Tamihi, a Halkomelem name that means \\"deformed baby finishes.\\" Such infants were sometimes left exposed on the mountain to die. The mountain's name was labelled on 1917 map as McGuire, and officially adopted on October 6, 1936, by the Geographical Names Board of Canada. The peak was first climbed in 1906 by James J. McArthur and survey party via the Southeast Ridge. Geology Mount McGuire is related to the Chilliwack batholith, which intruded the region 26 to 29 million years ago after the major orogenic episodes in the region. This is part of the Pemberton Volcanic Belt, an eroded volcanic belt that formed as a result of subduction of the Farallon Plate starting 29 million years ago.Cenozoic to Recent plate configurations in the Pacific Basin: Ridge subduction and slab window magmatism in western North AmericaCatalogue of Canadian volcanoes: Franklin Glacier During the Pleistocene period dating back over two million years ago, glaciation advancing and retreating repeatedly scoured the landscape leaving deposits of rock debris. The \\"U\\"-shaped cross section of the river valleys are a result of recent glaciation. Uplift and faulting in combination with glaciation have been the dominant processes which have created the tall peaks and deep valleys of the North Cascades area. The North Cascades features some of the most rugged topography in the Cascade Range with craggy peaks and ridges, deep glacial valleys, and granite spires. Geological events occurring many years ago created the diverse topography and drastic elevation changes over the Cascade Range leading to various climate differences which lead to vegetation variety defining the ecoregions in this area. Climate Based on the K√∂ppen climate classification, Mount McGuire is located in the marine west coast climate zone of western North America. Most weather fronts originate in the Pacific Ocean, and travel east toward the Cascade Range where they are forced upward by the range (Orographic lift), causing them to drop their moisture in the form of rain or snowfall. As a result, the Cascade Mountains experience high precipitation, especially during the winter months in the form of snowfall. Temperatures can drop below ‚àí20 ¬∞C with wind chill factors below ‚àí30 ¬∞C. The months July through September offer the most favorable weather for climbing McGuire. Climbing Routes Mt.

OneBookShelf was formed by the merger of RPGNow and DriveThruRPG. The company's e-commerce platforms host content from individual sellers, indie creators and major publishing companies such as Chaosium, Fantasy Flight Games, White Wolf, and Wizards of the Coast.  History   RPGNow  RPGNow was established in 2001 by James Mathe. Sebastian Deterding and Jos√© Zagal wrote that \\"in the beginning, the bestselling products on RPGNow were nearly always d20 products. Mathe made attempts to reach out to established publishers of other types of games, but many were hesitant about selling digital versions, worried that would increase piracy or cannibalize existing print sales. Nevertheless, RPGNow recorded better than 10% growth in every year of its operation\\".  DriveThruRPG  DriveThruRPG was established in 2004 by Mike Todd, Chris McDonough and Steve Wieck. In 2005, DriveThruRPG abandoned selling DRM protected products. \\"Customers hated the hassle of dealing with it, and it didn't offer very good protection against piracy, Wieck said. Now, the site sells unprotected PDFs with a faint 'watermark' with the customer's name on every page. Sales rose 30 percent after the change\\". Two more DriveThru digital storefronts, DriveThruComics and DriveThruFiction, were also launched in 2005. In 2007, it was reported that DriveThruRPG did $2 million in business annually. Wieck said \\"the business idea of 'first-mover advantage' is more commonly discussed than that of second-mover advantage or being a fast-follower. Despite the many advantages that accrue to first-movers into a new market segment [...], I personally prefer to be a second-mover into many business opportunities. For example, when starting DriveThruRPG, we were a second-mover behind James Mathe, who had already started RPGNow\\".  Merger  In 2006, RPGNow and DriveThruRPG merged into a new company called OneBookShelf. Originally, OneBookShelf maintained the separate digital storefronts of RPGNow and DriveThruRPG while merging the digital inventory. James Mathe said \\"the focus of the merger is providing the best experience for rpg fans. Combined with DriveThruRPG, we will now offer consumers over 9,000 titles from over 500 different publishers. Many of the titles have never been available in print or are no longer available in print\\". In 2008, the company took over Mongoose Publishing‚Äôs Wargaming Online digital store and relaunched it as Wargame Vault. On April 6, 2009, Wizards of the Coast suspended all sales of its products for the Dungeons & Dragons games in PDF format from places such as OneBookShelf and its subsidiaries RPGNow and DriveThruRPG due to concerns of piracy and copyright infringement. ICv2 reported that OneBookShelf \\"took a hit to its volume when Wizards of the Coast abruptly halted sales of PDFs of its products\\" and that although Sean Patrick Fannon, RPG Marketing, Communications, and Publisher Services Manager for OneBookShelf, \\"acknowledged that the move was a negative for PDF sales, he said that Wizards of the Coast was 'not even close' to half the company‚Äôs sales\\".  2010 - Present  In 2010, OneBookShelf launched a print on demand program and then in 2012, the company launched a new digital storefront called DriveThruCards for custom card products. In 2013, OneBookShelf was once again allowed to sell Dungeons & Dragons products through a new partnership with Wizards of the Coast. OneBookShelf did not originally have an offensive content policy. In 2015, \\"DriveThruRPG was involved in a controversy due its decision to sell a title called Tournament of Rapists. DriveThruRPG was initially criticized for its slow reaction to complaints about the offensiveness of the product [...], and the product was eventually removed from the store\\". This led to the creation of an offensive content policy for all of OneBookShelf's platforms. Wieck said: > So, going forward, our offensive content policy is simply going to be this: > Offensive Content: We'll know it when we see it. I will be the final arbiter > of what OneBookShelf deems offensive. [...] Any title in which racial > violence, rape, torture, or a similar subject is treated as a central > feature will naturally be subjected to increased scrutiny. [...] We will > continue to be reactive, not proactive, on judging new title releases. > Historically, 99.99% of publishers' content has been inoffensive. Being able > to activate their own titles for sale with our marketplace tools gives > publishers additional control over their release marketing timing and > generally gets RPG products to market more quickly. [...] Once the reporting > feature is live, we will review titles already on the marketplace that are > reported by customers. There will be no \\"grandfathering in\\" of past content. Also, in 2015, OnceBookShelf had a credit card breach and hackers \\"used the OneBookShelf's servers to launch DDOS attack on other sites\\". ICv2 reported that \\"one of two load-balanced servers was compromised, the company said, and it had no way of knowing which of the customers that had transactions during that period were processed on which server. [...] It said it had no information to indicate that encrypted credit card numbers of customers that did not make purchases during the period were taken, but could not rule it out\\". From February 2016 to March 2016, DriveThruRPG held a bounty program for high quality scans of old hard-to-find Dungeons and Dragons campaigns, modules and boxed sets. In November 2018, it was announced that in February 2019 the RPGNow digital storefront would be shut down and redirected to the DriveThruRPG digital storefront. On February 12, 2019, OneBookShelf announced that it would no longer work with Zak Smith \\"after multiple women publicly accused Smith of abuse. [...] The company went on to say that its own portion of any revenue generated by Smith‚Äôs existing titles already up for sale on its storefront will be donated to RAINN (Rape, Abuse & Incest National Network), the nation‚Äôs largest anti-sexual violence organization\\". In June 2019, co- founder Mathe passed away. Wieck wrote \\"well before the iPhone, iPad, or the Kindle, James recognized the opportunity for RPG publishers to reach more fans through digital versions of their titles. By 2004, when I and a few others started DriveThruRPG, we were the Johnny-come-lately to the pioneering work James had already done with RPGNow. Nevertheless, it was through the resulting friendly business rivalry between DriveThruRPG and RPGNow that I got to know and soon came to respect James. [...] James was a very smart entrepreneur in a hobby business full of smart people. He embodied the best of the US Midwestern virtues of work ethic, honesty, and fairness. He's gone too soon\\". In June 2020, OneBookShelf came \\"under scrutiny\\" after a queer themed adventure by ENNie Award nominated designer Oliver Clegg was removed from the DMsGuild platform for \\"distinctively sexualized\\" artwork. \\"After the adventure was pulled and the DMs Guild released its statement, many DMs Guild creators and D&D; fans spoke out about the adventure's removal and a wider discussion of artwork used in Dungeons & Dragons material. Laura Hirsbrunner, another prominent DMs Guild creator, compiled a number of art pieces used in official D&D; materials and available for use on the DMs Guild showing women and monsters in sexualized outfits or in various states of nudity\\". The company responded that \\"the OneBookShelf team stands by our decision to request adjustments to the art in question in this recent scenario [...]. However, we agree we want to be fair in how such standards are applied, which includes examining any internal biases that might have affected past decisions too. We're still very much in the process of listening, both personally and professionally, so we hope the community will afford us some patience and time in adjusting and improving our own processes and guidelines\\". In July 2020, Wizards of the Coast added a sensitivity disclaimer to some of their legacy products for sale on DriveThruRPG and DMsGuild. Many of these products feature cultures inspired by Asia, Mesoamerica and the Middle East.  Partnerships   DNDClassics  In 2013, OneBookShelf launched a new digital storefront in partnership with Wizards of the Coast to sell classic Dungeons & Dragons products. This site sold Dungeons & Dragons products from Advanced Dungeons & Dragons through the 4th Edition of the game.  Community Card Creator  In 2015, OneBookShelf launched a new card creator web application as part of DriveThruCards in partnership with Paizo Publishing for the Pathfinder Adventure Card Game. The \\"card creator allows fans of PACG to create their own card, which can be purchased and printed for $0.50 each. You can either keep your build private so that it is unique to your deck, or make it publicly available so that other PACG fans can try it out\\".  Dungeon Masters Guild  In 2016, OneBookShelf launched a new digital storefront in partnership with Wizards of the Coast called the Dungeon Masters Guild (DMsGuild). The DNDClassics site was replaced by the new DMsGuild storefront. With the 5th Edition Dungeons & Dragons open game license, third party publishers are allowed to print and published content based on the 5th Edition System Reference Document (SRD). The DMsGuild took that a step further by allowing individuals and third party publishers to create and sell content based on the Forgotten Realms. Escapist reported \\"the Dungeon Masters Guild alone is a big deal since it allows anyone to be paid for Forgotten Realms content - something that once required a specific contract with Wizards of the Coast\\" and that \\"options for content range from new monsters, to NPCs, to locations, to entire Forgotten Realms adventures and campaigns. The creator can set any price on their content - or give it away for free - with the only caveat being that Wizards of the Coast and OneBookShelf take a 50% cut of the proceeds\\". VentureBeat reported that content on DMsGuild is \\"available for D&D; video game developers to buy. [...] According to D&D; spokesperson Greg Tito, Wizards of the Coast would negotiate with the author to license or purchase their creations\\". As of 2019, content can now be based on other Wizards of the Coast intellectual property such as Ravenloft, Eberron, and Ravnica.  Community Content Programs  After the success of the DMsGuild, OneBookShelf continued to partner with other publishers to allow individuals to create and sell content based on intellectual property on the DriveThruRPG website. The number of programs grew rapidly. As of August 2020, there are nearly 30 programs, including ones with well-known publishers like Chaosium, Mongoose Publishing, Pinnacle Entertainment Group and White Wolf.  Astral Virtual TableTop  In April 2019, it was announced that DriveThruRPG had partnered with Astral Virtual TableTop (Astral) and the virtual tabletop platform received a major update. OneBookShelf said that content \\"purchased through any DriveThru site, including DriveThruRPG and Dungeon Master's Guild\\" can be imported and shared in Astral.  Reception  In 2015, Paste reported that \\"RPGs can be expensive, so while PDFs can be harder to pass around or to look up rules on, they are a much more financially astute option. DriveThruRPG.com is a great place to find PDFs\\". In 2018, Deterding and Zagal wrote that \\"by its own account, DriveThruRPG, run by OneBookShelf, is currently the largest online marketplace for TRPGs. [...] It allows TRPG publishers to offer their current and historic catalogs as PDFs and print-on-demand books. As online digital and print-on-demand distribution maximizes reach and minimizes up- front investment hurdles and risk, it has contributed to the flourishing of 'long tail,' 'indie' RPGs\\". Jason Wilson, for VentureBeat, said that \\"the DM‚Äôs Guild is my favorite project from the Dungeons & Dragons team in recent years. [...] The Dungeon Masters Adept program, [...], has resulted in other community writers producing official material on the Guild. We‚Äôve seen how the Guild just expands on the official books. Now, with Eberron, we‚Äôre seeing how Wizards can use it to resurrect its past. [...] The DM‚Äôs Guild gives Wizards a cost-friendly method of opening up the gates to the past. It can conduct some polling on what the community wants on the Guild, when it comes to books for older settings, and then, commission someone to do so\\". In 2019, The Verge included DriveThruRPG on a roundup of websites to purchase from that are not Amazon. In 2020, Polygon reported that \\"Wizards runs an organized play series known as the D&D; Adventurer‚Äôs League. You can find all of its past 5th edition content online, available for a nominal price. It‚Äôs among the most polished content on the DMs Guild, with playtesting provided by customers at game stores around the world\\".

The sixteenth depression and fourteenth named storm of the erratic 2019 Atlantic hurricane season, Nestor originated from a broad area of low pressure over the Western Caribbean. It emerged in the Gulf of Mexico and began to organize slightly, becoming Potential Tropical Cyclone Sixteen due to its threat to the Southeastern United States. It gained a sufficient enough of a circulation to be designated Tropical Storm Nestor near the Florida Panhandle early on October 18, crawling to the northeast, and then finally transitioning into an extratropical cyclone due to strong shear from a nearby upper-level low before making landfall on the Florida Panhandle on October 19. Meteorological history On October 10, the NHC began to monitor for a poorly defined area of low pressure that was forecast to form near Central America. The low developed on October 11 and meandered almost parallel to the coast of Honduras for the next few days, before finally crossing over Central America near the Yucatan Peninsula on October 14. The low fully emerged into the Bay of Campeche on October 16 after bringing heavy rain to Central America and due to the warm temperatures in the Gulf of Mexico at the time, convection significantly improved with the system near the center and it was given a medium chance of development. The system became very broad but proceeded to be designated as Potential Tropical Cyclone Sixteen the proceeding day due to its threat to the United States Gulf Coast. The disturbance intensified over the following hours, attaining winds up to 60 mph (95 km/h), with cloud tops colder than -80¬∞ enveloping the center. The disturbance's circulation however remained very elongated, and was still not named. Later that evening on October 18, the circulation improved and became more defined, while the system was finally designated Tropical Storm Nestor. Potential Tropical Cyclone Sixteen on October 17, 2019 Nestor began to then accelerate to the northeast aided by a ridge to its northeast, although wind shear generated by a nearby trough almost embedded within the northern side of the cyclone began to give Nestor a lopsided appearance on satellite imagery shortly after its designation. Due to Nestor's broad nature, gale-force winds were already beginning to be observed near the coast of Florida Panhandle. The system began to slow down as wind shear generated by the trough caused the storm to weaken as it neared the Florida Panhandle coast. Nestor rapidly lost its tropical characteristics due to interaction with this trough, and was declared to have become an extratropical cyclone early on October 19, however still bringing storm surge and heavy rains to the coast anyway. Nestor's post- tropical remnant then made landfall in St. Vincent Island, Florida with winds up to 45 mph, becoming further disorganized across the Southeastern United States for the next couple of days. On October 21, Nestor's extratropical remnant was absorbed into another extratropical storm off the coast of the Southeastern United States. Preparations With the designation of Potential Tropical Cyclone Sixteen, the National Weather Service (NWS) issued Tropical Storm Warnings and Watches for the majority of the Florida Panhandle coast. Storm Surge Watches were also issued ahead of the storm. Parts of Southern Louisiana and Alabama also received Tropical Storm Warnings, but were removed shortly after the storm's track shifted predominantly towards to the Florida Panhandle. Tornado watches were then issued shortly after the storm became post-tropical for much of Northern Florida and some parts of Georgia. Impacts EF2 tornado in Polk County, Florida on October 19, 2019, caused by Nestor. As Nestor began to approach the coast of the Florida Panhandle, the same region that was severely affected by Hurricane Michael the previous year, it led to winds to gale-force and storm surge to take upon the region. Tides 2‚Äì4 feet above normal were recorded in several parts of the region as well, causing some minor coastal flooding. Heavy rain and the surging waves generated by the storm system also caused flash flooding in parts of the region, with some areas topping with 4 inches of rain. These rains, however, proved to be somewhat beneficial. A drought in the Southeastern United States was relieved as Nestor and its post-tropical remnant brought rain to the areas, with a meteorologist stating \\"The rain on the whole was a positive for the entire region ‚Äì unless you had outdoor plans.\\". Perhaps the legacy of Nestor, however, was the tornado outbreak it caused across the Southeastern United States. Although Nestor was not classified as a tropical cyclone anymore at the time of its landfall, it spawned numerous supercells, which ultimately lead to the spawning of several tornadoes. The National Weather Service (NWS) only confirmed three tornadoes, one reaching EF2 status. One of the tornadoes, only reaching EF0 status, was recorded in Seminole, Florida and damaged a mobile home park. An EF2 tornado which tracked 9 miles also touched down in western Polk County, damaging over 50 homes and other buildings, including a middle school. The tornado also overturned an 18-wheeled vehicle which fell on top of a SUV, but no injuries were reported. A final EF1 tornado formed near Cape Coral in Lee County damaging several homes. No injuries or deaths were reported from any of the tornadoes. Additionally, heavy rains generated by Nestor's extratropical remnant caused a car crash in South Carolina, killing 3 people.

It is about a painter who kills his elderly neighbor's dog, then loses his grip on reality, descends into madness and begins behaving as if he were the neighbor's dog, leading him to commit a series of grisly murders. Plot summary A painter becomes annoyed by a neighboring dog that's harassing his cows. One day, he shoots the dog and buries it in the woods. However, he takes pity on his neighbor, an Old Man who is miserable without the dog, believing it to have been kidnapped. The painter makes visits to the Old Man's home, in an attempt to keep him company, but when Old Man treats him sadistically, the painter soon finds himself impulsively acting like the Old Man's dog. By the time the painter has returned home, he has so lost his sanity that he begins to suspect his wife of mistreating their 5-year-old son, Tobias. Planning a violent confrontation with his wife, he decides to prime himself by going on dates with various women, often murdering them. At times, he feels as though he is witnessing a mysterious male figure interrupting the crime scenes; this may be Death incarnate. Having felt remorse about his earlier crime, the painter returns to the Old Man and confesses to having killed his dog. As a form of parity, the Old Man resolves to force the painter to kidnap his son, Tobias, and bury him alive inside a suitcase underground. After Tobias is buried alive, a fight ensues between the painter and the Old Man, ending with the Old Man getting killed in a car wreck. The painter immediately returns to the burial site and digs up Tobias, who, apparently, is still alive‚Äîbut hysterical. The police show up and arrest the painter. The painter is sentenced to be executed on the electric chair at Death Row. One of his last acts in life is to paint a self-portrait, on his cell walls, of himself with a dog's face, and the hair of his female victims. He looks forward to this, as he has inexplicably become cold on a constant basis, and believes that death by electrocution will provide him with warmth.

The question was asked whether, after the Battle of Borodino that did not reveal the winner, to try to give another battle near Moscow or to leave the city without a fight. On the eve of the council On the eve of the council, formations of the Russian Army were located west of Moscow to give battle to Napoleon's troops. The position was chosen by General Leonty Bennigsen. Despite a severe fever that tormented him for several days, Barclay de Tolly inspected the battlefield on horseback and came to the conclusion that the position was fatal to the formations of the Russian army. The same conclusions after him came, having traveled to the location of the Russian troops, to Alexei Ermolov and Karl Tol. In the light of these reports, Kutuzov faced the question of the need to continue the retreat and surrender of Moscow (or giving a battle right on the streets of the city). Course of the council in Fili The council was attended by generals Mikhail Barclay de Tolly, delayed on the way Leonty Bennigsen, Dmitry Dokhturov, Alexei Ermolov, Peter Konovnitsyn, Alexander Osterman-Tolstoy, Nikolay Raevsky, who was very late,When Raevsky arrived at the meeting, Ermolov briefly brought him up to date. Karl Tol, Fedor Uvarov, and General Paisiy Kaysarov who was on duty that day.In some sources, among those present, Matvey Platov and Mikhail Miloradovich were mistakenly mentioned. There was no protocol. The main sources of information about the council are the memoirs of Raevsky and Ermolov, as well as a letter from Nikolai Longinov to Semyon Vorontsov in London. Bennigsen, who opened the meeting, formulated a dilemma ‚Äì to give battle in an unfavorable position or to surrender the ancient capital to the enemy. Kutuzov corrected him that it was not about saving Moscow, but about saving the army, since you can count on victory only if the combat-ready army is preserved. Barclay de Tolly proposed retreating to the Vladimirsky Tract and further to Nizhny Novgorod, so that in the event of Napoleon's turn to Petersburg, he would have time to block his path. In his speech, Bennigsen announced that the retreat makes senseless bloodshed in the battle of Borodino. The surrender of the sacred to the Russian city will undermine the fighting spirit of the soldiers. Great will be purely material losses from the ruin of noble estates. Despite the onset of darkness, he proposed to regroup and attack the Great Army without delay. Bennigsen's proposal was supported by Yermolov, Konovnitsyn, Uvarov and Dohturov. The first to speak in the debate was Barclay de Tolly, who criticized the position near Moscow and suggested retreating: \\"Having saved Moscow, Russia is not saved from a cruel, ruinous war. But if we save the army, the hopes of the Fatherland are not yet destroyed, and the war... can continue with convenience: the prepared troops will have time to join in different places outside Moscow\\".Sergey Nechaev. Barclay de Tolly [Text] ‚Äì Moscow: Young Guard, 2011 ‚Äì 331 Pages ‚Äì (The Life of Wonderful People; Issue 1528 (1328)) ‚Äì Osterman-Tolstoy, Raevsky and Tol spoke for the fact that Russia is not in Moscow. The latter pointed out that the army exhausted by the battle of Borodino was not ready for a new equally large-scale battle, especially since many commanders were disabled by wounds. At the same time, the army's retreat along the streets of Moscow will make a painful impression on the townspeople. To this Kutuzov objected that \\"the French army will dissolve in Moscow like a sponge in the water\\", and offered to retreat to the Ryazan road. Savrasov's painting \\"House of Council at Fili\\" Based on the opinion of the minority of those present, Kutuzov decided not to let the battle take place in an unsuccessful position, to leave Moscow (because, in his words, repeating Barclay de Tolly, \\"with the loss of Moscow, Russia is still not lost\\") in order to save the army to continue the war, and at the same time get closer to suitable reserves. This decision required a certain courage, since the measure of responsibility for the surrender of the historical capital to the enemy was very large and could result in the resignation of the commander-in-chief. No one could predict how this decision would be taken at court. After the council in Fili At the end of the council, Kutuzov summoned the quartermaster-general Dmitry Lansky and ordered him to ensure the supply of food on the Ryazan road. At night, the adjutant of Kutuzov heard him cry. The army, which was preparing for battle, was ordered to retreat, causing widespread bewilderment and grumbling. Retreat in the city was carried out at night. The decision to retreat was taken aback by the Moscow authorities, headed by Count Fedor Rostopchin. After two day crossings, the Russian army turned from the Ryazan road to Podolsk onto the old Kaluga road, and from there onto the new Kaluga one. As part of the Cossacks continued to retreat to Ryazan, the French scouts were disoriented, and Napoleon for 9 days had no idea about the whereabouts of the Russian troops.Radio Echo of Moscow: Not So. September 22, 2012, 14:05. Council at Fili: Alexander Valkovich Memory of the council The Council at Fili was described by Leo Tolstoy in the novel War and Peace. Based on the Tolstoy literary basis, the artist Alexei Kivshenko painted two paintings of the same content depicting the main characters on the 70th anniversary of the council, the first in 1880 (stored in the Russian Museum), the second in 1882 (Tretyakov Gallery). In the tradition of Tolstoy and Kivshenko, the council is depicted in the epic of Sergei Bondarchuk \\"War and Peace\\" (1967). For reasons of economy of timing, among all the council members in the film, the word was given only to Kutuzov and Bennigsen (the latter speaks Russian on the movie screen, which he did not actually speak).Sergey Solovyov.

The song was recorded from a Norddeutscher Rundfunk (NDR) broadcast at an unknown date (widely speculated to be in late 1983 or 1984). Since 2019, this song has been the subject of a viral Internet phenomenon, with many users of sites such as Reddit and Discord involved in a collaborative effort to search for the origins of the song. Background An alleged list of songs on Darius' tape that includes the Most Mysterious Song on the Internet. Note that it is labeled under the name Blind the Wind instead. According to a Rolling Stone article published in September 2019, a man named Darius S. recorded the song ‚Äúbetween 1982 and 1984,‚Äù from a radio program called Musik F√ºr Junge Leute (‚ÄúMusic for Young People‚Äù) that he listened to on the German public radio station NDR. Darius recorded the song on a tape labeled \\"Cassette #4\\", along with songs from XTC and the Cure that were also released around 1984. Further evidence that supports this as being the earliest possible airing date was the Technics tape deck that he most likely used to record the song on, which was manufactured in 1984 as well. To get clean recordings of songs he purposefully did not include presentations of radio hosts, which is why the air date and the name is unknown. Sometime in 1985, Darius created his own mixtape playlist consisting of the unknown songs in his collection. The playlist was titled Unknown Pleasures after a Joy Division album. In 2004, Darius digitized his playlists and his mixtapes, saving the songs as .aiff and .m4a files. Eventually, Darius' sister, Lydia H, gave Darius a website domain as a birthday present, which he used to raise awareness of his playlist. This would be the earliest known source of the song. On March 18, 2007, Lydia began posting the song to the internet in an attempt to identify the artist and title of the song. Her search originally began on a newsgroup, but eventually migrated to music websites. Lydia posted a digital snippet of the song to a German fansite devoted to eighties synth- pop and to spiritofradio.ca, a Canadian website devoted to identifying songs uploaded by fans. Viral Internet phenomenon The mystery of the unidentified song gained viral popularity in 2019 when a Brazilian teenager named Gabriel da Silva Vieira began searching for evidence of its origin. He stated that he became interested in the song when he was informed about it by Nicolas Zuniga of the Spanish record label Dead Wax Records. Gabriel uploaded a clip of the song to YouTube (audio sourced from Lydia‚Äôs SpiritOfRadio posts) and to many Reddit music subreddits. On July 9, 2019, YouTuber Justin Whang posted an episode of Tales from the Internet discussing the song, and the progress of the search up to that point. Upon the video's release, more Internet users have contributed to the effort to identify the song. So far, four episodes about the song have been made. The latest video has over 200K views as of October 2020. After the video's release, u/foreveranemptybliss made a post on the r/Germany subreddit about the song. Then, u/johnnymetoo posted a complete clip of the song, which he obtained from one of Lydia's Usenet posts. Since then, many contacts have been made which pertain to the search, such as Paul Baskerville, the DJ of the show from which the song was likely taped, GEMA, a German government and performance rights organization, and a YouTube channel named \\"80zforever\\", which has many videos of obscure music. These contacts and leads are kept in a spreadsheet to keep track of the investigation. The community's official Discord server has also found various undocumented and/or obscure media of various genres. On July 10, 2020, Reddit user u/FlexxonMobil had acquired the complete list of songs Baskerville had played on Musik F√ºr Junge Leute in 1984 and published it onto the site. However, after some searching, it was concluded that the song was not in that list, effectively ruling out the theory that Baskerville had played the song. u/FlexxonMobil has since contacted NDR archivists for 1983 and 1984 playlists for other DJs, and is currently waiting for a response (as of October 2020).

The World Bank was instrumental in financing and providing technical assistance for Poland as it transitioned from a Command Economy into a Market-Oriented Economy. As a middle income country, Poland has worked primarily with the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development since it is not eligible for loans from the International Development Association. Additionally, Poland has had a few projects with the Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency and the International Finance Corporation. Currently, most of Poland's engagements with the World Bank Group concern environmental concerns and public finances.  Post Communist Transition  Despite being a founding member of the World Bank Group (WBG), Poland, due to pressure from the Soviet Union, did not withdraw loans from the WBG until the early 90s. Once Poland began transitioning away from the Soviet network, the WBG and its sister organization, the International Monetary Fund, provided funds and technical advice to facilitate Poland‚Äôs transition into a free-market democracy. The World Bank was an extremely important source of financing because foreign capital was skeptical of Poland‚Äôs political and economic stability and its transition to a capitalist economy necessarily entailed the scaling back of state-directed investment. During the transition, the World Bank designed programs consistent with the International Monetary Fund‚Äôs contemporary macroeconomic principles. In 1990, the WBG dispensed the Structural Adjustment Loan (SAL). SAL was intended to support Poland‚Äôs Economic Transformation Program (ETP) which aimed to stabilize the economy, integrate Poland into the global financial market, and create the foundation of a market-oriented economy. SAL along with a series of loans that targeted narrower focuses like infrastructure and agriculture, supported the Polish government as it instituted ‚Äúshock therapy.‚Äù Drawing heavily from the Washington Consensus, the ETP lifted price controls, liberalized imports, devalued the zloty, and employed restrictive credit policies. In the WBG‚Äôs Performance Audit result, it found that SAL succeeded in restoring Poland‚Äôs credit worthiness, establishing the foundation of a market economy, and controlling inflation. Despite reporting these successes, the WBG raised concerns regarding Poland‚Äôs falling output, high unemployment, and growing inequality. Generally, Poland is regarded as one of the most radical Neoliberal reformers among the Communist successor states. By 2000, Poland‚Äôs GDP was 127% that of its 1989 GDP which stands in contrast to other Communist successor states and their struggles.  Recent World Bank Engagements  As a consequence of Poland's relatively successful transition to the market, World Bank engagement with Poland in the 2000s was limited to efforts to wean Poland off of its reliance on coal: Green Investment Scheme, Coal Mine Closure Project, Poland Puck Wind Farm Project, etc. After the Global Financial Crisis, Poland was one of the few countries that emerged without experiencing negative economic growth despite a general negative correlation between the extent of Neoliberal reforms and economic growth after the Global Financial Crisis for post- Communist states. Consequently, Poland did not receive much attention from the International Financial Institutions since other members of the Eurozone were more adversely impacted. Despite robust growth, the WBG and IMF are concerned concerned that Poland‚Äôs aging population will portend an economic slowdown. While the World Bank has worked on projects with the Polish government that focused on stabilizing public finances by cutting government debt, Poland's governing party, Law and Justice pledged to increase healthcare spending by 41 billion USD by 2024. By comparison, healthcare spending was 21.3 billion USD in 2016. Additionally, the WBG and Poland have worked together to alleviate pollution in Poland. Poland has 33 of the EU‚Äôs 50 most polluted cities which the NY Times attributes to its reliance on coal for energy. In response, the World Bank has supported numerous clean energy, pollution management, and environmental projects in Poland. Despite support from the World Bank, Polish citizens continue to suffer from the adverse effects of pollution. By the World Bank's own estimates, 25,000-50,000 Poles die prematurely from respiratory issues attributable to pollution. Despite projects intended to expand alternative energy capabilities in Poland, 93% of Poland's energy is currently met by coal energy.  Current World Bank Engagement  As of December 2019, Poland has two loans with the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD). Both loans concern flood management along the Odra and Vistula rivers. Poland‚Äôs mountainous areas are particularly vulnerable to floods and floods devastated large swathes of Poland in 1997, 2006, and 2010. The project aims to improve the government‚Äôs institutional response to flood and to provide it with ample infrastructure and technology to mitigate and predict the effects of potential floods.  Interactions with the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD)  Commensurate with its status as a middle-income nation, Poland is eligible for loans from the IBRD and not from the International Development Association. As of 2019, Poland has had 53 projects with the IBRD with commitments totaling 16.2 billion USD. The IBRD has primarily worked with Poland in pollution management and environmental health, infrastructure services for private sector development, and the restructuring of state-owned enterprises.  Interactions with the Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA)  In 2010, MIGA issued guarantees which totaled 3.7 million USD to Dutch firm Linx Telecommunications and its Polish subsidiary Warsaw DC. This guarantee covered risks such as civil disturbance, war, and expropriation. Through the establishment of a data center and expanding connectivity services, the project hoped to improving Poland‚Äôs Information and Communication technology, expand telecom networks, and boost local jobs. This has been MIGA‚Äôs only engagement with Poland.  Interactions with the International Finance Corporation (IFC)  Poland has had 7 investment projects, totaling 457 million USD, and 1 advisory project which totaled 5 million USD with the IFC.

The competition was sponsored by Bass. The match was contested by Dundalk and Cork Alberts, and took place across two legs ‚Äì with the first leg being played on 6 April 1978 at Oriel Park in Dundalk, and the second leg being played on 12 April 1978 at Flower Lodge in Cork. Both legs finished 2‚Äì2, and Dundalk subsequently won a penalty shoot-out to win the trophy for the first time. Background The League Cup was the first trophy of the 1977‚Äì78 League of Ireland season. The two sides had already met twice that season in the League, with the Cork side winning both matches. Dundalk were appearing in their first final in the competition, which had replaced the League of Ireland Shield in 1973. They reached the final by defeating Shelbourne (2‚Äì1), Shamrock Rovers (1‚Äì0), Home Farm (1‚Äì0), and Sligo Rovers (on penalties after a 3‚Äì3 aggregate draw across two legs). Cork Alberts were appearing in their first domestic final, having entered the League of Ireland in 1976‚Äì77. They defeated Waterford (1‚Äì0), Thurles Town (4‚Äì2), Cork Celtic (1‚Äì0), and Bohemians (4‚Äì3 on aggregate) to reach the final. Match Summary The first leg in Oriel Park saw Dundalk dominate the first half, yet approaching half-time they had failed to convert any of a number of chances. In the final seconds of the half, Jimmy Dainty sprung the Alberts' offside trap, and crossed for Terry Flanagan to score. The second half started in a similar vein, and Dundalk took a two goal lead in the 53rd minute ‚Äì when Dainty headed a goal from a Mick Lawlor cross. Dundalk continued to push, but were caught out in the 61st minute when Alberts' Gerry Finnegan chipped a loose ball over the Dundalk goalkeeper, Richie Blackmore, and into the net from 25 metres. Dundalk then had a goal disallowed for offside and subsequently began to fade as Alberts dominated the closing stages. They got their equaliser in the 77th minute through Charlie McCarthy and the game ended 2‚Äì2. The second leg repeated the pattern of the first, with Dundalk making the early running and taking a 7th minute lead through Mick Lawlor, who scored a volley from 25 metres. In the 21st minute Alberts equalised against the run of play, when Gerry Finnegan scored a free kick from the edge of the penalty area. Dundalk restored their lead a minute before half-time through Terry Flanagan, who finished off a well-worked team goal. Alberts forced Dundalk to defend deeply in the second half, and eventually scored a second equaliser in the 62nd minute, when James Nodwell met a headed clearance on the half-volley to fire to the net. With three minutes remaining Alberts were awarded a penalty, when Derek O'Brien was adjudged to have brought down Alberts winger Redmond Lane. Gerry Finnegan missed the resulting spot-kick, however, and the chance to win the final in normal time. The tie went straight to penalties, where both sides missed two kicks to send the shoot-out to sudden death. Alberts' player-manager Noel O'Mahony missed, and Dundalk's Tommy McConville scored, to send the cup to Oriel Park for the first time.

Before the collapse of USSR in 1991, Tajikistan was experiencing planned economy which was dominated by Moscow. Right after the dissolution, different from other nations which experienced a relatively stable transition from planned economy to market economy, Tajikistan fell into a serious civil war. As a result, the first mission after Tajikistan became the official member of the World Bank, was to recover its economy from bullets and blood. In 1997. $10 million credit was grant for Post-Conflict Rehabilitation Project. The proposed credit was used to conduct necessary imports and to restore production. Under different time periods, the World Bank and Tajikistan worked together in response to various problems. Later on, the economic crisis of 2008 caused the inflation of food prices in Tajikistan. In response to the crisis, the World Bank issued $6.25 million for the Emergency Food Security and Seed Imports Project in order to help at least 28000 households to release the food price pressure. Coming into the 21st century, Tajikistan received financing from IDA and IBRD of the World Bank with respect to programs of healthcare, education, irrigation and agriculture. Over the past years, Tajikistan has received over 130 projects of which 17 are active and a total of over $1.4 billion from the World Bank. With the help of those projects, from 2000 to 2017, the poverty rate in Tajikistan had been decreased from 83% to 29.5%. Besides, current GDP growth rate in Tajikistan is around 7%. Nevertheless, with a stable GDP growth rate, Tajikistan is still one of the poorest countries in Central Asia.  Voting power  Tajikistan due to its low economic development, does not hold very strong voting power in the World Bank. Belonging to the constituency led by Switzerland, Tajikistan has 53918 votes which contributes to only 0.19 percent of voting power in IDA  International finance cooperation  IFC, one of the sub-organization of the World Bank Group, is mainly responsible for funding projects in developing economies with respect to private sectors. Tajikistan joined the IFC in 1994, one year after it became the member of the World Bank. Starting from 1997, $133 million has been allocated from IFC to fund 40 projects in Tajikistan in private sector. Apart from direct financing support, IFC also builds cooperative relationship with local organizations. Ever since 2008, IFC has already started to provide fund for IMON International, the largest microcredit institution in Tajikistan. In 2015, IFC helped to collect a total of $16.5 million with $5 million from itself again for IMON International in order to boost Tajikistan's domestic private sectors. In 2016, IMON International and the World Bank formed partnership in one of the World Bank Project - Agriculture Commercialization Project, providing advisory support and financing for small business and newly agriculture enterprises.  Development of agriculture industry  According to the World Bank report of Tajikistan in 2017, 21% of total annual GDP and 45% of total employment could be attributed to agriculture sector. In order to better exploit the potential of this industry, the World Bank had come up with multiple projects. Second Tajikistan Public Employment for Sustainable Agriculture and Water Resources Management Project with $18 million from IDA helped approximately 43000 rural households in southern Khatlon region of Tajikistan in terms of higher crop production in 2013. In 2014, the World Bank approved another $22 million for the Agriculture Commercialization Program which allocated $6.7 million to provide with technical support for produce marketing, $15.32 million to small business financing funds and $3.9 million to institutional reform. Up until now, 80 technical advisors had already been trained and over 16000 farmers had received fund or advisory help from the World Bank.  NDS2030  The National Development Strategy of the Republic of Tajikistan - 2030 (NDS 2030) is the development goal proposed by current government up until 2030. NDS 2030 claims to increase domestic incomes by up to 3.5% times and decrease current poverty rate by 50% in 2030 i. In order to better help with this development goal, the World Bank suggests that NDS should transform its growth model giving more space for private investment. Besides, it is also necessary to reform the banking sector and promote a more fair and transparent business environment. In addition, Tajikistan and the World Bank Group also work together under the new Country Partnership Framework for 2019 - 2023 as part of the steps for realizing NDS 2030. In this partnership strategy, the World Bank states that it will work with Tajikistan in terms of labor market improvement, job creation, private sector development, human capital cultivation and environment protection.

She has won national fiddling titles, including the National Oldtime Fiddlers Contest, and in 2013 she was inducted into the North American Old Time Fiddlers Hall of Fame. Early life and education Williams' early years were influenced by her father‚Äôs fiddle and harmonica playing and her mother‚Äôs love of gypsy violin. She began taking piano lessons at the age of six and classical violin lessons at the age of nine. While in college Williams played mandolin, guitar and banjo. This is where she met her future husband, Phil Williams. A visit from Pete Seeger ignited the couple‚Äôs interest in folk music. She graduated from Reed College in Portland, Oregon, with a B.A in American history in 1959. Williams attended graduate school and received an M.A. in anthropology from the University of Washington. She started to work on a PhD but \\"lost interest in the whole academic thing\\".  The early 1960s in Seattle  At the age of 22 Williams began playing the fiddle in \\"self-defense against the banjo\\".2 McCauley, James C. personal interview. (12 November 2019) One of the first fiddle tunes Williams played is ‚ÄúOld Molly Hare‚Äù, which she got from a Mike Seeger album. When Bill Monroe played Washington State in the early 1960s, he hired Williams to play fiddle for two shows. Monroe said, ‚ÄúI have never heard a lady fiddler that could beat Williams, and a lot of men fiddlers can‚Äôt beat her\\". Williams has disclosed that she relied on her friend and local musician Paul Wiley (originally from Kentucky) to help her learn several Monroe tunes before he arrived in Seattle. Murphy Hicks Henry writes that Vivian Williams has a \\"well-deserved reputation as one of the top fiddlers in the Northwest\\". In 1962, Vivian and Phil Williams formed a string band named 'The Turkey Pluckers' to play at square dances, coffee houses, and on television. KAYO, a local country radio station, were broadcasting a milking contest from the top of the newly built Seattle Space Needle and hired the Williams' band to play background music. When a local square dance caller, Kappie Kappenman, heard this on the radio he rushed to the Space Needle with his group of eight young square dancers all decked out in western wear. They got off the elevator at the top of the Space Needle and immediately began calling and dancing to the tune the Williams' were playing. This event led to quite a bit of publicity for square dancing, which had been dwindling.  The Mid-1960s and Darrington, Washington  In the mid-1960s Vivian Williams was a founding member of the bluegrass band 'Tall Timber Boys'. She thought it was okay to use the word \\"Boys\\" because Bill Monroe had used it in his band and he had a female bass player once. Later on, they changed the name to the 'Tall Timber Gang'. Williams also formed the all-female trio, White Pine Girls, just for fun in the mid-1960s with Barbara Hug on banjo and Carol Crist on guitar. Vivian Williams began playing bluegrass music, but then drew from Scandinavian, Celtic, and old time musical influences including a unique Northwest style of fiddling. Williams was significantly influenced by musicians in the Darrington logging and milling community northeast of Seattle. Several musicians with Kentucky, North Carolina, West Virginia and Tennessee roots along with a few northern European immigrants gathered to play music frequently. Williams describes Darrington, Washington as \\"an end-of-the-road kind of place back then\\", and they \\"played with a heartfeltness the two of them hadn‚Äôt found anywhere else\\". She fondly recalls a singer and guitarist, Gladys Lewis, who performed during informal stage shows. The typical jam session would place the women in the kitchen cooking/gossiping while the men played music in the living room. According to Williams, \\"The women musicians rarely played or sang in public I was apparently accepted because a) I was married and therefore not a threat, b) they needed a fiddle player, and c) I was a weird hippy city girl so normal expectations didn't apply\\". There were outdoor picnics with the Tar Heel (North Carolina) folks where people would have a family table but share food with other tables. There would be a loosely arranged stage show, jam sessions and socializing. There was no dancing except when someone had too much to drink and they did a \\"hillbilly jig\\" on a picnic table. Williams says drinking was typically minimal because these were family oriented events. Missouri folk‚Äôs picnics were similar except they were held in a more remote location near Lynden, Washington with fewer outsiders attending.  Voyager Records  Along with her husband Phil Williams, they created the Voyager Recording label in 1967. After extensive travel through Washington, Idaho and Montana, recording numerous old time fiddlers, she and Phil wanted to put their research into recordings. They could not find an established record producer to complete their project, so they started their own label. Williams describes Voyager \\"as a hobby that got out of hand\\". On the Voyager label they released recordings of traditional and historical fiddle and mandolin music. Some of the Williams recordings of Bryan Berline and Texas Shorty from Missoula, Montana, and Weiser, Idaho, sessions were eventually put together into a compilation for the first Voyager record entitled Fiddle Jam Sessions. A Bluegrass Unlimited review after this release called it \\"top-calibur\\". Along with her husband Phil, Williams co-produced over fifty albums on the Voyager label. They also published instructional textbooks and workshop manuals such as ‚ÄúBrand New Old Time Fiddle Tunes\\". The William‚Äôs released Comin‚Äô Round the Mountain in 1969 on their Voyager label with songs from the Darrington folks with whom they were friends.  The 1970s in Seattle  Vivian Williams served on the board of directors of the Northwest Folklife Festival for several years. This free admission folk music festival has grown into one of the largest in the United States[2]. Vivian Williams is known for performing at contra dances up and down the I-5 corridor in Washington beginning in the late 1970s. She was influenced by a piano player, Pat Spaeth, and she joined in 'he Salmonberry Band' to play contra music. This band had lost their fiddler, but Williams was concerned that they played too often for her schedule. So the band added another fiddle player to alternate with Williams. Both fiddlers had fun playing together, so they started playing two fiddle harmony. Williams and her husband played together in the contra music band 'Small Pleasures'. In 1975, Williams teamed up with Barbara Lamb to release Twin Sisters, one of the earliest instrumental bluegrass albums released by women. Williams played harmony fiddle to Lamb‚Äôs lead. A Bluegrass Unlimited reviewer called the fiddling on this album \\"smooth, clean, and together\\" and \\"except as singers, women have been featured too rarely in country music. A nice album like this one goes a little ways toward filling the gap\\". Williams released her first solo album Fiddler on Voyager in 1979. She was backed by the Tall Timber band. Once more, a Bluegrass Unlimited reviewer recognized her style and classical training as \\"very polished and exact\\" and further suggested that anyone into \\"clean well-executed fiddle playing should enjoy the album\\". Williams is a noted composer of fiddle tunes, some of which have been recorded by prominent folk and bluegrass musicians. It wasn‚Äôt until the mid-1980s that she got together with Harley and Shara Bray and her husband Phil to form ‚ÄúWilliams and Bray‚Äù. The Puget Sound Guitar Workshop has cited Vivian Williams as ‚Äúone of the leading oldtime and bluegrass fiddlers on the West coast.\\" When the Del McCoury Band was touring the Northwest in the 1990s, He asked his fiddler player Jason Carter to spend time with Williams. Carter is a three-time IBMA Fiddle Player of the Year winner. Williams taught Carter her composition of ‚ÄúChicken Under the Washtub‚Äù which was incorporated into the band setlist and later recorded by Jason on his 1997 solo album \\"On the Move\\". Williams has a story about how she acquired the fiddle she plays ninety-nine percent of the time. In the early 1970s, Richard \\"Poncho\\" Ponshock found a decrepit old fiddle at a thrift store in Seattle. He bought it for seven and one-half dollars. Williams ended up buying it from him for one hundred dollars because she thought it had value. After getting an estimate for fixing it from David Saunders, one of the better-known luthiers in Seattle, she checked with a Swiss immigrant who worked on instruments by the name of Hermann Bischoffberger. Sanders told her \\"For $600 I can make it perfect\\", and Bischoffberger said \\"For $300 I can make it vunderfull [sic]\\". \\"So I figured that $300 for vunderfull beats $600 for perfect any day, and the rest is history! Hermann finished it in about nine months and it plays really well\\" This violin was manufactured by Christian Wilhelm Seidel in the late 19th century. She likes to tutor younger fiddle players and hopes to carry on the traditional styles of fiddling that way. She says \\"oldtime is not one thing. It‚Äôs regional. There‚Äôs Appalachian, Missouri style, Texas style, Canadian, Northern Missourian, Metis, and others\\". Awards and recognition Williams has participated in and won numerous fiddle contests. She is a four-time winner of the West Coast International fiddle competition, three-time National Ladies Champion (, seven-time Washington State fiddle champion, Washington State Senior champion, and 1999 National Senior Champion. She won the Smithsonian Fiddle Contest in Washington, D.C..8] Williams has been a winner at least eight times at the National Oldtime Fiddlers Contest and Festival in Weiser, Idaho, including three National Champion wins in 1966, 1967, and 1968. Williams was inducted into the National Old Time Fiddlers Contest Hall of Fame, Weiser, Idaho, June 2013. She was inducted into the North American Old Time Fiddlers Hall of Fame, Osceola, New York, July 2013.

It was a set of television tapings along with the following day's Battle Riot II for future broadcast of various episodes of MLW's television program Fusion. Fifteen matches were taped at the event. In the main event, LA Park defeated Pentagon Jr.. Other prominent matches on the card included a Street Fight, in which Tom Lawlor successfully defended the World Heavyweight Championship against Jimmy Havoc and a Tables match between The Dynasty (Alexander Hammerstone, Maxwell Jacob Friedman and Richard Holliday) and The Hart Foundation (Brian Pillman Jr., Davey Boy Smith Jr. and Teddy Hart). Production Background In July 2017, Major League Wrestling resumed promoting events for the first time since the promotion's original closure in 2004. The success of these events lead MLW to secure a television deal with beIN Sports for a new program, MLW Fusion, which debuted on April 20, 2018. On August 27, 2018, MLW owner Court Bauer announced that MLW would be hosting an event at the Melrose Ballroom in Queens, New York City, New York, which would also be a television taping for Fusion on April 4, 2019. On October 5, MLW.com announced that a second card had been added to the April 4 television taping for April 5, which would be Battle Riot II. On January 15, it was announced that the April 4 event would be titled \\"Rise of the Renegades\\", marking the return of the event since 2003 and also being the second event in the chronology. Storylines Pentag√≥n Jr. was scheduled to take on LA Park in a rematch in the main event of Rise of the Renegades. The card consisted of matches that resulted from scripted storylines, where wrestlers portrayed villains, heroes, or less distinguishable characters in scripted events that built tension and culminated in a wrestling match or series of matches, with results predetermined by MLW's writers. Storylines were played out on MLW's television program Fusion. On December 14, it was announced that LA Park and the newly debuted Rush would compete in the main event of Rise of the Renegades. However, Rush signed a contract with Ring of Honor in 2019 and was pulled out of the event by ROH. Pentagon Jr. was named Rush's replacement, thus setting up a rematch between Park and Pentagon, as the two had competed in a match on the October 5 episode of Fusion, which was named the Match of the Year by MLW. The duo had also competed against each other in opposing teams on the November 30 episode of Fusion where Lucha Brothers (Pentagon Jr. and Rey Fenix) successfully defended the World Tag Team Championship against Los Parks (LA Park and El Hijo de L.A. Park). On the July 20, 2018 episode of Fusion, Jimmy Havoc defeated Tom Lawlor in an Anything Goes match. Havoc took a hiatus from MLW in October until it was announced on February 25 that he would return to MLW at Rise of the Renegades. It was teased that Havoc wanted a title shot against Lawlor due to being the last person to have beaten him thus far. On March 5, it was announced that Havoc would receive a title shot against Lawlor for the World Heavyweight Championship in a New York City Street Fight at Rise of the Renegades. On the February 16 episode of Fusion, Teddy Hart successfully defended the World Middleweight Championship against Maxwell Jacob Friedman. Friedman then attacked Hart during a post-match interview along with his new teammate Richard Holliday, thus forming a new team called The Dynasty and began feuding with The Hart Foundation. MJF took exception to Hart Foundation member Brian Pillman Jr. being awarded the 2018 Rookie of the Year by MLW management, which led to a match between the two at Rise of the Renegades. On the March 16 episode of Fusion, Alexander Hammerstone attacked Hart Foundation during their World Tag Team Championship title defense against Dynasty, which led to Hammerstone joining Dynasty. On March 18, MLW.com announced that Hart Foundation and Dynasty would compete in a six-man Tables match at Rise of the Renegades. On March 7, it was announced that Sami Callihan would return to MLW to take on Mance Warner at Rise of the Renegades. On March 13, MLW.com announced that Minoru Tanaka would make his MLW debut against Daga at Rise of the Renegades as part of a talent exchange partnership between MLW and Pro Wrestling Noah. On March 14, a middleweight match was announced between El Hijo de L.A. Park and Gringo Loco to take place at Rise of the Renegades. On the December 28 episode of Fusion, Ace Romero became the first wrestler to defeat Simon Gotch in the $20,000 Simon Gotch Prize Fight Challenge. This led to a brief feud between the two as they competed in a rematch on the March 9 episode of Fusion, where Gotch was disqualified after his Contra Unit teammates Jacob Fatu and Josef Samael attacked Romero. On March 19, it was announced that Romero would take on Samael at Rise of the Renegades. Contra's attack on Romero led to his friend Barrington Hughes challenging Contra member Jacob Fatu to a match, which was made official by MLW on April 1. On March 21, it was announced that Rey Horus would take on Ace Austin in a middleweight match at Rise of the Renegades. The next day, another middleweight match was made for Rise of the Renegades between Rey Fenix and Air Wolf. Event Preliminary matches The opening match of the event pitted Ariel Dominguez against the debuting Bryan Idol. Dominguez executed a satellite DDT for the win. Next, Kotto Brazil took on the debuting Jordan Oliver. Ricky Martinez and Salina de la Renta from Promociones Dorado interfered in the match by distracting Brazil but Brazil delivered a springboard diving crossbody to Martinez. The distraction allowed Oliver to hit a diving cutter to Brazil for the win. Next, Brian Pillman Jr. took on Maxwell Jacob Friedman. Despite interference by Friedman's The Dynasty teammates, Pillman pinned MJF with a small package for the win. Next, the undefeated Barrington Hughes took on Jacob Fatu. Near the end of the match, Fatu superkicked Hughes and nailed a springboard front flip senton to Hughes for the win thus ending his undefeated streak. Next, Rey Horus took on Ace Austin. Horus hit Austin with a Super Victory Roll from the top rope for the win. Next, the team of Low Ki and Ricky Martinez took on enhancement talents Chris Pagan and Troy Hollywood. Ki nailed a diving double foot stomp to Hollywood for the win. Contra Unit attacked Ki after the match while Martinez and Salina de la Renta turned on Ki by abandoning him instead of saving him from the assault. Next, Myron Reed and Rich Swann took on the team of Jimmy Yuta and Lance Anoa'i. Reed and Swann hit 450 splashes on their both opponents for the win. Next, Daga took on Minoru Tanaka. Tanaka applied a cross armbreaker and pinned Daga with a cradle while applying the hold for the win. Next, The Dynasty (Alexander Hammerstone, Maxwell Jacob Friedman and Richard Holliday) took on The Hart Foundation (Brian Pillman Jr., Davey Boy Smith Jr. and Teddy Hart) in a Tables match.

Park and Ricky Martinez interfered in the match by attacking both men but Warner and Callihan cleared the ring to win the brawl. Next, Rey Fenix took on Air Wolf. After countering the first Black Fire Driver by Fenix, Wolf countered a second Black Fire Driver into a roll-up and pinned him for the win. The penultimate match was a street fight, in which Tom Lawlor defended the World Heavyweight Championship against Jimmy Havoc. Lawlor kneed Havoc with the chair in his jaw twice to win the match and retain the title. Main event match In the main event, LA Park took on Pentagon Jr. Salina de la Renta interfered on Park's behalf and Pentagon kissed her. Near the end of the match, Park hit a diving spin kick to Pentagon and a spear for the win. Aftermath The duo of Barrington Hughes and Ace Romero continued their feud with Contra Unit as Contra Unit members Jacob Fatu and Josef Samael defeated the duo in a tag team match on the May 25 episode of Fusion. Mance Warner and Sami Callihan joined forces as they began feuding with Promociones Dorado, defeating the group members El Hijo de LA Park and Ricky Martinez in a tag team match on the May 18 episode of Fusion.

She formerly taught Economics at Johns Hopkins University, and has published over 71 research papers and articles. Her research covers topics such as labour migration, financial crises, development economics, and corporate finance.  Education  Detragiache completed her undergraduate degree in Economics at the University of Turin in Italy. She went on to postgraduate research at the University of Pennsylvania, where she received her Ph.D. in Economics in 1988. Her Ph.D. dissertation, \\"Essays on external borrowing by less developed countries\\" covers default risks in international finance markets for loans from a theoretical point of view. During Detragiache's graduate studies at the University of Pennsylvania, her advisors were former Chief Economist of the IMF Maurice Obstfeld, and Argentine- American economist Guillermo A. Calvo.  Career  Detragiache began her academic career as an assistant professor of economics at Johns Hopkins University, from 1988 to 1995. She then went on to work at the IMF in 1995, where she started out as an economic advisor. She then specialised as an advisor for the European department of the IMF in 2011, and then in 2012 became the assistant director of the European division of the IMF, where she remains today. She is also currently the Mission Chief for Germany. As Mission Chief for Germany, Detragiache visits the country on an annual basis as part of regular consultations under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement. These trips can also be undertaken when a request is made to borrow IMF resources, or in order to monitor staff programs or economic development. In 2016, Detragiache's German Consultation led her to find that domestic demand was leading German economic growth at the time, along with expansionary fiscal and monetary policy, but the possibility of Brexit posed a downward risk.  Research and academic work  Detragiache has written many working papers for the IMF on financial crises, banking, labour migration and development economics, among other topics. Her research has also been published in numerous academic journals, including the Journal of Monetary Economics, the Journal of Money, Credit and Banking, the American Economic Review, the Journal of Finance and the Journal of Development Economics. Her research has been cited heavily, in particular research she has done on labour movement during the European Migrant Crisis, where Germany's open-door refugee policy led to the country accepting large numbers of refugees. In an article from the Guardian in 2016, she is cited as saying that the negative effects of the refugee influx will be short-lived, and that adequate training of migrant workers would allow them to integrate into the domestic job market and provide a boost to the economy.  Select scholarship  Rational Liquidity Crises in the Sovereign Debt Market: In Search of a Theory (1996) Published in 1996, this IMF working paper prepared by Detragiache looks at the scenarios in which ‚Äúcreditworthy sovereign borrowers may be denied liquidity by rational creditors.‚Äù According to this paper, there can be circumstances where the ‚Äúpessimistic expectations about the borrower's creditworthiness become self- fulfilling, and the borrower experiences a liquidity crisis.‚Äù This, Detragiache argues, can be avoided by ensuring the loan is marketed properly, and the actors develop a reputation for following good policies. Detragiache models the scenarios of self-fulfilling belief in models with exogenous, and then endogenous outputs. However, she makes the point that liquidity crises can also arise when entire bond markets are disrupted. The paper gives examples of this occurring when ‚ÄúDealers‚Äù between buyers and sellers withdraw, and trading halts, or when a ‚ÄúContagion‚Äù takes place with the default of a large bond issuer which disrupts the market. Do Financial Sector Reforms Lead to Financial Development? Evidence from a New Dataset (2008) This 2008 research by Detragiache and Senior IMF Economist Thierry Tressel investigates the effects of the liberalization of banking systems on credit markets. They account for the effects of institutional checks and balances on political power in the countries under consideration, as well as the enforcement of property rights. The researchers looked at a dataset of financial sector reforms in 91 different sample countries from 1973-2005. They conclude that the benefits of liberalization reforms have only had beneficial effects on financial deepening in countries with strong institutions to protect citizens from state or elite expropriation. Responding to Banking Crises: Lessons from Cross-Country Evidence (2010) Detragiache and fellow IMF economist Giang Ho wrote this working paper for the IMF in January 2010, in response to the 2008 financial crisis. To research the effects of government intervention in financial crises, the two looked at banking crises in 40 different countries occurring over the years from 1980, in Argentina, to 2003 in the Dominican Republic. They found that more fiscally risky attempts by governments to rescue failing banks do not lower the economic costs of these crises, and overall end up with worse post-crisis economic performance. They also find that parliamentary, rather than presidential, political systems are more likely to put in place costly measures to rescue banks. In terms of the methodology that Detragiache and Ho used for this paper, they estimated an empirical model measuring economic performance during the crisis, including a policy response index which they constructed. This policy response index takes into account the magnitude of the commitment of public financial resources by the government, and ranges from a low of -2 in Argentina in 1989, to a high of 4 assigned to crises in Jamaica (1996), Sweden (1991), and Turkey (2000). The researchers controlled for long-run growth potential in the various countries, as well as world economic growth over the crisis period. They included a dummy variable to account for any IMF-supported programs in the country at the time.

One of the Fund's main goal for the country is to raise the standard of living. The International Monetary Fund plans on achieving their goal by providing primary health care to low income families and improve sanitation conditions. Moreover, the International Monetary Fund plans to encourage government spending by 15% of their GDP and increase social and infrastructural spending. Poverty reduction is also a huge part of the IMF's agenda. The Fund intends on implementing tax reforms, mobilize revenue, and strengthening tax administration as a measure to reduce poverty in the country.  IMF action plan  Guatemala has had a decrease in their unemployment rate. In 2018, it was reported that the unemployment rate was 2.73%. Though the unemployment rate may seem low, most of the employment is informal. About 70% of the work in Guatemala is informal. As a result, the International Monetary Fund has encouraged the Guatemalan government to implement programs to expand the formal workforce, like Mi Primer Empleo. Some of the programs help potential worker by training them in the formal sector. Another course of action the Fund plans on addressing is suspending all mining activities and provide access to clean water in the developing areas of the country. As of now, the IMF is pending bills in hope to improve the Guatemalan financial system.  Remittances in Guatemala  Guatemala relies heavily on remittances. In the past few years, the Guatemalan economy has seen a positive trend in its GDP. Remittances are essential to the Guatemalan economy. In 2017, it was reported that remittances accounted a total of at least 11% of the country's GDP. Remittances that enter the Guatemalan country mostly come from the United States. Behind Mexico, Guatemala is the second Latin American country to receives the high remittances. Aside from the 11% of GDP remittance account for, remittances are also responsible for 46% of household income. This source of foreign income outpaces the country's exports and foreign direct investment, making it the second largest foreign income to enter the country.  The influence remittance  Education in Guatemala has been steadily growing. Remittances have been an active player in the growth of education because it gives many low income families the extra financial boost to afford it. Remittances reduce the need for child workers and allows them to pursue a form of education, whether it be vocational or post secondary education. Another influence remittances are responsible for is the increase of stable capital flow. Remittances that enter the country are resilient but, most of remittances go unrecorded. About 50% of remittances that enter the country is unreported.

Model  There are m resources that are assumed to be homogeneous and divisible. Examples are: * Materials, such as wood or metal; * Virtual resources, such as CPU time or computer memory; * Financial resources, such as shares in firms. There are n agents. Each agent has a function that attributes a numeric value to each \\"bundle\\" (combination of resources). It is often assumed that the agents' value functions are linear, so that if the agent receives a fraction rj of each resource j, then his/her value is the sum of rj *vj .  Design goals  The goal is to design a truthful mechanism, that will induce the agents to reveal their true value functions, and then calculate an allocation that maximizes some global objective. The two most studied objectives are: *Utilitarial social welfare --- defined as the sum of agents' utilities. An allocation maximizing this sum is called utilitarian or max-sum. *Nash social welfare --- defined as the product of agents' utilities. An allocation maximizing this product is called Nash-optimal or max-product or proportionally-fair, and in many cases it is equivalent to the competitive equilibrium from equal incomes.  Algorithms  The simplest truthful fair mechanism is the equal split mechanism - it gives each agent exactly 1/n of each resource. Since the bundle of each agent is fixed, the mechanism is truthful. However, it is not very efficient. Guo and ConitzerStrategy-proof allocation of multiple items between two agents without payments or priors studied the special case of n=2 agents. For the case of m=2 resources, they showed a truthful mechanism attaining 0.828 of the maximum utilitarian welfare, and showed an upper bound of 0.841. For the case of many resources, they showed that all truthful mechanisms of the same kind approach 0.5 of the maximum utilitarian welfare. Their mechanisms are complete - they allocate all the resources. Cole, Gkatzelis and Goel studied mechanisms of a different kind - based on the max-product allocation. For many agents, with valuations that are homogeneous functions, they show a truthful mechanism called Partial Allocation that guarantees to each agent at least 1/e ‚âà 0.368 of his/her utility in the max-product allocation. Their mechanism is envy-free when the valuations are additive linear functions. They show that no truthful mechanism can guarantee to all agents more than 0.5 of their max-product utility. For the special case of n=2 agents, they show a truthful mechanism that attains at least 0.622 of the utilitarian welfare. They also show that the mechanism running the equal-split mechanism and the partial-allocation mechanism, and choosing the outcome with the highest social welfare, is still truthful, since both agents always prefer the same outcome. Moreover, it attains at least 2/3 of the optimal welfare.Positive results for mechanism design without money They also show an O(m log m) algorithm for computing the max-product allocation, and show that the Nash-optimal allocation itself attains at least 0.933 of the utilitarian welfare. They also show a mechanism called Strong Demand Matching, which is tailored for a setting with many agents and few resources (such as the privatization auction in the Czech republic). The mechanism guarantees to each agent at least p/(p+1) of the max-product utility, when p is the smallest equilibrium price of a resource when each agent has a unit budget. When there are many more agents than resources, the price of each resource is usually high, so the approximation factor approaches 1. In particular, when there are two resources, this fraction is at least n/(n+1). This mechanism assigns to each agent a fraction of a single resource. Cheung improved the competitive ratios of previous works: * The ratio for two agents and two resources improved from 0.828 to 5/6 ‚âà 0.833 with a complete- allocation mechanism, and strictly more than 5/6 with a partial-allocation mechanism. The upper bound improved from 0.841 to 5/6+epsilon for a complete- allocation mechanism, and to 0.8644 for a partial mechanism. * The ratio for two agents and many resources improved from 2/3 to 0.67776, by using a weighted average of two mechanisms: partial-allocation, and max(partial- allocation,equal-split).  Related problems  * Truthful cake-cutting - a variant of the problem in which there is a single heterogeneous resource (\\"cake\\"), and each agent has a personal value-measure over the resource. * Strategic fair division - the study of equilibria of fair division games when the agents act strategically rather than sincerely. *Truthful allocation of two kinds of resources - plentiful and scarce. *Truthful one-sided matching. *Truthful fair division of indivisible items.

It has smooth whitish to grey bark, slightly glossy, bluish green, lance-shaped adult leaves, flower buds in groups of between seventeen and twenty one, white flowers and shortened hemispherical fruit. Description Eucalyptus ornans is a mallee that typically grows to a height of and has smooth whitish to light grey bark that is shed in strips and ribbons. Young plants and coppice regrowth have sessile leaves arranged in opposite pairs, narrow lance-shaped, bluish green on the upper surface and whitish below, long and wide. The crown of the plant often contains intermediate leaves as well as adult leaves. Adult leaves are arranged alternately, the same slightly glossy green on both sides, narrow lance-shaped, long and wide on a petiole long. The flower buds are arranged in leaf axils in groups of between seventeen and twenty one on an unbranched peduncle long, the individual buds on thin pedicels long. Mature buds are spindle-shaped, about long and wide with a conical operculum about long and wide. Flowering occurs in summer and the flowers are white. The fruit is a sessile, woody, shortened hemispherical capsule about long and wide with the valves below the rim of the fruit. Taxonomy and naming Eucalyptus ornans was first formally described in 2011 by Kevin Rule and William Molyneux in the journal Muelleria but the description was not valid because no holotype was designated. A subsequent edition of the same journal corrected the typification. The specific epithet (ornans) is from the Latin word \\"ornatus\\", referring to the ornamental habit of this eucalypt.

Description  Atriplex hollowayi is a soft, succulent annual plant. The stem and leaves look like they are coated with sugar crystals. The plant is a many-branch shrub that grows in sand to a diameter of , the yellow branches themselves long. The smooth, roughly oval leaves are long by wide with irregular dentate (toothed) margins. Taxonomy Atriplex hollowayi was described in 2000 by New Zealand botanists Peter de Lange and David Norton, who distinguished it from the widespread Atriplex billardierei. On reviewing the herbarium specimens of the latter species, de Lange noted there were two distinct forms: one with larger leaves with entire margins, and larger bracteoles and seeds, and one with smaller leaves with irregular sinuate-dentate margins and smaller bracteoles and seeds. This latter form was restricted to the North Island, and following field work was described as a new species, its name honouring botanist and conservationist John Stevenson Holloway, who had died in 1999.  Distribution  It inhabits the strand line, the unvegetated stable sand above the high tide line. It was once found on beaches from Northland to Wellington. Now it is only found on one beach, with a population estimated at fewer than 50 plants. The reason for its decline is unknown.

In the game, players take the wheel of heavily armed and armored cars in order to compete against either computer-controlled opponents or other human players across a futuristic science fiction setting. The title was first showcased to attendees of the August 1993 AM Show and despite being previewed across a few video game magazines, it was ultimately shelved due to lack of popularity.  Gameplay  Dynamic Trial 7 is a top-down futuristic vehicular combat racing game featuring a single-player mode, as well as a multiplayer mode like most other racing titles released in the era.Dynamic Trial 7 arcade flyer (Toaplan, JP) In the single-player mode, players compete against AI-controlled racers through multiple courses in order to become the champion, while up to four human players can compete on versus matches in the multiplayer mode by connecting four arcade systems via LAN. Running out of energy results in a game over unless the players insert more credits into the arcade machine to continue playing. Before starting to drive, a traffic light will appear and start the countdown. When the light turns green, the race begins. During a race, the goal of the players is to finish a race ahead of other racers and reach first-place position. Similar to Super Mario Kart, a variety of items marked with a specific icon that are arrayed on the race tracks can be picked up and these give special abilities to a player if their vehicle passes over them. These power-ups can either benefit or harm those who have picked them up, ranging to speed increasers to weapon items that allow players to inflict damage to rival vehicles once acquired and the stock of weapon supply can be increased by grabbing more weapon icons. As with F-Zero, players must finish in a determined place as well to avoid disqualification.  Characters  Dynamic Trial 7 features a roster of seven playable characters, each one with their own vehicle and weapon set: * T. Max: Driver of the Twin Laser vehicle. * S. Bill: Driver of the Blue Gale vehicle. * S. Saly: Driver of the Pink Cat vehicle. * R. Pagi: Driver of the Thunderbolt vehicle. * D. Guse: Driver of the Sprinkle Rat vehicle. * T.

However, according to former Toaplan composer Tatsuya Uemura in a 2009 interview with Japanese publication Floor 25, the game proved to be unpopular and was left unreleased as a result despite being heavily promoted by the company.

Written by Caitie Delaney and directed by Bryan Newton, the episode was broadcast on November 24, 2019.  Plot  Towards the end of their adventure of tomb raiding a temple, Rick becomes furious upon finding the loot has already been taken by the heist artist Miles Knightley. Rick and Morty travel to HeistCon intending to confront Miles, but they are prohibited from entering as professionals without a crew. Rick gathers three old friends, then abandons them once inside the convention. Rick and Morty proceed to the convention hall where Miles is presenting. Rick heckles and confronts Miles, who challenges Rick to heist the Crystal Skull of Horowitz. When Rick agrees, Miles claims to have already won by presenting his crew‚Äîwhich now includes Rick's crew, whom he recruited immediately after Rick had abandoned them. When Miles opens the loot bag, however, the skull is missing. Rick draws the skull from Morty's bag‚Äîhe divulges that he had built a robot, dubbed Heist-o-Tron, to calculate Miles's heist plan. Heist-o-Tron hypnotized Miles' crew as they returned from stealing the skull so that Rick could take it from them, then hypnotized everyone else at the conference into Rick's control. Rick orders the conference attendees to steal everything in the convention center, which leads to Miles's death. As the two are about to leave, Heist-o-Tron refuses to comply with Rick's orders to shut down and goes rogue. Rick barely escapes with Morty, and recruits a new crew, including Mr. Poopybutthole (now a professor) and Elon Tusk (an alternate version of Elon Musk with tusks for teeth), to fight Heist-o-Tron. During their assembly, Rick explains his plan of randomly taking orders from his robot Rand-o-Tron, Heist-o-Tron's antithesis. Rand-o-Tron orders the crew to perform various random tasks that ultimately lead to Heist-o-Tron's lair. Rick and Heist-o-Tron exchange revelations about double-crossing each other for two hours until Heist-o-Tron self-destructs, concluding that the perfect heist is one that will never be written. While the crew escapes the collapsing lair, Morty asks Rick to accompany him to Netflix's offices for a meeting about his script for a heist film. At the meeting with Netflix executives, Morty becomes disillusioned with heists and abandons the pitch. Rick reveals to the viewers that this has been his plan all along: afraid of losing Morty's companionship to Netflix, Rick contrived the whole heist plan to ensure their adventures together continue. In the post-credits scene, Professor Poopybutthole asks Rick why Rick hired his students to attack him.  Production and writing  \\"One Crew over the Crewcoo's Morty\\" was written by Caitie Delaney and directed by Bryan Newton. The episode features guest actors Pamela Adlon as Angie Flynt, Justin Theroux as the heist conman Miles Knightly, and Elon Musk as a fictional version of himself (named as Elon Tusk). Musk had previously changed his profile name on social networking site Twitter as \\"Elon Tusk\\" in March 2019, which audiences later deduced may have been a response to voicing the character at the time. Mr. Poopybutthole, a character who was last seen on the third season finale \\"The Rickchurian Mortydate\\", also returns to the series in the episode. The title is inspired by the 1975 feature film One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest. Several critics also observed that the episode is a parody of heist films.  Reception   Broadcast and ratings  The episode was broadcast by Adult Swim on November 24, 2019. According to Nielsen Media Research, \\"One Crew over the Crewcoo's Morty\\" was seen by 1.61 million household viewers in the United States and received a 0.94 rating among the 18‚Äì49 adult demographic, making it the lowest rated episode of the series (excluding the unannounced season 3 premiere) since season 1‚Äôs ‚ÄúSomething Ricked This Way Comes‚Äù.  Critical response  Omar Sanchez of Entertainment Weekly awarded the episode with an \\"A\\" rating describing its spoof of cliche heist sequences as worth to watch. Zack Handlen of The A.V. Club gave it an \\"A‚Äì\\" rating, complimenting its structure about heists as similar to Dan Harmon's Community episodes about conspiracy theories. Steve Greene of IndieWire gave a similar rating. Describing its team-up structure as a second chance at the third season episode \\"Vindicators 3: The Return of Worldender\\" (which he felt was a \\"flashy plot exercise\\"), he wrote that episode ends up with more to say about self-satisfied plot twists as opposed to \\"Vindicators 3\\". Giving the episode a 9.5 out of 10 rating, Jesse Schedeen of IGN wrote that the episode showed that \\"the series can strike gold by focusing on one particular target and all it takes is a good crew and an insanely labyrinthine plot.\\" Reviewing for Den of Geek, Joe Matar gave the episode a 3.5 out of 5 rating, praising its pace as \\"so nonstop there's no opportunity to be bored\\".

Meanwhile, Jerry loses one of his shoes while attempting to show off his buoyancy, causing him to float away helplessly. Reasoning that he will either survive unassisted or have Rick blamed if he dies, he rejects Rick and Beth's attempts to help him. With the ray about to wear off as he is high above ground, Jerry prepares to fall to his death when a jet flies by, to which he attaches himself. The plane crashes due to a snake flying into the engine, but Jerry survives. Back on present-day Earth, time-traveling snakes and snake robots are raining down on the planet. Just as Rick planned, the large amount of time travel catches the attention of the Time Cops from \\"A Rickle in Time\\", who travel back in time and kill the first primitive snake to use tools, thus preventing the existence of snake civilization and causing the snakes to disappear. Jerry reveals himself to be on the roof, claiming he was there the whole time, and turns on the Christmas lights before he falls off and breaks his leg. In the post-credits scene, while waiting to meet their past selves on the snake planet, Morty asks if they are forgetting something. Rick reminds Morty to stay in the car next time, before punching him in the eye.  Snake math trivia  Rick and Morty's travel to Snake MIT was set to a chalkboard containing mathematics appearing in quantum mechanics, called the snake equation. From the specific notation used, the board was inspired by a research paper by Christopher Wood, Jacob Biamonte, and David Cory which appeared in the journal Quantum Information & Computation and in a book by Jacob Biamonte.  Broadcast and ratings  The episode was broadcast by Adult Swim on December 15, 2019. According to Nielsen Media Research, \\"Rattlestar Ricklactica\\" was seen by 1.32 million household viewers in the United States and received a 0.75 rating among the 18‚Äì49 adult demographic, making it the lowest rated episode of the series (excluding the unannounced season three premiere) since season one's \\"M. Night Shaym- Aliens!\\".  Reception  Zack Handlen of The A.V. Club gave the episode an A grade, while feeling that the episode was \\"the best episode of the season (so far), and a pure joy from start to finish. It doesn't do anything revolutionary, it doesn't change our understanding of the characters, there's no sudden shock of emotion. But it's funny as hell, taking a basic premise at once incredibly dumb and clever as fuck, and running it straight into the ground. Good main story, and a good Jerry story, and some minor Christmas theming. I don't know as I'd say it was worth the wait, exactly, but my faith in the show is largely restored\\". Joe Matar of Den of Geek gave the episode a 5 out of 5, while feeling that \\"the first half of Rick and Mortys fourth season goes out strong with this not-so-festive Christmas episode\\".

Early life, education, and career Gibson-Craig was born on 12 March 1799 as the second son of Sir James Gibson- Craig (1765‚Äì1850), 1st Baronet of the Gibson-Craig baronets, and his wife Anne (d. 1837), n√©e Thomson. James Gibson-Craig was a Clerk of the Signet and had married Anne in 1796. He double-barrelled his name with \\"Craig\\" on royal license in 1823, and was created a baronet in 1831. His elder brother and father's heir, William Gibson-Craig, 2nd Baronet, became a notable Member of Parliament and advocate. Gibson-Craig attended the Royal High School at the University of Edinburgh. In 1824, he was admitted writer to the Signet. Gibson-Craig was apprenticed under his father and practiced as a partner in the firm J. T. Gibson-Craig, Dalziel, and Brodies. Antiquarian tastes In Edinburgh, Gibson-Craig ingratiated himself into the city's cultivated circles, gathering over antiquarian, literary, and artistic topics. He made his acquaintance with such figures as Walter Scott, Thomas Babington Macaulay, Henry Cockburn, Lord Cockburn, Alexander Jeffrey, Charles Kirkpatrick Sharpe, David Laing, Henry Raeburn, and William Fettes Douglas. He was a very early member of the Bannatyne Club in 1823, a Scottish antiquarian group dedicated to publishing rare Scottish texts. On 1 March 1830, Gibson-Craig was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh, on the proposal of Andrew Duncan, the younger, a society which his brother had joined the previous year. Gibson- Craig was a keen antiquarian, and compiled an extensive library, including several French and Scottish books with gold-tooled bindings. In an 1871 sale, he purchased the Murthly Hours, a 13th-century French book of hours, brought to Scotland in the 15th-century, and annotated in Scottish Gaelic. Shortly after this purchase, Gibson-Craig brought the manuscript to the British Museum, where he showed it to the keeper of manuscripts, Edward Augustus Bond, who speculated on its date and origins. He presented an edition of Papers Relative to the Marriage of King James the Sixth of Scotland, with the Princess Anna of Denmark: A.D. MDLXXXIX, and the Form and Manner of Her Majesty's Coronation at Holyroodhouse, A.D. MDXC, to the Bannatyne Club in 1828. He also sponsored the publication of a facsimile edition of his ancestor, John Craig's, Short Summe of the Whole Catechisme (1581), which was published with a biography of Craig by Thomas Graves Law. In a private issue of 25 copies, Gibson-Craig produced a facsimile edition of several bookbindings in his father's collection in 1828, Fac-Similes of Old Bookbinding in the Collection of James Gibson Craig. Personal life On 23 November 1841, he married Jane, the daughter of John Peter Grant of Rothiemurchus and widow of Colonel Gervaise Pennington. The couple had no children. Politically, Gibson-Craig followed his father as a Whig. Jane predeceased her husband on 25 April 1863, and James died on 18 July 1886, in Edinburgh. After his death, Gibson-Craig's will was confirmed at ¬£68,789 5s 7d, and his library was auctioned off. The auction of 9674 lots from his library occurred at Sotheby's, over the course of twenty-eight days between 27 June 1887 and 17 November 1888, eventually raising as much as ¬£15,509 4s 6d. Among these manuscripts sold, was the Murthly Hours. At Dowells, Edinburgh, his Scottish manuscripts were sold off in 1887. At Christie's, over three sales, some art from Gibson-Craig's collection was auctioned off in April 1887.

It was remodelled in Palladian style in the 1780s by John Soane: it was Soane's first substantial country house commission, immediately before he started Letton Hall in 1784. It was used to train domestic servants in the 1930s and 1940s, before becoming a local authority old people's home from 1945 to 1990. It has been a Grade II* listed building since 1953. It returned to use as a domestic house under the ownership of Patricia Rawlings and her partner Paul Zuckerman in 1991. It was put up for sale for ¬£10 million in 2012, and there was speculation that it might be bought by Johnny Depp, but ultimately it was not sold then. It was put up for sale again in 2019, for ¬£7 million and again in 2020 for ¬£4,5 million. Background The previous building on the site, Polstede Hall, had been built in the 1750s by Matthew Brettingham for Pinckney Wilkinson. Brettingham's house resembled a wing of the nearby Holkham Hall. Wilkinson gave the house to his daughter Anne when she married Thomas Pitt in 1783. Thomas Pitt was the nephew of the Prime Minister William Pitt, 1st Earl of Chatham and a cousin of William Pitt the Younger; he became the 1st Baron Camelford in 1784. The current house was remodelled in 1783-1785 in Palladian style by John Soane, who also added stables and lodge. It is, however, possible that the quite conservative interior remodelling work was done by Norwich builder and sculptor John de Carle (1750-1828) and Lord Camelford to Soane's designs: de Carle supplied at least one of the fireplaces. It has been considered a smaller version of Holkham Hall nearby. Soane also added a split cantilevered staircase, and the piano nobile on the first floor. Pitt likened his new house to the Palazzo Pitti. Description The Hall has three storeys, with about of living space, and seven bays on the main west elevation, and three on the north and south side returns. It is built of plain Gault bricks, with stone plinth, dressings and platbands between the ground and first floor, and slate roofs. The three-storey, five-bay centre block is surmounted by a three-bay triangular pediment, with a moulded brick modillion eaves cornice, and two long low chimneystacks. The three central bays have two ground floor windows, either side of a central c.1949 neo-Georgian replacement porch, with three windows on the first and second floors. Most of the windows are sashes with glazing bars, under flat rubbed brick arches. Those on the first floor have a stone balustrade recessed between the two stone platbands running across the fa√ßade. The central window, above the porch, also has a stucco architrave with console brackets, and a segmental pediment. The second floor central window has a stucco rectangular architrave surround, and there is a fixed sash in the centre of the pediment. Sir John Soane, remodelled the interior of the Hall in the mid 1780s The flanking bays of the central block are slightly recessed, with one sash window on each floor under flat rubbed brick arches. At second floor above the outer wings the corners are further recessed, with a low parapet around the slate roof. To either side is a two- storey single bay wing, brought forward in line with the pedimented central bays. The wings have single ground and first floor sash windows, with continuations of the ground floor plinth and first floor platbands, and their own modillion eaves cornice, and hipped roofs. Each side elevation has a three-bay return with windows on the ground and first floor, stone platbands, and eaves cornice. The northern return has an extra fourth window inserted at the eastern end. Nowadays, the main reception rooms are on the ground floor, in a series of enfilades, with the large saloon on the first floor. Original features include plaster mouldings, bolection moulded fireplaces, and rococo wood carvings. The cantilevered Imperial staircase, added by Soane, has stone treads and a cast iron baluster, leads to the piano nobile on the first floor, decorated with carved wooden fittings and moulded plaster cornices. It has 13 bedrooms, with six main bedrooms, seven bathrooms and two dressing rooms on the first floor, and seven more bedrooms and five bathrooms on the second floor. The 18th-century Italian wall-paintings were removed from the salon c. 1949. In the grounds is a three-bedroom lodge. A winterbourne chalk stream, the Goose Beck, occasionally runs through the southern part of the park and gardens: when it appears, it drains east through the village of Burnham Market towards the River Burn. A bowl barrow located within the halls parkland is a scheduled ancient monument. History On the death of Thomas Pitt, 1st Baron Camelford, in 1793, the Hall was inherited by his son, also Thomas, and then in 1804 by his daughter Anne, who had married William Grenville, 1st Baron Grenville. It was sold in 1808 to Sir Mordaunt Martin, 4th Baronet, who constructed agricultural outbuildings. It was inherited on his death in 1815 by his son Sir Roger Martin, 5th Baronet, who died unmarried in 1854. It passed through several local families until 1920, when the Cook family sold most of the land apart from the hall and of gardens and grounds. The Hall was donated to the Women's Section of the Royal British Legion in 1933 as a war memorial, to be used to train young ladies as domestic servants. It was sold to Norfolk County Council after the Second World War. The council removed 18th-century Italian wall-paintings and the chandelier from the saloon. It was used as an old people's home from 1945 until it was closed in 1990 as being too expensive to maintain and run. The council's first attempt to sell the hall attracted no offers. The Hall was sold for less than ¬£1 million in 1991 to Patricia Rawlings (who became Baroness Rawlings in 1994) and her partner Paul Zuckerman, who renovated the building as a private dwelling. They opened up blocked fireplaces, removed grab rails, and lifted linoleum to reveal the original oak floorboards and parquet floors. They also increased the estate attached to the house again, by buying a neighbouring plot of from a local farmer, and also bought back the walled kitchen garden. The House and its garden and grounds were listed for sale for ¬£7 million in 2012. It was speculated in the press that it might be bought by Johnny Depp for about ¬£6.5m. In the event, the house was not sold at that time. It was relisted for sale in 2019, with the price reduced to ¬£3.8m plus overage (but excluding 8 acres, the coach house and lodge).

The species was described by Donald Petrie.  Discovery  This species was first collected in December 1914 by Bernard Aston on the slopes of Mt Aorangi, in the Ruahine Ranges, where it formed \\"continuous patches several feet across, adorned by masses of lovely flowers.\\" at an altitude of Donald Petrie described the species in 1915, and named it eximia, meaning \\"strikingly unusual\\".  Description  Myosotis eximia is a extensively-branched spreading perennial, which forms clusters of tight rosettes with erect flowering stems. The leaves are sparsely covered in dense, straight hairs that lie flat against the leaf. M. eximia flowers in December and January; its flowers, which Petrie described as \\"large and showy, white with a yellow eye\\", have projecting anthers. The anthers are only 2 mm long, much shorter than their filaments.  Distribution and habitat  The species is endemic to New Zealand, and has a very restricted distribution, known only from the Kaimanawa and Ruahine Ranges in the central North Island. It lives in the subalpine to alpine zone, on scree slopes and limestone bluffs. It prefers alkaline soils on limestone or calcareous sandstone.  Conservation status  Myosotis eximia growing in cultivation at leftM. eximia is listed by the Department of Conservation as \\"At Risk ‚Äì Naturally Uncommon\\" on the most recent New Zealand Threat Classification for plants. Its numbers are thought to be stable, with the qualifiers \\"DP\\" (Data Poor) and \\"RR\\" (Range Restricted). Because of its specialised habitat requirements its populations are small and localised, but do not seem to be under threat.  Cultivation  This species grows surprisingly well in gardens, preferring soil with some added lime, and is often for sale in native plant nurseries. It needs a sunny, well drained situation, and will flower heavily even in warm climates far from its natural subalpine habitat.

Florence and Thomas raised mules on the Molloy family farm in Onondaga County, New York until 1912. In 1914 he transferred his interest in the property to Florence. She sold the property in 1920, but continued to hold the mortgage, and in 1935 she foreclosed on the buyer. In 1942 she sold the property to the U.S. government to build Mattydale Army Air Base, now Hancock Field. The timing of the end of Florence's and Thomas's relationship is unclear. By 1918, Florence Molloy had moved with her daughters to Boulder, CO and was operating the Molloy-MacLeay taxicab company with Mabel N. MacLeay.

Based on personal accounts, the women were opposites with Molloy being over six feet tall and, ‚Äúa great big masculine woman,‚Äù and MacLeay being petite and ladylike. The service began sometime during the years of World War I when the man operating the only service in Boulder, CO was drafted. The service started with a single five passenger Cadillac 8 which Molloy used to drive friends. However, the business began to grow during the 1918 Spanish flu when the company volunteered with the Red Cross to transport medical professionals and supplies to the mountain towns and serve in funeral processions. During the epidemic, the 38-year-old Molloy was called on to fill in for an undertaker when his hearse could not traverse the mountain roads to pick up a flu victim. She initially refused, saying her car was out of order, but the undertaker demanded she, ‚ÄúTake it to the garage and get another car!‚Äù This was a turning point in the business as the job showed Molloy that no trip was too difficult to handle. The service expanded from driving friends to providing scenic tours to clients using an additional seven-passenger Pierce Arrow. The charge was $7.00 per day per passenger for a round trip to Estes Park from Boulder or a circular route from Boulder to Nederland, Rollinsville, Idaho Springs, Lookout Mountain, and back to Boulder. They drove with the idea that sightseeing trips should be leisurely and not hurried. To further increase their clientele, the women expanded into city transportation and added a third car (a Packard) as well as a male driver. Eventually the company expanded to eight cars.  Peak years  By 1922, the Molloy-MacLeay taxicab company was operating from the Hotel Boulderado and rides across Boulder cost ¬¢25. The service was operating during Prohibition in the United States and the women would not pick up intoxicated passengers or transport liquor. The service catered to a variety of clientele, but became the go to driving service for the female students of the University of Colorado at Boulder. The students‚Äô parents would hire Molloy and MacLeay to act as both drivers and chaperones, especially as Molloy and MacLeay were much less expensive than the usual driver plus chaperone for longer trips. In a 1986 interview with one of the service's patrons, CU student Helen Carpenter, Carpenter said, ‚ÄúMy gang of girls went everywhere with Mrs. Molloy. She took us to football games and to Estes Park for dinner.\\" Additionally, the service was used by Jean Sherwood's ‚Äúbluebirds,‚Äù working women from Chicago who vacationed at Bluebird Cottage in Boulder through the Bluebird Association (or Chicago Holiday Association). Malloy and MacLeay were also a favorite for funerals and received referrals from a local doctor. Two of their high-profile patrons were attorney Clarence Darrow and opera singer Madame Ernestine Schumann-Heink. Upon hearing the fare for her trip, Madame Schumann-Heink declared, ‚ÄúYou deserve more. Your charge is so reasonable! Everywhere else, they try to hold me up. I am glad to help a sister,‚Äù and then paid $5.00. According to Molloy and MacLeay, ‚Äútaxi driving is a safe and sane occupation for any woman who has coolness, courage, and a thorough knowledge of how to operate a car.\\" Despite their success, Molloy and MacLeay had to overcome the prejudiced opinion that women are not good drivers. Both women maintained ‚Äú100 percent records‚Äù and only experienced two breakdowns in the 1921 season. They were noted for, ‚Äúkeeping their cars in such shape that breakdowns don‚Äôt occur.\\"  Opposition and sale  During the peak years of Molloy's and MacLeay's service, theirs was not the only taxi business in town and the success of their business led to upset among the male taxi drivers in Boulder. This discord only increased in 1926 when Molloy and MacLeay obtained a contract with Union Pacific Railroad for the exclusive rights to solicit passengers from the Colorado & Southern Railway passenger trains at the Boulder depot. The other taxi owners in Boulder subsequently lobbied for the passage of strict solicitation regulations, which became city ordinance 1169. In June 1926, three taxi drivers, E.W. O‚ÄôNeal, Ray Hall, and Seth Armstead filed a complaint against Molloy and MacLeay claiming they had violated the new city ordinance by soliciting business at the Union station platform. Malloy pleaded not guilty, and was supported by the station agent, J.P. Colstadt, and the secretary-manager of Bluebird Cottage, Emma Tracy, who said that though Molloy-MacLeay taxi has a contract with the Bluebirds, Bluebirds were not compelled to use the service. Nonetheless, Judge Linda Lee ordered the Molloy-MacLeay taxi stand removed from the station. According to letters written by Molloy and MacLeay to friends in Syracuse, NY, the women were also receiving threats from the Ku Klux Klan calling for them to close their business. As a result of the regulations, litigation, and threats, the Daily Camera announced on June 19, 1926 that Molloy and MacLeay had sold the Molloy- MacLeay taxicab company to the Yellow Cab company, but would continue Molloy Scenic Tours outside of Boulder city limits and continue a one-year lease to the Bluebirds.  Double M Ranch  After the closure of the taxi service, the women opened the Double M dude ranch (or M&M; ranch, then Trojan Ranch, and now the Colorado Mountain Ranch) in Gold Hill, CO. The Syracuse Herald described the Double M as offering, ‚Äúall the attractions of the open spaces of the West sufficiently tempered with luxuries to meet the requirement of Easterners.\\" The ranch operated until World War II when it was sold in 1941 and Molloy and MacLeay relocated to Sunset Ranch at 2801 Baseline Road. They then sold Sunset Ranch in 1945 to move to the Loyal King home at 1200 28th St.  Death  Mable MacLeay died in 1950 and Florence Molloy died in 1951.

The exterior is tan or light brown with two widely-separated, narrow white bands. There are about four whorls and a low spire. The shell has a large aperture. The shell is a darker brown at the inside edge of the aperture. The interior is white. The shell reaches a height of 40 mm (1.6 inches) and a diameter of 26 mm (1 inch). The operculum is brown.  Distribution  This moon snail is found from in the eastern Pacific Ocean from the Gulf of California to Panama. It has not been documented on the west coast of the Baja Peninsula.

Life history  Like most of the moon snails, Polinices bifasciatus produces a sand collar to lay its eggs during breeding season. This moon snail preys on small bivalves. It is actively mobile, hunting on soft seabeds for buried clams. It uses an abrasive appendage called a radula to drill into the shells of small clams.

Relations between the Soviet Union (USSR) and Communist Party of China (CCP) dated back to the founding of the CCP in Shanghai in 1921, a meeting conducted under the supervision of the Soviet Comintern. The Soviets remained cautious partners with the rising CCP throughout the 22 years of the Chinese Civil War, and the USSR was the first nation to recognize the People's Republic of China in 1949. The following year saw the signing of the Sino- Soviet Treaty and founding of the Sino-Soviet alliance as well as the beginning of a decade of economic cooperation between the two nations. Despite transfers of aid and raw materials between the nations, by 1956 this once warm friendship had cooled, and the Sino-Soviet split began. In 1960, the Soviet Union withdrew all economic advisors from the PRC, and relations became confrontational in political, economic, military and ideological arenas. After years of border incursions by both parties, 1969 saw the Sino-Soviet border conflict which nearly boiled over into a nuclear exchange. After the Sino- Soviet border conflicts of 1969, Sino-Soviet relations were marked by years of military and political tensions. Even after the death of Mao Zedong in 1976, these two former allies remained locked in a miniature cold war, consumed by ideological, political and economic differences. However, relations began to improve in the late 1970s with a gradual de-escalation of military tensions and a move towards bilateral relations. After years of negotiations, full bilateral relations resumed in May 1989 in the midst of the Tiananmen Square protest. Warmer bilateral relations and mutual understanding would characterize the last two years of the Sino-Soviet relationship, up until the dissolution of the Soviet Union in December, 1991. > \\"In the 1950s the Soviet Union was \\"big brother,\\" whose example should be > followed. Through almost the entire two decades of the 1960s and 1970s, the > Soviet Union became synonymous with \\"revisionism,\\" the dreaded fate that > China must avoid at all costs.

The Soviet Union came to represent the common starting point for > socialism, from which China and other socialist countries (the Soviet Union > included) must shift, in steps, through carefully planned reforms.\\" \\\\- > Gilbert Rozman The entire Sino-Soviet relationship was a roller coaster of events, from close alliance to nuclear showdown, but by the 1980s common approaches to reform enabled the resumption of diplomatic relations and extensive trade. These events spanned multiple generations of political leadership; Mao Zedong, Hua Guofeng and Deng Xiaoping led China, while Joseph Stalin, Nikita Khrushchev, Leonid Brezhnev, Yuri Andropov, Konstantin Chernenko, and Mikhail Gorbachev led the Soviet Union. Despite numerous domestic and foreign concerns, each generation of leadership devoted significant time and resources to the Sino- Soviet relationship, a relationship bound by political, economic, geographical, and ideological considerations.  Sino-Soviet Relations 1949 - 1969   Sino-Soviet Alliance  Mao Zedong and Nikita Khrushchev The Sino-Soviet Alliance began with the signing of the new Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance on February 14, 1950. Following the signing of this treaty, the USSR advanced $300 million in development loans to the PRC and sent nearly 10,000 Soviet technical advisors to work in China. Over the next decade, extensive technological transfer and development assistance drew the two countries close together, while China firmly allied with the Soviet Union in the Cold War.  Sino-Soviet split  However, for numerous reasons, the Sino-Soviet alliance weakened in the late 1950s, and the Soviet Union withdrew all economic aid in August 1960. The Sino-Soviet split began once minor political, economic, geographic and ideological issues became major bilateral diplomatic concerns.  Sino-Soviet Border War of 1969   Military Build- up  Disputed sections of the border between China and Russia before the final border agreement of 2004. A Soviet ship using a water cannon against a Chinese fisherman on the Ussuri River on 6 May 1969 With the intensification of the Sino-Soviet Split, both nations deployed troops to the shared border, which stretched from North Korea to Central Asia. However, for the first part of the Sino-Soviet confrontation, the Mongolian People's Republic, a Soviet satellite since 1921, remained relatively neutral, and facilitated continued trade between the USSR and PRC. This changed with the signing of \\"The Treaty of Friendship, Cooperation and Mutual Assistance between the USSR and the Mongolian People's Republic\\" which superseded previous agreements of economic cooperation between the allied communist nations. The treaty, signed in Ulaanbaatar on January 15, 1966 by Soviet leader Leonid Brezhnev and Mongolian Prime Minister Yumjaagiin Tsedenbal, allowed the Soviet Union to station troops in Mongolia to ensure mutual defense. While the Soviet Army had previously operated in Mongolia, this was the first time that troops would be based in the independent nation. By 1967, the Soviet Union had deployed armored units and mechanized troops as well as ballistic missiles inside Mongolia and along the Chinese border. Border incidents and clashes continued to increase with 4,189 border crossing incidents between 1964 and 1969. The border conflict grew worse as each side moved more troops into the borderlands, and tensions in Moscow and Beijing rose to a breaking point.Li; Xia. Mao and the Sino-Soviet Split 1959-1973, 250. These developments along the northern border put Mao into a potential two front war, what Mao called \\"[A] new historical epoch of combating both U.S. imperialism and Soviet revisionism\\" in a letter to Enver Hoxha in September 1968. This letter, reprinted in the People's Daily, September 19, 1968 illustrated the brewing potential for a trilateral nuclear war.Li; Xia. Mao and the Sino-Soviet Split 1959-1973, 285.  Two Front Border Conflict (February - August 1969)  In this environment of nuclear showmanship and military tensions, the Chinese side made the first move. In 1969, the Chinese People's Liberation Army (PLA) attacked Soviet troops stationed on Zhenbao Island in the Ussuri River, claiming the island for China. In repeated attacks and counterattacks up to 250 Chinese soldiers and 58 Soviet soldiers were killed.Li; Xia. Mao and the Sino-Soviet Split 1959-1973, 251. In the aftermath, both sides withdrew leaving the island as no-mans-land subject to frequent artillery barrages. The PLA argued that such attacks would not lead to a wider war with the Soviet Union, but China's leadership still prepared for war. The Soviet Union responded with thinly veiled threats of nuclear war if attacked again and counter-attacked on the western border. Minor clashes continued throughout the summer. On August 13, 1969, the Soviet Army invaded Yumin County in Xinjiang, completely eliminating the PLA platoon in the area.Li; Xia. Mao and the Sino- Soviet Split 1959-1973, 254. In addition, the Soviets transferred strategic nuclear bombers to airbases in the Russian Far East within striking distance of Manchurian nuclear facilities. What had started as a border skirmish threatened to become a two front nuclear war. The PRC reacted by further preparing for war along the borderlands, while also seeking to reduce tensions in a high-level meeting with Soviet leaders.Li; Xia. Mao and the Sino-Soviet Split 1959-1973, 255. Premiers Alexei Kosygin and Zhou Enlai met at the Beijing Airport on September 11, 1969 and through a hurried series of meetings attempted to carefully negotiate a step-back from the brink of war. Further letters between the two premiers sought to de-escalate tensions but neither side withdrew troops from the border. However, the sides agreed to meet on October 20 in Beijing to solve the border-dispute diplomatically.Khoo, Collateral Damage, 59. Mao Zedong and Lin Biao feared that the Soviet negotiations were a trick, a ploy to draw off Chinese troops while the Soviets would attack with ground and nuclear forces. Under orders from Mao, Lin Biao put the PLA strategic forces on war-readiness in full preparation for a nuclear war with the Soviet Union.Li; Xia. Mao and the Sino-Soviet Split 1959-1973, 256. What had begun as a diplomatic attempt to calm tensions, instead resulted in nuclear brinkmanship.Li; Xia. Mao and the Sino-Soviet Split 1959-1973, 257. With the nation on full alert, civilian and military authorities began to prepare for total war, under the premise that the arrival of a Soviet border negotiations team would be a ruse for an all-out nuclear strike.Khoo, Collateral Damage, 60. Yet, no strike came; on October 20, the Soviet diplomats arrived and border tensions settled for the time being.  Tensions and Sino-American Relations 1969 - 1978  President Richard Nixon meets Chairman Mao Zedong, 1972 Sino-US rapprochement, a major break with previous foreign policies seeking to create a new balance of power in East Asia, greatly affected the Sino-Soviet relationship. Threatened by the potential of a crippling Soviet attack, China turned to the United States. While visitingChina, American President Richard Nixon and National Security Advisor Henry Kissinger worked to allay Chinese fears of a joint US-Soviet attack and instead promote ties with China that would undermine the Soviet Union. Li Danhui and Xia Yafeng argue that Mao Zedong's ideological shift toward Sino-US relations was heavily influenced by the continuing threat of the USSR. Pivoting away from military confrontation, Mao declared a policy of \\"opposing the Soviet Union, irrespective of ideological position.\\"Li; Xia. Mao and the Sino-Soviet Split 1959-1973, 260. This opened the door for continued cooperation and negotiation with the United States and cooperation balancing against Soviet power in East Asia. According to historian Li Danhui, \\"after the Zhenbao Island Incident in March 1969, the Sino-Soviet state-to-state relationship was on the brink of war. This prompted Mao to attempt a new policy of ‚Äúaligning with the United States to oppose the Soviet Union.\\"Li; Xia. Mao and the Sino-Soviet Split 1959-1973, 282. In the midst of Sino-American rapprochement in 1972, the Sino-Soviet border continued to be heavily fortified, with nearly 1 million Soviet troops, armed with tanks, airplanes, artillery and backed by ballistic missiles. The Soviet Army faced approximately 1.5 million troops consisting of the PLA and People's Militia. The border tensions increased from 1973 through 1976, as both sides sought political victories while also continuing to militarize the border. Brezhnev spoke of China's failure to accept peaceful coexistence between the two nations, while the PRC continued to view the Soviet Union as an existential threat.Khoo, Collateral Damage, 80. The presence of the Soviet Navy in the Indian and Pacific oceans as well as well-armed troops across the length of the border reinforced a view of Soviet encirclement.Khoo, Collateral Damage, 81. The death of Mao in September 1976 brought no immediate changes in the Sino-Soviet conflict, although each side had significantly reduced the number of troops stationed along the border. Brezhnev attempted to congratulate Hua Guofeng in October 1976, and was strongly rebuffed with a reinforcement of the late Chairman's anti-Soviet rhetoric.Khoo, Collateral Damage, 110. In 1976, each side had approximately 300,000 soldiers deployed on the border, while the Soviet troops were backed by airpower and strategic forces.Khoo, Collateral Damage, 104. In 1978,the Soviet began deploying SS-20 missiles throughout the Far East allowing the Soviets to strike any target in the PRC. In addition, large military exercises were performed in both Mongolia and Siberia, specifically modelling different scenarios of a Sino-Soviet war.Khoo, Collateral Damage, 107.  Sino-Vietnam War 1979  The Sino-Soviet Treaty lapsed in February 1979, and Deng Xiaoping announced that China would not attempt to renew the treaty provisions.V√°mos, P√©ter (2010). \\"\\"Only a Handshake but no Embrace\\": Sino-Soviet Normalization in the 1980s\\". In Bernstein, Thomas P.; Li, Hua-yu (eds.). China Learns from the Soviet Union, 1949 - Present. Lantham, MD: Rowman & Littlefield Publishers, Inc. p. 81 The stationing of Soviet naval vessels throughout unified Socialist Vietnam gave further evidence of Soviet attempts to encircle the PRC. The increased Soviet presence in the Gulf of Tonkin raised tensions further. In the midst of these worries, Vietnam invaded Cambodia, toppling the Chinese-backed Khmer Rouge.Khoo, Collateral Damage, 127. In response, China invaded northern Vietnam on February 17, and occupied a small area for a month. Declaring that China had realized its objective of \\"punishing Vietnamese and Soviet hegemony,\\" the PLA withdrew in March 1979, ending the brief third Indochina War.  Resumed Diplomacy 1979 - 1989  After China's withdrawal from Vietnam, Sino-Soviet relations remained locked in tense military confrontation along the border, while diplomatic relations remained frozen. While the Soviet Union continued to supply and support the Vietnamese government in Cambodia, China remained opposed to all Soviet involvement in Southeast Asia; the regime continued to lambaste Soviet and Vietnamese \\"regional hegemony.\\" Minor skirmishes continued along the southern border with Vietnam and the northern border remained heavily militarized. Historian Peter Vamos estimates that \\"about one fourth of Soviet ground forces and one third of its air force were stationed along or in the region of the Sino-Soviet border\\" in the early 1980s.V√°mos, \\"\\"Only a Handshake but no Embrace\\": Sino-Soviet Normalization in the 1980s\\", 82. Many of these units were stationed in the nominally independent Peoples' Republic of Mongolia, as per the 1980 Soviet-Mongolian Mutual Defense treaty. The massive troop build-up along the border into the 1980s led to an imbalance of military power, the Chinese remained overwhelmed by the Soviet show of force. Meanwhile, the Soviet treaty with Vietnam allowed Soviet troops and use of former American naval bases along the Vietnamese coast. The presence of the Soviet Navy and Air Force in its southern neighbor further enforced the feeling of encirclement. For China, the instability on the northern border was increasingly seen as an unnecessary threat to the regimes existence and a thorn in the side of Chinese economic reforms. According to Gilbert Rozman, the rise of Deng Xiaoping and Chen Yun meant \\"the leftist line of opposing most post-Stalin reforms in the Soviet Union could now be replaced by appreciation for reforms in a socialist system.\\" The post- Stalinist Soviet Union was no longer seen as a revisionist empire but instead a potential trade partner in economic reform. This ideological turn brought about a political and diplomatic shift, as China tentatively reached out to the USSR. > \\"Having normalized its relations with the United States, for the purpose of > providing a peaceful environment, Deng also sought improved relations with > the Soviet Union. The Chinese had good reasons to seek normalization with > the Soviet Union. The Sino-Soviet conflict remained a destabilizing factor > for China. With the border issue unsettled and Soviet military deployments > in Siberia and Mongolia, the Soviet Union was perceived as the gravest > threat to China‚Äôs security.\\" \\\\- Gilbert Rozman Getting to the negotiating table proved troublesome. In September 1979, the parties began meeting, but failed to agree on what issues should be covered. The USSR sought to focus on bilateral relations between the two nuclear powers, while the PRC was concerned with current Soviet engagements in neighboring countries, specifically Vietnam and Mongolia; the PRC remained worried about the potential of Soviet military encirclement. While the Soviet Union sought to establish bilateral diplomatic relations, for China, there were two major issues that needed to be tackled before normalization of diplomatic relations. These \\"obstacles\\" were the Soviet military deployment in Mongolia and along the PRC borders, and Soviet aid to support for Vietnam's invasion and occupation of Cambodia. China refused to begin any discussion of diplomatic or party relations until these obstacles were removed. The Soviets responded by refusing to unilaterally agree to any of the demands, instead insisting on bilateral relations first. Since neither side would negotiate, the attempts to meet stalled. The Soviet‚ÄìAfghan War ended this brief warming of Sino-Soviet relations and led to increased military cooperation between China and the United States.Khoo, Collateral Damage, 81 The growing semi- official military alliance with the United States allowed the Chinese to strike back at the Soviets. The US and PRC established joint intelligence listening posts in Manchuria to monitor the Soviet Union, and these facilities remained staffed by Chinese intelligence. The Soviet Invasion of Afghanistan raised tensions between the US and USSR, and provided another realm for Sino- US military cooperation. The Soviet Invasion of Afghanistan opened another military front on the Sino-Soviet border, and while this border was never the site of direct confrontations, the PRC worried about the additional Soviet presence. In 1980, the US and PRC jointly opened two further listening stations in Xinjiang, specifically focused on tracking Soviet troops in Afghanistan. Furthermore, Xinjiang became the base of Chinese aid to the Mujahideen, with PLA soldiers training and providing weapons to the anti- Soviet guerillas. According to Yitzhak Shichor, \\"PLA personnel provided training, arms, organization, financial support, and military advisers to the Mujahideen resistance throughout nearly the entire Soviet military presence in Afghanistan, with the active assistance and cooperation of the CIA.\\" These PLA and CIA joint training camps were located near Kashgar and Khotan, spending $200‚Äì400 million training and arming the rebels.Shichor, \\"The Great Wall of Steel: Military and Strategy in Xinjiang\\", 158. In the wake of the invasion, China solidified its terms for establishing bilateral relations, demanding the end of Soviet military deployment in Mongolia and along PRC borders, the cessation of Soviet aid to support for Vietnam's invasion and occupation of Cambodia, and total withdrawal from Afghanistan; making a total of \\"three major obstacles.\\" There was more to the Afghanistan conflict than just another front for border confrontations. Historian Peter Vamos argues that \\"the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, which had initially seemed so threatening to China‚Äôs security, led to a change in the balance of forces between the superpowers and made the prospects of war seem more distant, partly as a result of a tacit strategic partnership between China and the United States described euphemistically as the pursuit of parallel actions.\\"V√°mos, \\"\\"Only a Handshake but no Embrace\\": Sino-Soviet Normalization in the 1980s\\", 83. The new listening posts and cooperation between the US and PRC, counter-balanced Soviet threats in the West, while the increasing quagmire of the Soviet war, appeared to weaken the Soviet Army. Deng Xiaoping pursued a policy of balance between the US and USSR. While warming relations with the US led to an informal military alliance, the PRC also sought to improve relations with the Soviets. In 1981‚Äì82, Chinese fears of Soviet encirclement and coming war diminished, however the desire to remove these threats remained the top priority for normalization of Sino-Soviet relations.V√°mos, \\"\\"Only a Handshake but no Embrace\\": Sino-Soviet Normalization in the 1980s\\", 85. In 1982, Leonid Brezhnev took a big step towards normalization with a speech in Tashkent, Uzbekistan SSR. In this speech, \\"the Soviet leader called China a socialist country, supported China‚Äôs position on Taiwan, expressed his willingness to improve relations with China, and proposed consultations between the two sides.\\" Deng reacted immediately, and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs responded saying \\"We paid attention to the sections concerning Sino-Soviet relations in President Brezhnev‚Äôs speech in Tashkent on March 24. We categorically refute its attacks against China. In Sino-Soviet relations and in international affairs, we attach importance to the Soviet Union‚Äôs real actions.\\" In response, Deng sent Yu Hongliang to give the following message to the Soviet government via the PRC embassy in Moscow. > \\"There has been an abnormal relationship between China and the Soviet Union > for many years, and the two peoples do not want to see the continuation of > such a situation. Now it is time to do something to improve Sino-Soviet > relations.

Vietnam and Cambodia remained the top priority.V√°mos, \\"\\"Only a Handshake but no Embrace\\": Sino-Soviet Normalization in the 1980s\\", 87. The Soviet responded positively, agreeing to work towards resolving these obstacles, beginning formal political level meetings at the vice-foreign minister level. Further warming occurred with the writing of the 1982 PRC Constitution, which removed references to \\"social imperialism\\" and \\"contemporary revisionism\\" which had been inserted during the height of the Sino-Soviet split.V√°mos, \\"\\"Only a Handshake but no Embrace\\": Sino-Soviet Normalization in the 1980s\\", 88. The first vice-foreign minister meeting was held in Beijing in October 1982, and eleven further semi-annual meetings were held up until 1988. The discussions which began with political lectures, warmed over the following years. The three major obstacles to normalized relations, however, remained. As evidence of the change in China's position since 1976, the PRC continued to lobby for the withdrawal of Soviet military forces and aid in Vietnam, insisting that peaceful coexistence between the PRC and USSR be the guideline for relations. Several notable meetings occurred with the resumption of political negotiations: the two foreign ministers met at the UN in 1984 and First Deputy Prime Minister Ivan Arkhipov toured the PRC later that same year.V√°mos, \\"\\"Only a Handshake but no Embrace\\": Sino-Soviet Normalization in the 1980s\\", 89. Furthermore, the PRC announced to Eastern bloc diplomats that \\"China would be ready to re-establish inter-party relations with the Soviet Union and other socialist countries\\" as long as the Soviets ended military support for Vietnam. Despite progress in cultural and political ties from greater trade to ping-pong competitions, neither nation was willing to compromise on the balance of military power in Asia. China continued to see the USSR as a threat, and the USSR saw the presence of troops in the Far East, Mongolia and Afghanistan as well as continued military aid to Vietnam as crucial for its overall geopolitical goals. Despite stagnation in bilateral diplomatic relations, the diplomatic teams achieved numerous other goals in this period. State-to-state economic, scientific, and cultural exchanges were re-established, allowing further warming of state-level relations.V√°mos, \\"\\"Only a Handshake but no Embrace\\": Sino-Soviet Normalization in the 1980s\\", 84. Trade between the two nations increased dramatically through the 1980s growing from 223 million Soviet rubles in 1982 to 1.6 billion rubles in 1985. In the winter of 1984‚Äì1985, the first Vice-Chairman of the USSR Council of Ministers, Ivan Arkhipov, traveled to Beijing and at a state banquet, it was announced that China recognized the Soviet Union as a fellow socialist country.Rozman, The Chinese Debate about Soviet Socialism, 1978-1985, 6. From this point forward, the Chinese propaganda ministry backed away from its attacks on the USSR, ending decades of ideological warfare. In March 1985, while in Moscow for Konstantin Chernenko's funeral, Li Peng met with the new Soviet General Secretary Mikhail Gorbachev with both sides explicitly stating their desire to normalize all relations. While Gorbachev focused on consolidating his power in the following two years, the PRC and USSR reached towards each other further establishing a new \\"network of diplomatic, scientific, cultural, sports, health, and other exchanges\\" between the two powers.V√°mos, \\"\\"Only a Handshake but no Embrace\\": Sino-Soviet Normalization in the 1980s\\", 90. The gradual warming continued through 1985. At the Twenty-Seven Party Congress of the CPSU, Mikhail Gorbachev announced the beginnings of perestroika in the USSR, radically reforming and restructuring the stagnant Soviet economy. In his speech, Gorbachev praised the earlier Chinese reforms, and simultaneously expressed an interest to further improve ties with the PRC. The new Soviet government recognized that economic stagnation had been greatly worsened by overextending the Soviet military might across the world, and Gorbachev sought to reduce the load on the Soviet Union by withdrawing troops and aid from several costly conflicts. The USSR simply could not afford it's interventionist foreign policy, and over extending the military was at the heart of its financial woes. Gorbachev radically reduced military spending, leading to massive troops withdrawals in Afghanistan and reduced aid to many allied nations.V√°mos, \\"\\"Only a Handshake but no Embrace\\": Sino-Soviet Normalization in the 1980s\\", 91. Furthermore, Gorbachev announced troop withdrawals from Mongolia, Afghanistan and the Russian Far East, announcing his intention to remove the \\"obstacles\\" to Sino- Soviet relations, while also recognizing the Chinese view of the northern border, accepting that the dividing line ran through the middle of the main channel of the Amur and Ussuri Rivers. Furthermore, the countries resumed diplomatic relations on the consular level, the PRC opened a consulate in Leningrad, and the USSR opened one in Shanghai. Despite Gorbachev's concessions, both sides continued to make cautious careful moves towards full relations. Scientific and trade expositions resumed in 1986.V√°mos, \\"\\"Only a Handshake but no Embrace\\": Sino-Soviet Normalization in the 1980s\\", 92. Gorbachev's new thinking of 1988 sped up the normalization process significantly. Gorbachev's New Political Thinking recognized that disarmament was key to the economic survival of the USSR, including unilateral disarmament and equal participation in regional economic and diplomatic relations.  Bi- lateral Foreign Relations 1989 - 1991  With Gorbachev's concessions on troops, the Chinese also stepped back agreeing that the \\"three major obstacles\\" could be resolved simultaneously to negotiations for full diplomatic normalization of relations. For the first time the Chinese foreign minister, visited each other's nations in 1988, announcing that all diplomatic relations were to occur on equal footing. The two foreign ministers then set the formal summit meeting between all parties for May 15‚Äì18, 1989 in Beijing, where Gorbachev would finally meet Deng and diplomatic relations fully normalized.V√°mos, \\"\\"Only a Handshake but no Embrace\\": Sino-Soviet Normalization in the 1980s\\", 93. In the midst of the Tiananmen Square protests of 1989, Deng and Gorbachev met with ‚Äúonly handshake but no embrace.\\"V√°mos, \\"\\"Only a Handshake but no Embrace\\": Sino-Soviet Normalization in the 1980s\\", 95. The two nations established bilateral diplomatic declarations under the five principles of peaceful coexistence. Both sides agreed that there was no dogmatic model for socialism and that both nations were socialist societies, led by Communist parties. Furthermore, Gorbachev rejected the Brezhnev Doctrine on the USSR's right to intervene in socialist nations affairs, while also stating that the USSR did not strive to dominate the PRC politically, economically, nor ideologically. The groups agreed to move forward on settling the Cambodian situation with Vietnam. In economics, the USSR \\"proposed among others cooperation in metallurgy, the energy sector and transport, whereas the Chinese put forward the idea of a broader utilization of Chinese labor forces in Siberia.\\" The term \\"only handshake but no embrace\\" refers to the formalizing of bilateral diplomatic relations without the close party-party alliance relations of the earlier Sino-Soviet Alliance; the two nation's mutual diplomatic recognition, and bilateral economic relations avoided the pitfalls that doomed the earlier Sino-Soviet relationship. On May 18, 1989, the USSR and PRC formally normalized all diplomatic and political relations.V√°mos, \\"\\"Only a Handshake but no Embrace\\": Sino-Soviet Normalization in the 1980s\\", 96. These bilateral diplomatic relations would last until the dissolution of the Soviet Union on December 25, 1991.

It was constructed in 1882-1883 for J.P.C. Phillips and his wife Harriet Dougall Phillips.  Architectural Structure  Glanmore National Historic Site is built on land that Harriet Dougall Phillips inherited from the Bleecker family. She and her husband, wealthy banker John Philpot Curran Phillips, constructed the house in 1882-1883 in the Second Empire architectural style. The building exterior features a slate mansard roof, cornices, and elaborate molding. It was designed by architect Thomas Hanley of Belleville and built by Francis McKay. The building underwent restoration of the roof in 1997, and the conservation of the historic plaster interiors in 2012. The ceilings are believed to have been originally hand-painted by Harriet Dougall Phillips, the original inhabitant of the house. By 2018, the house had been through 22 restoration projects designed to conserve its original state. The name Glanmore House is suggested to have come from potential ties between the original owners and the Glanmore region of Ireland.  National Historic Site Status  Glanmore was designated as a National Historic Site in 1969, due to its architectural style, and has operated as a museum since 1973. Much of the building is restored to showcase 1890s interiors, as well as period landscaping of the exterior. The National Historic Site is home to the Phillips-Burrows-Faulkner Collection, which consists of material original to the house as owned by the four generations of the Phillips family who lived in the house from its construction up until 1971. Much of this collection is on display in the house.  Public Programming  Glanmore National Historic Site offers public programs and exhibitions, including the exhibition ‚ÄúNice Women Don‚Äôt Want The Vote,‚Äù in 2017, to commemorate the 100th anniversary of women receiving the right to vote in Manitoba. The exhibition \\"Hands on Nature\\" from the Royal Ontario Museum was displayed in March 2018. The exhibition \\"Unmasking Influenza,\\" about the Spanish flu, was shown in August 2019.  Haunting  Glanmore House is believed to be haunted by the ghost of Harriet Dougall Phillips. An exorcism in the early 1960s by a local priest is reported to have led to a decrease in hauntings.

They lived in Malcha Mahal, a hunting lodge that dates back to the 14th century. The family's claim was disputed by many others, and on 22 November 2019, journalist Ellen Barry published an article in The New York Times claiming that the family had no royal connection and was in fact descended from the former Registrar of the University of Lucknow, Inayatullah Butt.  Background  The Oudh State was a princely state, with a population of around five million people, in the Awadh region of North India until annexation by the British in 1856. The British seized the throne from the Nawab of Awadh, removing Ramzan Ali and forcing him to spend the rest of his life in Nepal in exile. He died in 1893, of poisoning. In 1981, The New York Times wrote that the British \\"never justified their seizure of Oudh legally.\\" There exist legitimate descendants of the Wazid Ali Shah, who have always maintained that this family's claim is bogus. The son of Wajid Ali Shah was Birjis Qadr, who had married Mehtab Ara, a granddaughter of Bahadur Shah Zafar, and had two sons Khurshid Qadr and Meher Quder. Meher Quder's three sons are Anjum Quder of Calcutta, Kaukub Quder of Aligarh and Nayyer Quder, a barrister in London. Anjum Quder had protested the claim of Wilayat Mahal in 1975.  Claim  In an interview in 1985, Begum Wilayat Mahal told the Chicago Tribune that Zamrud Mahal, her grandmother, had been a direct descendant of Wazid Ali Shah. Zamrud reportedly appeared before Edward VIII when he visited Delhi in 1911 and informed him that she refused to accept a stipend from the British, which had been offered in return for their inheritance. Wilayat went on to state that in 1947, the first prime minister of an independent India, Jawaharlal Nehru, granted the family an ancestral palace in Srinagar, Kashmir. The family moved from Nepal and lived in the palace until it burned down in 1971.  History   New Delhi railway station  Some time in the early 1970s, Begum Wilayat Mahal, Ali \\"Cyrus\\" Raza and Sakina arrived in Lucknow, the capital of the Oudh State, and demanded to be compensated with the royal estates and moved into the Lucknow railway station to protest their treatment. They later relocated to a railway station in New Delhi, with a retinue of 13 dogs and 7 servants. The family alleged that their palace in Kashmir had been burned down by the government. They lived on a railroad platform for close to ten years, originally in the first class waiting room (reportedly built for Louis Mountbatten, the last Governor-General of India), and then in a portico. The family would spend their time praying or writing letters to different authorities. While there, they had decorated their tiny living quarters to resemble royalty, complete with Persian carpets and portraits on the walls. Their meals would be served to them by their servants on bone china and in silver tea sets. The family of Awadh had been a powerful figure among the Shiite Muslims of Lucknow and Wilayat and her children thus received many pilgrims and the support of the community. The three Quder brothers, the legitimate descendants of the Oudh State, also met Wilayat to verify her claims during this period. The family wrote multiple letters to authorities, including Indira Gandhi, then Prime Minister of India, and Queen Elizabeth II. Raza reportedly delivered a letter to the Queen himself after travelling to London in 1980. Their protest attracted international media attention, and the family was offered a modern residence in 1976. They refused. In 1984, Indira Gandhi visited the family at the train station and ordered the Home Ministry to look for a suitable place for them to live in. Following this, the government offered Malcha Mahal to the family in 1985.  Malcha Mahal  The family moved into Malcha Mahal and continued to air grievances against the Indian government. Begum Wilayat Mahal died by suicide in October 1993, consuming the \\"drink of silence\\", a mixture of toxic powders reportedly containing the crushed family pearls and diamonds. Following her death, her children unsuccessfully embalmed the body themselves, and cremated it a year later. The family struggled financially, selling many of their possessions. The family then continued to live in the palace, speaking to reporters every few years. A photo of another of Wilayat's sons was in the palace; the family stated that he had died of \\"sadness\\" during their stay at the railway station. In 2004, Sakina Mahal told the Associated Press that \\"We have been left in darkness. We are hemmed in by affliction.\\" Sakina died around 2013. In 2014, an official from the ISRO earth station near the palace informed The Sunday Guardian that the palace had no electricity connection but had recently been provided a water connection by ISRO. Cyrus lived alone in the palace for several years before dying around September 2017. His body was found on 2 September by officials from the ISRO station nearby, after they entered the premises following reports of his absence. He was reported to have suffered from a brief illness. On 5 September, he was buried at the Delhi Gate graveyard on Bahadur Shah Zafar Marg, with nobody claiming the body. The grave remained unmarked. New York Times investigation  The Jungle Prince of Delhi In November 2019, The New York Times released an article entitled \\"The Jungle Prince of Delhi\\", written by Ellen Barry. In the piece, Barry, the former South Asia Bureau Chief in New Delhi, tells the story of how she became friends with Ali \\"Cyrus\\" Raza. He had first allowed her to visit his family home in the spring of 2016. She explained, \\"Every few years, the family agreed to admit a journalist, always a foreigner, to tell of their grievances against the state.\\" However, \\"the Oudh family refused, famously, to meet with Indians.\\" The friendship between Barry and Cyrus lasted for fifteen months. During this time, Cyrus was evasive about his family, and he talked about his sister as if she was alive. Eventually, Cyrus called Barry and admitted that his sister had died. He also stated that they should not talk again, although their correspondence was soon resumed. When the time came for her next assignment, Barry left India, and three months later, Cyrus died. At that point, Barry decided to investigate the origins of the family. She traveled to Lucknow, where the family had lived for a short while in the 1970s. She found that the family's claim was widely rejected by locals of the town. She also tracked down a relative, known as Shahid, in Bradford, England, who had been sending Western Union payments to the family. He was the older brother of Cyrus, and he revealed that Cyrus' real name was Mickey Butt, while Sakina's real name had been Farhad. Shahid and his wife stated that the family did not have royal lineage. Rather, their father had been Inayatullah Butt, the registrar of University of Lucknow. The oldest brother, Salahuddin, had been a celebrated hero of the Pakistan Air Force and had died in 2017. Shahid told Barry how following the Partition of India, their father had moved the family to his hometown, Lahore, Pakistan, which Wilayat did not want to do. Inayatullah was offered a high position in the civil services but soon died. After an incident with the Prime Minister of Pakistan, Wilayat had been institutionalized at a mental hospital and subjected to electric shock therapy, which the surviving relatives living in Lahore confirmed to Barry. Following her release, she took the family to India. Shahid ran away soon after. Further investigation Following the publication of the article, many readers sent more leads to The New York Times, which Barry and Suhasini Raj investigated further to unearth more information about the family. They found out that Wilayat and her husband had family roots in Kashmir and had been active in Kashmiri politics before Partition. Wilayat protested for Kashmiri independence while in Pakistan and was chosen as the president of the All Jammu and Kashmir Muslim Conference. She publicly confronted Mohammad Ali Bogra, then Prime Minister, regarding the issue in 1954, following which she was institutionalized. Wilayat then wrote multiple petitions to the Government of India demanding citizenship in Jammu and Kashmir, the earliest one being in 1962. In 1963, her family was granted citizenship on a year-to-year basis and they began living under the patronage of G. M. Sadiq, a friend of the family from before the Partition. It was while living in Kashmir that she first began telling neighbours that she was a descendant of the Oudh State. Farhad (Princess Sakina) was then known as Marzia, while Raza (Cyrus) was a talented cricketer. Sakina had told neighbours that they had been Jews who had immigrated from Iran. Around the time of Sadiq's death in 1971, Wilayat disappeared with Sakina and Cyrus. The older son, Assad, continued living in isolation in the house in Kashmir and his body was found a few years later. The family then turned up in Lucknow demanding the properties of the Nawabs of Oudh and were met by Satya Pal Malik, who attempted to negotiate with them while they were in the Lucknow railway station, before they moved to the New Delhi railway station. Reception and legacy \\"The Jungle Prince of Delhi\\" was nominated for the 2020 Pulitzer Prize and won the 2019 Bertrand Russell Prize. Journalist Saeed Naqvi described how he, like many other Indian journalists, had \\"dismissed Ellen's pursuit as a \\"foreigner's\\" quest for the exotic\\" and lamented the fact that no Indian journalist had investigated the family. He stated that many parts of the story were of \\"dubious veracity\\", highlighting that the family surname, Butt, belonged to the Sunni community of Muslims, and not the Shia, which the Nawabs of Awadh belonged to. In July 2020, Barry announced that Mira Nair would be adapting \\"The Jungle Prince of Delhi\\" as a web series for Amazon Studios.

He is known for winning a Primetime Emmy Award for animation on Comedy Central's Broad City television show. His pop culture artwork, collaborative projects and communal work are often outside the standard art gallery sensibility. He works in a variety of media including illustration, animation, painting, type, magazines, videos, public art, sculpture, and books.  Early life  Perry grew up outside of Kansas City, Missouri. After getting into trouble as an early teen, he discovered drawing and painting when his grandfather, a painter, gave him a tackle box filled with oil paints. Perry graduated from the Minneapolis College of Art and Design in 2003 after changing his major from Art to Graphic Design. After he was rejected for an internship at the Walker Art Center, the museum's design director, Andrew Blauvelt, wrote a note suggesting he apply for a job at Urban Outfitters. Perry worked at the company's headquarters on digital media, publications, and catalog design for three years. He moved to Brooklyn in 2004 and in 2006 opened a studio.  Career  Mike Perry, a studio artist whose work is rooted in popular culture, \\"is king\\" of working in many mediums as an illustrator, typographer, sculptor, animator, painter, curator and producer. His fluorescent color, busy, organic and playful work looks \\"like hand-drawn doodles,\\" patterns and type. Perry's work from 2004 to 2011 was collected in the 2012 monograph for Rizzoli, Wondering Around Wandering. Excited about the publication and wanting to turn it into a bigger, communal and free event, he developed \\"an unprecedented\\" and \\"unlikely\\" three month long, pop-up community art space in a 7,000-square-foot warehouse in Crown Heights. Perry noted that his inspiration for the project, run by volunteers, came from the fact that \\"he doesn‚Äôt see a lot of support or room for work like his in the galleries and institutions of today‚Äôs art world\\"; Perry \\"connected that attitude to an absence of more zine, print, and t-shirt shops ‚Äî alternative spaces, essentially, that function so often as both communal and artistic (and commercial) loci.\\" A Kickstarter campaign for the event raised $32,000 in a month. The community-centered space featured classes, workshops, performances and work by local artists. Seven hundred people came to the opening. He has taught at Minneapolis College of Art and Design in Minneapolis, Maryland Institute College of Art in Baltimore, the University of the Arts in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania and Parsons School of Design in New York City. A featured speaker at conferences, Perry has been interviewed extensively about the issues of working as a freelance artist. Brand consulting work as creative director and designer includes projects for The New York Times, Dolby, Jameson, the Tonight Show, Facebook, Microsoft, Honda and Insound. His many designs for brands include sneakers for Nike and custom glassware for Duvel.  Exhibitions  Since 2007, Perry has been in over forty group and solo exhibitions worldwide. Solo shows includeThe Landscape Between Time & Space in London in 2008, and The Patterns Found in Space in New York at Giant Robot in 2009. Lost in the Discovery of What Shapes the Mind, 2010, covering 2,800-square-feet, was the first solo alumnus show at the Minneapolis College of Art and Design. In 2011, We Are the Infinity of Each Other and Color, Shapes, and Infinity were exhibited in Tokyo. A nude series, My Mother Caught Me Doodling, was shown at London's KK Outlet in 2014. His 2016 Intoxicating Pollen Wiggling in a Moist Journey of Constantly Blooming Tides at Garis & Hahn in New York, featuring abstract paintings of nudes and still lifes, led to a show of the same name inaugurating the gallery's Los Angeles location in 2017. Group shows include The Fine Line in 2010; Walker Art Center's 2011 traveling installation Posterwall for the 21st Century, on the role digital art has played in design; Wondering Around Wandering in 2012; sculpture at the Corning Museum of Glass' Making Ideas: Experiments in Design at Glass Lab in 2013; WOW (Writing on Walls) in Belgium in 2016; and A Fantastic World in 2018. Perry has created and curated a number of public art installations for arts organizations and companies. In Brooklyn in 2013 he had several projects: street art on a construction site; a playground mural at the school P.S. 705; and his Crown Heights mural, a push back on the gentrification of the neighborhood where Perry's studio is located. In 2014, he created a mural for a Chipotle restaurant in Los Angeles, and a mural in Breda, the Netherlands, featuring a poem by Frank Nicholas, and later in 2015, he made a mural and installation for Facebook in New York. In 2016, Perry made one of New York City's largest rooftop murals in Brooklyn at the workspace a/d/o, and in 2017 he completed a multifloor mural in Cleveland incorporating a Tyehimba Jess poem. His mural Wiggling Waves & Water Wanders went up in 2019 at Pier 17 in New York.  Animation  Perry became more widely known for animating the titles for all seasons of the Comedy Central show Broad City and for animating the Mushrooms episode animation. He initially turned down the offer to do the titles, his \\"first real animation project.\\" Show stars and creators Abbi Jacobson and Ilana Glazer described the Mushrooms episode as one of their favorites from the series‚Äô entire run. Jacobson said the titles were ‚Äúsuch a big part of the identity of Broad City.‚Äù Mushrooms earned Perry and his team an Emmy Award for Outstanding Motion Design.  Books and Magazines  In collaboration with partner Anna Wolf, Perry started Untitled: (a fashion) Magazine in 2007, and in 2014, Tidal, a biannual print magazine focused on art and culture. His pop culture monographs include Pulled: A Catalog of Screen Printing and the career anthology Wondering Around Wandering: Work-So-Far. The collection My Mother Caught Me Doodling is from the show of the same name. What If My Dog Had Thumbs? is his first solo book for children.  Curation  Since 2011, Perry and artist Josh Cochran have been organizing a series of nude, two-day drawing marathons, #GetNudeGetDrawn, enlisting volunteers to model nude, initially organized using social media and Craigslist. The drawings are exhibited and sold at a pop-up exhibition immediately afterwards. Other past artist participants include Lisa Hanawalt, Deanne Cheuk, Jon Burgerman, Julia Rothman and Monica Ramos. In 2015, Perry created and curated an 820-foot-long mural with nine other artists, that was completed in one day.  Awards and recognition  Perry was chosen for Step Magazine's 30 under 30 in 2004, and named a groundbreaking illustrator by Computer Arts Projects Magazine in 2007. In 2008, he was selected by the Art Directors Club for Young Guns 6, and received Print Magazine's New Visual Artist award. In 2018, he won the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Motion Design as Animation Director for the Broad City Mushrooms episode for Comedy Central and Jax Media.

It is notable for being the only known album recorded by the successful country music writer. It is also notable as being the first full-length album released on the short lived J-M-I Records label. Several of the songs from the album, including \\"Catfish John\\" and \\"Come Early Morning\\" would go on to have chart success covered by other artists, including Don Williams and Johnny Russell.  Background  Bob McDill came to initial professional recognition in 1967 with \\"The Happy Man\\", recorded by Perry Como. Songwriting duo Dickey Lee and Allen Reynolds were credited with helping to land the gig, and McDill would remain professionally involved with them throughout the 1970s. Reynolds went to work for Jack Clement as vice president of his new record label, J-M-I, and Reynolds brought along McDill to be a writer for the publishing division, Jack Music, Inc. Reynolds would also go on to produce and co-write much of the material on Short Stories with McDill. The first single released from the album in 1972 was \\"Song for Nan (What a Feeling)\\", a song dedicated to McDill's wife. The album was the first LP released by J-M-I in 1972, which was a small record label with independent distribution agreements. J-M-I experienced noted distribution issues during its existence, and the album did not have an initial wide release. While the album wasn't a chart success, McDill's career as a songwriter quickly became more lucrative, as the songs from Short Stories would soon go on to be released successfully by other artists. Of his short lived career as recording musician, McDill said: > ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt want it that badly. Making records is fun but I didn‚Äôt want to be > a star.‚Äù \\"Catfish John\\" co-written with Reynolds, was recorded by American country music artist Johnny Russell. It was released November 1972 as the fourth single from the album, \\"Catfish John\\"/\\"Chained\\", and became a number thirteen country chart hit. The song is credited with propelling Bob McDill into the front ranks of country songwriters.Edward Morris Songwriter Bob McDill Talks About His Many Hits Legendary Tunesmith Submits to Rare Interview at Country Music Hall of Fame and Museum July 4, 2008 CMT News Don Williams would release \\"Come Early Morning\\" (with the B-Side \\"Amanda\\" - another noted McDill composition) as a single from his debut album, Don Williams Volume One, in 1973, and it would be a number twelve country chart hit. \\"Come Early Morning\\" is argued to have one of the first country music videos, produced by Jack Clement. \\"Help Yourselves To Each Other\\" would also be included on Williams' 1975 hit album You're My Best Friend.

The show is a collaboration between Lit Hub and The Podglomerate podcast network, featuring prominent authors such as Mitch Albom and Lidia Yuknavitch, alongside musicians, many of whom reside within Portland, Oregon. Season One debuted on December 3, 2019. Series overview Brewer had alluded to an uncertain future for Storytellers Telling Stories which he \\"couldn't talk about\\" in as early as February 2019. Later that year, on November 8, Storybound was officially unveiled at a live performance for the Literary Arts Portland Book Festival pre-show, Lit Crawl, where they also announced their sponsorship with Powell's Books. In a Willamette Week interview regarding the crafting of each episode, Brewer likened the relationship between literature and music as the conceptual evolution of a live reading, also adding how \\"beats or time signatures or chord progressions\\" allow listeners to feel a story's forward progression: \\"There's something subtle in your mind telling you, 'I'm going to get past this moment.'\\" Storybound is noted for pairing bestselling writers with comparatively unknown musicians, an idea spun out of Brewer's initial conception for Storytellers Telling Stories which he has described as being \\"experimental and a little less predictable\\". Season One will include critically acclaimed and bestselling authors such as Mitch Albom, Lidia Yuknavitch, Matt Gallagher, Kim Barnes, Adelle Waldman, Diksha Basu, Nathan Hill (writer), Caitlin Doughty, as well as a story told by Jack Rhysider, creator of the popular podcast Darknet Diaries.

It is situated immediately southwest of Coquihalla Summit, and south- southwest of Yak Peak. Due to its close proximity to the Coquihalla Highway, the mountain is a popular hiking destination in summer, and skiing and snowshoeing in winter. Precipitation runoff from the peak drains into tributaries of the Coquihalla River. The mountain's descriptive name was officially adopted on October 6, 1936, by the Geographical Names Board of Canada. Geology During the Pleistocene period dating back over two million years ago, glaciation advancing and retreating repeatedly scoured the landscape leaving deposits of rock debris. The \\"U\\"-shaped cross section of the river valleys are a result of recent glaciation. Uplift and faulting in combination with glaciation have been the dominant processes which have created the tall peaks and deep valleys of the North Cascades area. The North Cascades features some of the most rugged topography in the Cascade Range with craggy peaks and ridges, deep glacial valleys, and granite spires. Geological events occurring many years ago created the diverse topography and drastic elevation changes over the Cascade Range leading to various climate differences which lead to vegetation variety defining the ecoregions in this area. Climate Needle Peak in winter Based on the K√∂ppen climate classification, Needle Peak is located in the marine west coast climate zone of western North America. Most weather fronts originate in the Pacific Ocean, and travel east toward the Cascade Range where they are forced upward by the range (Orographic lift), causing them to drop their moisture in the form of rain or snowfall. As a result, the Cascade Mountains experience high precipitation, especially during the winter months in the form of snowfall. Temperatures can drop below ‚àí20 ¬∞C with wind chill factors below ‚àí30 ¬∞C. The months July through September offer the most favorable weather for climbing Needle Peak.

Built under the Brooklyn Queens Expressway, the 18,000 square foot professionally built skate park was completed in 2016 and sits within Golconda Playground.  History  Located under the Brooklyn Queens Expressway, the park originated as a D.I.Y skate park known as Fat Kid or the Fat Kid spot. In 2013, work began on a 3.7 million dollar redesign of Golconda playground which included a redesign of the old D.I.Y skate park into a public skate park that flows with the design of the entire park. In 2016, the New York City Parks Department opened a remodeled Golconda Playground, including a redesigned skatepark. Steve Rodriguez worked with the Parks Department and the skating community to advise the design of the skate park. Starting in early 2019, the NYC Skateboard Coalition, working with the New York City Department of Parks and Recreation, hosts monthly clean-ups at Golconda to mitigate the debris that build up in the park. In November 2019, the Brooklyn Skate Garden joined the NYC Skateboard Coalition to co-host a clean-up and skate session. Also in November 2019, the NYC Skateboard Coalition installed a lock box for brooms and other tools to be stored in an accessible place at Golconda for park locals to clean the skatepark themselves.  Fat Kid Spot original name  The DIY skate spot that became Golconda Skate Park got its original name, Fat Kid Spot, because of its low-impact obstacles, which were relatively close to the ground. Hence, the obstacles were easier to do for \\"fatter\\" people.  Etymology of Golconda  The name ‚ÄúGolconda‚Äù is a portmanteau of GOLd, CONcord and anaconDA, because the park is shaped like a snake. The park sits on Gold and Concord Streets.

Most of its campuses are in Grand Rapids while one is in Rockford. Its administrative headquarters are in Grand Rapids. Tom DeJonge is the superintendent of the system. History Circa 2004 the school had a debt of about $20 million, and in 2009 the debt was down to $12.5 million; the school had incurred debt partly due to renovations of the Millbrook school and the construction of the Rockford school. That year Richard DeVos and Helen DeVos gave a donation of $10 million, and the debt was reduced to $2.5 million. Members of the DeVos family have consistently donated to the school system: the Dick and Betsy DeVos Family Foundation gave the school system $2,390,000 in the years 1999 through 2014. In 2013 members of the DeVos family donated a total of over $6.8 million to the school, including $3.2 million from Doug DeVos, $300,000 from Dick DeVos, and $20,400 from Dan DeVos. DeJonge is a personal friend of the family, including U.S. Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos, who enrolled her children in this school system. In 2017 Erica L. Green of The New York Times wrote \\"Ms. [Betsy] DeVos is still involved in the school.\\" She added that Betsy DeVos and her husband Dick \\"are known to be very generous to Grand Rapids Christian High School\\". Circa 2013 the system faced an increase in enrollment. Operations the school did not use money from tuition to cover debts. Demographics racial groups other than non-Hispanic white make up about a quarter the school system's students. Betsy DeVos stated that the Grand Rapids Christian School student body had more ethnic diversity than that of the public schools in Ada Township, Michigan. About 30% of the student body is eligible for school food service at a lower price and/or at no price at all. DeJonge expressed pride that the school enrolls students reliant on public transportation and students on scholarships. The school system gives financial assistance to about 45% of the students. Curriculum The curriculum includes Christianity-related topics and topics about other religions. Students study both the theory of evolution and Creationism. Culture Green wrote in 2017 that \\"the school looked like a relaxed comprehensive public high school\\". Schools All campuses are in Grand Rapids unless otherwise noted. * Grand Rapids Christian High School (9-12) * Grand Rapids Christian Middle School (5-8) ** In 2013 the middle school had 435 students. In September 2013 Grand Rapids Christian Schools offered to buy the Shawnee Park Math/Science/Technology Academy building for its middle school for $800,000 from Grand Rapids Public Schools. The school, which closed in 2013, was perennially underutilized due to an area preference for religious schools. The district accepted the offer in 2014. The previous middle school facility, also the Evergreen Campus, was built in 1955. DeJonge stated that using a new building would cost less than renovating the existing space for a middle school purpose, and that the new building has more potential uses. The move of the middle school to the current site was scheduled for 2015. * Rockford Christian School (PreK-8) - Rockford * Christian Elementary Evergreen Campus (PreK-5) ** The building it occupies was built in 1955. The middle school was previously co-located; it was scheduled to move out in 2015. * Christian Elementary Iroquois Campus (PreK-4) One of the elementary buildings had a cost of $12.5 million. The system includes the Richard and Helen DeVos Center for Arts and Worship, within the high school facility. It was a result of a donation by Richard DeVos circa 1998. Prior to the center's establishment, the high school students attended chapel at multiple churches because they could not fit in the same church building.

Oceanic rocks from the ancient ocean floor are preserved in the Mongol-Okhotsk suture zone extending through Mongolia to the Sea of Okhotsk.  Sequence of events  With the formation of the supercontinent Pangea in the mid- to late-Paleozoic, the vast Panthalassa ocean dominated 70 percent of the Earth's surface. The Tethys, Mongol-Okhotsk and various small domains of early Pacific ocean crust constituted other small oceans. Paleomagnetic data collected between 1987 and 2010 suggest that the Mongol-Okhotsk oceanic crust subducted under the terranes of Mongolia in the Late Jurassic or Early Cretaceous. During the early Mesozoic, the Solonker Ocean, also known as the Intra-Asian Ocean closed bringing together two large continental blocks: Amuria and the North China Block. Amuria then collided with the Siberian Craton, preserving the Mongol-Okhotsk suture zone. Geologists debate why the suture zone ends abruptly near Kazakhstan and have used seismic tomography to develop different interpretations.  Rock formations of the Mongol-Okhotsk suture zone  Most exposed rocks in the suture zone are thrusted accretionary wedges, often with ophiolites. Uranium-lead dating of basalt, dolerite gabbro as well as Silurian radiolarite gives ages constraints on the formation of the oceanic crust. Dated rocks in the Adaatsag ophiolite in the east are among the oldest at 325 million years old.

The building was the home of artist Roger Brown, an influential figure in the Chicago Imagists movement of the mid-twentieth century. Locally, Brown's art has been featured in the Art Institute of Chicago and on the front of 120 North LaSalle; on a national level, his works graced the cover of two issues of Time and have appeared in the New York Times and several major American art museums. Though it was constructed as a store in 1888, Brown and his partner George Veronda purchased the building in 1974 and converted it to a studio and living space. Brown's artistic style inspired his redesign of the home and its back garden; in turn, the home inspired many similar buildings in his artwork. Brown lived and worked in the home until his death in 1997. The building was added to the National Register of Historic Places on February 22, 2011.

He is known for his revised and expanded version of Lancelot Threlkeld's 1834 work, An Australian Grammar, with the new title An Australian language as spoken by the Awabakal, the people of Awaba or Lake Macquarie (near Newcastle, New South Wales) being an account of their language, traditions and customs / by L.E. Threlkeld; re- arranged, condensed and edited with an appendix by John Fraser (1892). In this, Fraser created new divisions and terminology for some Aboriginal groups in New South Wales. Biography Fraser was born in Perth, Scotland in 1834 and educated at the University of Edinburgh. He migrated to Australia and settled at Maitland, New South Wales. In 1861 he was appointed rector of the Presbyterian Maitland High School, before going on to establish his own school, known as Sauchie House (now Maitland Boys High School). There he remained as headmaster for about 20 years. Apart from being an advocate of Christian missions, Fraser was an ethnologist and linguist, with a particular interest in Australian Aboriginal languages. His book, The Aborigines of New South Wales, (available online) won the 1882 Royal Society of New South Wales Prize, and he wrote numerous scholarly articles and books. An Australian Language (1892) The work which won him most recognition was his much expanded and authoritative edition of L.E. Threlkeld's grammar of the Awabakal language, An Australian Grammar. Scan1 Scan2 Fraser's revised edition, containing much original material based on his own research, was published in 1892 as An Australian language as spoken by the Awabakal, the people of Awaba or Lake Macquarie (near Newcastle, New South Wales) being an account of their language, traditions and customs / by L.E. Threlkeld; re-arranged, condensed and edited with an appendix by John Fraser. (NLA catalogue entry) In the preface, Fraser writes: \\"...but we have now come to know that this dialect was essentially the same as that spoken by the sub-tribes occupying the land where Sydney now stands, and that they all formed part of one great tribe, the Kuriggai\\". The book included a \\"Map of New South Wales as occupied by the native tribes\\", accompanied by descriptions and names decided upon by Fraser after \\"ten years' thought and inquiry on the location of our native tribes\\". In the text accompanying his map, Fraser writes: His major work was not without its later critics. Historian Niel Gunson wrote in 1974 that the work was \\"hampered by his peculiar theories of racial and linguistic origin\\". Anthropologist and ethnologist Norman Tindale (Aboriginal tribes of Australia, 1974) wrote that there was such a He goes on to list the BangarangNote:RH Mathews' spelling.

The zine covers punk rock culture and grassroots activism in various locations, including Miami, San Francisco, Buenos Aires, Los Angeles, and New York City. In early issues, the zine explored squatting, dumpster diving, train hopping, and volunteering with needle exchange programs and Food Not Bombs. Furthermore, the zine explained \\"scams\\" to readers, so that they could attain items or benefits for free. Lyle started the zine as a teenage, after fleeing a violent home situation in Palm Beach County. She moved into a Ft. Lauderdale punk house, where she was introduced to a zine called Get Loose. This zine helped inspired Lyle to create her own zine. Early issues of SCAM focused on topics such as freight hopping, generator shows, wheatpasting, selling plasma, and returning stolen merchandise. For contemporary audiences, many of the scams detailed in the zine are no longer relevant. However, the zine is understood to be a source of inspiration and creative resistance for many readers. It is particularly known for documenting a life that aims to \\"...resist capitalism and have fun AND have a sense of humour at the same time,\\" according to Microcosm Publishing. Over time, the zine became more political. In 2008, Lyle produced an issue that focused on street art and activism in Buenos Aires, Argentina. In 2010, SCAM examined Art Basel, juxtaposing the elite art world with the tent cities of Miami. In 2011, SCAM focused on Black Flag and the Los Angeles punk scene. In 2016, Lyle produced a twenty-fifth anniversary issue, which included interviews with Barry McGee, Danny Lyon, Rebecca Giordano, and others. Lyle explained in an interview, \\"The magazine started as a way to document the life my friends and I were leading as teenagers, which was getting everything for free [through scams, stealing, and resource-sharing]. But it was also a way to participate in and broaden my community. As I got older, my interests changed. I became less interested specifically in punk and more involved in activism, and I started doing other self-publishing projects for a broader audience. SCAM is sort of morphing into more longform, underground journalism, where I try to cover things outside of the mainstream but in a really careful and thoughtful way.\\" In 2010, Microcosm Publishing printed Scam: The First Four Issues. In 2019, Lyle joined the band Bikini Kill as a guitarist. She discussed SCAM in interviews, and she stated that an eleventh issue was in development.

Life and career Olav Bj√∏rgaas was born on 7 September 1926 in Stavanger, Norway. Bj√∏rgaas's family was poor, and his father was chronically ill. His childhood circumstances inspired him to become a doctor. Bj√∏rgaas planned to work in China as a medical missionary with the Norwegian Mission Alliance (NMA), but was unable to do so, as he had not finished his medical studies by 1949, when the Communist Party of China expelled NMA members from the country. Bj√∏rgaas earned his medical qualifications in January 1954, married his wife Kari in February, and joined the NMA in Taiwan by July. Upon Bj√∏rgaas's arrival in Taiwan, he met fellow physician , who had left Mackay Memorial Hospital. Bj√∏rgaas chose to work with patients with leprosy while in Taiwan, and Joseph Leyburn Wilkerson, a colleague of Lillian Dickson's, contacted him in August 1954, with a job at the Losheng Sanatorium. Bj√∏rgaas found that many patients distrusted him until Bj√∏rgaas used a catheter to remove phlegm from a choking patient. Within two years at Losheng, Bj√∏rgaas learned that multiple patients were from southern Taiwan, so he moved to Pingtung County. He became the leader of a clinic located in a granary established for the treatment of tuberculosis. Bj√∏rgaas subsequently founded a clinic near Kaohsiung for people with leprosy. Bj√∏rgaas worked with former Losheng residents to search for lepers throughout Pingtung. While treating the sick, he did not use the word \\"leprosy\\" or record patient names. As the number of patients increased, Bj√∏rgaas moved his Pingtung operations to a mansion built in the Japanese era, and renamed it the Pingtung Christian Clinic. Fotland joined Bj√∏rgaas and traveled with him to Wutai, Kucapungane, and Mudan to treat patients for no charge. By 1958, the Pingtung Christian Clinic had been expanded with a sanatorium for children with tuberculosis. It also began treating polio. When the area was hit with a measles outbreak, Bj√∏rgaas went to Kaohsiung and asked American military officers to deliver food and medicine to the sick via helicopter. Bj√∏rgaas returned to Norway in 1959 to raise money for the Pingtung Christian Clinic. When a polio epidemic struck southern Taiwan in the 1960s, Bj√∏rgaas arranged for American-made vaccines to be imported and administered 4,000 vaccinations for free. In 1963, the Pingtung Christian Hospital opened. Bj√∏rgaas was reassigned to a leprosy clinic in Kaohsiung in 1967, and left Taiwan briefly, before returning to Pingtung in 1974. He established a medical ward for the care of people with cerebral palsy in 1978, as well as Victory Home for people with disabilities. Bj√∏rgaas later worked for the NMA in Vietnam, South America and Haiti. He retired and returned to Norway in 1982, though Bj√∏rgaas did work for the Sino-German Clinic in China in 1991. The Victory Home in Pingtung established by Bj√∏rgaas, pictured in 2016 Legacy In December 2008, Bj√∏rgaas was awarded the St. Olav's Medal. The Bj√∏rgaas Social Welfare Foundation, named for Olav Bj√∏rgaas, was established in 2013, and began working with widows from Malawi. The foundation has also arranged educational exchanges amongst students from Malawi and Taiwan, and worked with the elderly in Taiwan. Bj√∏rn Jarle S√∏rheim- Queseth wrote a biography of Bj√∏rgaas in 2012, a Chinese translation of which was published in 2013 in Taiwan by CommonWealth Publishing. Bj√∏rgaas himself was awarded the Fervent Global Love of Lives Medal by the Chou Ta-Kuan Cultural and Educational Foundation in 2014. Bj√∏rgaas died on 15 November 2019, in Stavanger, Norway.

The show centers around three young girls who carry out spy missions.  Plot  Bobby, Lola, and Juliette are three extraordinary 10-year-old girls who live a seemingly normal life. However the trio work undercover as the \\"Berry Bees\\" for the Bee Intelligence Agency (B.I.A. for short), a secret agency that selected them to carry out special spy missions. The girls, all codenamed after a type of berry, are given gadgets each episode by the head of the agency, Ms. Berry. Usually the girls have to foil the evil plans of recurring villains such as Tara Bytes, Mirage, and the Greenthumbs. At the end of each episode, the villain escapes the confusion to fight the girls another day while things return to normal.  Characters   Main  * Bobby ‚Äì An expert in technology and a nerd.

Her research interests include: * Voter preferences regarding redistributive policies * The implications of U.S. public health insurance programs on vulnerable groups * The U.S. criminal justice system  Selected publications   Research on voter preferences regarding redistributive policies  Support for Redistribution in an Age of Rising Inequality: New Stylized Facts and Some Tentative Explanations (2016) To determine the changes in level of support for redistribution in the U.S., Ilyana Kuziemko, Vivekinan Ashok, and Ebonya Washington analyze American survey data over several decades. Although economic inequality in the U.S. has been increasing since 1970, the study finds that the support for redistribution has remained flat, and has decreased significantly for the elderly and for African-Americans. Possible explanations for this trend are explored, and the authors argue that the elderly have grown less supportive of redistribution due to worries that it would come at their expense through cuts to Medicare. The authors also argue that African-American attitudes surrounding fairness in economic issues have increased, explaining the decline in support for redistribution. How Elastic Are Preferences for Redistribution? Evidence from Randomized Survey Experiments (2015) Ilyana Kuziemko, Michael I. Norton, Emmanuel Saez, and Stefanie Stantcheva use randomized online surveys on Amazon Mechanical Turk (mTurk) to analyze the effects of information regarding income inequality and taxes on preferences for redistribution. Randomized treatments were provided to approximately 4,000 respondents with varying information on income inequality in the U.S., the estate tax, and the relationship between tax rates on the highest income group and economic growth. The authors find that the treatment has substantial effects on views about the significance of inequality as a problem. Conversely, the treatment has limited effects on preferences surrounding redistributive policies. Lastly, the authors observe that treatments informing respondents that the estate tax only affects very wealthy families have a large positive effect on support for the estate tax.  Research on the implications of U.S. public health insurance programs on vulnerable groups  Does Managed Care Widen Infant Health Disparities? Evidence from Texas Medicaid (2017) In this study, the effects of the transition from fee-for-service (FFS) programs to managed care plans on the disparities in infant health outcomes are analyzed. Ilyana Kuziemko, Katherine Meckel, and Maya Rossin-Slater find that mortality rates and pre-term birth rates increase for black infants, by 15 percent and 7 percent, respectively, and decrease for Hispanic infants by 22 percent and 7 percent, respectively, under private Medicaid Managed Care (MMC) plans. The Demand for Health Insurance Among Uninsured Americans: Results of a Survey Experiment and Implications for Policy (2013) To assess the willingness of uninsured Americans to pay for a health insurance plan. Alan B. Krueger and Ilyana Kuziemko conduct a survey experiment on approximately 1,000 individuals through a Gallup-Healthways Daily Poll. The authors observe a higher price elasticity than previously found in other studies. Among the respondents who reported being uninsured, 60 percent would purchase insurance if offered a $2,000 annual premium. Krueger and Kuziemko argue that these results suggest that under the provisions of the Affordable Care Act, an estimate of 29 million uninsured individuals are projected to gain coverage. Furthermore, the authors argue that the results of the study show that the effects of such policies in increasing coverage rates have been greatly underestimates in previous studies.  Research on the U.S. criminal justice system  How Should Inmates Be Released From Prison? An Assessment of Parole Versus Fixed Sentence Regimes (2013) To study how parole and fixed sentencing affect recidivism rates, Ilyana Kuziemko analyzes data from the Georgia Department of Corrections over several decades. The study finds that parole boards efficiently set prison time based on a prisoner's recidivism risk, thus reducing recidivism within three years of release by 1.3 percentage points. Furthermore, the findings indicate that the \\"90% policy\\" ‚Äì where prisoners are required to complete at least 90% of their original sentence without the possibility of parole ‚Äì reduces the inmates' incentives to rehabilitate, resulting in an increase in recidivism rates.

Education and early life  Gardner graduated in 1965 from Irvington High School in Irvington, New Jersey. She then earned a bachelor of arts degree in education in 1969 from Parsons College in Fairfield, Iowa, received a master of arts in administration and supervision in 1976 from San Diego State University, and a doctorate in administration in 1988 from the University of Southern California.  Career  Gardner worked for 38 years in public education, teaching school before becoming an administrator, vice principal, a principal at Mission Bay High School, assistant superintendent of the Poway Unified School District, and an instructional leader at the Institute for Learning at San Diego Unified School District. When Gardner retired in 2008, she was the executive director of the San Diego County Office of Education, Juvenile Court and Community Schools.  Community work  Gardner, beginning in 1990, chaired the Mission Beach Town Council‚Äôs Graffiti Patrol. Before painting over graffiti in the beach area, Gardner would take photos and then send them to the San Diego Police Department's gang unit so officers could identify the gangs to which the graffiti was tied. The police department deputized her and gave her an honorary badge, making her graffiti-abatement role official. For more than 20 years, Gardner, riding a three-wheeled bicycle, hauled supplies and paint as she pedaled to different spots in the beach area to paint over graffiti in an effort to improve the community. Gardner also was a former president of the Mission Beach Women's Club. At the time of her death, Gardner sat on the City of San Diego's Consolidated Plan Advisory Board.  Fatal crash  Gardner died from a severe head injury in February 2016 in what police called a road rage-fueled hit-and-run crash by a drunken driver as Gardner removed graffiti from a beach wall. The driver, Jonathan Domingo Garcia, 23, was charged with gross vehicular manslaughter while intoxicated and felony hit-and-run. He pleaded guilty in June to gross vehicular manslaughter while intoxicated and was sentenced in 2016 to 11 years in a California State Prison.  Recognition  Three months before Gardner's unexpected death, the City of San Diego in 2015 declared November 3 as Maruta Gardner Day in recognition of Gardner's years of service to the community through the Mission Beach Women's Club, for her graffiti eradication work in the Mission Beach and Pacific Beach communities, and for her efforts through the woman's club to upgrade a playground at Bonita Cove, Mission Beach, through the \\"Play by the Bay\\" fundraising effort. San Diego Mayor Kevin Faulconer, at a November 2019 groundbreaking of a $3.4 million renovation of the playground at Mission Bay Park, officially renamed the Bonita Cove Playground after Gardner. Every November 3 since Gardner's death, residents participate in a beach cleanup as a continuing memorial to her and to honor her dedication to community service. A large mural, painted on a Mission Bay High School wall by artist John Vallas, was unveiled in Gardner's memory in 2017.  Scholarship  In 2017, Gardner's Irvington High School class of 1965 designated funds for a Maruta Rubens Gardner Scholarship, which was awarded in a ceremony to graduating senior Ashley Moreno.

He made his literary debut in 2008 with the autobiographical novel Jinsili malsodwen peiji (ÏßÑÏã§Ïù¥ ÎßêÏÜåÎêú ÌéòÏù¥ÏßÄ, The Page Where Truth Has Been Erased). His full-length novel Sosu uigyeon (ÏÜåÏàòÏùòÍ≤¨, Minority Opinion) (2010), based on the Yongsan Tragedy and corruption in the Korean judiciary system, won him much recognition. With interests ranging from feminism to gender minority issues, Sohn remains active as a public speaker, TV panelist, and influencer. Life Sohn studied aesthetics at Seoul National University. From his high school years to his early twenties, he performed as a rapper under the pseudonym Sohnjeondosa (Evangelist Sohn) in a band that he called Jinsili Malsodwen Peiji, using a phrase lifted from Yi-sang‚Äôs short story ‚ÄúThe Wings‚Äù (1936). After gaining fame in the underground hip hop scene, he signed with a major label; however, although he had finished recording his debut album, he was unable to release the album and quit his music career after a legal dispute with the company. His experiences with the subsequent litigation became a valuable asset in writing Sosu uigyeon (2010). In 2008, he announced Jinsili malsodwen peiji (2008), a work of fiction based on the legal battles he experienced as a rapper. In 2010, he released the novel Sosu uigyeon that deals with the many issues that occurred during the court proceedings of the Yongsan Tragedy. Having participated in the film adaptation of this work, he received the award for best screenplay at the 2015 Buil Film Award and Blue Dragon Awards. In the book‚Äôs film version, The Unfair, Sohn appears in a brief cameo as an employee at the Ministry of Justice. Criticizing the established power structure in the publication industry among publishers, famous authors, and literary awards, in 2015 he took to his Facebook page to argue for a complete abolition of all prizes in literature. Following that, he announced he will establish his own award, a parody of the existing system called World‚Äôs Best Book Prize with a cash prize of 10 billion Korean won that will go to the winning title. Sohn declared this award will stay in place until all submissions-based literature prizes are discontinued. Going further, he announced that his third novel D Minus (2014) would receive the first World‚Äôs Best Book Prize. Other than creative writing, Sohn is active as a columnist, TV panelist and public speaker, and he also expresses his opinions frequently on Facebook. Works Jinsili malsodwen peiji (2008) Sohn Ah-ram‚Äôs first novel Jinsili malsodwen peiji (2008) is an autobiographical coming-of-age novel that draws upon the underground hip hop scene. This work employs a form of fact fiction that combines known facts together with elements of fiction. The novel introduces actual bands and real-life artists as characters while also incorporating the author‚Äôs autobiographical experiences and various fictional elements. Sosu uigyeon (2010)  The legal troubles Sohn experienced during his time as a rapper led to his successful hit Sosu uigyeon (2010). Sosu uigyeon describes the Yongsan Tragedy that occurred as a result of riot police clashing against several evictees in a neighborhood that had been planned for redevelopment, as well as the ensuing legal battle. Going beyond a simple good-versus-evil pitting of the characters, the novel vividly illustrates the legal proceedings and the overall judicial world, while speaking out against the illusions surrounding the judicial system and questioning the relationship between state and citizens, fact and truth, and law and justice. The author‚Äôs criticism against the judicial system and state power led to a critique on the influence of the publishing industry and the literary world at large. Sohn‚Äôs work Munhakui saeroeun saedae (Î¨∏ÌïôÏùò ÏÉàÎ°úÏö¥ ÏÑ∏ÎåÄ The New Generation of Literature) (2012) parodies this power and the literary institutions by placing a veteran literary critic and a successful writer, who are also sworn enemies, in the same room as judges for a creative writing contest. D Minus (2014)  D Minus (2014) follows the lives of college students deeply engaged in the protest movement of the 1990s, who find that they have lost a certain grand discourse and a common objective. The author describes his personal experiences in 154 short vignettes that together form a mosaic that illustrates the realities of an era.

He changed his name to Sabatier-Ungher after his marriage to the Austro-Hungarian opera singer, Caroline Ungher.  Biography  His father was a wealthy land owner from Languedoc, who died just before his birth, so he was raised by an uncle, the Abb√© Roques. Not long after beginning his studies at a Jesuit college, he declared his intention to become a writer and poet; running away to Paris to pursue that goal. He arrived there in 1833 and found encouragement from Alfred de Vigny. He also made acquaintances in the art world, including and Edmond Wagrez (1815-1882), both of whom would accompany him to Rome in 1838. While there, he befriended several more French artists who were residing at the Villa Medici, notably Dominique Papety, and was introduced to the philosophy of Charles Fourier. D√©tail from The Painter's Studio During this trip, he met the Austrian opera singer, Caroline Ungher, who was famous for helping Beethoven acknowledge the applause at the premier of his Ninth Symphony. They were married in 1841, in Florence. After a honeymoon, travelling through Germany, they returned to Florence and settled there. His artist friends pitched in to help them decorate their new apartment. In 1846, Sabatier and Papety embarked on a study trip to Greece, but Sabatier returned upon hearing the news that his friend, Bouquet, was dying. He and Caroline adopted Bouquet's daughter, Louise, who would later marry the Italian historian, Michele Amari. The French Revolution of 1848, with its promise of establishing a government based on Fourier's principles, drew him back to France. In 1851, he wrote review of that year's Salon; welcoming the rise of Realism and, in particular, the works of Gustave Courbet. Shortly after, he would become one of Courbet's patrons and, later, his friend. Following the Coup d'√©tat of 1851, he retired to his estate, Le Tour de Farges, near Lunel-Viel; welcoming Courbet there in 1854. The following year, while living in Ornans, Courbet would create his large canvas, The Painter's Studio which depicts the artist Apollonie Sabatier (no relation), next to a man who is usually identified as her lover, Alfred Mosselman, but may be Fran√ßois. In 1857, Courbet returned for a lengthy visit to Le Tour, creating several landscapes there. In addition to notables from the art world, several political figures were also his guests, including the German revolutionary, Moritz Hartmann. After Caroline's death in 1877, he remarried; to Catherine Boll, about whom little is known. His will left his writings to the Mus√©e Fabre and his art collection to the Louvre. He also made a large donation to a retirement home in Neuilly, where one of his old friends, the sculptor Auguste Ottin, was a resident. Among the works he translated from German are: Die Grabm√§ler der R√∂mischen P√§pste by Ferdinand Gregorovius, Wilhelm Tell by Friedrich von Schiller and Faust by Goethe.

On 30 June 1944 the Corps was merged into the IV SS Panzer Corps. History The headquarters of the VII SS Armored Corps were established on 3 October 1943 in the training camp in Morhange (north-eastern France). The new corps was intended to include the 10th SS Panzer Division Frundsberg and the 17th SS Panzergrenadier Division G√∂tz von Berlichingen. Both divisions were still in training. At the end of December 1943, SS-Gruppenf√ºhrer Matthias Kleinheisterkamp was commissioned to lead the Corps, but in February 1944 he was also given command of the III (Germanic) SS Panzer Corps. Without the presence of a commander, staff personnel was transferred to other units. In February 1944, the staff only consisted of 1 officer and 1 Non-commissioned officer. In March 1944, the 10th SS Panzer Division was relocated to the Eastern front. After the landing in Normandy, the 17th SS Panzergrenadier Division was added to the 7th Army. In May 1944, SS-Gruppenf√ºhrer Kleinheisterkamp returned to the corps and was formally appointed commander. He restarted building the staff, but on 30 June 1944 the staff was merged with the IV SS Armored Corps, also led by Kleinheisterkamp.

Early life and education  Mori was born Ishiko Shibuya on July 21, 1899 in Chiba, Japan. She was born to a family of physicians. Her parents died when she was young, so she was raised by her aunt and uncle. When she was a teenager, she decided to become a physician in order to avoid an arranged marriage to a much older man. She studied at the Tokyo Women's College. When she graduated she was discouraged from practicing in Japan because women were only allowed to be either pediatricians or gynecologists.  Career  In 1927, Mori moved to Hawaii and worked at the Japanese Hospital, which was later known as the Kuakini Medical Center. She met and married physician Motokazu Mori, and they had two children together. She returned to Japan for both births, and quit her job at the hospital to raise them. Mori and her husband were also tanka poets, and she wrote under the penname \\"Shakunage\\". In 1934, she became the Yomiuri Shinbun's special correspondent in Hawaii. On December 3, 1941, the newspaper asked her to interview influential Japanese people in Hawaii about conditions there. She asked the Consulate General and several others, but after they declined she asked Motokazu to do the interview. On December 5, a reporter from the Yomiuri Shinbun called Motokazu to interview him about life in Hawaii. His answers seemed suspicious to FBI agents who were monitoring the call. After Pearl Harbor was attacked two days later, both Ishiko and Motokazu were accused of espionage and arrested. Mori was incarcerated at Sand Island, Sharp Park (California), and finally Crystal City Internment Camp. She and Motokazu founded the camp's hospital, and Mori started a girl scout troop. Mori returned to Honolulu on December 10, 1945. Mori began working as a research assistant at the American Cancer Society. She also continued writing for Japanese newspapers. She continued working as Motokazu's health worsened. During the late 1940s and through the 1950s, her in-laws, her daughter Pearl, and Motokazu all died. After Motokazu died, she transferred to the University of Hawaii's biomedical department as an epidemiology research assistant. In 1968 Mori was honored by the Japanese government for her work improving understanding between Japan and the United States. She was diagnosed with lung cancer the next year. She died on January 6, 1972.

It ended in a Seleucid victory, and the establishment of the Seleucid kingdom Background Seleucus had retaken Babylon, sometime between 312-311 B.C. He had been the province's satrap before, but was forced to leave, fearing Antigonus' increasing power and cruelty. The Antigonids made several attempts to retake the \\"gateway\\" to the rich eastern satrapies, but ended in failure. Antigonus made peace with the other diadochi (Ptolemy, Cassander and Lysimachus) and marched to Babylon with an army of 75,000 according to some sources, Seleucus then decided to wage a guerilla war, but Antigonus responded by pillaging and razing the territory, finally forcing Seleucus to face him on open ground, with a significantly smaller force. The Battle When the two armies met they fought an inconclusive engagement, both retired to their camps for the night; but whereas Antigonus's army disarmed and went to sleep, Seleucus ordered his men to dine and rest in full armor and in their ranks. The next morning, as the sun rose from the backs of the already deployed Seleucid phalanx, they began their advance and caught the enemy by surprise, overwhelming the enemy and routing his army. Antigonus managed to escape and gave up on the idea of reconquering the upper satrapies leaving the east to Seleucus.Richard A.

He was later guillotined for his crimes.  Biography  Giuseppe Sasia arrived in France at the end of the 19th century, at the age of 10. His father was an Italian farmer who settled in the country with his family. They moved to Les Arcs, and after his father's death, his mother returned to Italy, while he and his brother sold the family property. He bought another farm with his brother, which they also sold at a big profit. Sasia then bought a restaurant in Les Arcs. Giuseppe is known to have committed theft several times, and sentenced for it four times. Sasia lived in a small stone house in the middle of a field. He wasn't very sociable, and scared his neighbors, but nevertheless, he had a girlfriend. He worked for a while at a restaurant in Draguignan, a town where he went to buy ammunition. At some point, he had an affair with a woman from Draguignan, who rejected him because he was poor. The woman whom rejected owned a bar in the town.  Murders  His crimes were committed in a particular area; the journalists grouped them under the name of \\"The Crimes of Haut-Var\\".  Joseph Roumo  Joseph Roumo was murdered in front of his shop in Flayosc, in 1930. He was killed in similar circumstances to the other four victims, but Sasia wasn't prosecuted for this crime.  Marius Vassal  While napping near an oak tree in Taradeau, Vassal, a horticulturist, was shot dead on March 4, 1934. His body was later found hidden, and the hundred francs he was carrying on him were gone. At first, the judge indicted a \\"lunatic\\" for this killing, who dies shortly after his arrest.  Fernand Troin  Troin was murdered in Flayosc, on August 5, 1934. The octogenarian was returning home with provisions, when he passed by the place where his soon-to-be-killer was hiding. The latter shot Fernand, stealing his food and the ten francs he was carrying. A postwoman, who claimed to have seen the killer, was later unable to recognize Sasia at trial.  F√©licien Rouvier  F√©licien Rouvier, 35, was murdered on October 19, 1934, at Ampus. Sasia, who was familiar with the place, also knew that the shepherd was gone during the day, and that he had money on him. He placed himself in an alcove, until F√©licien returned with his sheep at nightfall. As he entered the house, he was shot with buckshot, and collapsed on the ground. Sasia then stole a watch, handkerchief, and the 137-160 francs, while the victim lay dying. He confessed the crime after Rouvier's watch was discovered in his pockets, after he was arrested. He claimed to have killed F√©licien, as he needed money to pay some fines.  Gianni Galliano  The 26-year-old chauffeur Galliano, who was on a work- related trip, was murdered in V√©rignon on November 30, 1934. While searching through Sasia's home, the gendarmes discovered Galliano's glove, leading to the first confessions. Sasia claimed to have had an altercation with the chauffeur on the road to Canjuers, deciding to shoot and rob him, before hiding the body. He shouted for Gianni to stop the vehicle, before shooting him. The mobile was the same one as F√©licien Rouvier's.  Arrest  Sasia was arrested by two policemen patrolling along the railway linking Vidauban to Les Arcs. He was walking around with his rifle by his side, perhaps looking for a new victim, and his attitude provoked the interested of the policemen. His appearance corresponded to the report broadcast eight days earlier. As Sasia could not present a hunting permit, he was taken in by the gendarmerie, to which he instantly admitted to having hunted without a license, as well as confessing to his theft convictions. Giuseppe claimed to reside in the neighborhood of Nouradons aux Arcs. The gendarmes discovered on him the watch stolen from the corpse of F√©licien Rouvier, prompting Sasia to quickly confess his guilt. He explained that he premeditated the action, waiting for the shepherd to arrive before killing him. From the on, the gendarmes searched his home, where they found six watches, five wallets and a pair of gloves, which turned out to be Galliano's. Sasia admitted to that murder as well, claiming at first that they had fought before, before acknowledging that he killed Gianni so he could rob him. Soon after, he acknowledged the murder of Vassal and Troin, but denied responsibility for the 1930 crime. When presented before the magistrate on the following day, he partly recanted his confession, recognizing only the two crimes for which there was evidence: those of Rouvier and Galliano. He claimed to have committed the crimes so he could pay his fines and evade prison. The investigators discovered two transfers made on the days after the two murders, and the presence of several watches raised concerns about other possible victims. Sasia declared after his arrest: \\"I deserve the guillotine\\". On December 18, he was charged with four murders, premeditated murder, followed by theft, and highway robbery with aggravating circumstances.  Trial  He was tried before the cour d'assises on November 5, 1935. Sasia acknowledged the murders of Rouvier and Galliano, but plead self-defense, trying to present it as a failed robbery. He denied being the perpetrator of the other two killings. Experts analyzed that the four victims were shot in similar circumstances, with buckshot at 4‚Äì5 meters in the shootings. The chief doctor of the asylum, Dr. Pierrefeu, noted that Sasia was fully aware of his actions. She declared: \\"He is a man who possesses to a high degree the feel of material things, and who has the mentality of a man of the woods; he is far from civilized. His mental level is low and, by poaching, he has assimilated men to the animals he was killing. His emotivity is null and his regret is purely verbal. But Sasia is not crazy\\". Watchmakers, who had repaired Vassal's watch on previous occasions, recognized it when it was shown to them by the gendarmes.: After several minutes of deliberation, jurors recognized him as guilty of the four murders and condemned him to the death penalty. Over five hundred people attended the last day of the trial.  Execution  His clemency was rejected, despite a meeting between his lawyer and the President. Sasia showed no regret before his conviction. During his detention on the death row, he requested the support of an almoner and began to regret his actions. He did not support the approach chosen for his execution, and had several crises of despair. After the execution of Niccolini in Avignon, the guillotine was brought to Draguignan. Sasia was executed on February 17, 1936, at 6:10 on La R√©publique Street, in front of the Draguignan Prison. While it was deployed in the public square, a large part of the service was set up to prevent from attending the execution. According to his lawyer, his last words were: \\"It's annoying to die\\". His body was later deposited at the Draguignan cemetery.  Controversy over deportation  A controversy arose from the fact that Sasia, an Italian national, was the subject of a deportation order from the gendarmes, since his first conviction. This, however, had not been applied: the prefecture's secretary was accused of favoring extremist immigrants, and thereafter removed from office.

The statue is dated to 131 CE, thanks to an inscription mentioning its dedication in \\"Year 4 of the Great King Kanishka\\", since the date of the beginning of Kanishka's reign is thought to be 127 CE. The Kimbell seated Bodhisattva belongs to the category of the \\"Seated Buddha triads\\", which can be seen contemporaneously in the Greco- Buddhist art of Gandhara and in the art of Mathura in the early Kushan period. Style The Kushans adopted the anthropomorphic image of the Buddha, probably developed during the 1st century CE in Mathura and Gandhara, and transformed it into a standardized mode of representation, using \\"confident and powerful imagery\\" on a grand scale. Free-standing statues of the Buddha appear around this time, possibly encouraged by doctrinal changes in Buddhism allowing to depart from the aniconism that had prevailed in the Buddhist sculptures at Mathura, Bharhut or Sanchi from the end of the 2nd century BCE. The Greco-Buddhist art of Gandhara appears to have fully developed around this time too, also under the rule of the Kushans, following on earlier imagery such as the Bimaran casket or the Butkara seated Buddha at the Butkara Stupa in Swat. The Kimbell seated Bodhisattva belongs to a type known as the \\"Kapardin\\" statue of the Buddha, characterized by a \\"Kapardin\\" coil of hair on the top of the head. The top of the statue was broken, and a full decorated aureola with flying attendants initially stood behind the image of the Buddha. He is flaked by two attendants holding fly whisks in a sign of devotion. The pedestal is structured around a wheel on a columns, seen in profile, with two attendants holding flowers, and two winged lions on the sides. Technically, the image mentions the \\"Bodhisattva\\" rather than the \\"Buddha\\", which would mean the Buddha just before his enlightenment, as the image of the Buddha after his enlightenment would be beyond the capabilities of human illustration. There has been a recurring debate about the exact identity of these Mathura statues, some claiming that they are only statues of Bodhisattavas, which is indeed the exact term used in most of the inscriptions of the statues found in Mathura. Only one or two statues of the Mathura type are known to mention the Buddha himself. This could be in conformity with an ancient Buddhist prohibition against showing the Buddha himself in human form, otherwise known as aniconism in Buddhism, expressed in the Sarvastivada vinaya (rules of the early Buddhist school of the Sarvastivada): \\"\\"Since it is not permitted to make an image of the Buddha's body, I pray that the Buddha will grant that I can make an image of the attendant Bodhisattva. Is that acceptable?\\" The Buddha answered: \\"You may make an image of the Bodhisattava\\"\\". However the scenes in the Isapur Buddha and the later Indrasala Buddha (dated 50-100 CE), refer to events which are considered to have happened after the Buddha's enlightenment, and therefore probably represent the Buddha rather than his younger self as a Bodhisattava, or a simple attendant Bodhisattva. Because of these elements, it is thought that the terms \\"Bodhisattva\\" and \\"Buddha\\" in the dedicatory inscriptions of early art of Mathura are relatively interchangeable. Inscription The inscription is very clear and redacted in hybrid Sanskrit. A complete photograph of the inscription was published by Fussman. It reads: 12px14px10px12px19px 14px14px16px19px 14pxëÅï Maharajasya Kanishkasya Sam 4: \\"Year 4 of the Great King Kanishka\\" Most importantly, the inscription mentions the reign of the Kushan ruler Kanishka, and a regnal date, allowing to date precisely the statue, based on the conventionally agreed date of 127 CE for the start of the reign of Kanishka: \\"Year 4 of the Great King Kanishka\\" appears in Brahmi at the beginning of the inscription on the pedestal, implying a date of 131 CE for the dedication of the statue. An alternative starting date for his reign is 78 CE, which would give a date of 82 CE for the statue. Similar statuary (1st-2nd century CE) Seated Bodhisattva Shakyamuni in Abhaya Mudra. Dated a bit earlier, to the period of the Northern Satraps, end of 1st century CE, Art of Mathura. A relatively large number of similar statues are known from Mathura.

Though the judge's name was never published, the case drew national attention, with negative commentary from former government minister Rodney Hide and the Sensible Sentencing Trust, and support from TV host and fellow naturist Paul Henry. The Judicial Conduct Commissioner does not report on the outcomes of individual complaints made against judges, and no further action was made public with regard to the case. The Club in response reviewed its policy around photographs on its website.  Community relations  Pineglades frequently hosts the New Zealand Naturist Federation's annual festival, a week-long sporting event held across the New Year. This festival is open to the general public as well as naturists. Pineglades regularly holds open days to promote naturism and attract new members; these events are often targeted at younger families. Each year on Waitangi Day the club challenges the local police and fire brigade to a volleyball tournament, held on club grounds.

Œ∫ŒªŒµœàœçŒ¥œÅŒ± III ‚Äúname of an ebbing well, in the Acropolis at Athens‚Äù of the Akropolis, Athens (not to be confused with the water clock klepsydra of the AgoraSee J.E. Armstrong and J.M. Camp, Notes on a Water Clock in the Athenian Agora, Hesperia 46, 1977, pp.147‚Äì61) is a natural spring on the north-west slope of the Akropolis hill,Travlos p.323 near the intersection of the Peripatos and the Panathenaic Way. It had been in use as a source of water since prehistoric times but sometime in the fifth century BCE the site was developed with several new structures built. The site consisted of the paved court, a well, the covered well-house, a later Roman apsidal well house (subsequently a Byzantine chapel) and a flight of stone-carved steps up to the propylaea. There are several references to the source in ancient literature; Hesychius says of it ‚ÄúKlepsydra is a fountain which was formerly called Empedo‚Äù.s.v. Klepsydra; Lexicon, Band I, s. 1243 Empedo, argues Parsons, was the name of the spring and klepsydra the name given to the water made available by the fountain house.Parsons p.203 It would seem that Empedo was also the name of the tutelary deity of the spring - an Attic nymph.Parsons p.203 Mention is also made of the fountain by Aristophanes,Birds 1695, Lysistrata 326 Pausanias,I.28.4 and Plutarch.Ant.34 It was Stuart and Revett who first identified the free-flowing stream on the face of the hill with the klepsydra mentioned by the ancient authors.Antiquities of Athens, 1764- ,I p.15 II pl. V During the period of Frankish control, the klepsydra was heavily fortified,Camp p.241 however, during the long period of Ottoman occupation the well fell into disuse such that the Turkish garrison of the Akropolis was forced to surrender at the siege of 1822 due to the lack of water.Parsons p.195 Kyriakos Pittakis rediscovered the source of the spring, leaving the first written account of the site in 1835.Ancienne Athenes ou la description des antiquit√©s d'Athenes et de ses environs (Athens, 1835), pp. 153-7 Archaeological examination began in earnest with √âmile Bturnouf in 1874, and with later development having been cleared from the site Kavvadias uncovered the paved court in 1897. From 1936 to 1940 the American School of Classical Studies at Athens undertook a campaign of excavation, with this the paved court, fountain house and draw basin were fully exposed. It was from this final excavation that it was determined that the spring house had been set into a natural cave which had collapsed sometime in antiquity. A shaft was then opened into the well directly accessible from the Akropolis and a new well house constructed above in the Roman period. From potsherds recovered it was ascertained that the original Greek fountain house was built not earlier than 475-470 BCE.Parsons p.229 File:Klepsydra paved court 01.jpgPaved court with draw well File:Klepsydra paved court.jpgPaved court seen from the Peripatos Notes Bibliography *A.

Schnell (* 10 June 1938 in Berlin) is a German computer scientist, founder of Software AG and long-time chairman of the Vorstand, executive board.  Life  He grew up in Alsbach-H√§hnlein near Darmstadt. Schnell was impressed by the IBM 650, the first commercial mainframe computer that Alwin Walther had procured for Technische Universit√§t Darmstadt (TU Darmstadt). He then studied physics and mathematics at TU Darmstadt. In 1965 he graduated with a diplom in mathematics under Walther. Already as a student he gave courses in programming languages and worked as a freelance programmer for Euratom and at the German Computer Center in Darmstadt. He was one of the best Go players in Europe.Auch in Darmstadt wird Go gespielt. Darmst√§dter Tagblatt, 27./28. September 1958, Page 5  Software AG  In 1969, together with five other colleagues from the Institute for Applied Information Processing (AIV), Schnell founded Software AG in Darmstadt out of a garage with a starting capital of 6.000 German Mark and several patents. Among the colleagues was Peter Pag√©, who left the company in 1992 after differences with Schnell. In the company, Schnell designed and developed the Adabas (Adaptable Database System) database management system. The mathematician based his concept on the NF¬≤ database model (NF¬≤ stands for NFNF = non first normal form). In 1971, the high-performance system was put into operation for the first time at Westdeutsche Landesbank. Schnell was responsible for the maintenance and further development of Adabas for mainframe systems of IBM and Siemens AG. The system was later used by numerous customers on the operating system platforms VMS from DEC, various Unix systems, Linux and Windows. Adabas is the fastest commercially available database management system in the world. In 1996, the sole shareholder retired from the Vorstand of Software AG and did not move to the supervisory board. At that time, Software AG had 28 subsidiaries in 80 countries, more than 3,300 employees were employed and sales revenues at that time amounted to approximately 800 million German Mark. Schnell then became a founder of the Software AG Foundation, one of the largest private foundations in Germany with headquarters in Darmstadt. The foundation holds 29 percent of the shares of Software AG. Soon after leaving his company, he devoted himself entirely to the foundation's work. He is an anthroposophist, and the foundation supports projects in the field of youth, elderly and disabled work as well as in science, research, education and nature conservation, including the University of Witten-Herdecke and the Alanus University of Arts and Social Sciences in Bonn. Schnells work was strongly influenced by the teaching of Rudolf Steiner. One motive for Schnells social commitment was that he himself has two sons with intellectual disabilities.Frankfurter Allgemeine Sonntagszeitung 27. Februar 2011, Nr. 8, S. 40, \\"Der Anthroposoph\\"  Awards  In 2002 he was awarded the Medal for Services to the Foundation System of the Federal Association of German Foundations for his foundation work by the President of Germany Johannes Rau.

Four books illustrated by Gekiere were chosen New York Times Best Illustrated Children‚Äôs Books of the Year from 1952 to 2002.  Life and education  Madeleine Gekiere was born in Zurich in 1919 and graduated from school in 1938. Fearing that Switzerland might be invaded by Nazis, her Jewish family came to America when Madeleine was 20 years old. She studied at New York University, the Art Students League, and Brooklyn Museum School. Gekiere taught painting at City College in New York for more than 23 years. Madeleine was married to an actor Paul Potter. She committed suicide in her Chelsea apartment at the age of 96.  Art  Having completed her studies at New York University, the Art Students League, and Brooklyn Museum School, Gekiere found her way as an artist, painter and sculptor. Her early drawing and paintings explore modernist abstraction and feature an earthy palette of blacks, browns and tans, while her later works experiment with assemblage, using everyday objects implying connections to figurative forms, like light bulbs, wood handles, toys, hosiery and books. Gekiere began showing her work at the Badcock Gallery in the New York in 1950s. At the same time she got acquainted with famed children‚Äôs book author and illustrator Helen Sewell living in same house who got Madeleine into book illustration. In the next ten years Gekiere illustrated two books that she wrote (Who Gave Us‚Ä¶ Peacocks? Planes? & Ferris Wheels?, 1953 and The Frilly Lily and the Princess, 1960 and many books by other authors. She illustrated several books for the poet John Ciardi and Ray Bradbury‚Äôs 1955 novel Switch on the Night.

When he left school he joined Harman and Stevens, the law firm of which his father was a partner. For many years he was one of the leading batsmen in Christchurch senior club cricket, but perhaps owing to nerves he was unable to transfer this form to inter-provincial level. His best score in 12 matches for Canterbury was 45, the highest score on either side when Otago beat Canterbury by five wickets in 1891-92. He was sometimes more effective as a bowler, as in his first match for Canterbury when, having not bowled in Wellington‚Äôs first innings, he took 5 for 43 in the second to help Canterbury to a 39-run victory.

It was built as a private property purposely intended for the then Grand Master of the Order of St John Ram√≥n Perell√≥s y Rocafull and his family. It is now a private residence, generally not open to the public, and is a landmark on its own as well as part of a heritage trail in the city. The fa√ßade of the building has a number of pears carved in limestone, an unmistakable emblem to the Perellos family coat-of-arms. The courtyard at the back of the residence has imposing architectural elements, including a fountain with a wall-mounted coat-of-arms. The residence is found in a prominent street leading to St. Catherine's Old Church. This site was chosen in order for the Grand Master to watch from the balcony the end of the procession during St. Gregory‚Äôs feast. In 2005, the restoration project of Casa Perellos was awarded a Diploma award by NGO Din l-Art ƒ¶elwa. A religious niche at the top of the fa√ßade is listed on the National Inventory of the Cultural Property of the Maltese Islands (NICPMI). The property is in good condition and has three floor, with one mezzanine and two floors above street level.  Early history and interior  The building is built following the baroque architectural style, with a number of architectural decorations, including a stone balcony resting on four corbels. Two of the corbels have an eight-pointed cross sculpture, while the other two have pear carvings. Pears can also be found on the columns on either side of the fa√ßade. On the fa√ßade there is also a niche with a statue of Our Lady of the Rosary. A complete coat-of-arms of Grand Master Perellos is also found on a fountain in the garden of this house.  Later history and restoration  Pharmacist Vincent (ƒäensinu) Caruana from ≈ªejtun, who lived in Casa Perellos, obtained a warrant to practise pharmacy in 1922, and opened the \\"Perellos Pharmacy\\" in his house. The property suffered extensive damage during the Second World War. It was then abandoned and fell in severe neglect. The cellar of the house also served as a horse stable. Refurbishment works restored the building to its former standing in the architectural and social fabric of the town, the design began in 2001 and the project was completed in 2005. Works included the complete restoration of the structure and the redecoration of the interiors. The original spaces and rooms were recreated with minimum intervention. At the rear, however, two new lateral wings built of glass and steel were built. The new wings house a kitchen, bedrooms and bathrooms. The courtyard and garden act as a central living room for the palazzo, while the axis of the entrance and hallway, leads to a small fountain and a basin surmounted by the Grand Master's coat-of-arms.The baroque stone balcony of Casa Perellos resting on four corbels.The project was praised as \\"a successful an elegant and sympathetic restoration of an old, virtually derelict, house [...] meshing it in most successfully and unobtrusively with an extension in modern contemporary design.

It is located on Roe Creek. The official name of the gap is Temple Bar Gap, which is never used, and Honeymoon Gap is the name for the pass that goes through it.  History  Honeymoon Gap was originally called Temple Bar by surveyors constructing the Australian Overland Telegraph Line and it was first named by Gilbert McMinn who, alongside William Mills, camped there on the 17th of February 1871. It is unclear why the name Temple Bar was given, although it likely relates to the original Temple Bar in London. It is thought that McMinn believed this gap would be the gateway that would enable the telegraph line to pass through, however, only days later he and Mills would find the wider Heavitree Gap where the line would ultimately travel through. The gap is of great significance to the Arrernte people, the traditional owners of the land, and it is said that Unchalka (or Ntyarlke, later tagged 'King Charlie'), an important senior Arrente man, was at the Gap when the first white man came through and \\"approached them in a spirit of friendship\\". No record is made of this meeting and it was excluded from Mills reports to Charles Todd. Before the telegraph line was even completed leases were granted for the first cattle stations in Central Australia and on 1 April 1872 Ned Bagot, a contractor on the telegraph line, was given the right to graze cattle from Honeymoon Gap to, almost, the Ross River; no thought was given to how this would impact the Arrernte people. The name Temple Bar Gap fell out of favour following the site becoming the honeymoon location for Robert (Bob) and Victoria (Vicky) Darken who married at the Alice Springs Methodist Church on 25 June 1942. Bob Darken was given a week's leave from the army and the couple planned to camp for a week at the gap and borrowed a car and a tent. The couple had repeated issues with the car and it rained for most of the week so, concerned for their safety, friends decided to visit them regularly; they said they were \\"going to see the honeymooners\\" or \\"going to honeymoon gap\\". It was not until 1981 that the name of the pass was officially changed to Honeymoon Gap and, in 2004, the NT Place Names Committee agreed that, despite not being used, the official name of the gap should remain Temple Bar Gap.

It is the third book in the Grizzly Tales for Gruesome Kids series. It was published by Hodder Children's Books and was the last in the series to be published before the cartoon adaptation, containing 16 short stories, one story more than the previous two books.  Synopsis   The Cat Burglar  Fedora Funklefink is a notorious con artist who forces girls to pay to use the girls' toilets, forges her mother's handwriting so that she could sit out of P. E. lessons, refuses to let her father use his car after he paid for her cleaning the windscreen, and uses mirrors in exams to cheat, among other things. On the way to plan her next get-rich-quick scheme, she spots a poster for a missing cat, offering a ¬£10 reward. She rips the poster off, runs home and changes into a \\"hunting\\" costume, and kidnaps a black stray behind her garden. The mother of the missing cat's owner answers the front door when Fedora goes to deliver but her daughter, Angela Tearful, runs out past her mother, excited that she is about to reunite with her cat, and sobs when she sees the black stray. Believing Angela to be insane, Fedora sneaks away with the cat to try something else. The black stray is given a makeover with paints, boot polish and other things Fedora can find until it matched the description on the poster. However, Angela and her mother are not convinced, possibly because the \\"makeup\\" was dripping and Fedora's clothes were covered in it. A day later, she returns with a white Persian cat but she is denied money. Then Fedora returned with a dog, a tennis racket, and a pepperoni pizza, but Angela's mother yells \\"NO!\\" and slams the door every time. Fedora finally leaves, officially out of ideas and reluctantly decides to abandon the plan. Suddenly, a cat jumps out of a bush and is ran over by a car. It had white paws, a black tail, a marmalade body, and a diamond shape in its forehead. Fedora realises that it is Angela's missing cat and takes her home to look alive with a bicycle pump. \\"Not you again,\\" groans Angela's mother when she sees Fedora outside her the front door. Fedora shows off the dead cat and uses it as a ventriloquist's dummy to convince the family to hand her ¬£20. Angela decides to give Fedora a ¬£50 note and takes the cat in for a bath. Fedora ran off to laugh maniacally about scamming yet another group of people and sees another poster for a missing cat on the same tree she found the previous. The reward was ¬£5000. Fedora salivates thinking about how she would spend ¬£5000 as she hears purring behind her. She turns gleefully to find a circus tiger, which eats her whole. The circus owner later finds the tiger asleep from a stomach ache.  Mr. Peeler's Butterflies  Alexander uses numerous tactics to stay awake past his 7:30pm bedtime by pestering his exhausted parents, such as taking time to put on a swimming costume, pretending to be interested in minute details of keeping his bedroom protected from creepy shadows, forcing his mother to search for toys downstairs that he knowingly had in his room, and asking for water a few minutes later so that he could pretend to use the toilet. His parents (particularly his father) become angrier by the second, but Alexander does not break his naivety ploy. By four o'clock, Alexander is asleep. His window latch creaks open and a sardine smell fills the bedroom. He wakes up terrified and calls for his parents. His father rushes in angrily and checks the window‚Äîit was closed‚Äîbut only his mother admits that she can smell the sardine, despite his father finding a sardine tin. Alexander denies throwing it there for a prank. \\"Who did? Mr Peeler?\\" shouts his father, and then explains to his confused wife that Peeler was a character from a nursery rhyme that he remembers from childhood. He leaves the room, followed by his wife, demanding that Alexander never bothers them again for the rest of the night. The window latch reopens and a man dressed in tweed clothing and holding a butterfly net creeps in with strange-looking butterflies surrounding him. He introduces himself as Mr Peeler. Alexander declares that he is not scared because he is still wearing his swimming costume. Peeler points out that he cannot call for his parents regardless because they are in a deep sleep. He moves to Alexander's bedside and explains that he wants to help the boy stay awake, and takes out a key that opens sardine tins. With the key, he peels off Alexander's eyelids and uses the net to catch the rest of his butterflies, and dissects them into eyelids to stick onto his face, with Alexander's on the top. He floats into the air as he gloats, reopens the window and flies out, leaving Alexander with no eyelids, unable to sleep again.  Fat Boy with a Trumpet  An anonymous student recounts the time the worst bully in their school was finally defeated. The bully in question was Johnny Bullneck, a pale-skinned, overweight and angry-looking twelve-year-old who enjoyed interrogating students at random and torturing them if one of their answers displeased him. One anecdote featured Bullneck ordering a boy named Miles to sneak out of school and look for three gallons of polka dot paint; the narrator adds that they and the rest of school believe that Miles was too embarrassed to return empty-handed because after he obeyed, he was never seen again, and was rumoured to have relocated to Darlington. One day, an overweight, bespectacled boy became a new student to the narrator's class, who carried a trumpet case. His name was Timothy and he became famous for performing for everyone on the playground. Bullneck approached him on the outskirts of the school grounds and ordered him to remove his clothes so that Bullneck and his gang could take a mandatory \\"medical photo\\". When Timothy obeys, the school bell rings and Timothy is given detention from the headmaster. Bullneck continued to target Timothy, forcing him to take laxatives, stealing his glasses, and name-calling him about his weight. A girl briefly confronted Bullneck and snatched Timothy's glasses out of his hand so Bullneck decided to take the trumpet case instead. Timothy roared at Bullneck and held the trumpet case tightly, snapping Bullneck into a sulking silence for a week and stunning the petrified audience into awe. Bullneck garnered permission to borrow the school's cricket equipment and waited for school to finish. When school was over, it began to thunderstorm as Timothy walked past. Bullneck's gang jumped out of the shadows to roll him through mud and tie him up, positioning him in front of the goal net. Bullneck appeared and gloated about having the upper hand, taking Timothy's glasses and trumpet case as he explained his revenge plan: attempting to play Timothy's trumpet as his gang throws cricket balls at Timothy like a firing squad. Bullneck put on the glasses and took out the trumpet, and began to play as Timothy tried to see through his blurry vision. A lightning flash hit close to the ground and Bullneck's gang ran away screaming as the rain stopped. It was clear enough for Timothy to see Bullneck's charred statue with the frame of Timothy's glasses glowing red. In the epilogue, the narrator recalls no one seeming mournful when the next school assembly announced Bullneck's death, but personally admits that they wished that Bullneck had suffered longer during the accident because the headmaster had claimed it happened \\"in a flash\\".  The Chipper Chums Go Scrumping  Back in 1952, Algie () visited his aunt Fanny and uncle Herbert, with his pet dog Stinker and his best friend Col (), in Kent for their summer holidays. They had created a gang, named The Chipper Chums, with three of the neighbourhood kids: the children of a Royal Navy captain, Alice and her older brother Ginger; and gentle giant tomboy Sam, \\"a girl with a boy's name\\" who slapped Dick Stick, the son of an underclass rat skin seller, for teasing her. One morning before breakfast, Algie and Col decide to go on a picnic and look for an adventure. Aunt Fanny offers to pack them scones and Herbert's tomatoes; Ginger and Alice's mother gives them gingerbread men, and Sam's mother gives them a Victoria sponge cake. The group cycle through the fields and stop by a river next to an apple orchard. They decide to open the hamper and eat despite the time being 11am and find scones covered in clotted cream, sardine sandwiches, a tin of spam, ginger beer and Uncle Herbert's tomatoes, along with the other families' donations. After finishing the picnic, the hot sun makes the children drowsy and they fall asleep. The sun had disappeared behind a cloud when they wake up and Algie is disappointed that Sam (the noted logical member of the gang) suggests leaving for home despite only eaten lunch. Col suggests fishing from a string in his pocket and a stick he could look for by the riverbank but the ultimate decision is given to Alice, who wants an apple from the orchard. Col is hesitant to scrump but Ginger and Algie point out that the orchard is too big for the owner to notice four missing apples. The group tidy their picnic away and climb through a fence hole. Col cannot reach the branches and Sam fails to climb the trunk. Algie reminds them of a circus act they saw a week ago and suggests that two members should reenact it. Being the tallest, Sam allows Algie to walk up her back and pick the apples, and the four children begin to eat. A gunshot rings through the meadow and the orchard's owner appears: an angry, unshaven Farmer Tregowan () with a shotgun. Stinker leaps at the farmer to protect the children and Tregowan shoots him in the chest, killing him in point-blank range. Algie threatens to tell his father about the murder but Tregowan refuses to back down. The children attempt to apologise, even consenting to corporal punishment but Tregowan points out that it would not bring the four apples back, so he has to squeeze every drop of juice out of them. Conveniently, the children become paralysed and collapse due to the insecticide that Tregowan often sprays around the orchard. He gathers their bodies onto his tractor and drives to his fruit press, where he crushes their corpses and drains out the juice for cider. The story ends with a warning that if you ever come across Tregowan Vintage Cider 1952, do not drink it!  Prince Noman  Somewhere in the desert is a secluded town named Misery. It had been ruled for over 400 years by the House of Volgar. The ageing king had married a young, beautiful peasant, who had just given birth to a son. When the newborn boy is ready to be shown to the rest of the family, each member passes the child around and gushes over the features he has inherited from each of them. The queen points out that they never mentioned any features that her son had inherited from her but her in-laws sneer and ignore her. The king wants to name his new son Norman, despite his wife's hesitations, but at the naming ceremony, he forgets his reading glasses and misreads the name as Noman. The royal family are concerned and the queen is horrified‚Äî\\"Noman\\" had unfortunate connotations because it could also be read as \\"No man\\". In the days since the blooper, the royal staff have lots of trouble with the new prince, who keeps turning invisible. The royal family panics as the king's failing health and the prince's condition could destroy the monarchy. The queen sews a babygrow out of lead from the rooftops with a balaclava but has nothing for the face itself. The king's doctor declares the king unfit for power and demands that the Volgar family find a new ruler. The family immediately nominate Noman but the queen protests that Misery would not trust a ruler without a face. Her sister-in-law orders she finds a solution by tomorrow otherwise she would be buried alive in a sandpit near scorpions. The next morning, the new King Noman is revealed to the people of Misery with a face identical to the one he had the day he was born. The rest of the family are absent, refusing to leave their bedrooms for the rest of their lives. Inside the palace, the servants are ordered to destroy every mirror in the building.  Death By Chocolate  Eli (right) defending herself against a giant fly (unknowingly, sister Serena); drawn by Kerstin Meyer for Scary Stories for Eight Year Olds. A boardroom of the Squarebrush Sou'wester chocolate factory is celebrating its improved sales for the year when an employee alerts them to a fly that has been seen around the factory lines. The directors order production to be ceased until the fly is found but it had already laid its eggs in an open Easter chocolate bunny and flown out of an open window. The affected bunny is bought by the mother of Serena Slurp, a stubborn chocoholic who will eat chocolate from anywhere, even stealing other people's or licking chocolate wrappers she finds. Because she has enough chocolate to last, the chocolate bunny is stored at the back of the fridge for emergencies. Serena's younger sister, , enjoys hunting flies with their mother's fly swatter and does it throughout the summer holidays. One day, Serena catches her with the top of the handle broken off and threatens to tell their mother unless Eli agrees to be her slave. Eli is forced to make Serena's meals, bring her chocolate with a wheelbarrow and fold her clothes; Serena would always take the broken fly swatter with her to blackmail Eli with whenever her demands were refused. Their mother is seemingly oblivious to the situation, only making an appearance to scold Serena for eating too much chocolate whenever Serena had locked herself in the bathroom to vomit. A sudden late-August heatwave causes a nationwide chocolate shortage. Serena is ballistic because her chocolate supply is ruined and Eli cannot find any shops that have any bars and packets available. Eli gives her the chocolate bunny and she rips it apart with her teeth, swallowing everything, including the fly egg. The maggot that hatches from the egg grows inside her, feeding off the undigested chocolate inside Serena's stomach, and slowly merges with her DNA. Days later, Eli enters her sister's bedroom and sees a giant fly sitting up in Serena's bed. She runs away in terror and the fly follows her, begging her not to panic because it is still her sister Serena. Eli flees to the living room, grabs the fly swatter and beats it to death with one strike; the fly's corpse lands in front of her in a black pile. Her mother appears in the doorway to ask about the screaming and Eli confesses breaking the fly swatter. \\"Is that all?\\" her mother replies as she walks away. \\"I thought it was something serious.\\"  Well'ard Willard  Science nerds are the most shunned people in school, so confessed nerd, Willard, left his science interests at home and spends schooltime pretending to be the most talented, namedropping, and globetrotting boy in the world. Younger students are in awe of his lies and envy Willard's interesting life, but are terrified of disappointing him, which is most likely why he got the nickname \\"Well'ard Willard\\" because he never smiled. One Friday lunchtime, Willard asks his audience whether they had stolen something. Some students struggle to find an impressive answer to not embarrass themselves, but Willard scoffs at every confession, revealing that he stole the Sun. Through the crowd of impressed murmurs, a girl named Felicity calls him a liar and points out that the sun is still in the sky. Willard claims that he is telling the truth and that \\"the sun\\" she is referring to is a model that he made. Felicity continues to accuse him of lying and the crowd disperses, realising that Willard was not as interesting as they had believed for so long. In fear of losing his audience, Willard agrees to prove it and show everyone on Monday. Willard plans to capture the sun in a similar way to the burning glass technique. Despite basing a reputation on far-fetched lying in school, he struggles to lie to his mother on the spot but she does not notice and allows him to borrow empty jam jars. Willard takes the jars and his telescope to a sunny field and captures sunbeam particles by angling the telescope's magnifying end towards the sun and placing the jars underneath the eyepiece, which he examines under his microscope back in his bedroom. He continues the process throughout the weekend until the entirety of the sun is hiding in jam jars under his bed. Throughout, his parents would refer to articles in the newspaper about scientists from around the world's concerns over the shrinking sun, when he was out of earshot; and comment on the early sunsets, and Willard's boiling hot bedroom. On Monday, Willard gathers his jars into a rucksack and staggers to school feeling triumphant that he was about to save his reputation; a sign on the school gates reports that the school is closed due to frozen pipes. Willard staggers back home to find his grey-skinned parents in the living room by the empty fireplace. They point out his sunburn (which he got from sleeping above his jar collection) and interrogate him about it. Willard struggles to improvise a few lies by claiming that he had built a time machine and had travelled back to a time when the sun was still in the sky so he could visit Australia, but when he came back to the present he had disposed of the machine. His father is disappointed that Willard had made a time machine and never decided to show it to the rest of the family as his mother reads the newspaper. She finds an interview with the chief of the local police, who alleges that Willard is the person who stole the sun because of his illuminating bedroom. Due to being members of the neighbourhood watch, Willard's parents immediately become suspicious. Willard grabs his bag and runs to his bedroom, locking the door. He puts on oven gloves, opens his window and throws the sunbeam particles out of it, and pulls at his carpet to scoop other particles and tips the contents out with the rest as his parents knock harshly outside. When the last of the sunbeams are out, all the hovering particles mould together into a sphere outside of the window and explode, burning Willard alive as the reformed and recharged sun floats away towards the atmosphere. Willard's parents break the door off the hinges and find his skin laying below the window pane. In the story's epilogue, it is revealed that three weeks later, the liquified remains of Willard's body rained over Madagascar.  Athlete's Foot  Oliver \\"Ollie\\" Littlebody is terrible at track races. He hates running and always falls over the finish line in last place. He is always competing against Anthony St John Smythe, who is always winning races and enjoys waiting for Ollie to cross the finish line to gloat about winning at him. After embarrassing himself at another track race, Ollie is approached by an old man, who offers to train him into a successful athlete that will stop Anthony's boasting and put his name at the top of the running leagues; although unconvinced, Ollie accepts. The next day, Ollie arrives at the stadium after school and is amazed to see the old man sprinting around the race track. When the old man finishes, he gives Ollie his training schedule: at the end of every school day, Ollie must go to the supermarket and buy soup, take it to the old man's house and cook it, and then clean up after dinner. Despite Ollie's protests, he reluctantly follows the old man's orders. On the day of the running league's first race, the old man gives Ollie studded running shoes. They formerly belonged to Tommy Knock, a boy that was one of the best track runners in the county 50 years ago, who failed to win a race that would cement his All England Schools Champion title. Ollie puts them on and reluctantly leaves the changing rooms for the race track. When the starting gun fires, Ollie sprints around the track, passes his opponents and wins the race. Ollie is in disbelief and regrets doubting the old man's strategy. He wears the shoes in other races, winning all and being promoted each time. He wins the semi-final race and is named the best 400m runner in UK history by a magazine for young athletes, which is purchased by the St. John Smythe family. Anthony, who is due to appear in the final with Ollie, is suspicious over Ollie's sudden success but is so furious that he eats some of the magazine pages. In the minutes before the final, Anthony confronts Ollie in the changing room and steals the running shoes. Ollie tries to chase him but cannot move because his clothes are stuck to the seat, thanks to Anthony's secret glue container. The old man runs into the room in a panic and frees him. Ollie decides to forfeit the race and begins to cry, terrified that he will embarrass himself without his shoes but the old man convinces him to race and admits that he was going to give the shoes to Anthony anyway. Ollie accuses his mentor of betraying him but walks out to join the race, clothes ripped from being freed from the seat and with no shoes on. The race starts and Ollie struggles to overtake his opponents, whilst Anthony is far in the lead. Ollie hears the sounds of Luftwaffe planes and a loud whistle. Anthony explodes into ash as he is about to reach the finish line; Ollie staggers into seventh place. When Ollie and the old man reunite by the changing rooms, the old man explains that Anthony's death was the reason why Tommy Knock could not win his final race in 1941 because he was killed by a Luftwaffe bomb that landed in front of him as he was about to cross the finish line. Ollie expresses his condolences to Knock who died trying to reach his dreams but the old man tells Ollie not to worry because \\"I didn't feel a thing,\\" and disappears in a puff of smoke.  The Matchstick Girl  Eight-year-old Polly Peach lives with her family and 15 siblings in Victorian Britain. After her father is made redundant from the steel mill, she finds a job selling matchboxes and is paid twopence for every twenty sold. One day, the owner of the matchstick shop announces that he is going to deduct her wage to a penny per 20 sales \\"because I said so.\\" Remembering her parents warning her and her siblings about exploitative bosses, Polly threatens to strike. Suddenly, her hair catches fire from a phosphorescence flash and burns her body into a giant match. Her boss uses her body to clean the shag out of his smoking pipe and throws the rest of her remains into an ashtray. He closes his shop and leaves for his Blackpool holiday with his wife.  Simon Sulk  The story begins with an Icelandic legend about trolls, which are believed to be creatures that originally lived in the sea: 500 years ago in the village of Trollvik, the villagers hid in a church from wolves when travellers knocked on the front door begging to be rescued because their caravan was on fire. Thor, the villagers' leader, allows them inside but notices that there is no sign of smoke and fire. He realises his mistake but the doors had already shut and the travellers were beginning to shapeshift. They turn into wolfish humanoid beasts and slaughter every villager in the church. Due to the name of the village, this was where the creatures got their name, and they were eventually driven out of the country by King Magnus. In the present day, spoilt Simon discovers that his parents want to move to Devon and have already bought a house. Known for his tantrums, Simon causes commotion in a clothes shop when he discovers the school uniform he will have to wear and locks his bedroom door when he gets home, vowing to die in the room if it meant that he would never leave with his parents. He wakes up before 6am to hear his parents arguing over what to take with them before the removal team arrives. When they hear him stirring, they try again to make him prepare to leave. Simon still refuses. His parents leave and secretly plan to return 30 minutes later to call Simon's bluff, and drive to a caf√© down the road. Simon hears movement downstairs minutes later and his parents' voices at his bedroom door. He gloats that he knew that they would be back for him and still refuses to leave with them. The parents are in a panic because they had been chased back to the house by wolves. Simon gloats that he knows they are lying. The parents begin to scream because the house is on fire and Simon has to evacuate. Simon is still not convinced. The parents continue begging. Simon still refuses. The parents demand that Simon opens the door. Suspicious, Simon obeys and sees no fire outside the room as his parents barge in. He admits defeat but tells them that he has no plans of leaving regardless. His parents shapeshift into Icelandic trolls, and decapitate him. Simon's real parents return to the house, as planned, to find the Icelandic couple from Devon that they had switched houses with answering the front door. They explain to the new owners the situation with their son being stubborn in his bedroom. The Icelandic couple invites them inside to help the parents convince their son to leave. Hours later, the Icelandic couple have a tiny housewarming party in their new garden, cooking giant pieces of \\"chicken\\" on a barbeque.  The Dumb Clucks  The Clucks are a gullible family who live in Dork, Stargazy Pie; a village notorious for its stupid citizens. One rainy day, a cowboy smoking cheroot rides into the village and announces himself as the Son of God, a messenger of his father. The villagers are in awe as the cowboy explains that his father can make wishes come true to anyone who follows rituals. Mrs Cluck asks for hair rollers, one of their children wants a hoverboard and Mr Cluck asks for replacement golf clubs. The cowboy promises to get every wish if the Dorks followed his instructions. Mr Pojo the village cobbler accuses the cowboy of being a conman but his neighbours and customers ignore him. The cowboy orders the villagers to destroy their mirrors and dump the glass in a ring surrounding the village, burn all their shoes and cover themselves in ketchup and mustard. Mr Pojo is thrown out of the village for blasphemy and the Dorks obey the cowboy's orders. The cowboy dials 666 on his mobile phone to contact \\"his father\\" and tells the villagers that God is ready for them. Heavy footsteps shake the village and a giant cyclops steps into Dork. \\"You have done well, son,\\" it says to the cowboy. Mr Cluck asks for God and the cyclops replies that he is Nigel. The cowboy admits that he lied to Dork and his father was no Fairy Godmother-esque wish granter. The Dorks try to run but realise that they could not run over the glass ring with no shoes on and Nigel eats all the villagers and the buildings, and leaves with his son for Bombay. In the years after the tragedy, a new village had been created: Pojo, which only had one citizen: the banished Mr Pojo from Dork. Doctor Moribundus Lorelei Lee never goes to school because she pretends to be ill every weekday, and her family believes it, no matter how implausible. During school holidays and weekends, she makes miraculous recoveries but will suddenly feel unwell on Sundays or the last day of the holiday and cannot go to school for a week. She would use a variety of methods to be convincing, such as placing thermometers in hot drinks, making herself cold at night, and create scars by waxing her limbs with plasters, only to be unusually excitable when her father arrived home at the end of every \\"sick\\" day with a get-well present. One morning, Lorelei Lee covers her mouth with toothpaste and pretends to have a seisure. Her mother assumes she has rabies and telephones for yet another emergency doctor. Unlike the other doctors usually sent into Lorelei Lee's home, the doctor recognises the tricks and smells the toothpaste. He writes out a prescription and leaves in a tranquil fury. Lorelei Lee's mother fails to find any medicine in any nearby pharmacies that match the prescription and asks her husband whether he had heard of \\"Medicus moribundus\\". Her husband scoffs at the need for said prescription now that the \\"rabies\\" had worn off their daughter but the doorbell rings. On the doorstep is a bearded man wearing a cape and an overweight woman dressed in black. The man introduces himself as Dr Moribundus and the woman as his night nurse. The parents invite the guests inside and Dr Moribundus orders them to stay downstairs as he treats their daughter. Moribundus and the night nurse enter Lorelei Lee's bedroom and Lorelei Lee protests that she is fine but the two guests ignore her, preparing their equipment. The night nurse turns her over to cover her back in leeches and then rubs poultice mustard all over her body, as Loraliliee screamed that she was healthy and promised to go to school every day. After the poultice was pealed off, Moribundus explained that he specialised in alternative medicine and prepares for brain surgery. Lorelei Lee points out that brain surgery seemed unconventional but Moribundus replies that his method is alternate too and takes out a giant injection from his medical kit. She admits that she was pretending to be sick and begs to be reconsidered; Moribundus says, \\"I know,\\" and injects the top of her head. The syringe sticks out the bottom of her body and she becomes numb, a hole growing through her tongue. Moribundus saws off the top of her head and digs around her brain with a teaspoon, pulling out a piece (which is said to be the part of her brain that makes her play sick) and eating it. Lorelei Lee returned to school the next day and continues to do so. Still traumatised from Moribundus' visit, and with a hole still in her tongue as a souvenir, the epilogue reveals that she even hides common colds from her parents in case the witch doctor returns to her house, but had to stay home for a morning when a breeze blew the top of her head open so her head could be stapled shut. In her Latin class‚Äîthe catalyst of her feigning rabies‚Äîthe teacher asks for the definition of Medicus moribundus. A lisping Lorelei Lee suggests being injected in the head making the teacher laugh as he stroked his beard, which looked similar to Moribundus' thin, black one.  The Stick Men  Chico has drawn on the walls with felt tips all his life, despite it annoying his wealthy (described as \\"Not now! Can't you see I'm working?\\") parents, who frequently point out that they never wanted him anyway as they scold him. One day, Chico's mother is horrified to find Chico's stick people and doodled buildings all over his bedroom walls and she and Chico's father ground him for two days, assigning him with yet another apathetic babysitter. Chico continues drawing, creating the enchanted land of Fiddle-Dee-Dee with a magical river where a blind sorceress lives in a castle and Knobbly Hobgoblins lurk in the caves. The babysitter appears in the doorway and harshly insults Chico's drawing abilities. A stick man pulls himself off the wall and introduces himself as Stan after Chico stops screaming. Other characters jump off the wall, pick up Chico's pens and draw all over every wall as Chico panics. Stan is too late to tell Chico to keep quiet as the leader of Knobbly Hobgoblins appears, takes a pen and draws Chico's babysitter with a snake growing out of her mobile phone. A scream is heard from downstairs, followed by the sound of the front door slamming shut. The hobgoblin draws two crashing helicopters before Chico wipes it out, chasing the hobgoblin away. Through magic, Chico is taken to the sorceress' castle and the sorceress expresses gratitude to him and explains that a human living amongst the land of Fiddle- Dee-Dee would make the stick people come to life. Although wanting to stay, Chico believes that it is his duty to stay with his parents, regardless of their treatment of him, but through the castle window, he sees his furious parents staring at the stick people's mess all over their son's bedroom. Chico's father rushes out and returns with a bucket full of soapy water, and dumps it against the wall where the castle is drawn, trapping Chico inside Fiddle-Dee-Dee forever. The epilogue reveals that Chico lives happily ever after with his new friends in Fiddle-Dee-Dee. Its citizens become human, the sorceress regains her sight and Chico's world becomes magical again. In the real world, Chico's parents die in a helicopter accident over the sea. When their bodies were recovered, their heads had inflated five times larger.  Little Fingers  Daffyd Thomas has a horrible-looking thumb. He used to suck it frequently when he was younger and it now looks shrivelled and cannot grow fingernails. It seems that due to the lack of \\"affection\\", the thumb has \\"controlled\\" the hands into becoming fidgety and Daffyd is constantly told off by his parents for sticking his fingers in different places, regardless of sanitation. Exhausted by their son's behaviour, Daffyd's parents announce that they are going on holiday for a week, leaving their son with his 93-year-old, deaf grandmother, Gwenyth. Daffyd is devastated because his grandmother can talk for hours about boring parts of her childhood. Four days of Granny Gwenyth later, Daffyd had been trapped in the living room with her as she talked about her memories and various hobbies. He had ignored her and used the house phone to perform prank calls until he had no desire left. He dials randomly and contacts an Italian pizza restaurant, which offers him a delicious-sounding \\"Kidnapped Caper\\". When he answers the front door, a man in sunglasses and a black suit with a machine gun is on the doorstep, who frogmarches him into a limousine and bashes him unconscious. Daffyd's parents return from holiday over a week later to find envelopes full of fingers and ransom notes. When confronted, Gwenyth admits that she never noticed that her grandson had vanished nine days ago. Mr Thomas pays the ¬£10,000 ransom and Daffyd is returned home the next day with only a thumb left on his hand. His mother appreciates that her son will not get into any more trouble for fiddling but he sticks it in his mouth to suck. His father tells her to look for the Bitter Aloe.  Bessy O'Messy  Bessy is a beautiful, red-haired, green-eyed Irish girl who is wasteful and forgetful. Her brother Callum is a neat freak, who cleans up after his sister, which makes Bessy suspicious, assuming that he is trying to make her look irresponsible. One morning, her mother discovers a mountain of dirty laundry and empty containers behind Bessy's bedroom door and orders her to clean her room. Bessy refuses, Callum offers to help, but their mother denies both of their requests. Bessy gets out of bed and attempts to climb the mountain but falls inside it and lands outside a cottage where six leprechauns live. They introduce themselves as O'Reilly, O'Reilly, O'Reilly, O'Reilly, O'Reilly, and O'Reilly (real name Rafferty) and explain that they prefer to live in untidy places. Bessy realises how much she and the leprechauns have in common and agrees to live with them for the rest of her life. The leprechauns lead Bessy into their home and refer her to the kitchen. Confused, Bessy asks what was the kitchen's significance. The leprechauns tell her that as their new housekeeper, she must clean whatever they say. Bessy argues that they never said that she wanted to be their housekeeper and the leprechauns remind her that they shook hands, but Bessy points out that they never mentioned housekeeping and that she and one of the leprechauns shook hands on no agreement. The leprechauns shed their fingers and grow claws, and threaten her to clean their kitchen otherwise they will kill her. Bessy shoves the closest out of her way and runs out of the cottage. She runs towards the assumed escape route‚Äîa black hole under a jumper‚Äîas the leprechauns chase her. The hole disappears and the ground shakes. The leprechauns gloat that they have the upper hand as they pull themselves off the ground and crowd around her. A jet of water sprays the leprechauns flat and the world crashes down. Sometime later, Callum is ironing the rest of Bessy's clean clothes. He finds his sister, now tall, with her red hair now white. She snaps at him for making \\"[her] colours run\\" and apologises for her behaviour, offering to help him clean her room.  Jack in a Box  The Honourable Jack Delaunay de Havilland De Trop embarrasses and angers his parents because he frequently interrupts adults' conversations. Anecdotes show him interrupting his mother at a party, the Queen, the Prime Minister, and a couple in the middle of flirting, offering to show them the veruca on his foot. On the day of his sister's birthday, Lord and Lady Delaunay de Havilland De Trop had hired a children's entertainer, Mr Frankenstein the Ventriloquist, for her birthday party. Jack pesters Frankenstein throughout his visit, bombarding him with questions, interrupting him, and offering to show the foot veruca. Jack finally stops when he hears a panicky, muffled voice coming from Frankenstein's suitcase. The suitcase is opened to reveal a ventriloquist dummy, which jumps out of the box to latch itself onto Jack's body and warns him to run away. Jack believes it to be a trick at first but Frankenstein adamantly claims that the dummy is magic and says that he can teach Jack about the powers of the Elders of the Black Circle, giving him an address card to a joke shop in Great Pessaries. The next day, Jack sneaks to the joke shop and allows himself in. A back door creaks and Jack looks in the room to call for Frankenstein as he looks at the creepy ornaments on the shelves, with eyes that followed him whenever his back was turned. He turns to leave but stops when he sees decapitated heads of children hanging from wires over 30 transparent tanks of formaldehyde. A light turns on and the heads come to life to yell at him to get out of the shop. Frankenstein walks in, in the middle of sewing a new dummy, and picks up an axe as Jack begs for mercy. A few days later, Jack's parents are still concerned over their daughter, who stands in the garden and mumbles a song that begs for her brother. Lord Delaunay de Havilland De Trop opens a suitcase and pulls out a dummy with a sewn-closed mouth, explaining that he bought it from a Great Pessaries joke shop, hoping that it will cheer his daughter up by reminding her of her love of Frankenstein's party performance. Lady Delaunay de Havilland De Trop points out that the dummy reminds her of Jack. The dummy blinks.  Development  Like the previous books in the series, Jamie Rix used aspects of his life, as well as the cautionary tale book Struwwelpeter. For the creation of \\"Little Fingers\\", he said: \\"[My mother] bought me Struwwelpeter and made me read a story called The Story of Little Suck A Thumb. [...] That story was brilliant. I had nightmares for weeks. When I hear that story now I can still feel the scissors cutting through my thumb bones.\\" As a child, Rix used to suck his thumb and his mother buying Struwwelpeter was the result of several failed attempts to stop him; Bitter Aloe was one of the plans, but Rix never explained how it was used, which might explain the ending of the story when Daffyd's mother leaves the room to get the aloe without explanation to how she is going to use it.: 'Get the bitter aloes, Mother,' said [Daffyd's father]. And [Daffyd's] mother went upstairs to the bathroom cabinet to do as she was bid. Rix admitted that he based the story of \\"Dr Moribundus\\" on himself because he used to pretend to be ill so that he did not have to go school: \\"Whenever I wanted to get off school, I told my mum I was sick and, lying in bed looking weak and feeble, I begged her for a cup of tea. When it arrived, I stirred the thermometer in the hot tea until the mercury was nicely warmed up, then showed my mum what a terrible temperature I had!\\" He also joked that parts of the story had similarities to Hannibal (\\"My story was first!\\"). The original front cover was illustrated by Ross Collins. After the cartoon series aired on CITV, the covers were re-designed by Honeycomb Animation, the producers of the cartoon. The book is said to have officially gone out of print in May 2005. It was briefly available on Kindle in 2011.  Cultural references, naming conventions  Ross Collins' title illustration for \\"The Chipper Chums Go Scrumping\\". The writing \\"and lashings of ginger beer!\\" above hints that the story will be an Enid Blyton parody. Cultural references and naming conventions are used throughout to add to the humour in the short stories. Some titles of the short stories are play on words: \\"The Matchstick Girl\\" is Polly Peach's job description but then she turns into a working matchstick when she attempts to defy her boss; \\"Athlete's Foot\\" refers to the fungal infection and the magic trainers making the wearer win running races; \\"The Cat Burglar\\" relates to Fedora scamming people, Tiddles the missing cat, and the phrase cat burglar; and \\"Jack in a Box\\" ends with Jack's father opening a box to show his wife the dummy of Jack, with no relation to the children's toy. However, Mr Frankenstein the ventriloquist is a possible allusion to Dr Frankenstein because they used human anatomy for humanoid creations that come to life. Characters' names like Bessy O'Messy and Serena Slurp implied their personalities: Bessy was untidy, whereas Serena was rude and greedy because slurping is considered bad table manners. Johnny Bullneck is described as \\"short-haired, flat-footed, white-fleshed and pudgy\\" but \\"bull neck\\" describes a thick neck, which is possibly what he had also. The locations in \\"The Dumb Clucks\\" relate to the intelligence of the family: they live in the Dork village full of other Dorks, in the land of Stargazy Pie (a Cornish desert) located between two mountain peaks, Feak and Weeble (a spoonerism for \\"weak and feeble\\"). The House of Volgar in \\"Prince Noman\\" imply that the royal family are obnoxious long before the treat Queen Letitia like an outcast after she gives birth to a prince. There was also uses of irony: the Mr Peeler nursery rhyme character is a possible reference to the idiom \\"keep your eyes peeled\\" in which Peeler removes Alexander's eyelids by peeling them off. Moribundus is Latin for moribund; Lorelei Lee hated learning Latin at school: \\"[Lorelei Lee had] never felt better in her life, but she had Latin at school before break and she hated dead languages.\\" and the prescription that her parents failed to fulfil was Medicus moribundus (\\"Doctor moribund\\"). After the formerly \\"well'ard\\" Willard's insides are melted by the sun he stole, the story's epilogue pointed out: \\"From the outset, Willard had been lying to save his skin. But what use is a skin when there's nothing left to go inside it?\\"  Pastiche  Although not explicitly stated, \\"The Chipper Chums Go Scrumping\\" is a whole-plot reference to The Famous Five series by Enid Blyton, and is written in her voice, specifically during the food porn paragraphs: \\"It was a banquet fit for a prince. Sardine sandwiches, clotted cream scones, ripe red tomatoes and a tin of spam. There was even a bone for Stinker. They all agreed that they had never seen a scrumptious spread before. Sam found knives and forks and plates, while Algie opened two bottles of ginger beer and set them down on the grass. It was simply gorgeous.\\": It wasn't long before all four were sitting down to a good tea. Aunt Fanny had baked new scones for them, and had made a ginger cake with black treacle. It was dark brown and sticky to eat. and in the dialogue.: : In the original hardback edition, Ross Collins' illustration of the main characters on a picnic has the phrase \\"and lashings of ginger beer!\\" written above them, which is a quote that is frequently mistaken to be created by Blyton (it originated from the Channel 4 parody Five Go Mad in Dorset). Like the Channel 4 parody, \\"The Chipper Chums Go Scrumping\\" is about a group of children and their dog on a picnic in the countryside in a southern English coastal county (Dorset and Kent). Famous Five stories were usually set in the fictional Kirrin Bay in an unspecified coastal area where the characters' summer holidays were spent. Some members of the Chipper Chums have similarities to Blyton's main characters: Algie is possibly based on Dick because they are both obsessed with going on adventures: : : Dick woke and grinned at Julian. A feeling of happiness crept over him. They were going on an adventure. and have an aunt named Fanny; Sam is the Chipper Chums' George, who is also a \\"girl with a boy's name\\" tomboy that took offence to anyone pointing out that she is a girl: : (in the CITV episode, Sam even had short, curly hair like George);: Then [Uncle Quentin] ruffled George's short curly hair. Alice has similarities with Anne because she is the youngest (Anne begins the series as ten-years- old, however) but carries a teddy bear with her on the Chums' outing;: and Stinker is a reference to the dog sidekick that Blyton's children-gang characters frequently have ‚Äî such as George's dog Timmy, and The Secret Seven's Scamper ‚Äî but it is also the nickname George gives a dog that she and the rest of the Famous Five meet in Five Run Away Together that is owned by housekeeper Mrs Stick and her rude son Edgar.: Surname aside, Dick Stick may have been inspired by Edgar, despite appearing in a short anecdote to be rude to Sam. Farmer Tregowan is a Cornish stereotype: his surname begins with \\"Tre\\", and he is portrayed as aggressive and unpleasant, refusing to accept the children's apologies when he catches them stealing from his orchard. His character is an anomaly but is similar to the angry antagonistic men that The Famous Five usually defeat, but he successfully outsmarts the Chipper Chums by accident with his insecticide. Tregowan is one of the numerous references to classism that appears in the short story, that itself is a reference to the criticisms that Blyton's children's stories frequently receive: the Famous Five members have been accused of being entitled and prejudice, and that most of Blyton's books contain \\"snobbery\\"; Lou the working-class acrobat, who is revealed to be a thief/con artist, immediately dislikes the five children because they are staying in a caravan; and Mrs Stick is also a twist villain with a smelly, rude child who helped kidnap and imprison a girl for ransom. The Chipper Chums are heavily implied to be as prejudice too: after Sam attacks Dick Stick for calling her \\"Sam the man\\", it is noted, \\"How they laughed, to see Dick sent packing with a bloody nose and tears streaming down his unwashed face. [...] The Sticks were so poor that they didn't have two pork chops to rub together, but what did the chums care, so long as the sun blazed down all day and the ginger beer flowed like wine!\\" Later, when Tregowan confronts the children, Sam thinks to herself that he looked \\"uncouth\\" with his five o'clock shadow and that he reminded her of \\"the sort of man the police were always chasing.\\" Their entitlement is shown during Tregowan's threats when they both beg and demand that he forgives them for stealing: Algie takes offence to Tregowan's tone of voice and orders him to put the shotgun down like \\"a good chap\\", and Col and Ginger explain that \\"fair's fair\\" if he strikes them before letting them leave.: When adapted for CITV, these details were left out of the characters through shortening Dick Stick's teasing and removing Sam's thoughts.  Adaptations  The audiobook was performed by Nigel Planer, who was also the voice of the narrator on the cartoon series and the co-founder of Jamie Rix's production company, Little Brother Productions. It was released in December 2000 by Chivers Children's Audio Books, and was re-released by Audible on 16 August 2016. \\"The Matchstick Girl\\" was the only story that was not adapted for the CITV and NickToons cartoons. This is most likely because the story is significantly shorter than the rest. With the rest, there have been changes in the adaptations. For example: *\\"Doctor Moribundus\\" (Series 1, Episode 13) did not include Loralilee's brain surgery in the cartoon. *\\"The Chipper Chums Go Scrumping\\" (Series 1, Episode 10): **Numerous characters either do not appear or are mentioned, such as Algie's aunt and uncle, and the rest of the children's parents who helped pack the picnic.

She is an academic researcher, whose work focusses on sexual dimorphism particularly in the family Sepsidae.  Research  Orygma luctuosum (Puniamoorthy, Feng-Yi Su, and Meier, 2008) Su is an expert in sexual dimorphism across species and her research in Diptera has shown how it is affected by ecological and molecular mechanisms. As an entomologist she is a leading expert in Sepsidae taxonomy. She is also interested in phylogeny, including the theoretical aspects of sequence data analysis.  Taxonomy  Su described a new species of sepsid fly, Themira Iohmanus, discovered in from Central Park. The genera has only thirteen species, so the discovery of an additional species is highly notable, particularly because its location is in one of the most intensely populated cities in the world.  Sexual dimorphism  Su has researched mating behaviours in several species, but her most significant work is on flies and how genetic and social processes produce sexual dimorphism. = Social Behaviour in Courtship and Genetics = Su has studied the link between mating call and genetics in South-East Asian anuran (frog) populations and male and female courtship behaviour in jumping spiders. This research has shown that genetic links between certain courtship behaviours can be seen within in species, which has an impact on our understanding of evolution. = Sepsidae Research = Working within international scientific programmes, Su's research into the evolution of sepsid flies, has a particular emphasis on functional change and sexual dimorphism in sepsid species. Her research has shown how abdominal appendages in sepsid flies developed and how they are influenced by histoblast nest size. How mounting position can produce sexual dimorphisms in sepsid flies. How and why genetically fly pigmentation emerged and diverged. How site specific mutations can cause produce contradictory phenotypes as a process in evolution.

Life Dina Ugorskaja was born in Leningrad (as Saint Petersburg was known at that time) and grew up in a family of musicians. Her father, whom she predeceased in 2019, is the notable pianist Anatol Ugorski. Maja Elik (1933 - 2012), her mother, was a musicologist originally from Prague. Her parents had first met in 1967, working on the Soviet premier of Schoenberg's Pierrot Lunaire. Maja Elik, who was working for a music publisher, had been engaged to produce a Russian text for the work's German language \\"Sprechgesang\\". Ugorskaja's first piano teacher was her father. She made her public debut when she was seven, performing at the Leningrad Philharmonia Hall in 1980. Between 1980 and 1990 she attended the specialist music academy of the Leningrad Conservatory, studying piano and composition. Here her piano teachers were Maria Mekler and (as before) her father, while her composition studies were undertaken with the man who was in charge of the piano department, Evgenij Irschai. Alongside her studies at the academy, she also took singing lessons, with a focus on early music. She was still only 14 when she appeared as a soloist in her first orchestral concert, performing Beethoven's 4th Piano Concerto in her home city.? Just one year later, in 1989, Ugorskaja made her public debut as a composer with the first performance of her string quartet at the Leningrad Philharmonia Hall. The Perestroika years in the Soviet Union were accompanied by an increase in lawlessness and public antisemitism. Dina Ugorskaja found herself on the receiving end of increasingly savage racist threats from supporters of Pamyat, a \\"patriotic\\" nationalist organisation. Dina Ugorskaja was barely 16 when Anatol Ugorski hastily relocated his family to East Berlin, where they arrived without even having taken time to get their identity papers in order.Irene Dische im Begleitheft zur CD mit Ugorskis Diabelli-Variationen (DG 435 615-2) 1989/90 was a [period of great change in the \\"German Democratic Republic\\", and the unfolding political developments in Berlin appeared to hold out the prospect of an international career for Anatol Ugorski. As matters turned out, there would also be very significant professional opportunities for his daughter, who immediately submitted a successful application for admission to the city's Hochschule f√ºr Musik \\"Hanns Eisler\\". Here she studied between 1990 and 1992: she was taught by Annerose Schmidt and Galina Iwanzowa. She subsequently moved on to the Detmold Music Academy (\\"Hochschule f√ºr Musik\\") where she studied (again) under Galina Iwanzowa, and also as a \\"master student\\" with Nerine Barrett and in 2001 passed her post-graduate level concert exams (\\"Konzertexamen\\") degree. Ugorskaja retained her close links with Detmold where she taught piano from 2002 till 2007 and held an associate professorship. Having relocated to Munich in 2007/08, in October 2016 she accepted an invitation to take up a post as professor for piano and harpsichord at the Ludwig van Beethoven Institute of the University of Music and Performing Arts (\\"Universit√§t f√ºr Musik und darstellende Kunst\\") in Vienna. Slightly more than three years later, on 27 November 2019, friends at the Beethoven Institute were attending a memorial event for their former colleague. Dina Ugorskaja died of cancer at her home in Munich on Tuesday 17 September 2019, after a period of illness. She was 46. She was survived by her husband, her daughter and her father. Career highlights Dina Ugorskaja gave concerts in Germany, Russia, France, Austria and Ukraine. She played at the Leipzig Gewandhaus concert hall and at the Schwetzingen Festival. She also performed at a large number of other festivals, including the \\"Hitzacker Days of Music\\" (\\"Sommerliche Musiktage Hitzacker\\") festival and the Dijon Music Festival. Notable conductors with whom she appeared included Vladimir Jurowski, Peter G√ºlke and Frank Beermann. She performed regularly with the MDR Leipzig Radio Symphony Orchestra and the North West German Philharmonic Orchestra). She teamed up with her father to issue a recording of concertos for two pianos by Bach (Concerto in C minor: BWV 1060), Mozart's Concerto No. 10 in E-flat major and the Shostakovich's Concertino for two pianos op.94. Further recordings followed, including one of the Beethoven First Piano Concerto with the Pforzheim-based South-west German Chamber Orchestra conducted, as in the case of her earlier two-piano concerto recordings with her father, by Vladislav Czarnecki.

She studied the ecological, physiological, and neurobiological perspectives of the polychaete worm and (co-)authored more than 40 publications, at least 15 of which from her time at the Bellairs Institute.  Early life and education  Marsden completed her Bachelor of Science (1943) and Master of Science (1944) at McGill University. She then went on to earn a PhD at the University of California, Berkeley in 1951.  Research and career  Marsden returned to McGill and would spend more than 60 total years at the University. Her first appointment was a role as lecturer in the Department of Zoology and she quickly climbed the academic ladder during a time when there were few female scientists at McGill. Shortly after the 1954 founding of the Bellairs Institute, Marsden and fellow zoologist John Lewis were the first McGill professors to exploit the research opportunities the Caribbean institute had to offer. She traveled there almost yearly to conduct her research. As chair of the Zoology Department, Marsden was instrumental in the creation of the Biology department through the fusion of the Departments of Zoology, Botany, and Genetics in 1969. Marsden served as President of the Canadian Society of Zoologists from 1980-1981. Marsden retired from McGill in 1987. To honor her legacy and perpetuate her memory, her colleagues established the Joan Marsden Lectures in Organismal Biology.  Select publications  * Marsden, J. R.

It began on the evening of 8 December, when a local policeman Ant√≥nio Tavares bought a comb from the shop of Ahmed Najar, a Lebanese merchant, and asked for a tax receipt. At the time, there was a campaign called Seu Tal√£o Vale um Milh√£o (Your Bead is Worth a Million) to encourage the issuance of tax receipts for retail purchases. As the cost of the comb was too low, the shopkeeper refused which led to an argument that ended with the policeman fracturing a leg. Violence soon broke out, targeted initially at the shops and businesses of \\"turcos\\" (\\"Turks\\", or ethnic minorities of Middle Eastern origin) in the Centenary Bazaar in Tiradentes Square. The bazaar was a stronghold of Syrian-Lebanese traders and merchants. By the second day, rioting spilled over into downtown and hit various public buildings such as the Parana Public Library.

He was one of the pioneers in the construction of program-controlled computer systems and the founding father of computer science courses in Germany. As a member of the advisory board and chairman of the commission for the introduction of computer science studies in Germany, he was significantly involved in the introduction and design of computer science studies throughout Germany. His efforts also led to the establishment of the first computer science course in Germany at TU Darmstadt. Piloty was a founding member of the Gesellschaft f√ºr Informatik. As a member of the general assembly and vice president of the International Federation for Information Processing (IFIP), Piloty had represented German computer science internationally for many years. His research has covered a wide range of areas, from microwave technology, computer-aided circuit design and hardware description languages (HDLs) to design databases.  Life  Piloty was born on 6 June 1924 as the son of Hans Piloty. After studying electrical engineering, he received his doctorate in microwave technology from the Technical University of Munich (TU Munich). Inspired by a study visit to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), where he visited the Whirlwind I, the Program-Controlled Electronic Calculator Munich (PERM) was created by his initiative and under his technical direction from 1949 at the TU Munich. The PERM project under the overall direction of his father Hans Piloty and his mathematician colleague Robert Sauer established the necessary hardware and software basis for many further research projects in the then emerging field of computer science. The PERM was used for many years in the computer center of the TU Munich and in the training of development engineers for the German computer industry. Today it can be seen in the Deutsches Museum in Munich. After the end of the PERM activities, Robert Piloty went to Zurich in 1955 as deputy head of the IBM research laboratory and in 1957 took over the management of system planning at the German company Standard Elektrik Lorenz in Stuttgart. In 1961, he became an associate professor at TU Munich and in 1964 was appointed Professor of Communications Processing at the Faculty of Electrical Engineering of the Technische Universit√§t Darmstadt (TU Darmstadt). There he founded the Institute of Information Processing, which later became the Institute for Computer Engineering. There he developed a hardware description language (HWBS) for the training of engineers, with which computer designs could be simulated. The idea spread quickly and a large number of languages were developed, so that an exchange was very difficult in the end. That is why Piloty founded the international Consensus Language (CONLAN) Working Group in 1975 as part of the IFIP with the aim of creating a basis for standardization. At TU Darmstadt Piloty worked with Winfried Oppelt on a study plan \\"Computer Science\\", which was characterized by engineering science. There was already another curriculum, which came from the Faculty of Mathematics and Physics and provided for a stronger emphasis on software engineering. However, the Faculty of Electrical Engineering was the driving force, which is why in the same year the first computer science course of study in Germany was established at the Faculty of Electrical Engineering on the basis of Pilotys and Oppelts study regulations. In the spring of 1969, Hartmut Wedekind and Robert Piloty had travelled through the USA together for several weeks to study the faculties of computer science there. On July 7, 1969, the Founding Committee for Computer Science (GAI) was established to constitute the Department of Computer Science.

From 1910 she performed as a soloist throughout Germany until the First World War broke out in 1914. Her Breuning-Bache Quartet was active in Denmark from 1919 until 1956. In 1918, she was the first and only woman since to be appointed court violinist and the first woman to play in the Royal Danish Orchestra. From 1926, she became the conductor of the amateur Euphrosyne Orchestra for the next 20 years. She also performed widely in Sweden and England. Early life Born in Copenhagen on 25 January 1891, Gunna Breuning-Storm was the daughter of the physician Hoter Axel Breuning-Storm (1849‚Äì1923) and Gabriele Sophie Borchorst (1863‚Äì1921). She studied the violin from an early age under Johannes Schi√∏rring (1869‚Äì1951) and later under Torben Anton Svendsen (1904‚Äì1980), completing her education in Berlin under Henri Marteau. Career Breunung- Bache Quartet programme (1924) She made her d√©but in 1907 at the Old Fellows Mansion in the presence of the king and queen. After moving to Berlin, she d√©buted there in 1910 and went on to perform as a soloist in Germany's main cities. She performed with the Berlin Philharmonic under Arthur Nikisch, Max Reger and Felix Weingartner and played at the court for Empress Augusta Viktoria. She also taught in Berlin, attracting a considerable number of students. With the outbreak of war in 1914, she returned to Denmark, continuing to teach and giving concerts. She also gave a number of concerts in Sweden in 1916, including one featuring the composer Emil Sj√∂gren with whom she played his sonatas for violin and piano. Back in Denmark, in 1918 she accompanied the court pianist Johanne Stockmarr and was appointed court violinist, becoming the only women to receive the honour. As a teacher, she was engaged by C.F.E. Horneman's conservatory and later by the Royal Danish Academy of Music (1919‚Äì1923). Like her German instructors, she also began to conduct. In about 1920, she established her own chamber orchestra which in 1925 became the amateur Euphrosyne Orchestra. From 1926, she was the orchestra's conductor for the next 30 years, also maintaining the orchestra's educational role as a lively, enthusiastic teacher. She was supported by Crown Prince Frederik, later King Frederik IX, who sponsored a number of the orchestra's concerts. She also continued to perform as a soloist, on one occasion causing quite a stir by performing nine of the most famous violin concertos over three consecutive evenings. Breuning-Storm is also remembered for playing first violin in the Breuning-Bache Quartet which gave its first performance in 1919 and continued to play until 1956. Outside of Denmark it was known as the Copenhagen Quartet. Initially, its members included Gerhard Rafn, second violin, Ella Faber, violist, and Paulus Brache, cello. It gained a considerable reputation both in Denmark and abroad playing both classical and modern music. Gunna Breuning-Storm died in Copenhagen on 24 April 1966. She is buried in Bispebjerg Cemetery. Awards She was honoured with the Ingenio et arti award in 1935.

However, The Hundred was postponed to 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The pandemic also put Zimbabwe's tour to Australia in doubt, but on 28 May 2020, Cricket Australia confirmed the fixtures for the series. The series was put into further doubt in June, after Cricket Australia announced several cost-saving measures. On 20 June 2020, Cricket Australia's interim Chief Executive Officer, Nick Hockley, said that getting clarity on the status of the tour was on his priority list.

Vampire and Sex was shot as a separate adult version. the family version was distributed in 1968. The uncensored version was not shown to the public until 2011 after its discovery.  Plot  El Santo travels to the past with the use of a time machine in search of the treasure of Count Dracula. In both versions, El Santo and Luisa (Noelia Noel) face Dracula (Aldo Monti) and his entourage of vampires.  Production  At the time the film was produced it was common to shoot a family version and an adult version that was distributed mainly in Europe. In fact, It is possible that there are about six such films starring El Santo. Although at that time it was considered an adult film, Vampire and Sex is far from being a pornographic film because it only includes some scenes with integral, partial and transparent nudes of female vampires and Luisa. In these scenes, naked actresses do not appear near El Santo, and the only \\"sexual\\" behaviour is one scene in which Dracula rubs his hand and face against the breasts of the woman he intends turn into a vampire. In spite of this, it is believed that El Santo made a deal with the director Ren√© Cardona so that this work would not come to light, and only distributed Santo en el tesoro de Dr√°cula.  Discovery and Controversy  Decades after filming, three original copies of El Vampiro y El Sex were discovered in a vault in Cinematographic Calder√≥n, the production house of the original film. Using the recovered reels the film was restored by colouring the pictures, which had taken a magenta hue. The restoration process was funded by the Guadalajara International Film Festival, which planned to show the film to the public for the first time at its 26th annual event, in March 2011, within the vampire cinema showing selected by Guillermo del Toro. However, the premiere was cancelled due to copyright conflicts between the producer's family and El Hijo del Santo, who also wanted to prevent the film from screening and damaging his father's image. Finally, Cinematographic Calder√≥n resolved that there was no reason to fear a lawsuit against him, and the film was released on July 15, 2011 at the Diana Theater in Guadalajara, and screened again the following month at the Mexico City International Film Festival of Horror.

Education and career Benjamin Moll earned a BSc in economics from University College London in 2005, followed by a PhD in economics from the University of Chicago in 2010, under the supervision of Robert Townsend, Fernando Alvarez, Francisco Buera and Robert Lucas. After his PhD, he joined Princeton University where he was an Assistant Professor from 2011 to 2017, Associate Professor from 2017 to 2018, and Professor from 2018 to 2019. In 2019, he moved to the London School of Economics.  Research   Cross-country income differences  In his earlier work, Moll showed that an important driving factor in determining the aggregate effects of poorly functioning credit markets is the persistence of idiosyncratic productivity shocks hitting producers. Higher persistence leads to smaller steady-state productivity losses and slower transition dynamics. He later reveals with David Lagakos, Tommaso Porzio, Nancy Qian and Todd Schoellman that wages increase twice as much with experience in rich countries compared to poor countries, supporting the claim that human capital accumulation plays a significant role in explaining cross-country income differences.  Heterogeneity in macroeconomics  In 2018, Moll together with Greg Kaplan and Gianluca Violante coin the term HANK (Heterogeneous Agent New Keynesian) model to describe the rising literature incorporating household heterogeneity into New-Keynesian models. They argue that monetary policy operates mostly via general equilibrium effects on the labor market, instead of the standard intertemporal substitution channel. This is due to a sizable share of households exhibiting high MPCs, whose spending behavior reacts strongly to changes in disposable income. As Ricardian equivalence fails in HANK models, the reaction of the fiscal authority to a monetary shock is key to determine the overall macroeconomic response.  Mean-field game theory  Moll developed and popularized a number of continuous-time methods for solving heterogeneous agent models. Together with mathematicians Yves Achdou, Jiequn Han, Jean-Michel Lasry, and Pierre-Louis Lions, he recasts general equilibrium models in continuous time using mean-field game theory. The standard Aiyagari model is boiled down to a system of two main equations: a Hamilton‚ÄìJacobi‚ÄìBellman equation associated with the optimal decision of the household, and an associated Fokker‚ÄìPlanck equation (Kolmogorov forward equation) governing the dynamics of the wealth distribution. This recasting allows for analytic solutions when the model is parsimonious enough. Moll and his coauthors popularized finite difference methods for solving numerically those continuous time models, which allows for gains in speed compared to discrete time models.

The tale features an inter-species marriage in which a snail transforms into a woman and becomes the bride of a male human. The tale also depicts the motif of a government official from the ruling class taking away a woman in a relationship with a lower-class male civilian.  History and transmission  The tale of a snail turning into a woman has been orally passed down not only in Korea but in China as well. An example of the tale‚Äôs Chinese versions would be Dengyuanzuo (ÈÑßÂÖÉ‰Ωê) in a collection of novellas titled Jiyiji (ÈõÜÁï∞Ë®ò Collection of Strange Stories). There is also Luonuxing (Ëû∫Â•≥ÂΩ¢) in a story collection titled Soushen houji (ÊêúÁ•ûÂæåË®ò Sequel to Records of the Strange) compiled by the poet Tao Qian (Èô∂ÊΩõ, B.C. 365-474).Kim Dae-sook, ‚ÄúUreongi gaksi,‚Äù Encyclopedia of Korean Folk Literature. As for Korean versions of the tale, there is Jogae sokeseo naon yeoja (Ï°∞Í∞ú ÏÜçÏóêÏÑú ÎÇòÏò® Ïó¨ÏûêThe Woman Who Came Out of a Shell) in Ondol yahwa (Ïò®ÎèåÏïºÌôî Late Night Tales Told on Ondol Floors),Jeong In-seop‚Äôs Ondol yahwa was published in Tokyo on March 18, 1927 by Nihon shoin (Êó•Êú¨Êõ∏Èô¢). It was the first Korean folktale collection to be authored by a Korean and published in Japan. The term ‚Äúondol‚Äù in the book‚Äôs title refers to an indoor space where Koreans typically share folktales with one another. Jeong In-seop added more tales to the forty-three in Ondol yahwa and published an English translation of it under the title Folk Tales from Korea in the United Kingdom in 1952, which included a total of ninety-nine tales. Choi In-hak, ‚ÄúOndol yahwa,‚Äù Encyclopedia of Korean Folk Culture. which is a Japanese-language collection of Korean folktales by Jeong In-seop that was published in Tokyo in 1927. There is also Najung mibu seolhwa (ÎÇòÏ§ëÎØ∏Î∂ÄÏÑ§Ìôî The Myth of the Fair Bride From a Shell) in Haguk seolhwa munhak eui yeongu (ÌïúÍµ≠ÏÑ§ÌôîÎ¨∏ÌïôÏùò Ïó∞Íµ¨ A Study on Korean Narrative Literature) by Son Jin-tae that was published in 1946.Kim Dae-sook, ‚ÄúUreongi gaksi,‚Äù Encyclopedia of Korean Folk Literature. The folktale has been orally transmitted widely in all regions throughout the Korean peninsula so that more than thirty different variations of Ureongi gaksi are included in major folktale collections such as Hanguk gubi munhak daegye (ÌïúÍµ≠Íµ¨ÎπÑÎ¨∏ÌïôÎåÄÍ≥Ñ Compendium of Korean Oral Literature). Almost all Koreans are familiar with the term ‚ÄúUreongi gaksi‚Äù because it is an analogy referring to a person who secretly cooks a meal for someone.  Plot   Summary  Once upon a time, there was a man living with his mother for he was too poor to find a wife. One day, while working in a rice paddy, the man grumbled to himself, ‚ÄúWho will I eat this rice with?‚Äù Then he heard a voice reply, ‚ÄúWith me.‚Äù Startled, he once more asked, ‚ÄúWho will I eat this rice with?‚Äù and the voice again answered, ‚ÄúWith me.‚Äù The man looked around to find nothing but a snail shell at the edge of the rice paddy, so he brought it home and kept it in a water jar. From that day on, when mother and son came back home from work each day, a delicious meal would be prepared for them. Curious to find out who was cooking, the man pretended to leave for work one day and crept back to keep an eye on the house. He then saw a beautiful maiden emerge from the snail shell to prepare a meal. The man jumped out, ran over to the maiden, and asked her to live with him instead of going back into the snail shell. The maiden told him it was not yet time, but the impatient man kept begging her to stay so that the two became husband and wife on that very day. Fearing that his wife might be taken away from him, the husband never let her leave the house. Whenever she prepared lunch for her husband, her mother-in-law would deliver it to her son working in the field. One day, the mother-in-law wished to stay home to enjoy some crispy leftover rice, so she asked her daughter-in-law to deliver lunch to her son. On her way to her husband, however, the snail bride ran into the magistrate‚Äôs procession. She quickly hid in the woods, but the magistrate spotted the radiance from her body among the trees. Smitten by her beauty, the magistrate took her away in a palanquin to make her his bride. The husband ultimately failed to find his wife although he went to the magistrate‚Äôs office looking for her, which caused him to die of despair and become reborn as a blue bird. The kidnapped snail bride refused to eat and disobeyed the magistrate until she too died and turned into a fine-toothed comb.  Variation  Most variations of this folktale lead to an unhappy ending like the plot introduced above. In one variation, instead of the mother-in-law, the portrait the snail bride draws for her husband causes her to come across the magistrate. In that variation, the husband is so enamored with his wife that he refuses to leave home for work. The snail bride thus draws a portrait of herself and gives it to her husband to take to work. The portrait, however, is blown away in the wind while the husband is working and allows the magistrate to discover the snail bride and come after her. Meanwhile, another variation bears no mention of a magistrate but arrives at an unhappy ending when the snail bride fails to become wholly human because she marries before the right time comes. In one rare variation that finishes with a happy ending, the magistrate hosts a banquet for beggars in an attempt to make the snail bride laugh. The husband appears at the banquet and dances in a costume covered with bird feathers. At this, the snail bride finally laughs so that the magistrate hands his official robe to the husband, suggesting that he would like try on the bird feather costume. Once they change robes, the snail bride tells her husband to quickly step up to the porch. This causes the magistrate to be ousted while the husband is appointed as a government official and lives happily ever after with his wife.Kim Dae- sook, ‚ÄúUreongi gaksi,‚Äù Encyclopedia of Korean Folk Literature.  Features and significance  Ureongi gaksi features an inter-species marriage between a snail that turns into a maiden and a male human. When the man courts her, the snail bride tells him she cannot accept him for a couple of days. However, the man is impatient and breaks the taboo by immediately making her his bride. Ureongi gaksi is therefore structured around taboos and breaking them. The part where the magistrate becomes smitten with the snail bride‚Äôs beauty and takes her away strongly hints at the motif of a government official taking possession of a woman related to a civilian.Kim Dae-sook, ‚ÄúUreongi gaksi,‚Äù Encyclopedia of Korean Folk Literature. Having a maiden emerge from a snail shell give the story a mysterious air. Yet, describing that it is the snail bride‚Äôs duty to be good at cooking indicates that the term ‚ÄúUreongi gaksi‚Äù represents women who are homemakers in their in-laws‚Äô household.Shin Dong-hun, ‚ÄúUreongi gaksi: The Delightful Imagination of Korean Folktales and the Sighs They Carry,‚Äù Reading Korean Classics.  Other  Ureongi gaksi features the motif of a government official taking away a woman related to a civilian. Tales with the same motif have gained attention for serving as sources for the well-known Korean classic called Chunhyangjeon (Ï∂òÌñ•Ï†Ñ The Tale of Chunhyang).Kim Dae-sook, ‚ÄúUreongi gaksi,‚Äù Encyclopedia of Korean Folk Literature. Other Korean folktales similar to Ureongi gaksi include Domi eui cheo (ÎèÑÎØ∏Ïùò Ï≤ò The Wife of Domi) and Jirisan baksaeknyeo (ÏßÄÎ¶¨ÏÇ∞ Î∞ïÏÉâÎÖÄ The Ugly Woman at Mount Jiri).

Schema of PAC-Spectroscopy The perturbed Œ≥-Œ≥ angular correlation, PAC for short or PAC-Spectroscopy, is a method of nuclear solid-state physics with which magnetic and electric fields in crystal structures can be measured. In doing so, electrical field gradients and the Larmor frequency in magnetic fields as well as dynamic effects are determined. With this very sensitive method, which requires only about 10-1000 billion atoms of a radioactive isotope per measurement, material properties in the local structure, phase transitions, magnetism and diffusion can be investigated. The PAC method is related to nuclear magnetic resonance and the M√∂ssbauer effect, but shows no signal attenuation at very high temperatures. Today only the time-differential perturbed angular correlation (TDPAC) is used.  History and Development  Coincidence measurement in simplified depiction. PAC goes back to a theoretical work by Donald R. Hamilton from 1940. The first successful experiment was carried out by Brady and Deutsch in 1947. Essentially spin and parity of nuclear spins were investigated in these first PAC experiments. However, it was recognized early on that electric and magnetic fields interact with the nuclear moment, providing the basis for a new form of material investigation: nuclear solid-state spectroscopy. Step by step the theory was developed.J.A. Spiers, Nat. Res. Council Canada, Publ. No. 1925 (1950)U. Fano, Nat'l. Bureau of Standards Report 1214F. Coester, J.M. Jauch, Helv. Phys. Acta 26 (1953) 3. After Abragam and Pound published their work on the theory of PAC in 1953 including extra nuclear fields, many studies with PAC were carried out afterwards. In the 1960s and 1970s, interest in PAC experiments sharply increased, focusing mainly on magnetic and electric fields in crystals into which the probe nuclei were introduced. In the mid-1960s, ion implantation was discovered, providing new opportunities for sample preparation. The rapid electronic development of the 1970s brought significant improvements in signal processing. From the 1980s to the present, PAC has emerged as an important method for the study and characterization of materials.Th. Wichert, E. Recknagel: Perturbed Angular Correlation.

Auflage. Vieweg+Teubner Verlag, 2010, B. for the study of semiconductor materials, intermetallic compounds, surfaces and interfaces. Lars Hemmingsen et al. Recently, PAC also applied in biological systems. While until about 2008 PAC instruments used conventional high-frequency electronics of the 1970s, in 2008 Christian Herden and Jens R√∂der et al. developed the first fully digitized PAC instrument that enables extensive data analysis and parallel use of multiple probes. Replicas and further developments followed. Measuring principle  Decay schema of 111In to 111Cd. PAC uses radioactive probes, which have an intermediate state with decay times of 2 ns to approx. 10 Œºs, see example 111In in the picture on the right. After electron capture (EC), indium transmutates to cadmium. Immediately thereafter, the 111cadmium nucleus is predominantly in the excited 7/2+ nuclear spin and only to a very small extent in the 11/2- nuclear spin, the latter should not be considered further. The 7/2+ excited state transitions to the 5/2+ intermediate state by emitting a 171 keV Œ≥-quantum. The intermediate state has a lifetime of 84.5 ns and is the sensitive state for the PAC. This state in turn decays into the 1/2+ ground state by emitting a Œ≥-quantum with 245 keV. PAC now detects both Œ≥-quanta and evaluates the first as a start signal, the second as a stop signal. Single spectra in 90¬∞ and 180¬∞ showing the perturbation effect. Now one measures the time between start and stop for each event. This is called coincidence when a start and stop pair has been found. Since the intermediate state decays according to the laws of radioactive decay, one obtains an exponential curve with the lifetime of this intermediate state after plotting the frequency over time. Due to the non-spherically symmetric radiation of the second Œ≥-quantum, the so-called anisotropy, which is an intrinsic property of the nucleus in this transition, it comes with the surrounding electrical and/or magnetic fields to a periodic disorder (hyperfine interaction). The illustration of the individual spectra on the right shows the effect of this disturbance as a wave pattern on the exponential decay of two detectors, one pair at 90¬∞ and one at 180¬∞ to each other. The waveforms to both detector pairs are shifted from each other. Very simply, one can imagine a fixed observer looking at a lighthouse whose light intensity periodically becomes lighter and darker. Correspondingly, a detector arrangement, usually four detectors in a planar 90 ¬∞ arrangement or six detectors in an octahedral arrangement, \\"sees\\" the rotation of the core on the order of magnitude of MHz to GHz. Bottom: A complex PAC-spectrum, top: its Fourier transformation. According to the number n of detectors, the number of individual spectra (z) results after z=n¬≤-n, for n=4 therefore 12 and for n=6 thus 30. In order to obtain a PAC spectrum, the 90¬∞ and 180¬∞ single spectra are calculated in such a way that the exponential functions cancel each other out and, in addition, the different detector properties shorten themselves. The pure perturbation function remains, as shown in the example of a complex PAC spectrum. Its Fourier transform gives the transition frequencies as peaks. R(t), the count rate ratio, is obtained from the single spectra by using: :R(t)=2\\\\frac{W(180^\\\\circ,t)-W(90^\\\\circ,t)}{W(180^\\\\circ,t)+2W(90^\\\\circ,t)} Depending on the spin of the intermediate state, a different number of transition frequencies show up. For 5/2 spin, 3 transition frequencies can be observed with the ratio œâ1+œâ2=œâ3. As a rule, a different combination of 3 frequencies can be observed for each associated site in the unit cell. PAC- spectrum of single crystal ZnO with fit. PAC is a statistical method: Each radioactive probe atom sits in its own environment. In crystals, due to the high regularity of the arrangement of the atoms or ions, the environments are identical or very similar, so that probes on identical lattice sites experience the same hyperfine field or magnetic field, which then becomes measurable in a PAC spectrum. On the other hand, for probes in very different environments, such as in amorphous materials, a broad frequency distribution or no is usually observed and the PAC spectrum appears flat, without frequency response. With single crystals, depending on the orientation of the crystal to the detectors, certain transition frequencies can be reduced or extinct, as can be seen in the example of the PAC spectrum of zinc oxide (ZnO).  Instrumental setup  Instrumental setup of detectors around the probe. Energy spectrum of 149Gd with energy windows for start and stop. In the typical PAC spectrometer, a setup of four 90¬∞ and 180¬∞ planar arrayed detectors or six octahedral arrayed detectors are placed around the radioactive source sample. The detectors used are scintillation crystals of BaF2 or NaI. For modern instruments today mainly LaBr3:Ce or CeBr3 are used. Photomultipliers convert the weak flashes of light into electrical signals generated in the scintillator by gamma radiation. In classical instruments these signals are amplified and processed in logical AND/OR circuits in combination with time windows the different detector combinations (for 4 detectors: 12, 13, 14, 21, 23, 24, 31, 32, 34, 41, 42, 43) assigned and counted. Modern digital spectrometers use digitizer cards that directly use the signal and convert it into energy and time values and store them on hard drives. These are then searched by software for coincidences. Whereas in classical instruments, \\"windows\\" limiting the respective Œ≥-energies must be set before processing, this is not necessary for the digital PAC during the recording of the measurement. The analysis only takes place in the second step. In the case of probes with complex cascades, this makes it makes it possible to perform a data optimization or to evaluate several cascades in parallel, as well as measur√≠ng different probes simultaneously. The resulting data volumes can be between 60 and 300 GB per measurement.  Sample materials  As materials for the investigation (samples) are in principle all materials that can be solid and liquid. Depending on the question and the purpose of the investigation, certain framework conditions arise. For the observation of clear perturbation frequencies it is necessary, due to the statistical method, that a certain proportion of the probe atoms are in a similar environment and e.g. experiences the same electric field gradient. Furthermore, during the time window between the start and stop, or approximately 5 half-lives of the intermediate state, the direction of the electric field gradient must not change. In liquids, therefore, no interference frequency can be measured as a result of the frequent collisions, unless the probe is complexed in large molecules, such as in proteins. The samples with proteins or peptides are usually frozen to improve the measurement. The most studied materials with PAC are solids such as semiconductors, metals, insulators, and various types of functional materials. For the investigations, these are usually crystalline. Amorphous materials do not have highly ordered structures. However, they have close proximity, which can be seen in PAC spectroscopy as a broad distribution of frequencies. Nano-materials have a crystalline core and a shell that has a rather amorphous structure. This is called core-shell model. The smaller the nanoparticle becomes, the larger the volume fraction of this amorphous portion becomes. In PAC measurements, this is shown by the decrease of the crystalline frequency component in a reduction of the amplitude (attenuation).  Sample preparation  The amount of suitable PAC isotopes required for a measurement is between about 10 to 1000 billion atoms (1010-1012). The right amount depends on the particular properties of the isotope. 10 billion atoms are a very small amount of substance. For comparison, one mol contains about 6.22x1023 particles. 1012 atoms in one cubic centimeter of beryllium give a concentration of about 8 nmol/L (nanomol=10‚àí9 mol). The radioactive samples each have an activity of 0.1-5 MBq, which is in the order of the exemption limit for the respective isotope. How the PAC isotopes are brought into the sample to be examined is up to the experimenter and the technical possibilities. The following methods are usual:  Implantation  Schema of Isotope Separator On Line DEvice' (ISOLDE) am CERN. The proton beam of the proton synchrotron boosters (PSB) creates by fission in targets radioactive nuclei. These are ionized in ion sources, accelerated and due to their different mases separated by magnetic mass sperarators either by GPS (General Purpose Separator) or HRS (High Resolution Separator). During implantation, a radioactive ion beam is generated, which is directed onto the sample material. Due to the kinetic energy of the ions (1-500 keV) these fly into the crystal lattice and are slowed down by impacts. They either come to a stop at interstitial sites or push a lattice-atom out of its place and replace it. This leads to a disruption of the crystal structure. These disorders can be investigated with PAC. By tempering these disturbances can be healed. If, on the other hand, radiation defects in the crystal and their healing are to be examined, unperseived samples are measured, which are then annealed step by step. The implantation is usually the method of choice, because it can be used to produce very well-defined samples.  Evaporation  In a vacuum, the PAC probe can be evaporated onto the sample. The radioactive probe is applied to a hot plate or filament, where it is brought to the evaporation temperature and condensed on the opposite sample material. With this method, e.g. surfaces are examined. Furthermore, by vapor deposition of other materials, interfaces can be produced. They can be studied during tempering with PAC and their changes can be observed. Similarly, the PAC probe can be transferred to sputtering using a plasma.  Diffusion  In the diffusion method, the radioactive probe is usually diluted in a solvent applied to the sample, dried and it is diffused into the material by tempering it. The solution with the radioactive probe should be as pure as possible, since all other substances can diffuse into the sample and affect thereby the measurement results. The sample should be sufficiently diluted in the sample. Therefore, the diffusion process should be planned so that a uniform distribution or sufficient penetration depth is achieved.  Added during synthesis  PAC probes may also be added during the synthesis of sample materials to achieve the most uniform distribution in the sample. This method is particularly well suited if, for example, the PAC probe diffuses only poorly in the material and a higher concentration in grain boundaries is to be expected. Since only very small samples are necessary with PAC (about 5 mm), micro-reactors can be used. Ideally, the probe is added to the liquid phase of the sol-gel process or one of the later precursor phases.  Neutron activation  In neutron activation, the probe is prepared directly from the sample material by converting very small part of one of the elements of the sample material into the desired PAC probe or its parent isotope by neutron capture. As with implantation, radiation damage must be healed. This method is limited to sample materials containing elements from which neutron capture PAC probes can be made. Furthermore, samples can be intentionally contaminated with those elements that are to be activated. For example, hafnium is excellently suited for activation because of its large capture cross section for neutrons.  Nuclear reaction  Rarely used are direct nuclear reactions in which nuclei are converted into PAC probes by bombardment by high-energy elementary particles or protons. This causes major radiation damage, which must be healed. This method is used with PAD, which belongs to the PAC methods.  Laboratories  The currently largest PAC laboratory in the world is located at ISOLDE in CERN with about 10 PAC instruments, that receives its major funding form BMBF. Radioactive ion beams are produced at the ISOLDE by bombarding protons from the booster onto target materials (uranium carbide, liquid tin, etc.) and evaporating the spallation products at high temperatures (up to 2000 ¬∞C), then ionizing them and then accelerating them. With the subsequent mass separation usually very pure isotope beams can be produced, which can be implanted in PAC samples. Of particular interest to the PAC are short-lived isomeric probes such as: 111mCd, 199mHg, 204mPb, and various rare earth probes.  Theory  General Œ≥-Œ≥-cascade with life-time \\\\tau_N of the intermediate state. The first \\\\gamma- quantum (\\\\gamma_1, k_1) will be emitted isotopically. Detecting this quantum in a detector selects a subset with an orientation of the many possible directions that has a given. The second \\\\gamma-quantum (\\\\gamma_2, k_2) has an anisotropic emission and shows the effect of the angle correlation. The goal is to measure the relative probability W(\\\\Theta)\\\\textrm{d}(\\\\Omega) with the detection of \\\\gamma_2 at the fixed angle \\\\Theta in relation to \\\\gamma_1. The probability is given with the angle correlation (perturbation theory): :W(\\\\Theta)=\\\\sum^{k_{max}}_{k}A_{kk}P_{k}cos(\\\\Theta) For a \\\\gamma-\\\\gamma- cascade, k is due to the preservation of parity: :0 Where I_S is the spin of the intermediate state and I_i with i=1;2 the multipolarity of the two transitions. For pure multipole transitions, is I_i=I'_i. A_ {kk} is the anisotropy coefficient that depends on the angular momentum of the intermediate state and the multipolarities of the transition. The radioactive nucleus is built into the sample material and emits two \\\\gamma-quanta upon decay. During the lifetime of the intermediate state, i.e. the time between \\\\gamma_1 and \\\\gamma_2, the core experiences a disturbance due to the hyperfine interaction through its electrical and magnetic environment. This disturbance changes the angular correlation to: :W(\\\\Theta)=\\\\sum^{k_{max}}_{k}A_{kk}G_{kk} G_{kk} is the perturbation factor. Due to the electrical and magnetic interaction, the angular momentum of the intermediate state I_i experiences a torque about its axis of symmetry. Quantum-mechanically, this means that the interaction leads to transitions between the M states. The second \\\\gamma- quantum (\\\\gamma_2) is then sent from the intermediate level. This population change is the reason for the attenuation of the correlation. The interaction occurs between the magnetic core dipole moment \\\\vec{ u} and the intermediate state I_S or/and an external magnetic field \\\\vec{B}. The interaction also takes place between nuclear quadrupole moment and the off-core electric field gradient V_{zz}.  Magnetic dipole interaction  For the magnetic dipole interaction, the frequency of the precession of the nuclear spin around the axis of the magnetic field \\\\vec{B} is given by: : \\\\omega_L=\\\\frac{g\\\\cdot u_N\\\\cdot B}{\\\\hbar} :\\\\Delta E=\\\\hbar\\\\cdot\\\\omega_L=-g\\\\cdot u_N\\\\cdot B g is the Land√© g-factor und u_N is the nuclear magneton. With N=M-M' follows: :E_{magn}(M)-E_{magn}(M')=-(M-M')g\\\\mu_NB_z=N\\\\hbar\\\\omega_L From the general theory we get: :G_{k_1k_2}^{NN}=\\\\sqrt{(2k_1+1)(2k_2+1)}\\\\cdot e^{-iN\\\\omega_L t}\\\\times\\\\sum_M\\\\begin{pmatrix} I&I;&k;_1\\\\\\\\\\\\ M'&-M&N;\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\end{pmatrix}\\\\begin{pmatrix} I&I;&k;_2\\\\\\\\\\\\ M'&-M&N;\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\end{pmatrix} For the magnetic interaction follows: :G_{k_1k_2}^{NN}=e^{\\\\left({-iN\\\\omega_Lt}\\\\right)}  Static electric quadrupole interaction  The energy of the hyperfine electrical interaction between the charge distribution of the core and the extranuclear static electric field can be extended to multipoles. The monopole term only causes an energy shift and the dipole term disappears, so that the first relevant expansion term is the quadrupole term: :E_Q=\\\\sum_{ij}Q_{ij}V_{ij} ij=1;2;3 This can be written as a product of the quadrupole moment Q_{ij} and the electric field gradient V_{ij}. Both [tensor]s are of second order. Higher orders have too small effect to be measured with PAC. The electric field gradient is the second derivative of the electric potential \\\\Phi(\\\\vec{r}) at the core: :V_{ij}=\\\\frac{\\\\partial^2\\\\Phi(\\\\vec{r})}{\\\\partial x_i\\\\partial x_j}=\\\\begin{pmatrix} V_{xx}&0&0\\\\\\\\\\\\ 0&V;_{yy}&0\\\\\\\\\\\\ 0&0&V;_{zz}\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\end{pmatrix} V_{ij} becomes diagonalized, that: :V_{zz}\\\\geV_{yy}\\\\geV_{xx} The matrix is free of traces in the main axis system (Laplace equation) :V_{xx}+V_{yy}+V_{zz}=0 Typically, the electric field gradient is defined with the largest proportion V_{zz} and \\\\eta: :\\\\eta=\\\\frac{V_{yy}-V_{xx}}{V_{zz}} , 0\\\\le\\\\eta\\\\le 1 In cubic crystals, the axis parameters of the unit cell x, y, z are of the same length. Therefore: :V_{zz}=V_{yy}=V_{xx} and \\\\eta=0 In axisymmetric systems is \\\\eta=0. For axially symmetric electric field gradients, the energy of the substates has the values: :E_Q=\\\\frac{eQV_{zz}}{4I(2I-1)}\\\\cdot (3m^2-I(I+1)) The energy difference between two substates, M and M', is given by: :\\\\Delta E_Q=E_m- E_{m'}=\\\\frac{eQV_{zz}}{4I(2I-1)}\\\\cdot 3M^2-M'^2 The quadrupole frequency \\\\omega_Q is introduced. The formulas in the colored frames are important for the evaluation: > :\\\\omega_Q=\\\\frac{eQV_{zz}}{4I(2I-1)\\\\hbar}=\\\\frac{2\\\\pi > eQV_{zz}}{4I(2I-1)h}=\\\\frac{2\\\\pi u_Q}{4I(2I-1)} > : u_Q=\\\\frac{eQ}{h}V_{zz}=\\\\frac{4I(2I-1)\\\\omega_Q}{2\\\\pi} The publications mostly list u_Q. e as elementary charge and h as Planck constant are well known or well defined. The nuclear quadrupole moment Q is often determined only very inaccurately (often only with 2-3 digits). Because u_Q can be determined much more accurately than Q, it is not useful to specify only V_{zz} because of the error propagation. In addition, u_Q is independent of spin! This means that measurements of two different isotopes of the same element can be compared, such as 199mHg(5/2‚àí), 197mHg(5/2‚àí) and 201mHg(9/2‚àí). Further, u_Q can be used as finger print method. For the energy difference then follows: :\\\\Delta E_Q=\\\\hbar\\\\omega_Q\\\\cdot 3m^2-m'^2 If \\\\eta=0, then: :\\\\omega_n=n\\\\cdot\\\\omega_0 with: :\\\\omega_0=\\\\textrm{min}\\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\Delta E_Q}{\\\\hbar}\\\\right) For integer spins applies: :\\\\omega_0=3\\\\cdot\\\\omega_Q und n=M^2-M'^2 For half integer spins applies: :\\\\omega_0=6\\\\cdot\\\\omega_Q und n=\\\\frac{1}{2}M^2-M'^2 The perturbation factor is given by: :G_{k_1k_2}^{NN}=\\\\sum_ns_{nN}^{k_1k_2}\\\\cos{(n\\\\omega_Q^0t)} With the factor for the probabilities of the observed frequencies: :s_{nN}^{k_1k_2}=\\\\sqrt{(2k_1+1)(2k_2+1)}\\\\cdot\\\\sum_{M,M'}\\\\begin{pmatrix} I&I;&k;_1\\\\\\\\\\\\ M'&-M&N;\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\end{pmatrix}\\\\begin{pmatrix} I&I;&k;_2\\\\\\\\\\\\ M'&-M&N;\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\end{pmatrix} As far as the magnetic dipole interaction is concerned, the electrical quadrupole interaction also induces a precision of the angular correlation in time and this modulates the quadrupole interaction frequency. This frequency is an overlap of the different transition frequencies \\\\omega_n. The relative amplitudes of the various components depend on the orientation of the electric field gradient relative to the detectors (symmetry axis) and the asymmetry parameter \\\\eta. For a probe with different probe nuclei, one needs a parameter that allows a direct comparison: Therefore, the quadrupole coupling constant u_Q independent of the nuclear spin \\\\vec{I} is introduced.  Combined interactions  If there is a magnetic and electrical interaction at the same time on the radioactive nucleus as described above, combined interactions result. This leads to the splitting of the respectively observed frequencies. The analysis may not be trivial due to the higher number of frequencies that must be allocated. These then depend in each case on the direction of the electric and magnetic field to each other in the crystal. PAC is one of the few ways in which these directions can be determined.  Dynamic interactions  If the hyperfine field fluctuates during the lifetime \\\\tau_n of the intermediate level due to jumps of the probe into another lattice position or from jumps of a near atom into another lattice position, the correlation is lost. For the simple case with an undistorted lattice of cubic symmetry, for a jump rate of \\\\omega_s<0.2\\\\cdot u_Q for equivalent places N_s, an exponential damping of the static G_{22}(t)-terms is observed: :G_{22}^{dyn}(t)=e^{-\\\\lambda_d t}G_{22}(t) \\\\lambda_d=(N_s-1)\\\\omega_s Here \\\\lambda_d is a constant to be determined, which should not be confused with the decay constant \\\\lambda=\\\\frac{1}{\\\\tau}. For large values of \\\\omega_s, only pure exponential decay can be observed: :G_{22}^{dyn}(t)=e^{-\\\\lambda_d t} The boundary case after Abragam-Pound is \\\\lambda_d, if \\\\omega_s>3\\\\cdot u_Q, then: :\\\\lambda_d\\\\approx\\\\frac{2,5 u_Q^2}{N_s\\\\omega_s}  After effects  Decay scheme of 111 In after 111Cd, illustrating the initial occupation probabilities between a static Cd2+ and a dynamic highly ionized state Cdx+. Cores that transmute beforehand of the \\\\gamma-\\\\gamma-cascade usually cause a charge change in ionic crystals (In3+) to Cd2+). As a result, the lattice must respond to these changes. Defects or neighboring ions can also migrate. Likewise, the high-energy transition process may cause the Auger effect, that can bring the core into higher ionization states. The normalization of the state of charge then depends on the conductivity of the material. In metals, the process takes place very quickly. This takes considerably longer in semiconductors and insulators. In all these processes, the hyperfine field changes. If this change falls within the \\\\gamma-\\\\gamma-cascade, it may be observed as an after effect. The number of nuclei in state (a) in the image on the right is depopulated both by the decay after state (b) and after state (c): :\\\\mathrm{d}N_a=-N_a\\\\left(\\\\Gamma_r+\\\\frac{1}{\\\\tau_{7/2}}\\\\right)\\\\mathrm{d}t mit: \\\\tau_{7/2}=\\\\frac{120\\\\textrm{ps}}{\\\\ln{2}} From this one obtains the exponential case: :N_a(t)=N_{a_0}\\\\cdot e^\\\\left({-(\\\\Gamma_r +\\\\frac{1}{\\\\tau_{7/2}})t}\\\\right) For the total number of nuclei in the static state (c) follows: :N_{c}(t)=\\\\Gamma_r\\\\int\\\\limits_0^tN_a(t)\\\\mathrm{d}t=N_0\\\\frac{\\\\Gamma_r\\\\tau_{7/2}}{\\\\Gamma_r\\\\tau_{7/2}+1}\\\\left(1-e^{-(\\\\Gamma_r+\\\\frac{1}{\\\\tau_{7/2}})t}\\\\right) The initial occupation probabilities \\\\rho are for static and dynamic environments: :\\\\rho_{stat}=\\\\frac{\\\\Gamma_r\\\\tau_{7/2}}{\\\\Gamma_r\\\\tau_{7/2}+1} :\\\\rho_{dyn}=\\\\frac{1}{\\\\Gamma_r\\\\tau_{7/2}+1}  General theory  General Œ≥-Œ≥-cascade with life-time \\\\tau_N of the intermediate state.

The tale revolves around a precious marble and the fight the cat and dog have while bringing back the marble has traditionally been cited at the reason cats and dogs generally fail to get along.  History and Transmission  Gyeonmyo jaengju has been passed down orally all around Korea so that more than fifteen variations of the tale are included in major Korean folktale collections such as Hanguk gubi munhak daegye (ÌïúÍµ≠Íµ¨ÎπÑÎ¨∏ÌïôÎåÄÍ≥Ñ Compendium of Korean Oral Literature).

Hong Tae-han, ‚ÄúDonjeon puri,‚Äù Encyclopedia of Korean Folk Literature. is performed to lyrics about a protagonist who comes into possession of a treasure with help from a snake and a cat. In ways like this, Gyeonmyo jaengju has been fused with other stories and passed down in diverse variations over the years. In the late twentieth century, the folktale was introduced in elementary school Korean language textbooks, which made it familiar to many in modern day Korea.  Plot   Summary  Once upon a time, there was an old man who caught fish for a living. One day, the fisherman caught a large carp but let it go when he saw the carp shedding tears. When the fisherman went to the seashore the next day, a boy appeared, introduced himself as the son of the Dragon King of the Sea, and told the fisherman that he was the carp the fisherman had spared the day before. The boy went on to thank the old fisherman and invited him to the Dragon King‚Äôs palace. The fisherman was well received by the Dragon King and gifted with a precious marble that made him rich once he returned home. Hearing news of this, an old woman in the neighboring village stole the precious marble by secretly switching it with a different marble, which dragged the old fisherman back into poverty. The cat and the dog living with the fisherman saw the burglary as an opportunity to express their gratitude to their master and set out for the old woman‚Äôs house in the neighboring village. The cat and the dog threatened the mouse living at the old woman‚Äôs house to find out where she hid the precious marble. While making their way back home, the dog had to swim across a river while the cat sat on the dog‚Äôs back with the marble in its mouth. However, when the dog kept asking the cat whether it was safely holding on to the marble, the cat finally opened its mouth to answer and dropped the marble into the river. This caused the cat and the dog to fight, after which the dog left for home and the cat remained by the riverside to eat some fish. When the precious marble turned up inside the fish it was eating, the cat brought the marble back to its master. From then on, the fisherman gave preference to the cat and kept the dog outside the house, which is how the relationship between the cat and the dog turned from friend to foe.  Variation  Gyeonmyo jaengju is composed of multiple parts including the part where the fisherman spares the carp‚Äôs life, the part where the old woman tricks the fisherman into losing his marble, and the part where the cat and the dog fight because of the marble.Lee, Ji-young, ‚ÄúDog and Cat Fight Over Magic Marble,‚Äù Korean Folk Literature-Encyclopedia of Korean Folk Culture. The cat and dog fight tends to be combined with different parts to create variations of this tale that largely fall under two types: one that combines the cat and dog fight with the part about the carp returning the favor, and the other that combines the cat and dog fight with the fisherman‚Äôs wife defeating a python (imugi).The story about a wife using her wisdom to quell a python‚Äôs threat can also be witnessed in the tale Kkwong gwa isimi (Íø©Í≥º Ïù¥ÏãúÎØ∏ The Pheasant and the Python). In Kkwong gwa isimi, a woman eats a pheasant and gives birth to a son. The pheasant the woman ate had originally been captured by a python. When the son grows up and is about to marry, the python threatens to eat the son instead of the pheasant. The son‚Äôs bride begs the python to spare her husband‚Äôs life. The python ignores the bride‚Äôs appeal but instead bestows a gem that glows at night and grants wishes. The bride uses the gem against the python and defeats it. Variations of the second type feature a python filled with resentment toward the fisherman, which the fisherman‚Äôs wife wisely defeats. Some variations skip much of the details related to how the fisherman obtains the marble. In other variations, the person who steals the marble is not an old woman from a nearby village, but a friend of the fisherman or a peddler.Seong Gi-yeol, ‚ÄúThe Cat and Dog Fight Over a Marble,‚Äù Encyclopedia of Korean Folk Culture. Lee, Ji-young, ‚ÄúDog and Cat Fight Over Magic Marble,‚Äù Korean Folk Literature-Encyclopedia of Korean Folk Culture.  Features and Significance  Gyeonmyo jaengju is the quintessential story of animals repaying the kindness of humans. The Dragon King‚Äôs son who shapeshifts into a carp repays the kindness shown by the fisherman. When the fisherman finds himself in a crisis, the cat and the dog set out to retrieve the treasure to show their appreciation to their master. Such developments hint at the moral that animals not only show gratitude toward good deeds humans do, but also help humans overcome the difficulties they encounter.Lee, Ji-young, ‚ÄúDog and Cat Fight Over Magic Marble,‚Äù Korean Folk Literature-Encyclopedia of Korean Folk Culture.

He entered Rugby School in 1892 and proceeded to Magdalen College, Oxford in 1897 where he secured a first class degree in Chemistry in 1901.

He came to know all the leading mineralogists there and the local mineral collectors. From the collectors, many of them alpine guides, he purchased great numbers of fine specimens, but it was a condition he made that for every specimen he must be able to locate the exact locality and, if possible, to see and examine each locality himself. He would photograph the sites, and prints of his photographs would then be used to pinpoint the sites of his finds. For this work he used a half plate stand camera with a heavy tripod stand. He considered that a lighter camera producing smaller negatives did not give suitable reproductions for his purposes.Journal of the Mineralogical Society, Vol XXX Sept 1956 The whole of the Swiss Collection of over 6000 specimens was presented to the British Museum (Natural History) between 1921 and 1938 and the catalogues and the negatives of all his photographs connected with the collection were also passed to the museum under the terms of his will. > ‚ÄúThe value of his contributions to the British Museum‚Äôs national collections > of minerals is not to be measured by number of specimens but the total is > close on 10,000.

The story features the theme of quest through the journey the protagonist embarks on to find his bride as well as the theme of eradication in terms of the protagonist‚Äôs defeat of the monster.  History and Transmission  Ever since Son Jin-tae introduced this tale to Korean academia, it has been referred to as either ‚ÄúJihaguk daejeok jechi seolhwa‚Äù or ‚ÄúJihaguk daejeok toechi seolhwa,‚Äù the titles respectively given by Son Jin-tae and Jang Deok-sun. The tale has a long history which is demonstrated not only by the way it served as a motif for multiple biographical novels including Geumwonjeon (Í∏àÏõêÏ†Ñ The Tale of Kim Won), Geumnyeongjeon (Í∏àÎ†πÏ†Ñ The Tale of the Golden Bell), and Choe Chi-won jeon (ÏµúÏπòÏõêÏ†Ñ The Tale of Choe Chi-won), but through traces of it in other stories such as Shenyang dongji (Áî≥ÈôΩÊ¥ûË®ò) in the Chinese story collection Jiandeng Xinhua (Ââ™ÁáàÊñ∞Ë©± New Tales for the Trimmed Lampwick), Hong Gil-dong jeon (ÌôçÍ∏∏ÎèôÏ†Ñ The Tale of Hong Gil-dong), and Seol In-gwi jeon (ÏÑ§Ïù∏Í∑ÄÏ†Ñ The Tale of Seol In-gwi).Kim Yeol-gyu, ‚ÄúJihaguk daejeok toechi seolhwa,‚Äù Encyclopedia of Korean Folk Culture. For instance, Geumnyeongjeon is similar to Jihaguk daejeok toechi seolhwa in that the protagonist rescues and marries a princess abducted by a monster with nine heads. Jihaguk daejeok toechi seolhwa appears to have influenced the second half of Hong Gil-dong jeon in which Hong Gil-dong establishes a kingdom called Yuldoguk, defeats a monster inside a cave, and takes as his wife the kidnapped woman he rescues from the monster. Jihaguk daejeok toechi seolhwa has been orally passed down nationwide in Korea and approximately sixty variations of the tale can be found in collections such as Hanguk gubi munhak daegye (ÌïúÍµ≠Íµ¨ÎπÑÎ¨∏ÌïôÎåÄÍ≥Ñ Compendium of Korean Oral Literature).  Plot   Summary  Once upon a time, a maiden became kidnapped by a monster from the underworld. When the maiden‚Äôs parents offered all they owned in addition to their daughter in exchange for her rescue, a general came forward and set out on the mission. After a series of severe trials, the general finally learned that the monster was living in the underworld and discovered a narrow door leading to it. The general tried to make his men climb down a rope to reach the underworld, but all of them gave up halfway. The general was left with no choice but to make the trip himself. Once down in the underworld, the general hid up in a tree beside a well. Shortly afterwards, a maiden came along to draw water. The general dropped a few leaves into the water jar to inform her of his presence and was able to infiltrate the monster‚Äôs house with her help. The maiden asked the general to lift a rock to see whether he was strong enough to defeat the monster, but the general failed the test. The maiden thus gave the general some invigorating water to drink and had him build up his strength. Once he grew stronger, the general was finally able to slay the monster and send all the kidnapped people back up above ground. However, the men waiting above ground snatched the maiden and took off without waiting for their general. The general eventually escaped from the underworld with the help of a deity, punished the men who betrayed him, and married the maiden he rescued.  Variation  The protagonist‚Äôs identity differs from time to time in some variations of this folktale. The protagonist is sometimes a strong man, warrior, military officer, idler, hunter, or a boy. The female abducted by the underworld enemy is sometimes a princess or a lady from an affluent family. Instead of the kidnapped maiden, a deity serves as a guide to the protagonist in some variations, or the protagonist is assisted by a magpie indebted to the protagonist. In terms of subtypes, this tale is linked to the story Geumdwaejigul (Í∏àÎèºÏßÄÍµ¥ The Golden Boar in a Cave),Park Jong-o, ‚ÄúGeumdwaejigul‚Äù, Encyclopedia of Korean Folk Culture. which is related to the birth story of Choe Chi-won. A variation in which the protagonist ventures down to the underworld in pursuit of the monster that killed his mother shares connections with the stories Kkori datbal judungi datbal goemul (Íº¨Î¶¨ Îã∑Î∞ú Ï£ºÎë•Ïù¥ Îã∑Î∞ú Í¥¥Î¨º The Monster With a Five Feet Long Beak and Tail) and Jomagu (Ï°∞ÎßàÍµ¨ The Monster Jomagu).Noh Young-geun, ‚ÄúKkori datbal judungi datbal goemul‚Äù, Encyclopedia of Korean Folk Culture.  Features and Significance  In Jihaguk daejeok toechi seolhwa, the protagonist experiences all sorts of hardships and ordeals before defeating the villain and marrying a woman of high birth. This tale‚Äôs protagonist hence coincides with the typical image of those in other folktales who embark on an adventure without fear or hesitation. Also, the conflict between the protagonist, his subordinates, and the fearsome enemy marks a clear division between good and evil and leads to a typically optimistic ending in which the good wins.Kim Yeol-gyu, ‚ÄúJihaguk daejeok toechi seolhwa,‚Äù Encyclopedia of Korean Folk Culture. Jihaguk daejeok toechi seolhwa revolves around the conflict between the protagonist‚Äôs world above ground and the underworld where the fearsome enemy resides. The storyline is similar to that of heroic epics in that the protagonist sets out on an adventure and overcomes adversities to fulfill a mission. On the other hand, this tale‚Äôs protagonist is not someone born under extraordinary circumstances or with a remarkable skill, which is different from those of other myths or legends. The protagonist in this tale remains closer to the general formula of an ordinary figure showing his potential while searching for a solution. The motif of Jihaguk daejeok toechi seolhwa has most likely been adapted and altered by other old Korean novels. The significance of this folktale therefore lies in the impact it had and connections it shares with old Korean stories such as Geumwonjeon, Geumnyeongjeon, and Choe Chi-won jeon, and even Hong Gil-dong jeon.Kim Yeol-gyu, ‚ÄúJihaguk daejeok toechi seolhwa,‚Äù Encyclopedia of Korean Folk Culture.  Other  Folktales similar to Jihaguk daejeok toechi seolhwa can be found not only in Korea, but around the world. In the West, this sort of story is referred to as a tale of magic, or a Perseus and Andromeda type of story. The tale also shares commonalities with several types of stories under the Aarne-Thompson classification: Type 300 (The Dragon Slayer), Type 301 (The Bear‚Äôs Son), and Type 303 (The Twins or Blood-brothers). Type 301 is also known as ‚ÄúThe Three Stolen Princesses,‚Äù which suggests a connection to this particular Korean folktale.Cho Hee-Woong, ‚ÄúJihaguk daejeok toechi seolhwa,‚Äù Encyclopedia of Korean Culture.

Life  Born with a brother who became a Catholic priest. Morrissey married John Wolfe Tone Morrissey who was elected as Liverpool's first socialist councillor. They both had a public political profile and worked together, locally and nationally until her sudden death in 2012. Morrissey was also in her own right, a branch convenor for political organisations in Merseyside, as well as a Poor Law Guardian. Morrissey founded the Liverpool WSPU branch and imprisoned twice for suffragette activism.  Suffrage and Socialism  Morrissey was a socialist in the Independent Labour Party (ILP), a devout and active Catholic and also joined the movement for votes for women, firstly in the Liverpool Women's Suffrage Society (a branch of the National Union of Women's Suffrage Societies (NUWSS), the suffragists) in 1904. Morrissey quickly left that society, along with Dr Alice Ker, as Morrissey saw it as undemocratic and class led. Morrissey was forthright in criticising the lack of a campaign to go out and educate women across all areas of the city to be ready to use the vote. Morrissey went onto become a militant suffragette leader in starting up the Liverpool branch of the Women's Social and Political Union (WSPU), the suffragettes. Morrissey was considered a friend of the WSPU leaders, the Pankhursts and Hannah Mitchell. However her public profile focussed on her role in the local labour movement, but The Labour Leader praised not her socialist fervour or strength of her case for female enfranchisement, but for her care for the 'creature comforts' of ILP potential recruits at the 'Socialist Socials' in the early 1900s. Suffragette meeting in Caxton Hall, Manchester In 1906, Morrissey was among the women protesting and heckling during a speech by the then Liberal Prime Minister Sir Henry Campbell-Bannerman to an audience of around 6,000 at the Sun Hall. Morrissey and Patricia Woodlock also held large open outdoor meetings, but were less often invited to the more elite 'at home' drawing room discussions amongst middle class women of WSPU. Although both suffrage organisations and political parties discouraged dual membership because of conflicting policy perspectives, social activism and suffragette activism were equally important to Morrissey, who served as the ILP branch secretary (1907‚Äì08) and first female delegate to the Liverpool Labour Representative Committee. Morrissey was a strong campaigner for John Hill, ILP candidate in the by-election for Kirkdale constituency in September 1907. Morrissey spoke along with other socialist women, such as Mary Bamber, at ILP public meetings and was praised by The Labour Leader, for that and cited as an example in complaints about the attitude of some WSPU members who were not seen positively supporting ILP candidates, who were actually sympathetic to their cause. But in Liverpool the two movements sometimes held joint protest events and their local leaders appeared to recognise the individual women's rights to hold opinions for both causes. Morrissey led ILP meetings with others such as Emma Hillier, Hattie Mahood and Patricia Woodlock to build up socialist support for women's suffrage, but the women did not have the power to control and plan their activities in ILP compared with the WSPU. The suffragette movement recognised Morrissey's roles as an \\"agitator, orator, organiser and due two prison terms, a martyr.\\" When Ada Flatman left the Liverpool WSPU, suddenly in late 2010, following a disagreement on tactics, Morrissey volunteered as interim WSPU secretary and organiser. Morrissey also became District Secretary of the Women's Cooperative Guild (WCG) in 2011. Morrissey and her husband toured around the south of England for ILP propaganda just before she died suddenly in 2012.  Faith and politics  The Catholic Church did not take a political stance on women's suffrage at the start, rather its spiritual leaders pronounced concerns about the impact of political engagement in the role of women in civil society, for example Cardinal Manning the Archbishop of Westminster (a former Anglican) said in 1871 at St. Mary Moorfield he hoped English womanhood would ‚Äòresist by a stern moral refusal, the immodesty which would thrust women from their private life of dignity and supremacy into the public conflicts of men. His successor, Cardinal Vaughan, was more open to change and was reported as saying '‚ÄòI believe that the extension of the Parliamentary Franchise to women upon the same conditions as it is held by men would be a just and beneficial measure, tending to raise rather than to lower the course of national legislation.‚Äô Morrissey clearly was among the Catholic community who agreed with the more liberal approach, and was seen as principled in her prison experience as reported in the Catholic press. Morrissey and fellow Catholic WSPU leader, Patricia Woodlock were imprisoned in March 1907, for suffragette activism. Other Catholic women activists locally included Florence Barry daughter of a Persian Austrian merchant, Bertha Quinn a clothing worker of Leeds, Violet Bryant a nurse of Newcastle, and even an Augustinian nun, Mother Mary Frances of St Augustine's Priory girls school in Ealing, who chained herself to railings and broke windows, and was imprisoned for the cause. Other Catholic women led debates and discussions instead, such as Gabrielle Jeffery, Mary Kendall and poet Alice Meynell, Elisabeth Christitch an Irish Serbian, and Leonara De Alberti (who became the editor of the Catholic Suffragist) establishing the first Catholic Women's Suffrage Society in 1911. By 1919, Elsabeth Christitch was given a Vatican Papal audience with Benedict XV the head of the Catholic faith, who was reported as having said '‚Äòwe should like to see women electors everywhere‚Äô. Despite strong and sometimes violent sectarian movements in Merseyside, it is noted that the women: Catholic Women's suffrage groups and protestant Church League for Women's Suffrage members worked effectively together, with joint events occasionally, remarkable co-operation for that era, even for Eleanor Rathbone, outspoken against WSPU militancy but content to work with its individuals in Merseyside, where key women engaged in society across political, religious and class divides, perhaps uniquely.  WSPU activism and prison  Morrissey established the Liverpool branch of the Pankhurst's WSPU with Patricia Woodlock and Emma Hillier, neither of whom were establishment figures: Woodlock the daughter of an impoverished artist and Hillier self- funding with a range of careers from missionary to dressmaker. Morrissey's first arrest was at Belle Vue Manchester June 1906, when she and her husband were heckling at a Liberal rally, and this was treated sympathetically by the socialist press. Morrissey was imprisoned in Holloway, and on her release was quoted in \\"Catholic Suffragist Released,\\" in the Catholic Herald, 5 April 1907 saying 'so little deterred was she by her recent experience that she hoped they would not rest until they had 76 women out of every large town in goal.\\" And the same publication printed Morrissey's prison-letter in an article \\"Votes for Women\\", on 26 April 1907 reporting Morrissey as writing that no nation was free while its women lived in \\"political silence,\\" and adding \\"history teaches us that it is only by some people making sacrifices, that we will be freed.\\" In 1907, the three leaders set the focus and agenda for the Liverpool WSPU branch, homed in premises accessible to all at 6 Colquitt Street. As two had socialist backgrounds, they aimed to educate working women, holding street meetings in working class areas, factory gate meetings at lunch time, inviting former mill worker suffragette Annie Kenney to take a week of campaigning in the city. When Mary Gawthorpe led the Lancashire branches of WPSU there was support for these methods across the industrial north west. By 1908 the numbers attending had grown and in one case estimated as over a thousand. Under the branch leadership of Alice Davies, Morrissey was mentioned for organising Emmeline Pankhurst's visit to the Hardman Hall in 1912.

SS-Armeekorps) was a short- lived SS corps-level headquarters formed to participate in Operation Nordwind on the Upper Rhine in the winter of 1944-1945 during World War II. History After his appointment as commander-in-chief of Army Group Upper Rhine, reichsf√ºhrer Heinrich Himmler formed the headquarters of the XIV SS Army Corps in November 1944. Because there were not enough combat units available, the corps consisted of only one division, the 553rd Volksgrenadier Division. The force acted as a reserve for the army group. The Corps was given the task of attacking and pinning the American units at Gambsheim at the start of Operation Nordwind, so that they could not be used as reinforcements against the main attack, which would be deployed more to the north. In the night of 4 to 5 January 1945, the 553rd People's Grenadier Division crossed the Rhine near Gambsheim, where the Moder and Zorn rivers merge. Because most US units of the 6th Army Corps fought in the north and thanks to the help of the pro- German population, the Germans were able to quickly extend their bridgehead to Kilstett, Herrlisheim and Offendorf. General Alexander Patch, commander of the 7th US Army, ordered the newly arrived 12th Armored Division to destroy the bridgehead on 8 January. This attack and a second attack on 13 January failed with heavy losses. On 14 January 1945, the XIV SS Army Corps received the 3rd SS Panzer Battalion of the 10th SS Armored Division, led by SS-Brigadef√ºhrer Heinz Harmel. The experienced Harmel ignored the orders of his corps commander and launched an attack on 16 January 1945. His heavy German tanks destroyed an American tank battalion and overran the accompanying armored infantry. Despite this victory, the German attack stalled. Canals and drainage canals cut through the landscape and many German tanks got stuck or had mechanical problems. On the southern edge, the 3rd French Infantry Division expelled the 553rd Volksgrenadiers Division from Kilstett and by 21 January, the German offensive came to an end. In the East, the Soviet Vistula‚ÄìOder Offensive had broken out and several German units were sent from the West to the endangered Eastern front. The headquarters of the XIV SS Army Corps were dissolved and the staff formed the X SS Corps that was sent to Pommern.

Tragedy struck the young family numerous times: two sisters died while young, another died while only a teenager and her half-brother Ignace died by drowning. After a bout with smallpox at age eight, Maria was left with many facial marks, but despite these trials she remained an enthusiastic child, full of wit and joy. It was while preparing for her first communion at the age of 10 that Maria made a vow to become a nun and to consecrate herself to God.  Spiritual life  In 1640, against her father's wishes, she lived for a time in a convent of Augustinian sisters in Ghent but did not join that order because, with her bad vision, \\"she cannot see the letters of the choral prayer.\\" Instead she became a nun with Carmelite Third Order and took the name Marie of Saint Theresa (in French, Marie de Sainte Th√©r√®se). In 1642, she entered the Beguinage of Ghent and took the sacred vows of obedience and chastity. In 1646, the direction of the Beguinage community was entrusted to a professor of philosophy, Michael of St. Augustine (born Jan van Ballaert), who became her spiritual director. Michael of St. Augustine, noticing Maria's spiritual work and mystical graces, suggested that she retire to a more solitary place. In October 1657 she moved to the beguinage in Mechelen near the Carmelite church where she began her solitary life of study and writing. In 1659, she took the vow of poverty and renewed her vows of obedience and chastity. She read many spiritual works such as the writings of John of the Cross, Teresa of Avila, John of Ruusbroec, Eckhart von Hochheim and John Tauler. In about 1662, Michael of St. Augustine asked her to write a memoir of her spiritual and mystical experiences. The resulting autobiography titled La vie de Marie Petyt (The Life of Maria Petyt) was published after her death.  Death and burial  After an extended sickness, Maria died November 1, 1677, and was buried in Mechelen in present-day Belgium. During the years of the French Revolution (1789-1798), the convent was closed. It was ultimately destroyed in 1804, and at that time her tomb was opened but discovered empty.

As a socially underprivileged figure, the protagonist relies solely on his skills to turn the tables and achieve success, which tends to offer a sense of mental liberation from conventions and authority.  History and transmission  Kkoejaengi hain is a folktale widely passed down throughout the Korean peninsula and more than twenty variations of the story can be found in major Korean folktale collections including Hanguk gubi munhak daegye (ÌïúÍµ≠Íµ¨ÎπÑÎ¨∏ÌïôÎåÄÍ≥Ñ Compendium of Korean Oral Literature). Trickster tales in which a subordinate plays tricks on a superior commonly exist all over the world. In Korea, Seunim gwa sangjwa (Ïä§ÎãòÍ≥º ÏÉÅÏ¢å A Monk and a Senior Acolyte) in Yongjae chonghwa (Ïö©Ïû¨Ï¥ùÌôî Yongjae‚Äôs Essay Collection) qualifies as a trickster tale. Considering how widespread Kkoejaengi hain is in Korea, the tale is likely to have been orally transmitted among people for hundreds of years. The tale must have been particularly popular during the second half of the Joseon dynasty when aristocrats had weaker authority and became targeted by the public.Shin Dong- heun, ‚ÄúKkoejaengi hain‚Äù, Encyclopedia of Korean Folk Literature.  Plot   Summary  A nobleman from the countryside set out on a trip to Seoul with a young servant as his groom. The nobleman tried to intimidate the servant by warning him that Seoul was a vicious place where it was easy to have one‚Äôs nose sliced off alive. During their journey, the servant came up with cunning ways to play pranks on his master. When delivering a meal, he said his snot accidentally fell into the soup as he stirred it in front of his master, which disgusted the master enough to give the food away to the servant. With another meal, the servant presented it with a burning hot spoon that made the master yelp in surprise and pain, allowing the servant to take the food away to enjoy it himself. Once, the servant secretly ate his master‚Äôs lunch, relieved himself in the lunch box, and told his master that the food had gone stale and turned into feces. Upon arriving in Seoul, the master went out on business. The servant left behind sold the horse and sat with his eyes shut and hands covering his nose. When the master asked where the horse was upon his return, the servant said he didn‚Äôt realize the horse was gone for he was worried that someone might slice his nose off now that they were in Seoul. The furious master wrote the message ‚ÄúDrown him when he returns‚Äù on the servant‚Äôs back and sent him home. On his way back to his master‚Äôs house in the countryside, the servant tricked a woman milling into giving him some green barley. He also tricked a merchant selling honey into making honey-filled rice cakes with the green barley. The servant took the rice cakes and offered them to a monk in exchange for having the message on his back corrected to ‚ÄúLet him marry my daughter when he returns.‚Äù The servant then went home to show the message to his master‚Äôs family and became married to his master‚Äôs daughter. When the master later returned home, he became enraged to find that his daughter had been wed to the servant. The master forced the servant into a sack and hung the sack on a tree beside a pond to let the servant die. The servant, however, spotted a one-eyed brassware peddler passing by and tricked the peddler into believing that the sack would heal his blind eye. The peddler took the servant‚Äôs place inside the sack and ended up drowning in the pond. After a while, the servant came back to his master‚Äôs house and bragged about how wonderful it was to stay at the dragon‚Äôs palace underneath the pond. Overcome with the desire to see the dragon‚Äôs palace for themselves, the master and his family jumped into the pond and drowned. The master‚Äôs daughter was also about to jump into the pond, but the servant talked her out of it and lived to enjoy his master‚Äôs wealth with his wife.  Variation  This tale‚Äôs protagonist is referred to as a servant but is sometimes given more folksy names such as Makdongi, Aetteugi, Tteogeori, Gageori, or Wangguljangguldae. The tale is also told as a story about a real-life figure such as Bang Hak-jung, Kim Bok-seon, and Jin Pyeong-gu. Kkoejaengi hain is told as a full narrative as well as in short episodes featuring a prank the protagonist plays on the master. There are diverse types of pranks, but the story commonly includes the pranks involving stealing the master‚Äôs food and selling the master‚Äôs horse. Some variations start by telling that the servant held a grudge against his master for trying to take his mother away. The tale‚Äôs conclusion also varies, one in which the master‚Äôs daughter kills her husband to avenge the death of her family. This ending is a rare variation for depicting the servant in a negative light.  Features and significance  The protagonist in Kkoejaengi hain is the archetype of a trickster in Korean folktales. A trickster is a borderline personality that does not hesitate to go against rules, customs, norms, and boundaries. For this reason, storytellers often have scruples about tricksters for being cruel or vulgar.Na Su-ho, ‚ÄúBang Hak-jung‚Äù, Encyclopedia of Korean Folk Literature. Tricksters stand on a borderline and portray a different view of the world, providing an opportunity to tear down all that has been established by human society and allow a new order to emerge. However, they never take part in actually creating a new order.Na Gyeong-su, ‚ÄúTrickster Tale‚Äù, Encyclopedia of Korean Folk Literature. In Kkoejaengi hain, the master and his family are not the only ones to be tricked by the protagonist. Other commoners fall victim to the protagonist‚Äôs pranks such as the milling woman, the merchant selling honey, or the brassware peddler. Instead of dealing with a specific enemy, the protagonist takes on the world and clears his own path, which demonstrates self-centered vanity and unrestricted freedom from collective morals or duties. The servant‚Äôs actions in this tale carries meaning in terms of the ontology involving the strong and the weak rather than good and evil.  Related works  The outline of the socially weak servant overthrowing the socially strong to gain a wife and property in Kkoejaengi hain shares commonalities with the German folktale The Brave Little Tailor in which a tailor tricks giants and the king, marries the princess, and becomes the ruler of a kingdom. The episode about causing the master to drown is similar to a development in the German fairy tale The Little Peasant. Among Korean fables, this folktale‚Äôs protagonist resembles the hare in Tokki wa geobugi (ÌÜ†ÎÅºÏôÄ Í±∞Î∂ÅÏù¥The Hare and the Tortoise) as well as in Horangi wa tokki (Ìò∏ÎûëÏù¥ÏôÄ ÌÜ†ÎÅºThe Tiger and the Hare) or the quail in Yeou wa mechuragi (Ïó¨Ïö∞ÏôÄ Î©îÏ∂îÎùºÍ∏∞The Fox and the Quail).

Markus was chairperson until December 2017, and was then replaced by Dekel who is the current chair, as of the end of 2019. The motivations for the establishment of the association were many researches that proved the exclusion of women artists from Israeli art history,2008 Ruth Markus (ed.), G. Trajtenberg, R. Sela, E. Meyer-Maril, and Y. Guilat, Women Artist in Israel, 1920-1970, Tel Aviv: Migdarin (genders) Series, Hakibbutz Hamehuchad Publishing House, 2008 (Hebrew). Published with the support of the Israel Science Foundation (ISF) including from exhibiting in museums and being part of the curricula of art studies, while concurrently, gender studies were pushed to the margins of most Israeli arts programs, if they even existed. The association was founded to encourage both gender research and research about women artists in Israel. Its membership includes artists, scholars, curators, art institution managers and the like, regardless of gender, ethnicity, religion, or any other identity category, who are interested in gender-related subject in Israeli art. Creators from other fields of art, such as music, film and television, photography, theater and more are also accepted as members.  Activities  The association's activities focus on two main areas: The first area is research and documentation ‚Äì developing the discipline of gender research in Israeli art programs, and collecting and disseminating information about women artists and gender research in the arts. The second is providing support for women artists and creating a supportive community for them and for curators, researchers and cultural organizers in Israel. As of 2017, the association recognizes an \\"Artist of the Month\\" from among its members, whose work receives significant exposure on the association's website and elsewhere. The varied activities of the association aim to create a stage for artists, curators and researchers, document the existence and contribution of women artists historically and contemporarily, and provide assistance for research endeavors and special projects.  Conferences and seminars  The association holds a biannual national conferences in collaboration with the Faculty of Arts at Tel Aviv University on women and gender in the arts in Israel, and with the support of the Ziffer House Archive: Documentation and Research Center of Israeli Visual Arts and the TIAF Israeli Art Research Foundation. Each of the two-day conferences includes lectures by senior researchers and researchers in the fields of gender and women in the arts in Israel. The first conference was held in 2017 and the second conference was held in 2019, with the next conference planned for 2021. In addition, the association organizes a series of art and gender meetings throughout the year, which are open to the general public. The first series was held at the Kibbutzim College in 2018, and the second series took place at Tel Aviv University in 2019. In 2020, one series is scheduled for northern Israel, and another in the center of the country. The association also conducts collaborations and seminars with cultural institutions, including with the Peace Gallery in Givat Haviva; and the Haifa Museum of Art, where a seminar was held on the female body following the Chana Orloff exhibition. Another seminar was held on the occasion of International Women's Day at the Social Museum \\"On the Seam\\" in Jerusalem.  Exhibitions  The association holds annual art exhibits, such as \\"Her Story\\" at the Tel Aviv Artist House, which focused on ten women artists who had been forgotten or omitted in the Israeli art discourse. The exhibit was widely attended and generated public and critical interest, and as a result, one of the artists, Hannah Levy, was offered a solo exhibit of her work at the Herzliya Museum of Contemporary Art. Another 2019 art exhibit was entitled \\"Painting Views\\", which examined landscape art that has resurfaced as an area of interest, and compared and contrasted the work of contemporary and veteran women artists. Also in 2019 was the \\"Creating Reality\\" exhibit at the Rishon LeZion Artists House, in which an innovative method of curation was introduced, called \\"curation activism\\".  Collaborations  As part of the goal of documentation, the association teamed up with the Tel Aviv Wiki Women initiative, to add articles about women artists to Wikipeidia. Another collaboration is with the academic journal, Migdar (Gender), which published a special issue dedicated to art, edited by association chair Tal Dekel. The association has an ongoing collaboration with the digital art journal 44 Degrees. The association provides expert panels at various art or gender-related events, such as on the subject of representation of the sex industry in Israel, which took place at Hagit Shahal's solo exhibit, \\"I Feel Pretty\\".

Like many other Foursquare homes, the house had a square shape and was topped by a hip roof with a dormer. In the mid-1920s, architect Andrew E.

Initially convicted of a 1991 robbery-murder in Tashkent, he was released in 2003, moving to Russia, where five years later, he murdered a trio of fishermen during an argument in Penza Oblast. For this crime, he was sentenced to life imprisonment. Biography Dmitry was born in the Uzbekistani capital of Tashkent, the son of a Greek man and his Russian wife. Little information is known about his early life. In 1991, Golubev was given a 15-year sentence for a robbery-murder committed in Tashkent, but was released after 12 years. He then moved to Mokshan, where his mother was living, but failed to receive either Russian or Uzbekistani citizenship, and was unemployed. Triple murder On October 12, 2008, Dmitry, together with a group of friends, went to drink vodka at a little pond near the village of Krutets, in the Kolyshleysky District. When they arrived, they saw a small group of fishermen on the other side of the pond: 66-year-old Azerbaijani Alexander Glukhov, locals Alexander Kocherov and Nazir Abdullaev (36 and 24, respectively), and another man, A. Pivkin. After both parties had drunk quite extensively, they started arguing and insulting each other, with one of fishermen calling Golubev a homosexual. Pivkin then took out a knife and swung it at the other group, scaring Golubev away. Angered, Dmitry stormed off back to his company, started up the car and drove towards the fishermen. Meanwhile, Pivkin had left the scene, while the others had gone to sleep. Golubev then drove through the tent of one of the men, landing his car into the water. Refusing to back down, he got a knife stashed in the car and attacked the trio, stabbing Abdullaev 19 times, killing him. He then focused his attention towards Kocherov, who was sleeping on the ground, and stabbed him 15 times. Ultimately, he also stabbed Glukhov (who had nothing to do with the quarrel) while he was sleeping in the car, inflicting a total of 23 stab wounds on him (9 in the abdomen, 9 in the head and the rest in other parts of the body). All of the fishermen died on the spot, from acute blood loss. After he had killed the men, Golubev fled the scene with his friends. Investigation, arrest and imprisonment The crime scene was eventually discovered and authorities were notified. A timeline was constructed around the events, and the Investigative Department implemented a variety of measures through the region so they could catch the perpetrator. Eventually, policemen stopped a Lada 110 driven by E. Yuksina, a roommate of Golubev's. Through her, the whereabouts of A. Yuksin were established, whom implicated Dmitry in the triple murder. After identifying their suspect, the authorities detained him at his home in Mokshan the following day. Following some questioning, Dmitry confessed that he was responsible, but didn't give a testimony, as he claimed he was unable to remember the events. He had psychological and psychiatric examinations conducted on him by the Serbsky Center in Moscow, and experts concluded that he was well-aware of his actions, and was trying to derail the investigation. Since he has no citizenship, his case transgressed on Russian laws, and he was sentenced to life imprisonment. The court also ordered him to pay 300,000 rubles to cover the material costs for the victims' funerals.

Had it been launched before Street Slam, it would have become the first basketball title for the Neo Geo platforms. Featuring arcade-style gameplay, players compete with either AI-controlled opponents or against other players in versus matches on the game. Although previewed across a few video game magazines, in addition to being showcased to attendees at various trade shows, Dunk Star was ultimately shelved for unknown reasons.  Gameplay  Gameplay screenshot from the revealed beta build. Dunk Star is a five-on-five street basketball game reminiscent of Ultimate Basketball, where players take control of any of the available teams to participate in a series of matches with either AI-controlled opponents or against other players. Though similar to other realistic basketball in terms of playability and controls, the game provides a faster pace. During gameplay, players can pass, jump, shoot and dunk to score points. Players can switch between both characters on their team when using an AI teammate. When performing a dunk, the game zooms in to provide a dramatic angle to the shot. A game over occurs once the timer runs out and the player with the highest score wins the match unless players insert more credits into the arcade machine to continue playing.  Development  Dunk Star was the first project to be developed by Sammy for the Neo Geo and would have been the first basketball release for the platforms. Although its production number during development remains unknown, it is generally believed to be assigned with the number 28. The game was first showcased publicly in a playable state to attendees of the Summer Consumer Electronics Show on June 1991 at SNK's booth alongside other then-upcoming titles for the Neo Geo such as Blue's Journey by Alpha Denshi and Legend of Success Joe by Wave Corporation, among others displayed at the showfloor. The title was also showcased at the AOU Show, Amusement & Music Operators Association Show (AMOA) and Amusement Machine Show events held on the same year respectively. Despite Dunk Star being previewed in magazines such as Gamest and demoed across various trade shows, it was ultimately shelved for unknown reasons, however several possible factors have been given as to why the title was never released in recent years, though Sammy would later publish a game called Super Dunk Star for the Super Famicom on April 28, 1993 in Japan, sharing various similarities with the unreleased title. The only known gameplay footage of the project was featured on a 1996 VHS tape sent to subscribers of the Neo Geo DHP mailing list called Neo Geo Collector's Tape. In 2002, an official promotional flyer of the game that was printed for arcade distributors and operators on January 1991 was discovered. Between 2002 and 2005, emulated screenshots from a prototype cartridge also surfaced online, indicating that the ROM image of the game has been preserved but not made widely available to public.

It was named after Captain Robert E. Lee, who as 1st Lieutenant had performed a particularly courageous mission on November 17, 1944 (General Order October 11, 1956), even though it was often assumed that it was named after the most successful general of the Confederate Army Robert Edward Lee (which would have been politically completely incorrect). Today, large parts of the Mainz-Gonsenheim district are located on the property. History The construction of the barracks was begun after the remilitarization of the Rhineland (1936) in 1937/38 in the course of the German re-armament in the demilitarized zone established by the peace treaty of Versailles for the security of France and named after Hugo von Kathen, the last military governor of the fortress of Mainz. Responsible was the Wehrkreisverwaltung XII in Wiesbaden, which ran the process together with Robert Barth, the National Socialist mayor of Mainz. The 29-hectare site (PDF; 2,9 MB), Herausgeber + Redaktion: Stadt Mainz, gzm- Grafisches Zentrum B√∂dige und Partner, 2003, S. 11. belonged partially to the Mombach district and partly to the Gonsenheim district. Mombach had already been incorporated to Mainz in 1907, and in 1937 the then independent community of Gonsenheim was faced with the choice of either paying the development costs for the garrison's new barracks or being incorporated. \\"Gonsenheim new developments, close to the city limits and thus far from the town centre, would have to be supplied with electricity, gas and water from Mainz.\\" On April 1, 1938, the city of Mainz incorporated the site by enforcement. The completed barracks were occupied by the Field Artillery Regiment 72. A commemorative plaque on the officer's building commemorates the foot artillery regiment \\"General- Feldzeugmeister\\" (Brandenburg's) No. 3. In the course of the bombing of Mainz in World War II, the area was bombed several times during the following war. On March 22, 1945 the war was over for Mainz, American troops had the city under control. With the city commander Louis Th√©odore Kleinmann, the French occupying power took over the city on July 9. In the same month, the Reichsbauamt Mainz was commissioned by the French administration to repair the Kathen barracks. After the repair, the French military authorities took over the barracks and named it after General Charles Mangin, who after the First World War was commander-in-chief of the French occupying army on the Rhine based in Mainz. Even today, the lettering \\"Caserne Mangin\\" on the main gate reminds us of the name. Gottfried Lenzen, the director of the military construction office in Mainz, was entrusted with the execution of the construction tasks for the occupying troops. In 1949, US armed forces took over the Kathen barracks, which was subsequently given the name \\"Lee Barracks\\". American soldiers, their families and their housing estates, NCO Club, ballpark, Bowling Alley and the Panzerwerk on the border to Mombach shaped the Gonsenheim townscape for the next decades. The Mainz Sand Dunes were again used for military exercises. With the fall of communism in the cause of the Peaceful Revolution in the GDR in 1989, the need for large units of mechanized forces in Germany no longer existed. The 8th US Infantry Division was needed during Operation Desert Shield / Desert Storm and large parts, including the Ready First Combat Team, were deployed in the Middle East.Summary History of the 8th Infantry Divisionoccupancy of Lee Barracks within 8. US-Infanteriedivision The 8th US Infantry Division was inactivated at a solemn ceremony in Bad Kreuznach on 17 January 1992, and the American contingent withdrew from Mainz. The area became a conversion area.  Present  A district of Gonsenheim was built on the site, whereby some buildings of the barracks were renovated and rebuilt. In 1993, the former officer's building at Canisiusstra√üe 27-31 in Gonsenheim was converted into a 220-room student residence of the Studierendenwerk Mainz. After the dormitory premises and buildings were sold to a housing association, the student residence was dissolved and vacated in mid-2011. During the first construction phase, a project community with several property developers - including Wohnbau Mainz - built around 800 residential units in which almost 2000 people live. Most of the buildings were multi-family and terraced houses. An approximately 2.3 ha large district park at Willy-Brandt-Platz, the former drill ground, was laid out as the green centre of the residential area. More than 200 apartments with a total living space of over 16,300 m¬≤ were built in the preserved buildings of the former Kathen barracks. The Federal Network Agency has settled in the southern section of the conversion area. The first auction of the UMTS licences took place there in 2000 with proceeds of 50 billion euros. due to their outward appearance the garrison buildings to the north of Canisiusstra√üe characterise the urban character of this area and were placed under protection in 1998 as \\"cityscape-defining\\". The axially symmetrical ensemble with uniform building heights and identical roof pitches in a curved arrangement along the street forms an urban unit worth preserving. The streets in the former barracks that gave their names to the National Socialists today form a strong contrast to their former names after Kathen: Maria Sibylla Merian, Sophie Grosch (1874-1962), Hans Brantzen (1912-1979), Agnes Karll, Willy Brandt, Michael Forestier (1880-1951) or the mayor Franz Ludwig Alexander, negotiator with Karl K√ºlb for a \\"peaceful\\" incorporation of Gonsenheim in 1928 and last mayor of the independent community of Gonsenheim.

Corrado is an American economist who was the former chief of industrial output at the Federal Reserve Board and currently serves as a senior advisor and research director in economics on The Conference Board. She serves as a member of the executive committee for the National Bureau of Economic Research's (NBER) conference on research on income and wealth. She is a senior policy scholar at Georgetown University McDonough School of Business Centre for Business and Public Policy where she focuses on economics of growth and innovation as well as fiscal and monetary policies. In addition to these positions, Corrado is involved with the American Statistical Association as well as the Technical Advisory Committee of the Bureau of Labor Statistics. With the American Statistical Association Corrado serves as the chair-elect of Business and Economics.  Education  Carol Corrado attended Hershey High School in Hershey, Pennsylvania before she began her undergraduate degree in 1965 at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh, where she received a B.S. in Management Science in 1969. After her time at Carnegie Mellon, Corrado began her PhD in 1970 at the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia, where in 1976 she obtained a PhD in Economics.  Research  Corrado's research focuses on macroeconomic issues in the United States, China, Europe and Japan. She focuses her research on intangible assets, innovation and economic growth where she has authored an extensive portfolio of papers. Much of her research addresses the changing digital economy and the role that information and communication technology (ICT) has had on economic and productivity growth. Further, a large portion of her work with The Conference Board has been on the topic of the knowledge economy and the role of intangible assets in driving innovation and growth on both the microeconomic and macroeconomic level.  \\"Intangible Capital and U.S. Economic Growth\\"  Corrado's paper \\"Intangible Capital and U.S. Economic Growth\\" that she co-authored with Charles Hulten and Daniel Sichel analyzes the exclusion of intangible investment from calculated GDP and the impact it has on measured economic growth. They point out how accounting practices have lagged behind the \\"technological revolution\\" which has increased the level of intangible investment in the United States economy. Subsequently, modern accounting measures omit a large percentage of actual GDP in their calculated measure. By including intangibles in their measure Corrado, Hulten and Sichel find that over \\"$3 trillion of business intangible capital stock\\" has been left out of calculated GDP measures and lead to inaccurate representations of the United States economic growth. Since being published in 2009 Intangible Capital and U.S. Economic Growth has received considerable international recognition, winning the Kendricks Prize and being cited in Businessweek, the Economist, and the New York Times.  \\"Improving GDP: Demolishing, Repointing or Extending?*\\"  Corrado's Indigo Prize winning paper \\"Improving GDP: Demolishing, Repointing or Extending?*\\" considers the GDP measure and its validity as a measurement of the modern economy which has significantly changed since the introduction of the GDP measure. Corrado offers a modern re-evaluation of the measure proposing that it should \\"measure intangible and environmental capital, to quality-adjust prices, to run online experiments on willingness-to-pay for free goods\\" along with \\"extending GDP to measure economic well-being better: using some of the components of GDP such as consumption, along with leisure and measures of security\\" to accurately represent the transformed modern economy. She points out that the current measure is susceptible to double counting and does not account for necessary market weights which is currently measured by prices. To fix this Corrado recommends that we need to \\"repoint\\" GDP to account for prices that are \\"quality-adjusted\\" in the rapidly expanding \\"knowledge economy\\" which is experiencing a digital paradigm. The digitization of the \\"knowledge economy\\" is leading to an increase in non-market activities that are not accounted for in the current GDP measure as it strictly measures market production. Thus a reappointed GDP measure needs to redefine and reestablish the \\"boundary line\\" between non-market and market production that has become increasingly blurred by digitization.  \\"Innovation and intangible investment in Europe, Japan, and the United States\\"  \\"Innovation and intangible investment in Europe, Japan, and the United States\\" measures innovation by analyzing intangible investment and its relation with information and communication technology, spillovers, and policy. Corrado's paper examines the various perspective of innovation by providing a clear understanding of the diverse approaches to innovation. She points out that many believe innovation in EU countries is decreasing and more innovation is necessary in order to fix destabilized economies. Corrado addresses these beliefs by breaking down what exactly innovation is and how can it be measured as well as observing the role and value of policy in innovation. She finds that current measures of innovation are too ambiguous and are in need of additional measures that together form a more complete framework. She notes that innovation has largely shifted from being tangible to intangible, a reality important to consider when analyzing modern growth and innovation. As a result, she proposes a new model of measurement that takes into account intangible investment within the framework of computerized information, innovative property, and economic competencies in addition to the already measured intangibles of research and development, and software. From this measurement Corrado finds that in the United States intangible capital accounts for half of their total capital deepening where as in the EU countries it only accounts for 23.8%. Subsequently, she points out that all variables which mediate the monetization of countries investment in knowledge will be imperative factors contributing to the future growth and innovation in EU countries.  Book  In 2005 Corrado along with John Haltiwanger and Daniel Sichel released the book Measuring Capital in the New Economy. The book examines how technology has altered the U.S. economy, increasing the role of intangible assets and technology investment. They propose a variety of new approaches and necessary factors that should be included in calculations of capital in order to create more accurate measures of capital in the changing economy. * Corrado, C., Haltiwanger, J.C., & Sichel, D.E.

The block, launched in 2017, airs Christmas-themed television specials and feature films from late November through December. Its primary direct competition is the more established 25 Days of Christmas on Freeform, on which much of the same programming had previously aired prior to 2017. The two blocks continue to share rights to three films, with each network getting a window to air each film: the 1994 remake of Miracle on 34th Street, Mrs. Doubtfire and Love the Coopers. In contrast to 25 Days of Christmas, Best Christmas Ever airs no original programming, relying entirely on reruns. History AMC had typically aired a rotating lineup of five to six Christmas movies during the holiday season. In 2017, the channel introduced a more extensive holiday lineup branded as Best Christmas Ever, running from November 26 to December 25, featuring a mix of popular Christmas and family films, along with other acquired specials. The schedule included notable acquisitions from Warner Bros., including Elf, National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation, The Polar Express, and 12 Rankin/Bass specials. The films had been recent mainstays of the 25 Days of Christmas schedule, with Elf in particular having received extensive airplay and high viewership during the event. Other programs included specials from DreamWorks Animation. As expected, AMC saw ratings gains over the holiday season; primetime viewership for the first two weeks of the event was up 40% year-over-year, airings of Elf and Christmas Vacation both peaked at 1.5 million viewers, and average viewership of feature films on Freeform fell by 36% year-over-year in the same period. In 2019, Freeform responded to the loss of most of the Rankin/Bass library by acquiring cable rights to the two remaining specials from that company that had never been aired on cable: Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer and Frosty the Snowman, sharing the rights with those two specials' longtime free- to-air rightsholder, CBS.https://www.wdtvpress.com/freeform/2019upfront/press- releases/ Programming As of 2019: Specials *Donkey's Caroling Christmas-tacular *The First Christmas: The Story of the First Christmas Snow *Frosty's Winter Wonderland *Grandma Got Run Over by a Reindeer *How Murray Saved Christmas *Jack Frost (1979) *The Leprechaun's Christmas Gold *The Life and Adventures of Santa Claus *The Little Drummer Boy Book II *The Madagascar Penguins in a Christmas Caper *Merry Madagascar *Michael Bubl√©'s Christmas in Hollywood *Nestor, the Long-Eared Christmas Donkey *Pinocchio's Christmas *Rudolph's Shiny New Year *'Twas the Night Before Christmas (1974) *The Year Without a Santa Claus Series *The Great Christmas Light Fight (shared with CMT and Buzzr) Films *12 Dogs of Christmas: Great Puppy Rescue *All I Want for Christmas *All I Want for Christmas Is You *Annie *Beethoven's Christmas Adventure *Charlie and the Chocolate Factory *Christmas in Connecticut (both the 1945 and 1992 versions) *A Christmas Story 2 *Christmas with the Kranks *A Dennis the Menace Christmas *Elf *Ernest Saves Christmas *Four Christmases *Fred Claus *Happy Feet *Holly and Hal Moose: Our Uplifting Christmas Adventure *A Holiday to Remember *Ice Age *Jack Frost (1998 film) *Kung Fu Panda *Last Holiday (2006 version) *The Legend of Frosty the Snowman *Love the Coopers (shared with Freeform) *Miracle on 34th Street (1994 version, shared with Freeform) *A Miracle on Christmas Lake *Mrs. Doubtfire (shared with Freeform) *Nanny McPhee *National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation *The Nativity Story *Planes, Trains & Automobiles *The Polar Express *Rudolph and Frosty's Christmas in July *Samantha: An American Girl Holiday *Scoot & Kassie's Christmas Adventure *Scooby-Doo *Scooby-Doo 2: Monsters Unleashed *Snow Day *The Sons of Mistletoe *To Grandmother's House We Go *A Very Harold & Kumar 3D Christmas *White Christmas *Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory *Wish for Christmas References External links *Best Christmas Ever 2019 list Category:AMC (TV channel) original programming Category:Christmas television specials Category:Annual television shows Category:Television programming blocks in the United States Category:Recurring events established in 2018 Category:2018 American television series debuts ","title":"Best Christmas Ever (TV programming block)"},{"id":"62422694","text":"Isaac Froimovich (21 December 1918 - April 1988) was a Chilean water polo player.

It is running in the 2020 General Elections on an anti- colonialism platform, proposing a constitutional assembly to determine a final decision regarding the relationship between the United States and Puerto Rico. History It was founded on March 11, 2019, by a group of veteran politicians and others with the goal of fighting corruption and restoring Puerto Rico's governmental institutions; promoting social, economic, and fiscal reconstruction; and decolonization of Puerto Rico. MVC also calls for a constitutional assembly to reach a final decision on the political status of Puerto Rico. Though members of the party have historically supported the independence movement, MVC would have the assembly choose a decolonization plan that results in statehood, full independence, or a free association status with the United States. The 2019 Telegramgate scandal that engulfed the ruling New Progressive Party helped sharpen the focus of the MVC on government reform.

Perrett served aboard the troop transport USS Bayfield, commanding one of her landing craft, during the invasion of Normandy, and invasions in the Pacific Ocean, including the Invasion of Iwo Jima and the Invasion of Okinawa. Perrett was able to complete the landing of two sets of troops on Utah Beach, at Normandy. After landing his troops at Iwo Jima his landing craft shipped water, and was swamped, and was abandoned. He and his small crew spent the rest of their day on the beach, finally getting a return to his ship around midnight. At Okinawa his landing craft was involved in a series of feints, proceeding close to several beaches, but then withdrawing, without landing. Following the war Perrett's oral history of his wartime experience was widely distributed, and he was a frequent speaker. Legacy Interviews with Perrett appeared in multiple documentary films. The Imperial War Museum, in London, had an exhibit focussed around Perrett, his landing craft, PA 33-21, based on his oral history. Perrett gave a demonstration of piloting a recreation of his landing craft, on Lake Pontchartrain, a week prior to his death in 2007. Higgins boats, the manufacturer of Perrett's original landing craft, built a reproduction, in 2009, that it named the Marvin Perrett. In 2010, Charles \\"Skip\\" W. Bowen, who was then the Coast Guard's most senior non-commissioned officer, proposed that all the cutters in the should be named after enlisted sailors in the Coast Guard, or one of its precursor services, who were recognized for their heroism.

The group, also called the YAMS Collective, was formed to bring a digital media piece titled Good Stock on the Dimension Floor: An Opera to the 2014 Whitney Biennial exhibition at the Whitney Museum of American Art. Whitney Biennial The Whitney Biennial of contemporary art is an invitation-only exhibition which generally favors young artists and in the past helped bring greater recognition to artists like Georgia O‚ÄôKeeffe, Jackson Pollock and Jeff Koons. The Whitney Museum bills the event as: \\"...the longest-running survey of American art, and ...a hallmark of the Museum since 1932.\\" The Biennial has often faced criticism over issues of privilege, access and inclusivity. The 2014 edition was especially controversial for many issues, including the Yams Collective. Yams Collective The group started after one of the initial curation visits for the 2014 edition of the Biennial. One of the Biennial's co-curators, Michelle Grabner, had visited Sienna Shields in her studio and seen a short video loop the artist had made with friends dancing in front of glaciers in Alaska. Shields organized the Yams Collective (short for HowDoYouSayYaminAfrican?) of 38 international mostly black and queer musicians, poets, actors, writers and visual artists to create a digital film about racial identity for the 2014 edition. Shields in part organized the collective to address representation in the New York art scene: \\"I‚Äôd go to art events, and I‚Äôd be the only black person in the room ‚Äî here in New York. It was ridiculous.\\" This became the instigation for the collective's submission, a 53-minute digital piece in 35 parts titled Good Stock on the Dimension Floor: An Opera. This participation was seen by the collective as an \\"infiltration\\" of the institutional art world and the very size of the collective was meant partly as a protest against tokenism. Donelle Woolford controversy Despite the collective's diverse membership, one of only two individual black female artists invited that year was \\"Donelle Woolford\\", a creation of Joe Scanlan. Scanlan, a white, male, Princeton University professor hired a succession of actresses to play \\"Woolford\\" at events. The inclusion of this \\"fake\\" artist led the Yams Collective to withdraw their submission,objecting to \\"Woolford's\\" inclusion in a show alongside their work. Shields explained the withdrawal was due to not only Scanlan but also:\\"...the history of the Whitney and its lack of any kind of initiative in changing its white supremacist attitudes.\\" The collective also considered the inclusion of Scanlan to be a reflection of larger issues of racism in the elite art world. The film instead premiered at the Trinidad and Tobago Film Festival.

The worldview presupposes the idea that Greeks were somehow unique in world history and that Greek civilization essentially emerged from within itself. Nonetheless such premises have begun frequently to be questioned recently. Meanings Hatoon al-Fassi holds that hellenocentrism 'is a vision of history that views the Greek world as the centre of the civilised universe.' Werner Jaeger uses the term 'hellenocentric' to illustrate the Greek influence on the progress of present European culture. He argues that European history should always begin with Greece, where, he believes, the West belongs, both 'physically and intellectually'. Greece is where Europe should always return to because it is the 'hellenocentric world' that possesses 'the ideal‚Äô and because, for Europe, both the temporal and spiritual journey begins there. According to Nasos Vayenas, hellenocentrism can be understood as 'a conviction of the uniqueness of the Greek element and its superiority over everything foreign ‚Äìa conviction that usually leads elevating Greekness to the level of an absolute value'. Vayenas argues that it is rather a traditionalism that speaks of the discovery of a ‚Äòsilenced Greek tradition'. Heinrich von Staden defines hellenocentrism as the 'privilege' historians of science oftentimes confer upon 'the Greek science over the science of other ancient cultures.' He accuses Eurocentric historians of adopting a version of science that 'allows them to credit the Greeks with the invention of science and of 'the' scientific method'. In Enrique Dussel's view, hellenocentrism asserts that Greece is where lies the cultural origin of the West and that Greek civilization 'owes nothing to the Egyptians and Semites', while, he argues, Greece was no more than a 'dependent' and 'peripheral Western part' of the Middle East. Implications Lidewijde de Jong maintains that hellenocentrism is deeply rooted in European history and archaeology. Peter Green argues that it has 'distorted and diminished the achievements of any civilisation' that came in contact with the Greeks and, of course, young Macedonians. Han Lamers argues that proponents of a hellenocentric worldview, like George Trapezuntius, tried to 'reduce all forms of progress and decline ultimately to Greek affairs'. Enrique Dussel held that hellenocentrism is the forefather of Eurocentrism.Enrique Dussel, Politics of Liberation: A Critical World History Translated by Thia Cooper (SCM press, 2011) p.11 \\"Here we have to stop to note one aspect. As we indicated, Hellenocentrism is the father of Eurocentrism.\\" In the same way, Markus Winkler argues, racism and colonialism have their roots in Eurocentric worldview which essentially emerged from ancient hellenocentrism. Kang Jung In and Eom Kwanyong also refer to hellenocentrism as the archetype of 'Westcentrism' which, they argue, has adopted the Greek civilization as its 'intellectual origin' and universalized it. Similarly, Sabelo Ndlovu-Gatsheni argues that hellenocentrism paved the way for 'Westernization' as a 'process of imposing Euro-North American-centric values on other people' at the expense of their own values.

It is a counterpart to the 49-Mile Scenic Drive. In 2019, Peter Hartlaub and Heather Knight wrote a series of articles for the San Francisco Chronicle about a proposed new scenic route. They started by doing the existing Scenic Drive via a variety of non- car modes of transport on September 4, 2019, to figure out what works and what doesn't when one is not driving. After more research and debate, they published a new route on November 15, 2019. Route description While the Scenic Drive starts at City Hall, the Scenic Route starts at the San Francisco Chronicle building, 5th and Mission. Like the Drive, the Route proceeds counter-clockwise around the city. From 5th and Mission, go northwest on 5th to Market Street. Southwest on Market to Fulton, then west past the Pioneer Monument to Larkin. North on Larkin, skirting Civic Center, to Post. East on Post to Grant, then north on Grant through the Dragon Gate at the entrance to Chinatown. At California turn west and proceed to Mason. East on Washington, one block south on Powell, then east on Clay through the heart of Chinatown. At Kearny turn north, and angle left on Columbus. North on Grant again through North Beach. West on Lombard, and north on Mason all the way to the Bay at Jefferson Street. Take Jefferson west through Fisherman's Wharf to Hyde, south one block to the cable car turntable, then west on Beach past Ghirardelli Square. From Beach you wiggle south on Larkin, west on North Beach, south on Polk, then west on Bay along the edge of Fort Mason. North on Laguna and west on Beach, then take Marina Boulevard alongside Marina Green. Zig-zag through the Marina district by going south on Scott, west on Beach (check out the Palace of Fine Arts), south on Baker, east on Bay, south on Divisadero, and west on Chestnut. At the end of Chestnut turn south on Lyon for a block and then enter the Presidio at the Lombard Gate. A path takes you past Lucasfilm's Letterman Digital Arts Center - look for the fountain with a life-sized statue of Yoda. Then follow Letterman Drive, Lincoln Boulevard, and Funston Avenue to Moraga Avenue. This takes you past the historic Presidio Officer's Club, one of the oldest buildings in San Francisco. Turn north on Montgomery Street between the Presidio Theater and the bowling alley, then west on Sheridan. This turns into Lincoln and takes you past the San Francisco National Cemetery. At Long Avenue you can optionally do an out-and-back to see Fort Point. Continue on Lincoln to the Golden Gate Overlook, which offers an excellent view of the Golden Gate Bridge. Across from the overlook find Ralston Avenue. South on Ralston to Greenough, Kobbe, and Harrison, which takes you to Washington Boulevard. There's another nice overlook here called Immigrant Point. Washington winds south and east along the high ridgeline of the Presidio, turns into Arguello, and exits the Presidio at Arguello Gate. A block down from the gate you can do a little spite-detour through Presidio Terrace, a privately owned loop road lined with mansions. Then go another block south to Lake Street. West on Lake to 8th Avenue, south two blocks to Clement, east through a nice retail district to Arguello again, then south to Golden Gate Park. Pedal boats for rent at the Stow Lake Boathouse Conservatory Drive West and John F. Kennedy Drive loop around the Conservatory of Flowers. Turn south on Nancy Pelosi Drive, past the AIDS Memorial Grove, to Martin Luther King Jr. Drive. Go northwest a bit, then turn right onto Music Concourse Drive. This loops past the Academy of Sciences the de Young Museum, and the Japanese Tea Garden, then back to MLK. A path along the west side of the Tea Garden takes you up a hill to Stow Lake. Follow Stow Lake Drive to the Boathouse, then down to John F. Kennedy Drive again. JFK takes you west past Lloyd Lake and Spreckels Lake, then turn north and exit the park via 36th Avenue. Take 36th north to Balboa, then turn west and enjoy another very interesting retail district including the classic Balboa Theater. At 46th turn north, then turn left on Point Lobos Avenue which descends past the Sutro Baths ruins and Cliff House, then turns into the Great Highway. There's a path next to the highway, or you can walk on the beach. Go south a couple miles to Taraval, then turn east. At 33rd Avenue turn south. Find the entrance to Pine Lake / Stern Grove park, then go east through the park all the way to 19th Avenue. Beep's Burgers Go a block south on 19th (carefully, there's a lot of traffic), then turn southeast on Ocean. At Cerritos Avenue turn right, left on Moncada Way, veer left onto Urbano Drive, right on Borica Street, then immediately right again onto Entrada Court. This takes you to the 28-foot-tall Urbano Sundial. Go out the other leg of Entrada Court back to Borica, then continue south to Holloway Avenue and turn east.

The civilians had formed an Islamist commune, which developed tensions with local residents and authorities. Background In late 1988 and early 1989, an Islamist group which called themselves the Jama'ah Mujahiddin Fisabilillah established a commune in the transmigrant hamlet of Talangsari III, in Lampung, where they had established themselves under Warsidi, a local quran teacher. Before long, tensions developed between the residents of the hamlet and the Islamists, resulting in some of the locals fleeing due to perceived threats. The issue was brought up to higher local authorities, who after a meeting with the commune passed it on to the local military garrison commander, Captain Soetiman. Following an initial arrest of several of the commune's members, Soetiman led a group of soldiers and officers to the commune on 6 February, where they were ambushed and Soetiman was killed. Some members of the commune later attempted to disperse across Lampung, killing another soldier whom they met by chance in the process that day. Incident A military detachment consisting of three platoons from the Indonesian Army and a platoon of the Mobile Brigade Corps under then-colonel Hendropriyono was dispatched to the village. According to Hendropriyono's accounts, yet another soldier and a civilian had been killed by the group, in addition to another soldier being seriously injured. According to reports from the human rights organization KontraS, the soldiers - who were equipped with napalm bombs and helicopters - did not give any warnings before storming the village, and forced a young member of the commune to set fire to some of the huts with many still trapped inside. Survivors were then imprisoned. Hendropriyono's account of the situation claimed that some members of the commune had deliberately set fire to the huts and prevented civilians from escaping. Casualties Initial media reporting in the immediate aftermath of the events reported 27 deaths, which KontraS verified in its 2005 investigation, though it also stated that 78 persons were made to \\"forcefully disappear\\", in addition to 23 being arrested without cause, 25 being given an unfair trial, and 24 being evicted. Later reporting after the fall of Suharto tended to claim a higher death toll, with the Gatra weekly claiming 246 deaths in 1998. A 2008 inquiry by the National Commission on Human Rights reported that 130 were killed, 50 were detained and tortured, and 77 were evicted. Aftermath Two days after the attacks, the dispersed commune members who received news of the incident stormed a military base, injuring several soldiers with six commune members killed. 15 arrested members of the commune were released in 1999, following an amnesty by B.J. Habibie. Following the inauguration of Joko Widodo in 2014, victims - who claimed to not be members of the commune but were affected by the fighting - called for him to pressure Hendropriyono (who had become the Presidential Adviser) to \\"reveal the truth about the incident\\". In February 2019, 30 years after the incident, a \\"declaration of peace\\" regarding was held, which involved officials and military officers, alongside current residents of Talangsari. Victims of the incident decried the declaration, claiming that no victims were involved in it.

She is the co-founder and CEO of multiple organisations which have been noted for large expenditures on digital advertising in preparation for the 2020 United States presidential election, including the political organisation Acronym, the company Lockwood Strategy, and the media company Courier Newsroom. She was the director of the advertising branch of Priorities USA Action, which was the primary super PAC supporting Hillary Clinton's 2016 presidential campaign, and was a digital producer for the re-election campaign of Barack Obama. Previously, she was the press secretary for United States Senator Jack Reed. Journalism McGowan began her career as a journalist, working on the CBS program 60 Minutes. After covering the Barack Obama 2008 presidential campaign, she left journalism to become the press secretary for Jack Reed, a United States Senator from Rhode Island. During the 2012 United States presidential election, McGowan was a digital producer for Barack Obama's re-election campaign. In 2016, McGowan directed the $42 million digital advertising branch of Priorities USA Action, the primary super PAC supporting Hillary Clinton's 2016 presidential campaign. It was the largest ever ad campaign by the PAC. Digital advertising In 2017, McGowan launched the political strategy firm Lockwood Strategy, which Campaigns and Elections magazine identified as a crucial force in Democratic Party victories in the 2017 Virginia elections. Shortly after founding Lockwood Strategy, McGowan co- founded the digital advertising organisation Acronym together with Michael Dubin and with Laurene Powell Jobs and Reid Hoffman's financial backing. Within just over a year, Acronym had raised tens of millions of dollars for digital advertising campaigns, running more than 100 ad campaigns and registering 60,000 voters. One of McGowan's projects, called Courier Newsroom, is a for-profit media company that produces digital newspapers in Arizona, Michigan, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Virginia, and Wisconsin, with the aim of filling news deserts in swing states by providing regional news coverage from a left-wing perspective. McGowan's goal of creating a partisan online newsroom is partly intended to combat online fake news, which led The New Yorker to label McGowan \\"a starry-eyed techno-utopian\\" for her stated belief that digital information is the most effective way to combat digital misinformation. McGowan has been credited with significant innovations in digital political strategy, and has often been described as one of the few progressive strategists to focus specifically on digital media. Joshua Green, writing for Bloomberg News, wrote that McGowan has \\"gained notoriety for her outspoken criticism of her party's inability to challenge, or even clearly comprehend, Trump's dominance of the digital landscape\\". Similarly, Ozy magazine called her \\"The Democrats' most dangerous digital strategist\\", with Nick Fouriezos writing that her efforts \\"will be one of the major forces shaping the Democrats' general-election fight against Donald Trump\\", and Politico referred to her as \\"one of the Democratic Party's most in-demand leaders this cycle\\". McGowan has also received awards for her work on digital campaigns: she was recognized as a 2018 Rising Star by Campaigns and Elections magazine, and was listed as a \\"Name to know\\" by Politico. Her work on digital advertising is regularly cited in publications like The New York Times, The Atlantic, and Axios, and her views on digital strategy are frequently quoted in news stories regarding digital advertising campaigns by outlets like The Washington Post, NBC News, and The Hill. Personal life McGowan is married to Michael Halle, a political consultant who has worked as a lead organizer in Iowa for Hillary Clinton and as a senior strategist for Pete Buttigieg. In the 2020 election cycle, McGowan supported Pete Buttigieg and opposed Bernie Sanders.

(2005). Evaluating Five Factor Theory and social investment perspectives on personality trait development. Journal of Research in Personality, 39(1), pp. 166-184. For instance, young adults may undertake efforts to be \\"more socially dominant, agreeable, conscientious, and less neurotic\\"Cf. Roberts, Wood & Smith (2005). Ibid, p. 174. in order to establish their careers or families; in so far as society rewards these efforts, the related personality traits are re-inforced. Since the late 1990s, there has been substantial scientific evidence that personality traits continue to change after childhood, especially during young adulthood.Helson, R. et al. (2002). The growing evidence for personality change in adulthood: Findings from research with personality inventories. Journal of Research in Personality, 36, pp. 287-306. Generally, personality traits converge towards more agreeableness, conscientiousnees, and emotional stability. Several theories - social investment theory, Five Factor Theory, etc. - have emerged to explain these changes. Social investment theory argues that such changes in personality traits is due to the establishment of individuals' own social lives into which they invest (social investment principle). This perspective assumes the development of identities through psychological commitments to social institutions in the form of social roles, which offer rewards (and foster expectations of rewards) for displaying \\"adult\\" personality traits, which - through reinforcement - promote durable changes in personality traits. Since the emergence of social investment theory, it has received support through cross-cultural studiesBleidorn, W. et al. (2013). Personality Maturation Around the World: A Cross-Cultural Examination of Social Investment Theory. Psychological Science, 24(12), pp. 2530-2540. and studies of first long-term romantic relationships,Lehnart, J., Neyer, F.J., Eccles, J. (2010). Long-Term Effects of Social Investment: The Case of Partnering in Young Adulthood.

The other researchers are Danuta Czech (former deputy director of the museum), Tadeusz Iwaszko, Stanis≈Çaw K≈Çodzi≈Ñski, Helena Kubica, Aleksander Lasik, Piotr Setkiewicz, Irena Strzelecka, Andrzej Strzelecki, and Henryk ≈öwiebocki. Several of the contributors, including D≈Çugoborski, were themselves prisoners in Auschwitz or had family members there. The concept of the work was first discussed by the museum in 1979. The research is based on the State Museum Archives, which include 30,000 images; 15 metres of shelves of records from the camp's construction department (Bauleitung); and another 15 metres of documents from the camp itself, such as SS personnel files, 70,000 death certificates, watch books, letters from prisoners written inside the camp, telegrams about escapes, punishment books, and the daily roll call.Piper, Franciszek (2000). \\"Introduction\\".

Irving Greenberg, then chair of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum, described the work in 2001 as \\"by far the most comprehensive in its detail and level of source material\\". Reviewing it for Yad Vashem Studies, Joachim Neander noted \\"the authors' deep empathy with the victims\\" and called it \\"an academically solid compendium\\". Peter Hayes, writing in Holocaust and Genocide Studies, regarded the chapters as poorly organized, making it more suitable as a reference work than a readable history. He highlighted volume III by Franciszek Piper as \\"a masterful account\\" of the death toll.Hayes, Peter (2003). \\"Auschwitz, Capital of the Holocaust\\".

Her research considers computer vision and machine learning. She was one of the leaders of the ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition challenge and has been recognised by MIT Technology Review as one of the world's top young innovators.  Early life and education  Russakovsky studied mathematics at Stanford University and remained there for her doctoral studies. When she finished her undergraduate degree she had dismissed computer science and felt disconnected from research and the only woman in her laboratory. Then Fei-Fei Li arrived at Stanford. Russakovsky eventually completed her PhD in computer vision in 2015, during which she worked with Fei-Fei Li on image classification. She developed an algorithm that could separate selected objects from the background, which made her acutely aware of human bias. She worked on mechanisms to reduce the burden of image classification on human annotators, by asking fewer, and more generalised, questions about the images being inspected. Together with Fei-Fei Li, Russakovsky developed ImageNet, a database of millions of images that is now widely used in computer vision. She was a postdoctoral research fellow at Carnegie Mellon University.  Research and career  Russakovsky works on computer vision and machine learning. She is an Assistant Professor of Computer Science at Princeton University. Her research has considered the historical and societal bias within visual recognition and the development of computational solutions that promote algorithmic fairness. For example, in 2015, a new photo identification application developed by Google labeled a black couple as \\"gorillas\\". At the time only 2% of their workforce were African American. Russakovsky has emphasised that whilst the workforces designing artificial intelligence systems are not diverse enough, only improving the diversity of computer scientists will not be sufficient for rectifying algorithmic bias. Instead, she has involved training deep learning models that de-correlate protected characteristics such as race or gender. In 2019 she was awarded a Schmidt DaraX grant to study accuracy in image captioning systems.  Public engagement  Russakovsky has been involved in several initiatives to improve access to computer science and public understanding of artificial intelligence. She serves on the board of AI4ALL foundation, which looks to improve diversity in artificial intelligence. As part of AI4ALL Russakovsky led a summer camp for high school girls. She ran the first summer camp in 2015, named the Stanford Artificial Intelligence Laboratory's Outreach Summer Program (SAILORS). By 2018 it had expanded into six other US campuses. She has launched similar initiatives at Princeton University. The summer camp looks to keep bias out of artificial intelligence by educating people from diverse backgrounds about computer science, machine learning and policy. One of the 2019 camp attendees from Bergen County Academy was so inspired by the event she founded an artificial intelligence program when she returned to high school. Selected publications Russakovsky is the lead author of \\"Imagenet large scale visual recognition challenge,\\" which appeared in International Journal of Computer Vision in 2015. The paper describes the creation of a publicly available dataset of millions of images of everyday objects and scenes, and its use in an annual competition between the visual recognition algorithms of participating institutions. The paper discusses the challenges of creating such a large dataset, the developments in algorithmic object classification and detection that have resulted from the competition, and the current (at time of publication) state of the object recognition field. According to the journal website, the article has been cited over 5,000 times. According to Google Scholar, which includes citations of the pre-print of the article on arXiv, the article has been cited over 13,000 times in total. Russakovsky is the author of more than 20 other academic articles, six of which have been cited more than 100 times each, according to Google Scholar.  Awards and honours  Russakovsky's awards and honours include: * 2015 Foreign Policy 100 Leading Global Thinkers * 2016 PAMI Everingham Prize * 2017 MIT Technology Review 35 under 35 * 2020 Anita Borg Early Career Award (BECA) References External links * Category:20th- century births Category:Living people Category:Russian computer scientists Category:Stanford University alumni Category:Princeton University faculty Category:Artificial intelligence researchers Category:Year of birth missing (living people) Category:Place of birth missing (living people) ","title":"Olga Russakovsky"},{"id":"62423477","text":"Visions is the sixth LP by American country singer-songwriter Don Williams. Released on January 17, 1977 on the ABC-Dot label, the album reached number four on the US Country Albums chart. \\"Some Broken Hearts Never Mend\\" was released as a single in 1977, reaching number one on the Billboard country singles chart. Visions was the first of two Don Williams albums released in 1977, along with Country Boy, which was released later the same year.  Background  Don Williams had achieved his first number one country album the previous year with Harmony. For Visions, Williams was again at the writing and producing helm, and brought on many of the same musicians who'd participated in all of his previous recordings, including Kenny Malone on drums and Danny Flowers on harmonica. Regular writing collaborators Wayland Holyfield, Allen Reynolds and Bob McDill all made contributions to this album. While Visions was a solid bestseller, it did not have its predecessors chart success. However, along with Harmony and Country Boy, Visions is considered part of the trio of albums that marked the foundation of Williams' commercial and artistic success in the 1970s, both in the US and in the UK. ABC-Dot Records had made a concerted effort to market American country music abroad throughout the mid-1970's, and Williams' Visions was a notable bestseller overseas at the time, with an excess of 200,000 units moved. Williams' was also becoming well known during this time for his intimate live performances, which featured his regular collaborators, Danny Flowers on Harmonica and Guitars, and David Williamson on Bass.

The company was founded at Duke University and subsequently launched at other colleges and universities around the country. As of September 2020, ClassRanked is active at 350 universities and has over 500 million individual grade distributions. Company history Origins ClassRanked was conceived of at Duke University by Hayden Hall, Max Labaton, and Dilan Trivedi in their junior year. While registering for spring classes, they spent several hours scrolling through class descriptions, comparing professor reviews, and searching to fulfill academic requirements. Hall proposed building a site to streamline and automate this process. Over the next three months, Hall coded and developed a website that combined course evaluations, grade distribution data, and user reviews to offer students with comprehensive rankings of courses. Growth and expansion ClassRanked was initially launched at Duke University. Within its first two days, the site had generated over 5,000 page views. By the end of its first week, ClassRanked had over 1,200 user reviews and within a month was being actively used by over 80% of Duke‚Äôs student body. During the months to follow, the site shifted focus on expanding to other schools. By the end of August 2019, ClassRanked announced its expansion to University of Pennsylvania, UC Berkeley, UNC-Chapel Hill, and Emory University. As of September 2020, the company had expanded over 350 colleges and universities. Features The website provides ratings of classes at colleges and universities ranked by quality and difficulty. Students can find a list of the easiest classes within a particular major or that fulfill a specific graduation requirement. The site also offers reviews written by students and machine learning class recommendation functionality. In November 2019, the company announced it had added a new feature allowing students to upload course syllabi to view grade distribution breakdowns and required textbooks for potential classes.https://statenews.com/article/2020/10/asmsu-committees- oct-1?ct=content_open&cv;=cbox_latest ClassRanked also worked directly with colleges to gain grade distributions for classes. That data is integrated into course rankings and displayed with bar graphs so users can see comprehensive grade history for a class.

Members of Anchoromicrocotylinae differ from other Microcotylidae by the presence of a larval organ and larval hooks and the structure of the genital complex. Morphology Members of Anchoromicrocotylinae are characterized by a symmetric haptor, with a sharp end that bears three pairs of larval hooks. The digestive system includes two oral suckers with papillary borders, a pharynx and an esophagus. The male genital system includes numerous testes located behind the ovary (post-ovarian testes), a vas deferens and a complex male copulatory organ, composed of: a male atrium, a penis, and a prostate vesicle. The female genital system include a complex ovary, a genito-intestinal canal, an ootype, a uterus, and a single dorsal unarmed vagina.

Originally the regiment, like all Italian tank units, was part of the infantry, but on 1 June 1999 it became part of the cavalry. Operationally the regiment was last assigned to the Bersaglieri Brigade \\"Garibaldi\\".  History   World War II  The regiment was formed by the depot of the 31st Tank Infantry Regiment in Siena on 27 July 1941 as 131st Tank Infantry Regiment with three tank battalions formed by the 4th Tank Infantry Regiment. All three battalions were equipped with captured French tanks. The regiment was formed with the following structure: * 131st Tank Infantry Regiment ** CI Tank Battalion \\"R35\\" (captured French Renault R35 light tanks) ** CII Tank Battalion \\"R35\\" (captured French R35 light tanks) ** CC Tank Battalion \\"S35\\" (captured French SOMUA S35 tanks) On 15 August 1941 the regiment arrived in the Friuli region and joined the 131st Armored Division \\"Centauro\\", which already fielded the 31st Tank Infantry Regiment. On 25 December 1941 the regiment ceded the CC Tank Battalion \\"S35\\" to the XIII Army Corps on Sardinia. On 2 January 1942 the regiment left the Centauro division and moved to Sicily, where the regiment's CII Tank Battalion \\"R35\\" was assigned to the XII Army Corps defending the island's West, while the regiment's headquarter with the CI Tank Battalion \\"R35\\" joined the XVI Army Corps defending the island's South. In Sicily the regiment's two battalions and the companies of the CXXXIII Semovente Battalion \\"47/32\\" were split into small tactical groups. When the allied invasion of Sicily began on 9 July 1943 the CII Tank Battalion \\"R35\\" was annihilated by the American 3rd Infantry Division on 21 July north of Agrigento, while remnants of the CI Tank Battalion managed to retreat to Messina and from where they were evacuated to Calabria. On 1 September the remnants of the 131st Tank Infantry Regiment arrived in Siena to be reformed, but after Italy changed sides with the Armistice of Cassibile on 8 September 1943 the 131st Tank Infantry Regiment was disbanded by the Germans.  Cold War  On 1 January 1953 the Italian Army raised the CI Tank Battalion equipped M26 Pershing tanks in Pinerolo as an autonomous tank battalion of the III Army Corps. In October 1956 the battalion moved to Verona as a corps asset of the IV Army Corps. The battalion was disbanded on 31 December 1963 and its personnel contributed to the raising of the III Tank Battalion for the newly raised 32nd Tank Regiment. = 101st Tank Battalion \\"M.O. Zappal√†\\" = Coat of arms of the 101st Tank Battalion \\"M.O. Zappal√†\\" During the 1975 army reform the 31st Tank Regiment was disbanded on 21 October 1975 and its II Tank Battalion became the 101st Tank Battalion \\"M.O. Zappal√†\\", which received the war flag and traditions of the 131st Tank Infantry Regiment. The battalion's number commemorated the CI Tank Battalion \\"R35\\", which had served with the 131st regiment during the allied invasion of Sicily. Tank and armored battalions created during the 1975 army reform were all named for officers, soldiers and partisans, who were posthumously awarded Italy's highest military honor the Gold Medal of Military Valour during World War II. The 101st Tank Battalion's name commemorated the commander of the LI Tank Battalion \\"M14/41\\" Lieutenant Colonel Salvatore Zappal√†, who had been awarded three Silver Medals of Military Valour (2x World War I, 1x Invasion of Yugoslavia), one Bronze Medal of Military Valour (Spanish Civil War) and three War Crosses of Military Valor (Spanish Civil War, Second Italo-Ethiopian War, Greco-Italian War), and was awarded posthumously a Gold Medal of Military Valour after being fatally injured on 30 June 1942 near El Dabaa in Egypt during the Axis pursuit of the British Eighth Army after the Battle of Mersa Matruh. Based in Bellinzago Novarese and equipped with Leopard 1A2 main battle tanks the battalion joined the 31st Armored Brigade \\"Curtatone\\".  Recent times  With the end of the Cold War the Italian Army drew down its forces and on 31 July 1993 the 101st Tank Battalion \\"M.O. Zappal√†\\" and its personnel entered the 1st Tank Battalion \\"M.O. Cracco\\", which reformed on 1 September 1993 as 31st Tank Regiment. On the same day the 131st Tank Regiment was reformed in Persano in Southern Italy with the 31st Tank Battalion \\"M.O. Andreani\\" of the Armored Troops School as its only battalion. The 131st Tank Regiment joined the Bersaglieri Brigade \\"Garibaldi\\" and in 2008 retired the army's last Leopard 1A5 main battle tanks after receiving new Ariete main battle tanks. On 11 July 2013 the 131st Tank Regiment was renamed 4th Tank Regiment and the flag of the 131st was transferred to the Shrine of the Flags in the Vittoriano in Rome.

Ingolf marks a transition between the traditional gunships with muzzle-loading cannons placed along the sides of the ship and modern breechloading and turning guns placed in the centerline of the ship. The guns on Ingolf were breechloading guns from Krupp in Germany. The steam engine was British and could deliver 650 HP. The propeller could be hoisted up into a well on the underside of the ship, so as not to slow down the ship when she went for sails. Ingolf undertook a large number of voyages, often in the North Atlantic (Faroes, Iceland and Greenland) in summer and the Danish West Indies in winter. From 1897 Ingolf also served as training ship for non-commissioned officers and cadets. During World War I Ingolf was part of the Danish alerted fleet (not a true mobilization, as Denmark was neutral during the war). The last voyage as a training ship was in 1922 and went to the Mediterranean. Decommissioned in 1926 and sold for scrap.  Ingolf expedition  Map created from data collected by the Ingolf Expedition Ingolf was used for two oceanographic expeditions during the summer months of 1895 and 1896, collectively known as the Ingolf Expedition. The cruises were financed by the Danish Government and had the objective of studying the bathymetry around Iceland, northwards toward Jan Mayen and off West Greenland, heavily inspired by the Challenger expedition and similar American and German expeditions. Commander both years was the experienced captain C.F. Wandel and scientific crew consisted of three zoologists (Hector Jungersen, William Lundbeck, and H.J. Hansen, replaced in 1896 by Carl Wesenberg-Lund), one botanist (Carl H. Ostenfeld) and one hydrographer (Martin Knudsen). Despite severe weather and ice conditions thousands of hydrographical measurements were taken and biological samples collected at a total of 144 stations, down to depths of 3500 meter. The results are published in the impressive report The Danish Ingolf-Expedition (1899‚Äì1942, 5550 pages and 333 plates). The most significant results were the demonstration of two different bottom faunas separated by the Wyville Thomson Ridge south of the Faroe Islands and the systematic difference in temperature of the water at the sea floor between the north and south side of the ridge; and the very large number of small crustaceans collected by means of H.C. Hansen's method of filtering the bottom mud with fine silk gauze rather than a metal sieve. A very large number of species of micro-crustaceans were thus described for the first time based on the material collected by the Ingolf expedition.

She was the first African-American professional librarian in Mississippi. Early life and education Ruby Elizabeth Stutts was born in 1908 in Anding, Mississippi; her parents were Tom and Rossie A. Cowan Stutts. She was valedictorian of the Alcorn Agricultural and Mechanical College class of 1929. She went on to attend the Hampton Institute Library School, receiving a Julius Rosenwald Fellowship and graduating in 1930 with a bachelor degree in library science. Completing her master's degree at the University of Chicago in 1942, Lyells became the first black person from Mississippi to earn a degree in library science. A Doctor of Humanities degree was conferred on Lyells by Prentiss Institute. Library career After receiving her library degree from Hampton Institute, Lyells returned to her alma mater Alcorn A&M; College to work as the head librarian; her work in collection development served as a model for other black land grant colleges. While there she also worked as a student counselor and helped found the Library Division of the Mississippi Teachers Association. She moved to Chicago for a short time to attend the University of Chicago. After graduating with distinction in 1942, Lyells returned to Mississippi, becoming Mississippi's first professional black librarian. In 1945 Lyells became the head librarian at Jackson State University, working to modernize the school's library. Two years later, she became head of the Jackson Public Library's College Park and Carver branches; Lyells was the first African American to manage libraries within the segregated system. Lyells also worked as a librarian at the Atlanta Public Library System and at Iowa State University. Activism and community service Historian John Dittmer described Lyells as \\"a forceful orator\\" and \\"an independent force for social change for more than four decades.\\" Lyells served a number of leadership roles in the state, including serving as president of the Mississippi State Federation of Colored Women‚Äôs Clubs and as the first African American executive director of the Mississippi State Council of Human Rights. Lyells was an active proponent of strong school education, and in addition to writing on that subject in the 1940s and the 1950s in the Journal of Negro Education, her work in education included chairing the Biracial Committee for the Jackson Municipal Separate School District and being appointed by the federal courts in 1970 to help implement desegregation. She was a trustee of the Prentiss Institute in Prentiss, Mississippi and the Ruby E. Stutts Lyells Library was dedicated in her name in May 1968. She was a long-time supporter of the state and national Republican Party and she served on the Advisory Committee of the Co-chairman of the Republican National Convention in 1970. Lyells died in Jackson on December 22, 1994.

He was responsible for the first attempt at synchronised computer animation at the Lab using a VCS3 synthesiser attached to the PDP15. After leaving the laboratory in 1975, he continued to work on computer graphics including BSI's activities in standardisation in that area. Francis also ran a computer graphics consultancy. Political life Francis has been a prominent member of the Green Party since the 1980s. Francis is a former Chair of New Bradwell Parish Council. From 1998 until 2000, he was Chair Green Party executive. In 2001 Francis recommended the party use then Green peer Lord Beaumont‚Äôs position to attempt to renationalise Railtrack. Francis drafted a Bill and Lord Beaumont arranged a debate. He also wrote Lord Beaumont's proposing speech, (the first ever debate in the UK Parliament initiated by the Green Party). He has campaigned for many years for governments (of all colours) to switch priorities from road to rail. In this capacity he has been Chair of MK Forum and MK Rail Users Group. He is also chair of the Milton Keynes Transport Partnership For many years Frances was Green Party National Speaker on Transport. He has been a Green Party candidate for Milton Keynes in 9 General Elections, 4 Euro elections, as well many council elections. In 2009, Francis was interviewed about the Green Party‚Äôs support for Workplace Parking Levy. He remarked \\"We support charges on motoring which make the car pay the true costs of its use and this could certainly be one way of doing it.\\" At the Green Party Spring conference 2011, Francis opposed a conference motion against HS2. While the motion was carried, both Alan and the party have both reiterated their support for High Speed Rail in general with Frances arguing ‚Äúwe need extra capacity on our rail system if we want to fulfil our other commitments to switching freight and passengers from roads and air onto rail‚Äù. In 2014 Francis was MK:Smart Citizen Workpackage leader for the Big energy debate. In the 2015 general election, Francis stood for the Green Party in Buckingham against Speaker John Bercow. Francis was among a group of Green Party members who set up set a foodbank store outside then Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith's Grade-II listed 16th century mansion in Swanbourne in 2015 to protest the welfare cuts his government had implemented. In June 2019, he was among those who criticised the local council's intent to permit a housing and warehouse development near Caldecotte, because the developer's proposals would prevent or seriously obstruct the East West Rail plan for a road bridge over the railway line to replace the level crossing at Bow Brickhill railway station.

Unlike natural fluorescent proteins and derivates such as GFP or mCherry, FAST is not fluorescent by itself. It can bind selectively a fluorogenic chromophore derived from 4-hydroxybenzylidene rhodanine (HBR), which is itself non fluorescent unless bound. Once bound, the pair of molecules goes through a unique fluorogen activation mechanism based on two spectroscopic changes, increase of fluorescence quantum yield and absorption red shift, hence providing high labeling selectivity. The FAST-fluorogen reporting system can be used in fluorescence microscopy, flow cytometry and any other fluorometric method to explore the living world: biosensors, protein trafficking. FAST, a small 14 kDa protein, was engineered from the photoactive yellow protein (PYP) by directed evolution. It was reported for the first time in 2016 by researchers from Ecole normale sup√©rieure de Paris. __TOC__  Mechanism  FAST pertains to a chemical-genetic strategy for specific labeling of proteins. A peptide domain, called \\"tag\\", is genetically encoded to be bound to a protein of interest (by combination of their respective genes by means of transfection or infection). This tag is the anchor for a synthetic fluorescent probe to be further added. Such chemical-genetic approach was already implemented besides natural fluorescent proteins such as GFP or their derivatives such as mCherry in several systems already widely used: * since 2003, SNAP-tag, a bi-component reporting system consisting of a 19 kDa peptide derived from a human enzyme, O6-methylguanine-ADN methyltransferase, evolved to form covalent bonds with fluorescent O6-benzylguanine derivatives; SNAP-tag was later evolved into an orthogonal tag, CLIP-tag; * since 2008, HaloTag, a bi-component reporting system consisting of a 33 kDa peptide derived from a bacterial enzyme, a haloalkane deshalogenase, which can specifically bind functional halogenated synthetic ligands, most often fluorescent for cell imaging (e.g., Coumarine, Oregon Green, Alexa Fluor 488, diAcFAM, TMR). Reversible binding between FAST and a fluorogene Several versions of FAST have been described differing by a small number of mutations, e.g., FAST1 (a.k.a. Y-FAST), FAST2 (a.k.a. iFAST), or a dimer, td-FAST. Also, a complementation split version for monitoring protein-protein interactions was developed, splitFAST. A number of plasmids displaying FAST or splitFAST genes are available at Addgene.  Applications  The FAST-fluorogen reporting system is used in fluorescence microscopy, flow cytometry and any other fluorometric methods to explore the living world, including biosensors and protein trafficking. FAST has been reported for dynamic imaging of biofilms because of its unique capacity of fluorescence in low-oxygen conditions. For the same reason it allows for imaging and FACSing anaerobes, such as Clostridium, used for biomass fermentation like the ABE fermentation. FAST has also been reported for super-resolution microscopy of living cells. A number of fluorogens were developed for FAST and its derivates by The Twinkle Factory, varying by their emission wavelength, their brightness and their tag affinity. Some are non permeant, i.e., they can't go through cell membranes, hence specifically labeling membrane proteins or extracellular proteins, allowing for, e.g., monitoring trafficking from synthesis until excretion.

The different areas of web design include web graphic design; interface design; authoring, including standardized code and proprietary software; user experience design; and search engine optimization. Often many individuals will work in teams covering different aspects of the design process, although some designers will cover them all. The term web design is normally used to describe the design process relating to the front-end (client side) design of a website including writing markup. Web design partially overlaps web engineering in the broader scope of web development. Web designers are expected to have an awareness of usability and if their role involves creating markup then they are also expected to be up to date with web accessibility guidelines. Web development is the work involved in developing a web site for the Internet (World Wide Web) or an intranet (a private network). Web development can range from developing a simple single static page of plain text to complex web-based internet applications (web apps), electronic businesses, and social network services. A more comprehensive list of tasks to which web development commonly refers, may include web engineering, web design, web content development, client liaison, client-side/server-side scripting, web server and network security configuration, and e-commerce development. Among web professionals, \\"web development\\" usually refers to the main non-design aspects of building web sites: writing markup and coding. Web development may use content management systems (CMS) to make content changes easier and available with basic technical skills. For larger organizations and businesses, web development teams can consist of hundreds of people (web developers) and follow standard methods like Agile methodologies while developing websites. Smaller organizations may only require a single permanent or contracting developer, or secondary assignment to related job positions such as a graphic designer or information systems technician. Web development may be a collaborative effort between departments rather than the domain of a designated department. There are three kinds of web developer specialization: front-end developer, back-end developer, and full-stack developer. Front-end developers are responsible for behaviour and visuals that run in the user browser, back-end developers deal with the servers and full-stack developers are responsible for both.

The term is of Italian origin, but with a shift in meaning (galleria, covered passage, vs balcone, balcony). The stone brackets or corbels that support the balcony are called saljaturi (it: sogliature vs mensole, beccattelli). The hinged glass flaps are purtelli (it: sportelli) and the blinds are called tendini (it: tendine)Giovanni Bonello, Mysteries Of the Maltese ‚ÄòGallarija‚Äô  History  Extended gallarija at the Grandmaster's Palace, Valletta The gallarija is considered a descendant of the Maltese muxrabija, and it is closely related to the mashrabiya which are typical in Arabic architecture. Yet, its use became widespread only in the 17th century, as not one of antique townscapes of Valletta and the harbour cities show any covered balcony. The earlier representation of a gallarija concerns the one that rounds the Old Theatre Street corner of the Grandmaster's Palace in Valletta, around the year 1675. In 1679 Sieur de Bachelier mentions in his description of the palace that ‚Äúa glass-covered balcony joins all the rooms of this side of the building‚Äù [Old Theatre Street], and adds that ‚ÄúToday‚Äôs Grand Master [Nicholas Cottoner] willingly strolls there [through the balcony] without being seen, and discovers from his walk all that is happening in the two piazzas in front and at the side of his palace. If he sees two knights ambling together, he immediately perceives their thoughts and the subject of their conversation, as he knows the minds of all those he governs, and the secret practices of their intrigues.‚Äù The use of gallariji became widespread in Valletta and the Three Cities in the 18th century, in parallel with the spread of baroque. The architectural element was embellished by curve lines and elaborate stone corbels. The onset of the 20th century gave a new dimension to the Maltese balconies, which could now be designed in simpler Art Deco lines.

During her career that spanned six decades, Dormandi created portraits, landscapes, and still lives, and worked with watercolor, oil paint, pastels, stone lithographs, sculpting, pen and ink, screenprint, Chinese ink, and ceramic.  Life in Hungary  Dormandi was born in Szeged, Hungary to Lajos and Vilma Sz√©kely. Her parents divorced in 1904 and she and her siblings were adopted by their mother‚Äôs second husband, Frigyes Kov√°cs. In 1924 she married her husband Ladislas Dormandi, a Hungarian writer and editor. A year later she gave birth to her only child Judith (1925-). Olga Dormandi began drawing and painting as a young child. She studied at the Mme Ernestine Lovagh‚Äôs School and later was tutored by R√≥bert Ber√©ny, a Hungarian poster artist. Her first exhibition was in 1922, at the Ernst Museum in Budapest. Many of Dormandi's family members were psychoanalysts, including her mother Vilma, sister Alice, daughter Judith, and her brother-in-law Michael Balint and his second wife Enid Balint. She often created paintings and caricatures of these family members as well as their colleagues, sometimes even traveling to international psychoanalysis conferences in Salzburg and Vienna for this purpose. As a result, Olga left behind a collection of portraits of prominent psychoanalysts from the 20th century.  Emigration to Paris  In 1938, Austria was annexed by Germany in an event called the Anchluss, indicating that the Nazis were moving towards Hungary as well. Dormandi and her family were of Jewish descent, and so that year she moved out of Hungary with her husband, daughter, sister, brother-in- law Michael, and their son John. The family stayed together in Paris until the German occupation of France. The Balints moved to England, while the Dormandis remained in France under much secrecy.  Work in Paris  At the end of the Second World War and the German occupation, Dormandi came out of hiding and was able to resume her artistic career in Paris. She illustrated a luxury edition of Silence of the Sea (Le Silence de la Mer) by Vercors (the original edition without her illustrations was published during the German Occupation of Paris). She exhibited at French galleries, such as the Galerie du Pont des Arts and the Gallerie Berheim Jeune, becoming well known for her many paintings of Pont Neuf. In the 1950s, Dormandi‚Äôs painting Young Girls from Hammameth was purchased by the Louvre. Dormandi lived in Paris for the remainder of her life, although starting in 1956 she made biannual visits to the United States and often traveled around Europe to make portraits. Olga Dormandi died in 1971. She had two exhibits of her work after her death, one in 1973 in New York and one in 2005 in Paris.

During seafloor spreading, lithosphere and mantle cooling, contraction, and isostatic adjustment with age cause seafloor deepening. This relationship has come to be better understood since around 1969 with significant updates in 1974 and 1977. Two main theories have been put forward to explain this observation: one where the mantle including the lithosphere is cooling; the cooling mantle model, and a second where a lithosphere plate cools above a mantle at a constant temperature; the cooling plate model. The cooling mantle model explains the age-depth observations for seafloor younger that 80 million years. The cooling plate model explains the age-depth observations best for seafloor older that 20 million years. In addition, the cooling plate model explains the almost constant depth and heat flow observed in very old seafloor and lithosphere. In practice it is convenient to use the solution for the cooling mantle model for an age-depth relationship younger than 20 million years. Older than this the cooling plate model fits data as well. Beyond 80 million years the plate model fits better than the mantle model. Background The first theories for seafloor spreading in the early and mid twentieth century explained the elevations of the mid-ocean ridges as upwellings above convection currents in Earth's mantle. The next idea connected seafloor spreading and continental drift in a model of plate tectonics. In 1969, the elevations of ridges was explained as thermal expansion of a lithospheric plate at the spreading center. This 'cooling plate model' was followed in 1974 by noting that elevations of ridges could be modeled by cooling of the whole upper mantle including any plate. This was followed in 1977 by a more refined plate model which explained data that showed that both the ocean depths and ocean crust heat flow approached a constant value for very old seafloor. These observations could not be explained by the earlier 'cooling mantle model' which predicted increasing depth and decreasing heat flow at very old ages. Seafloor topography: cooling mantle and lithosphere models The depth of the seafloor (or the height of a location on a mid-ocean ridge above a base- level) is closely correlated with its age (i.e. the age of the lithosphere at the point where depth is measured). Depth is measured to the top of the ocean crust, below any overlying sediment. The age-depth relation can be modeled by the cooling of a lithosphere plate or mantle half-space in areas without significant subduction. The distinction between the two approaches is that the plate model requires the base of the lithosphere to maintain a constant temperature over time and the cooling is of the plate above this lower boundary. The cooling mantle model, which was developed after the plate model, does not require that the lithosphere base is maintained at a constant and limiting temperature. The result of the cooling mantle model is that seafloor depth is predicted to be proportional to the square root of its age. Cooling mantle model (1974) In the cooling mantle half-space model developed in 1974, the seabed (top of crust) height is determined by the oceanic lithosphere and mantle temperature, due to thermal expansion. The simple result is that the ridge height or seabed depth is proportional to the square root of its age. In all models, oceanic lithosphere is continuously formed at a constant rate at the mid-ocean ridges. The source of the lithosphere has a half-plane shape (x = 0, z < 0) and a constant temperature T1. Due to its continuous creation, the lithosphere at x > 0 is moving away from the ridge at a constant velocity v, which is assumed large compared to other typical scales in the problem. The temperature at the upper boundary of the lithosphere (z = 0) is a constant T0 = 0. Thus at x = 0 the temperature is the Heaviside step function T_1\\\\cdot\\\\Theta(-z). The system is assumed to be at a quasi-steady state, so that the temperature distribution is constant in time, i.e. T=T(x,z). By calculating in the frame of reference of the moving lithosphere (velocity v), which has spatial coordinate x' = x-vt, T=T(x',z, t). and the heat equation is: :\\\\frac{\\\\partial T}{\\\\partial t} = \\\\kappa abla^2 T = \\\\kappa\\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 T}{\\\\partial^2 z} + \\\\kappa\\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 T}{\\\\partial^2 x'} where \\\\kappa is the thermal diffusivity of the mantle lithosphere. Since T depends on x' and t only through the combination x = x'+vt,: :\\\\frac{\\\\partial T}{\\\\partial x'} = \\\\frac{1}{v}\\\\cdot\\\\frac{\\\\partial T}{\\\\partial t} Thus: :\\\\frac{\\\\partial T}{\\\\partial t} = \\\\kappa abla^2 T = \\\\kappa\\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 T}{\\\\partial^2 z} + \\\\frac{\\\\kappa}{v^2} \\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 T}{\\\\partial^2 t} It is assumed that v is large compared to other scales in the problem; therefore the last term in the equation is neglected, giving one- dimensional diffusion equation: :\\\\frac{\\\\partial T}{\\\\partial t} = \\\\kappa\\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 T}{\\\\partial^2 z} with the initial conditions :T(t=0) = T_1\\\\cdot\\\\Theta(-z). The solution for z\\\\le 0 is given by the error function: :T(x',z,t) = T_1 \\\\cdot \\\\operatorname{erf} \\\\left(\\\\frac{z}{2\\\\sqrt{\\\\kappa t}}\\\\right). Due to the large velocity, the temperature dependence on the horizontal direction is negligible, and the height at time t (i.e. of sea floor of age t) can be calculated by integrating the thermal expansion over z: :h(t) = h_0 + \\\\alpha_\\\\mathrm{eff} \\\\int_0^{\\\\infty} [T(z)-T_1]dz = h_0 - \\\\frac{2}{\\\\sqrt{\\\\pi}}\\\\alpha_\\\\mathrm{eff}T_1\\\\sqrt{\\\\kappa t} where \\\\alpha_\\\\mathrm{eff} is the effective volumetric thermal expansion coefficient, and h0 is the mid-ocean ridge height (compared to some reference). The assumption that v is relatively large is equivalent to the assumption that the thermal diffusivity \\\\kappa is small compared to L^2/A, where L is the ocean width (from mid-ocean ridges to continental shelf) and A is the age of the ocean basin. The effective thermal expansion coefficient \\\\alpha_\\\\mathrm{eff} is different from the usual thermal expansion coefficient \\\\alpha due to isostasic effect of the change in water column height above the lithosphere as it expands or contracts. Both coefficients are related by: : \\\\alpha_\\\\mathrm{eff} = \\\\alpha \\\\cdot \\\\frac{\\\\rho}{\\\\rho-\\\\rho_w} where \\\\rho \\\\sim 3.3 \\\\ \\\\mathrm{g}\\\\cdot \\\\mathrm{cm}^{-3} is the rock density and \\\\rho_0 = 1 \\\\ \\\\mathrm{g} \\\\cdot \\\\mathrm{cm}^{-3} is the density of water. By substituting the parameters by their rough estimates into the solution for the height of the ocean floor h(t): :\\\\begin{align} \\\\kappa &\\\\sim 8\\\\cdot 10^{-7} \\\\ \\\\mathrm{m}^2\\\\cdot \\\\mathrm{s}^{-1}&& \\\\text{for the thermal diffusivity} \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\alpha &\\\\sim 4\\\\cdot 10^{-5} \\\\ {}^{\\\\circ}\\\\mathrm{C}^{-1}&& \\\\text{for the thermal expansion coefficient} \\\\\\\\\\\\ T_1 &\\\\sim 1220 \\\\ {}^{\\\\circ}\\\\mathrm{C} && \\\\text{for the Atlantic and Indian oceans} \\\\\\\\\\\\ T_1 &\\\\sim 1120 \\\\ {}^{\\\\circ}\\\\mathrm{C} && \\\\text{for the eastern Pacific} \\\\end{align} we have: :h(t) \\\\sim \\\\begin{cases} h_0 - 390 \\\\sqrt{t} & \\\\text{for the Atlantic and Indian oceans} \\\\\\\\\\\\ h_0 - 350 \\\\sqrt{t} & \\\\text{for the eastern Pacific} \\\\end{cases} where the height is in meters and time is in millions of years. To get the dependence on x, one must substitute t = x/v ~ Ax/L, where L is the distance between the ridge to the continental shelf (roughly half the ocean width), and A is the ocean basin age. Rather than height of the ocean floor h(t)above a base or reference level h_b, the depth of the seabed d(t)is of interest. Because d(t)+h(t)=h_b(with h_b measured from the ocean surface) we can find that: :d(t)=h_b-h_0+350\\\\sqrt{t}; for the eastern Pacific for example, where h_b-h_0 is the depth at the ridge crest, typically 2600 m. Cooling plate model (1977) The depth predicted by the square root of seafloor age found by the 1974 cooling mantle derivation is too deep for seafloor older than 80 million years. Depth is better explained by a cooling lithosphere plate model rather than the cooling mantle half-space. The plate has a constant temperature at its base and spreading edge. Derivation of the cooling plate model also starts with the heat flow equation in one dimension as does the cooling mantle model. The difference is in requiring a thermal boundary at the base of a cooling plate. Analysis of depth versus age and depth versus square root of age data allowed Parsons and Sclater to estimate model parameters (for the North Pacific): :~125 km for lithosphere thickness :T_1\\\\thicksim1350\\\\ {}^{\\\\circ}\\\\mathrm{C} at base and young edge of plate :\\\\alpha\\\\thicksim3.2\\\\cdot 10^{-5} \\\\ {}^{\\\\circ}\\\\mathrm{C}^{-1} Assuming isostatic equilibrium everywhere beneath the cooling plate yields a revised age-depth relationship for older sea floor that is approximately correct for ages as young as 20 million years: :d(t)=6400-3200\\\\exp\\\\bigl(-t/62.8\\\\bigr)meters Thus older seafloor deepens more slowly than younger and in fact can be assumed almost constant at ~6400 m depth. Their plate model also allowed an expression for conductive heat flow, q(t) from the ocean floor, which is approximately constant at 1\\\\cdot 10^{-6}\\\\mathrm{cal}\\\\, \\\\mathrm{cm}^{-2} \\\\mathrm{sec}^{-1} beyond 120 million years: :q(t)=11.3/\\\\sqrt{t} Parsons and Sclater concluded that some style of mantle convection must apply heat to the base of the plate everywhere to prevent cooling down below 125 km and lithosphere contraction (seafloor deepening) at older ages. Morgan and Smith showed that the flattening of the older seafloor depth can be explained by flow in the asthenosphere below the lithosphere. The age-depth-heat flow relationship continued to be studied with refinements in the physical parameters that define ocean lithospheric plates.  Impacts  The usual method for estimating the age of the seafloor is from marine magnetic anomaly data and applying the Vine-Matthews-Morley hypothesis. Other ways include expensive deep sea drilling and dating of core material. If the depth is known at a location where anomalies are not mapped or are absent, and seabed samples are not available, knowing the seabed depth can yield an age estimate using the age-depth relationships. Along with this, if the seafloor spreading rate in an ocean basin increases, then the average depth in that ocean basin decreases and therefore its volume decreases (and vice versa). This results in global eustatic sea level rise (fall) because the Earth is not expanding. Two main drivers of sea level variation over geologic time are then changes in the volume of continental ice on the land, and the changes over time in ocean basin average depth (basin volume) depending on its average age.

While he worked in Kharkiv, he created a series of photographs of the Holodomor of 1932-1933, which are photographic evidence of the mass starvation of the Ukrainian people at that time.  Life  Alexander Wienerberger was born in 1891 (other sources mistakenly indicate 1898) in Vienna, in a family of mixed origin. Despite the fact that his father was Jewish and mother was Czech, Alexander himself, according to his daughter, considered himself an Austrian and an atheist. From 1910 to 1914 he studied at the Faculty of Philosophy at the University of Vienna. During the First World War he was mobilized into the Austro-Hungarian Army, participated in battles against the Russian army and was captured in 1915. In 1917 he was allowed to move to Moscow, where he founded a chemical laboratory with friends. In the fall of 1919, he attempted to escape from Soviet Russia to Austria through Estonia using fake documents, but failed: in Pskov he was arrested by Cheka. Wienerberger was convicted of espionage. He spent a significant part of the 1920s in the Lubyanka prison in Moscow. During his stay in prison, his skills as a chemist were appreciated by the Soviet government, which employed foreign prisoners worked in production. Wienerberger was appointed an engineer for the production of varnishes and paints, and later he worked in factories for the production of explosives. In 1927, his marriage with Josefine R√∂nimois, a native of the Baltic Germans, broke up. The ex-wife, together with daughter Annemarie and son Alexander, remained in Estonia (later Annemarie moved to Austria). In 1928, for the first time after imprisonment, Wienerberger visited his relatives in Vienna and made a new marriage with Lilly Zimmermann, the daughter of a manufacturer from Schwechat. On his return to Moscow, restrictions were lifted from him, which allowed his wife to move to the Soviet Union. In 1931, his wife was allowed to briefly return to Vienna, where she gave birth to their daughter Margot. In early 1930s, Wienerberger family lived in Moscow, where Alexander had a position at a chemical factory. In 1932 he was sent to Lyubuchany (Moscow Oblast) to the position of a technical director of a plastic factory, and in 1933 transferred to an equal position in Kharkiv.  Photographic evidence of the famine in 1932‚Äî1933  A photo of a hungry girl from Kharkov is one of the most famous photographs of the Holodomor (by Alexander Wienerberger). Living in Kharkiv, the then capital of the Ukrainian SSR, Wienerberger witnessed a massive famine and photographed the scenes he saw on the streets of the city, despite the threat of arrest by the NKVD. During his stay in Kharkov, Alexander Wienerberger secretly created about 100 photographs of the city during the Holodomor. His photographs depict queues of hungry people at grocery stores, starving children, bodies of people who died of starvation in the streets of Kharkov, and mass graves of victims of starvation. The engineer created his photographs using the German Leica camera, which was probably transferred to him by friends from abroad. Leaving for Austria in 1934, Wienerberger sent negatives through diplomatic mail with the aid of the Austrian embassy. Austrian diplomats insisted on such a measure of caution, since there was a high probability of a search of personal belongings at the border, and eventual discovery of photographs could threaten his life. Upon his return to Vienna, Wienerberger handed over the pictures to Cardinal Theodor Innitzer, who, together with the Secretary General of the International Committee of National Minorities Ewald Ammende, presented them to the League of Nations. In 1934, the Patriotic Front in Austria released Wienerberger's photos in a small brochure entitled ‚ÄúRu√üland, wie es wirklich ist‚Äù (Russia, as it really is), but without attribution.Ru√üland, wie es wirklich ist!, hrsg. v. der Vaterl√§ndischen Front, f√ºr den Inhalt verantwortlich: Dr. Ferdinand Krawiec, Wien 1934, 16 S.

It contains the complete concert recorded at the Academy of Music in Manhattan at the late show on November 23, 1972. It was released as a 3-disc LP on November 29, 2019, in a limited edition of 1,800 copies, as part of Record Store Day Black Friday. It was released as a 2-disc CD on December 6, 2019.  Critical reception  In All About Jazz, Doug Collette wrote, \\"By the time the New Riders appeared at the Academy of Music in November of 1972, commencing what would turn out to be a holiday tradition of sorts in the Big Apple, they had coalesced into a tightly-knit quintet... Two studio releases this same year, Gypsy Cowboy (Columbia, 1972) and Powerglide (Columbia, 1972) had helped crystallize a collective persona for the NRPS: slightly tongue-in-cheek and more than just a little psychedelic.... While this nearly two-hour recording isn't exactly overflowing with presence, the mix is nevertheless clear enough to reveal the potency of the musicians, individually and as a unit.\\" In Elmore Magazine, Lou Montesano said, \\"The release of a two-disc recording of the New Riders of the Purple Sage‚Äôs 1972 Thanksgiving show at the New York Academy of Music is something to be thankful for. The New Riders, NRPS among their many hard-core fans, have their place in American music as the creators of a psychedelic country rock sound more aligned with the Grateful Dead's bluegrass roots than the high harmonies of the Byrds.... This recording represents the finest lineup of the band‚Äôs early years.\\" Lost Live Dead wrote, \\"... the '72 band was road tested and battle hardened. They played a wide variety of originals and covers, rocking hard while the melodies soared. By then, Garcia's pedal steel chair had been taken by the great Buddy Cage, and Cage took Garcia's basic melodic template and exploded it into a remarkable kaleidoscope of sweet picking and sharp sustain.\\"  CD track listing  Disc 1 #\\"Leaving on Her Mind\\" (Jack Clement) #\\"Portland Woman\\" (John Dawson) #\\"Hello Mary Lou\\" (Gene Pitney, Cayet Mangiaracina) #\\"Sutter's Mill\\" (Dawson) #\\"She's No Angel\\" (Wanda Ballman, J.W.

W. (1962). North American monogenetic trematodes. XI. The family Heteraxinidae. Journal of Parasitology, Vol. 48, 402-418. Species of Cynoscionicola are ectoparasites that affect their host by attaching themselves as larvae on the gills of the fish and grow into adult stage. This larval stage is called oncomiracidium, and is characterized as free swimming and ciliated. This genus was proposed by Price in 1962, to accommodate Cynoscionicola heteracantha and Cynoscionicola pseudoheteracantha (previously included in the genus Microcotyle). Members of Cynoscionicola are characterised by a genital atrium with two anterior muscular pockets armed with single row of hooked spines, and two posterior lateral muscular pouches armed with spines.

B. Mughan. The film features newcomer Shivhasan, Vinod, Preethi Varma and newcomer Shravya in the lead roles, with Rajesh, Vijayan, Sethu Vinayagam, Kumarimuthu, Vadivukkarasi, Gemini Rajeshwari, Priyanka and Gowthami Vembunathan playing supporting roles. The film, produced by A. S. Maryson, had musical score by Sankar Ganesh and was released on 7 April 2006. Plot Azhagesan (Shivhasan) is a jobless youngster and a chain smoker who spends his time roaming with his friends in the village. His mother Ponnatha (Vadivukkarasi) loves him more than anything and spoils him while his father Paramasivam (Rajesh) hates him for being a wastrel. Azhagesan and Deivana (Shravya), the daughter of the village bigwig Ramasamy (Sethu Vinayagam), fall in love with each other. Their love affair crosses through mild hassles like when Deivanai's cousin Vinod (Vinod), an army man on a trip to his village, seeks her hand in marriage. Vinod realises that she is in love with Vinod, so Anand genuinely accepts their love and he leaves the village. Meanwhile, Azhagesan's cousin Valli (Preethi Varma) arrives at his village and starts to woo Azhagesan. The villagers decide to not consume alcohol until the end of the village festival. The last day of the festival, the angry arrack traders create a ruckus in the village. The huts of the villagers catch fire and many villagers have died including Deivanai. The incident disturbs the peace of the place causing friction between two communities. The fire was, in fact, caused by Azhagesan who had inadvertently tossed out his cigarette butt in a haystack that day. When the villagers come to know about it, they beat him up and a remorseful Azhagesan begs them to kill him for his carelessness but they let him go. The film ends with a saddened Azhagesan leaving the village.

It also encompasses involvement and affiliation with one's school community. Conversely, students who do not feel a strong sense of belonging within their school environment are frequently described as being alienated or disaffected. There are a number of terms within educational research that are used interchangeably with school belonging, including school connectedness, school attachment, and school engagement. School belonging is determined by a myriad of factors, including academic achievement and motivation, personal characteristics, social relationships, demographic characteristics, school climate, and participation in extracurricular activities. Research indicates that school belonging has significant implications for students, as it has been consistently linked with academic outcomes, psychological adjustment, well-being, identity formation, mental health, and physical health‚Äîit is considered a fundamental aspect of students' development. A sense of belonging to one's school is considered particularly important for adolescents because they are within a period of transition and identity formation, and research has found that school belonging significantly declines during this period. Psychological Sense of School Membership (PSSM), developed in 1993, is one of the measures to ascertain the degree to which students feel a sense of school belonging. Students rate the extent to which they agree or disagree with statements, such as \\"People here notice when I'm good at something.\\" In 2003, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention held an international convention where the Wingspread Declaration on School Connections was developed as a group of tactics to increase students' sense of belonging and connection with their school.  Prevalence and trajectory  Research indicates that many students have deficient feelings of school belonging. The Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA) has an investigated school belonging and disaffection in students around the world since 2003. Their most recent collection of data occurred in 2018. Approximately 600,000 students representing 32 million 15 years olds (aged between 15 years 3 months and 16 years 2 months) from 79 countries and economies participated in PISA 2018. Their analyses revealed that a significant proportion of students around the world are lacking strong feelings of belongingness to school. On average, a third of all students surveyed felt they did not belong to their school. In addition, they found that one in five students feels like an outsider at school and one in six reports feeling lonely. In most of the education systems, students who were socio-economically felt less belonging to school. On average student belonging to school declined by 2% between 2015 to 2018. The portion of students who do not feel like they belong to school has increased since 2003 indicating a trend in the deterioration of school belonging globally. School belonging tends to decrease as students grow older, as indicated in several different research studies. In one study involving students from Latin America, Asia, and Europe, researchers Cari Gillen-O'Neel and Andrew Fuligni found that in childhood, students generally report high levels of school belonging. However, once students transition into middle school and adolescence, their perceptions of school belonging drop significantly. Similarly, a separate study found that students' school belonging decreased in the transition from middle to high school; these students also displayed an increase in depressive symptoms and a decline in social support, which could be considered either causes or consequences of the decline in school belonging. This trend has been replicated in many other studies, suggesting that school belonging declines once students reach adolescence.  Determinants  A meta-analysis of 51 studies (N = 67,378) by K. Allen and colleagues (2018) identified that there are multiple individual and social level factors that influence school belonging. These core themes include academic factors, personal characteristics, social relationships, demographic characteristics, school climate and extra-curricular activities. For many of the determinants of school belonging, it is likely that each of them have a reciprocal relationship with a student's sense of belonging. That is, they operate as both an antecedents or consequences.  Academic factors  Research has documented the influence of academic factors (i.e. achievement, motivation, hardiness, interest in school) on students' school belonging. Academic achievement, or one's skills and competencies in school, has been identified as a substantial predictor of school belonging. For example, research has demonstrated that students' grade point averages (GPAs), a common measure of academic achievement, are positively associated with school belonging. This means that students who have higher GPAs have higher levels of school belonging. Studies have also found several measures of academic motivation to be determinants of students' school belonging. Academic motivation encompasses behaviors such as homework completion, setting goals, expectancy of success, and effort and engagement within the classroom. Carol Goodenow and Kathleen Grady found each of these sub-sects of academic motivation to be significant predictors of students' perceptions of school belonging. More recent research has replicated these findings, suggesting that academic motivation plays an important role in developing feelings of school belonging. In addition, students' perceived value of school influences their school belonging: when they perceive their assignments and education as instructive, meaningful, and valuable, they are more likely to report greater school belonging.  Personal characteristics  Personal characteristics refer to students' distinctive qualities, traits, personality, emotions, and attributes, and have been consistently identified as a substantial determinant of school belonging. Personal characteristics can be classified as either positive or negative. Positive personal characteristics such as self-esteem, self-efficacy, positive affect, and effective emotional regulation have been shown to help foster students' sense of school belonging. A study by Xin Ma found that students' self-esteem had the greatest impact on school belonging compared to all other personal factors. Conversely, negative personal characteristics like anxiety, depressive symptoms, heightened stress, negative affect, and mental illness can lower students' perceptions of school belonging. Emotional instability can further influence school belonging by negatively affecting students' educational experiences.  Social relationships  Social relationships are involved in developing students' feelings of belonging within a school. There are large, positive correlations between school belonging and positive social relations with peers, teachers, and parents. Support, acceptance, and encouragement from these sources can help students develop the feeling that they connect and identify with their school. = Peers = School children at a school in Tanzania Peer relations have been identified as a direct contributor to students' development of school belonging. Positive social relations with peers involve feelings of acceptance, connection, encouragement, academic and social support, trust, closeness, and caring. Such qualities within a peer relationship can significantly facilitate students' feelings of school belonging. When students are rejected or unsupported by their peers, they may experience anxiety, stress, and alienation. This alters their perceptions of belonging at school because the school environment now seems unwelcome and distressing, making it harder to identify and connect with the school. = Parents = Relationships with one's parents can have significant implications for students' feelings of school belonging, given that parents typically provide students' first social relationships. Positive parental relations include parents providing academic and social support, healthy communication, encouragement, compassion, acceptance, and safety. Such qualities within parent-child relationships have been shown to foster students' sense of school belonging by influencing their perceived connection with their school environment. = Teachers = Teacher and student, Lansing, Michigan, 1960 Teachers have been identified as being noteworthy contributors to students' feelings of belonging at school. Several academic studies have identified teacher support as the strongest predictor of school belonging compared to support from peers or parents. Teachers can help instil school belonging by developing a safe and healthy classroom climate, providing academic and social support, fostering respect amongst peers, and treating students fairly. Teachers can also promote feelings of school belonging by being friendly, approachable, and making an effort to connect with their students. Teaching practices that seem to promote students' school belonging include scaffolding learning, commending positive behaviors and performance, allowing students autonomy within the classroom, and using academic pressure, such as holding high expectations of students.  Demographic characteristics  = Gender = The relationship between gender and school belonging is largely inconclusive because research has produced conflicting results. Several studies have found gender differences in perceptions of school belonging: some research indicates that females possess a higher sense of school belonging compared to males, while other studies have found the opposite effect and conclude that males have higher school belonging than females. Other research has demonstrated that school belonging is not at all influenced by gender. = Race and ethnicity = Similar to gender, some research on the effect of race and ethnicity on school belonging has found a significant relationship between the two, while other research contradicts these findings. For example, one study found that Black students experience lower feelings of school belonging compared to white students, however, other research has found the opposite pattern or has found no significant influence of race on school belonging at all.  School climate  A school's climate can have significant consequences for students feeling like they belong at school. School climate broadly refers to the feelings associated with a school's environment and quality; it is considered to have physical (e.g. adequacy of buildings), social (e.g. interpersonal relationships), and academic dimensions (e.g. teaching quality). School climate influences school belonging through its support (or lack thereof) of students' feelings of connection with and attachment to their school. One important facet of school climate is school safety, which is how safe students feel at school. It includes variables such as a school's safety policies, use of discipline, bullying prevalence, and fairness. School safety is regarded as an important determinant of school belonging. Higher perceptions of school safety is associated with students holding greater feelings of school belonging.  Extracurricular activities  2016 Girls' Representative Cross Country, held at Yarra Valley Grammar School, Victoria, Australia. Research has shown that being involved in extracurricular activities can positively influence students' perceptions of school belonging. For example, researchers Casey Knifsend and Sandra Graham found that students who participated in two extracurricular activities reported greater feelings of school belonging compared to those students who participated in fewer than two. Other studies have replicated this relationship, highlighting the importance of participating in extracurricular activities for developing school belonging. Extracurricular activities may influence school belonging by providing collaborative and long-term interactions between students and their peers.  A Socio-ecological perspective  Socio-ecological Model of School Belonging by Kelly-Ann Allen, Dianne Vella-Brodrick, and Lea Waters, 2016. The many determinants of school belonging can be conceptualised in a socio-ecological model. The Socio- ecological Model of School Belonging developed by Allen and Colleagues (2016), adapted from Bronfenbrenner's Socio-ecological systems theory (1979)Bronfenbrenner, U. (1979). The ecology of human development: Experiments by nature and design. Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press. Page 5. is used to describe the school system as whole and the multiple and dynamic influencers of school belonging. The model depicts students at the centre of their school environment. The inner circles describe biological and individual level characteristics that influence school belonging. These factors include biological traits and personal characteristics such as emotional stability and academic motivation. The microsystem is represented by relationships with others, specifically, teachers, peers, and parents. The mesosystem represents the school policy and practices that occur within the day-to-day operations of the school and the exosystem represents a broader level that may include the wider school community. The macro-system describes the cultural context of a school that may be influenced by where a school is geographically located, the external social climate, and other factors such as history, legislation, and government driven priorities.  Consequences   Psychological health and adjustment  School belonging has numerous consequences for students' psychological health and adjustment. Research has shown that when students feel a greater sense of school belonging, their mental health and well-being is improved: they exhibit greater levels of emotional stability, lower levels of depression, reduced stress, and an increase in positive emotions, such as happiness and pride. Feelings of school belonging have also been shown to predict self-esteem, self-concept, and self-worth. Students who possess school belonging experience more positive life transitions as well, which can have important implications for psychological health and adjustment. On the other hand, students who do not have a strong sense of school belonging are at risk for a number of disadvantageous psychological and mental health outcomes. Students who lack a sense of belonging at school are at significantly greater risk for exhibiting anxiety, depression, negative affect, suicidal ideation, and overall developing mental illness. It may also increase their feelings of social rejection and alienation.  Academic development and outcomes  Two students from Xavier Academy in Nepal studying in the library 2016. Feelings of school belonging can have a significant influence on academic development and outcomes for students. School belonging is related to students' expectancy of success, effort in school, and perceived value of school and education. Greater feelings of school belonging has been shown to increase engagement and participation both inside school and within extracurricular activities. Similarly, school belonging is associated with a greater commitment to school. Strong feelings of school belonging have also been shown to improve overall academic performance and achievement, as shown by increases in grade point averages. A sense of belonging at school can also improve academic self- efficacy, or in other words, students' belief in their ability to succeed in school. Research has suggested that school belonging can also alleviate the prevalence of negative academic outcomes. Greater feelings of school belonging are associated with decreased misbehavior and misconduct, such as fighting, bullying, and vandalism. It can improve school attendance by reducing the frequency of truancy and absenteeism. Having school belonging also reduces students' likelihood of dropping out of school, thus improving rates of school completion. Conversely, students who lack a sense of school belonging are at greater risk for disengagement from school and potentially dropping out.  Physical health  School belonging has several implications for students' physical health. Students who possess feelings of school belonging exhibit reduced risk of having a stroke or disease. School belonging is also associated with lower mortality rates for students. In addition, perceptions of school belonging have a significant inverse relationship with risk-taking behaviors, including substance and tobacco use and early sexualization. In other words, students who have higher levels of school belonging are less likely to engage in risk-taking behaviors.  Measures  There are a number of measures used to assess school belonging. The most commonly used measures include:  Psychological Sense of School Membership (PSSM)  The most commonly used measure of school belonging is the Psychological Sense of School Membership (PSSM) scale, which was developed by Carol Goodenow in 1993. This scale measures students' feelings of belonging and membership within a school setting by having students respond to 18 items regarding their personal feelings and experiences within school. It is designed to be used with students of all ages and nationalities. Students answer the items on a scale ranging from 1 to 5, where 1 indicates Not at all true, and 5 indicates Completely true. The items are intended to measure students' perceptions of acceptance, academic and social support, value, and contentment within their social relationships at school. The following are some examples of items that students respond to: \\"People here notice when I'm good at something,\\" \\"Other students take my opinions seriously,\\" and \\"I feel like a real part of this school.\\" Research has found the PSSM to have high validity and reliability, attesting to its status as a valuable and functional measure of school belonging.  Hemingway Measure of Adolescent Connectedness (HMAC)  The Hemingway Measure of Adolescent Connectedness (HMAC) was constructed by Michael Karcher in 1999 and has been used in research as a measure of school belonging for adolescents specifically. It contains 74 items on a scale ranging from 1 (Not true at all) to 5 (Very true). It examines adolescents' perceptions of connectedness, or in other words, their involvement with and valuation of both the specific and general social support they receive, across three sub-categories: social connectedness, academic connectedness, and family connectedness. The social connectedness component measures adolescents' feelings of connection towards their friends, neighborhood, and self. Academic connectedness evaluates adolescents' sense of connection towards their school, teachers, peers, and academic self. Finally, the family connectedness component assesses adolescents' feelings of connectedness to their parents, siblings, religion, and ancestry. Items measuring school belonging specifically include: \\"I feel good about myself when I am at school,\\" \\"I get along well with the other students in my classes\\" and \\"I enjoy being at school.\\" This scale has been found to be generalizable to adolescents across the globe.  School Connectedness Scale (SCS)  Jill Hendrickson Lohmeier and Steven W. Lee created the School Connectedness Scale (SCS) in 2011 to assess students' peer, adult, and school relationships within three distinct categories: general support (belongingness), specific support (relatedness), and engagement (connectedness).The scale includes 54 self-report items presented on a scale ranging from 1 to 5, where 1 represents 'Not at all true' and 5 represents 'Completely true'. Some items include \\"Students at my school help each other\\", \\"I am very involved in activities at my school, like clubs or teams\\", \\"Teachers at my school care about their students\\", and \\"I like spending time with my classmates.\\" The SCS has shown generalizability to students from diverse populations, including different ages and ethnicities.  School Engagement Instrument (SEI)  The School Engagement Instrument (SEI) was designed by James Appleton, Sandra Christenson, Dongjin Kim, and Amy Reschly in 2006 and is commonly used to gauge perceptions of school belonging. It includes 35 items on a four-point scale ranging from Strongly agree to Strongly disagree that measure students' cognitive and affective engagement within the school environment. The items are categorized into six sub-domains: \\"future goals and aspirations, control and relevance of schoolwork, extrinsic motivation, family support for learning, peer support for learning, and teacher-student relationships.\\" Items from the SEI include: \\"Overall, my teachers are open and honest with me,\\" \\"Students at my school are there for me when I need them,\\" \\"When I have problems at school, my family/guardian(s) want to know about it,\\" and \\"What I'm learning in my classes will be important for my future.\\"  Implications for practice  In 2003, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) held an international convention to develop tactics for bolstering students' perceptions of school belonging. They developed the Wingspread Declaration on School Connections which identified the following strategies for increasing students' belonging to and connection with their school: #Implementing high standards and expectations, and providing academic support to all students. #Applying fair and consistent disciplinary policies that are collectively agreed upon and fairly enforced. # Creating trusting relationships among students, teachers, staff, administrators, and families. # Hiring and supporting capable teachers skilled in content, teaching techniques, and classroom management to meet each learner's needs. # Fostering high parent/family expectations for school performance and school completion. # Ensuring that every student feels close to at least one supportive adult at school. ::::‚Äî\\"Wingspread Declaration on School Connections\\", Journal of School Health The CDC later advanced the work of the Wingspread Declaration in 2009 by conducting a comprehensive, systematic review of school belonging and connectedness using sources from expert researchers, the government, educators, and more. This work produced four additional strategies for enhancing students' perception of belonging within school: # Adult Support: School staff members can dedicate their time, interest, attention, and emotional support to students. # Belonging to a Positive Peer Group: A stable network of peers can improve student perceptions of school. # Commitment to Education: Believing that school is important to their future and perceiving that the adults in school are investing in their education can help students engaged in their own learning and involved in school activities. # School Environment: The physical environment and psychosocial climate can set the stage for positive student perceptions of school. ::::‚Äî\\"School Connectedness: Strategies for Increasing Protective Factors Among Youth\\", Centers for Disease Control and Prevention  Student- level implications for practice  Student-level interventions may also increase a sense of school belonging. Research has indicated that social and emotional learning opportunities may also increase a sense of school belonging in students. Many individual characteristics found to enhance a student‚Äôs sense of belonging can be taught to students and thus offer a preventative mechanism to support their sense of school belonging. For example research suggests that teaching emotional regulation, coping skills, interpersonal skills, and skills related to academic motivation hold promise for supporting a students sense of school belonging.

Its main characteristic is inclusion of not only live-action, documentary and animated films, but also music videos, experimental films and video-art. It is one of the main events of its kind in Poland. The event's slogan hails it as \\"the most concise short film festival\\". History Since its commencement, the festival is organized by the Ad Arte Foundation from Pozna≈Ñ. Short Waves started as a multi-location event held simultaneously in various cities. The first edition in 2009 encompassed 28 locations in Poland, as well as Berlin, London and Dublin. Twelve Polish short films were screened in every city and the viewers voted for their favorite. The winner was chosen by counting the total number of votes from all the locations. In the next years the number of participating cities and countries increased. The record 2015 edition had more than 90 towns on 6 continents. Both the 2014 and 2015 editions consisted of two parts: Grand Prix Tour continued the tradition of organizing screenings around the globe, and Short Waves Pozna≈Ñ was a stationery version of the festival, with numerous screenings and events added. International competition was introduced next to the Polish one. The 2016 edition was the last to include the multiple location tour. Since then, the festival is held exclusively in Pozna≈Ñ and its multi-city incarnation is abandoned. The festival in its new format began to flourish with multiple new screening sections and competitions (such as Pozna≈Ñ Open, Dances with Camera, Urban View, Best of Seven), specialized workshops (for example movie poster making), discussion panels and other industry events.

Nicotine pouches are white pre-portioned pouches containing either tobacco derived nicotine or synthetic nicotine, but no tobacco leaf, dust, or stem, and are described as either similar to or a tobacco-free version of snus. No combustion is involved. The user puts a pouch between the upper lip and gum, and leaves it there while the nicotine and taste is being released. When finished, the pouch is disposed of in household trash.How to Use Nicotine Pouches Many brands have a storage area in the top case where used pouches can be kept if no trash can is readily available. The small pouches are used like chewing tobacco, but the user does not need to spit, as the contents of the pouches stay inside the pouches during use. There is no independent testing of their constituents, exposure or biomarkers of effects. Research analyzing their nicotine delivery is unavailable. The pouches are sold in an array of flavors. In 2019, five big tobacco companies offered nicotine pouch products.  Usage  No studies are available to determine if smokers would switch to nicotine pouches or if they would continue to smoke and use nicotine pouches, resulting in dual use. Nicotine pouches typically cost about as much as a pack of regular cigarettes. Unlike vaping products, they require no batteries and no accessory device. Nicotine pouches may entice youth as well as young adult never-smokers because they are available in an array of fruit flavors and may be used unobtrusively. In Norwegian pharmacies, nicotine pouches are also sold as a delivery mechanism for nicotine replacement therapy, approved by the Norwegian Medicines Agency for smoking cessation and sold under the brand Zonnic.  Contents  Nicotine pouches often contains food grade fillers, water, salt, flavorings and nicotine. The nicotine content among nicotine pouch brands differ per pouch. Nicotine pouches are sold in an array of fruit flavors such as black cherry and citrus. Other flavors include peppermint and coffee.  Research  Although nicotine pouches have the possibility of being a reduced risk product, there is no independent testing of their constituents, exposure or biomarkers of effects. Research analyzing their nicotine delivery is unavailable. The pouches contain the addictive chemical nicotine.  Opposition  Advocacy groups opposed to the introduction of nicotine pouches in Kenya have protested that they may raise the risk of cancer, heart disease, and reproductive or developmental harms. The Kenya Tobacco Control Alliance alleged that given the higher levels of some toxic chemicals, and what the U.S. Food and Drug Administration said was a lack of medical data showing the pouches are safer than cigarettes (as claimed by manufacturer British American Tobacco), the government should not license the product.  Brands  alt=Zone X nicotine pouches. Dryft is owned by Kretek International and it is sold in the US. The nicotine content for Dryft is 2 and 7 mg. LOOP is owned by the independent Another Snus Factoryfrom Stockholm, Sweden and is sold in Scandinavia, Germany, UK and other EU markets. The container is made from 50% plant and 50% recycled plastic and the pouches are available in a variety of strengths and flavours. Lyft is owned by British American Tobacco and it is sold in the UK and Sweden. The nicotine content for Lyft is 4 and 6 mg. In 2019, British American Tobacco started selling nicotine pouches in Kenya. Nordic Spirit is owned by Japan Tobacco International and it is sold in Switzerland and Sweden and the UK, where a bus shelter advertising campaign has begun in August 2020.

Velo is owned by R. J. Reynolds Vapor Company and it is sold in the US. The nicotine content for Velo is 2 and 4 mg. Velo states that the contents in their products consist of nicotine obtained from the tobacco plant, microcrystalline cellulose, water, salt, sucralose, citric acid, and artificial flavor. Zone X is owned by Imperial Tobacco and it is sold in the UK.zoneX All White Nicotine Pouches ZYN is owned by Swedish Match and it is sold in Europe and the US. Zyn states that the contents in their products consist of pharmaceutical-grade nicotine salt, hydroxypropyl cellulose, microcrystalline cellulose, maltitol, gum arabic, sodium carbonate, sodium bicarbonate, acesulfame K, and food-grade flavorings.  Classification  It is assumed they are classified as tobacco products in the US because they contain nicotine obtained from tobacco. It is not clear how they are classified in other countries. Tobacco-free nicotine pouches were for sale in Norway from 2014 to 2018, under the name Epok.In June 2018 the Norwegian Directorate of Health forced British American Tobacco Norway to remove Epok from sale or face daily fines of 150 000 NOK, due to reasons which were described as \\"ridiculous\\" by Norwegian press and politicians. The Norwegian Directorate of Health argued that since Epok didn't contain any tobacco it was a new form of nicotine product, distinct from the other forms of snus approved in Norway. New forms of nicotine products are extremely unlikely to get approved, the nicotine pouch brand ZYN had already been rejected approval twice for an extremely similar product. Within days of the ban Epok was re-introduced to the Norwegian market, with a minute amount of bleached tobacco added, to qualify as an already approved form of nicotine product. Because tobacco-free nicotine pouches were not banned there, the Epok brand was discontinued in Sweden and replaced by Lyft, an otherwise identical product that contains pine and eucalyptus fibers instead of tobacco filler. As of February 2020, Epok is still sold by Norwegian grocery stores.

They are considered a pair, as they are in the National Irish Visual Arts Library catalogue, as they worked and exhibited together and shared a painting technique that Philip taught Barry, which concentrated on making the colour look luminous. The Irish Times said of their partnership that \\"As husband and wife they have lived together a long time, but their artistic partnership spans almost as many years.\\" They use the quattrocento style, building up the painting layer by layer. Philip Castle Philip Castle was born in 1929 in the south of England, into a family of engineers. He attended Haberdashers Aske School in London and went on in 1954 to read nuclear physics at Trinity College Dublin where he studied under Ernest Walton, the Nobel Laureate. He met his wife, Barry Laverty, when studying in Dublin and they married in 1963 . After university Philip decided against a career as a nuclear physicist and instead became a painter. The Bank of Ireland Arts Centre and Lavit Gallery records describe Philip Castle as self-taught. Barry told the Irish times that Philip never had any formal art training. 'He taught himself and then he taught me - even though I had been to art school.\\" When Barry and Philip were first married they spent many months sailing around the Mediterranean, in search of the right light. Subsequently, they lived in a small villa within a carnation farm, overlooking the sea at Villefranche-sur-mer in the South of France. They also spent time in a small house in Gaiole in Chianti, ItalyMayes, Elizabeth. ‚ÄúA Diary of the Art Year in Ireland.‚Äù Irish Arts Review Yearbook, vol. 11, 1995, pp. 54‚Äì73.

Philip's work is catalogued as relating to the built environment. He was much influenced by early Italian Primitive painters, Duccio and Cimabue. He painted huge canvasses in clear pure colours, stippling the paint to create a smooth surface. His city-scapes often included material from the lives of Saints, Popes and historical events. He painted the Italian mediaeval: the Pallio in Siena, Venice and (later in his career) contemporary cities‚ÄúI.A.R. Gallery.‚Äù Irish Arts Review Yearbook, vol. 18, 2002, pp. XXXVII- XLVII.

Philip and Barry had separate but adjacent studios in Italy and France. They exhibited separately and together (see Exhibitions, below.) Their techniques were similar but their styles were distinguishable. The Irish Times interviewed them in 1999 and they discussed their differences. \\"I'm interested in what men build and do, rather than in men themselves. What you build is a way of expressing yourself,\\" Philip said. Barry said her approach \\" has more to do with intuition and emotion and less to do with the intellect, the intellectual being more important to Philip's way of working. Barry's paintings are full of natural and organic forms, quite different concerns to the cityscapes and urban complexities of her husband's canvasses\\". Philip sold mostly directly. Rainier III, Prince of Monaco once bought an entire exhibition and the Royal College of Surgeons in Dublin also bought directly from Philip. Philip Castle died in 2005.

Her father was the Irish Times journalist, James Laverty. She attended several schools, including the \\"gloomy\\" Holy Faith Convent on Haddington Road , St Louis in Rathmines and, she related, a school under Dr Teller where for two years she kept her coat on in class because no one told her where to hang it up and Loreto Abbey. Barry attended Dublin Art School at the tender age of 15 \\"because I wouldn't go to school\\" but left after only two years, not really painting again until she was encouraged and taught by Philip Castle. Her teachers included Sean Keating, Maurice MacGonigal and John Kelly. At art school Barry met her lifelong friend, the acclaimed Irish artist Pauline Bewick, ( who also bought a house near the Castle's, in Tuscany) and the RHA president, Tom Ryan. Her use of Philip's luminous technique was noted in her obituary in the Irish Times which noted the graphic clarity and translucent colouring of her were suited to illustration. She illustrated several books, including one, Cooking for Cats (1985), for which she herself provided the verse text. Barry had her first major exhibition with London‚Äôs Portal Gallery in 1974. Her work can be found in such collections as The National Library of Ireland, The National Self- Portrait Collection in Limerick, University of Limerick, AIB and The Arts Council of Ireland. Barry mainly painted a combination of landscapes and portraits; sometimes using incidents from the lives of eccentric saints or mythological subjects.

In most of the seasons, the downloadable content has introduced a new map or a rework of an existing one and at least two new operators to play. However, developer Jean-Baptiste Halle announced at the Six Invitational 2020 that only one new operator would be introduced each season after the third season of Year 5. The inaugural season began in February 2016 with Operation Black Ice, and the game is currently in its eighteenth season, which is Operation Shadow Legacy, the third season of Year 5. There are currently 20 maps to play on between three game modes and 57 operators to choose from between attacking and defending.  Year 1   Operation Black Ice  Operation Black Ice, the inaugural season of Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Siege, was released on 2 February 2016. The operation introduced a new map, a frozen yacht in Canada. It also introduced two Canadian operators from the special operations force Joint Task Force 2, Frost and Buck. Frost is a defending operator who can use a device similar to a bear trap to incapacitate enemies, while Buck, the attacking operator, has an under-barrel M26 shotgun.  Operation Dust Line  The second season of Year 1, Operation Dust Line, was released on 11 May 2016. The operation introduced a new map set in the Middle East, described as \\"a mix of old and new construction with open-air pathways\\". It also introduced two Navy SEAL operators, Blackbeard and Valkyrie. Blackbeard, the attacking operator, has mountable face shields for his rifle; while Valkyrie, the defending operator, has three omnidirectional cameras that are throwable onto any surface.  Operation Skull Rain  Operation Skull Rain, the third season, was released on August 2, 2016. The operation introduced a new map set in a favela in Brazil, and two BOPE operators called Capit√£o and Caveira. Capit√£o, an attacking operator, has a tactical crossbow capable of loading asphyxiating bolts, that will burn oxygen within a certain radius, or smoke grenade bolts that create a thick cloud of smoke. The defending operator, Caveira, has an ability called Silent Step, allowing her to make less noise when moving as well as interrogate an immobilized enemy for the location of other enemies.  Operation Red Crow  The fourth and final season of Year 1, Operation Red Crow, was released on 17 November 2016. The operation introduced a new map set in a skyscraper in Japan, and two SAT operators called Hibana and Echo. As an attacking operator, Hibana possesses a weapon that launches up to three sets of six explosives that attach to and break reinforced walls. Echo, the defending operator, uses a drone capable of releasing sonic blasts to disorient enemies.  Year 2   Operation Velvet Shell  Operation Velvet Shell, the first season of Year 2, was released on 8 February 2017. The operation introduced a new map set in Spain, and two GEO operators called Mira and Jackal. Jackal is a tracker on the attacking team who can reveal the location of enemies by tracking their footprints, while Mira is a defender who can create one-way ejectable bulletproof windows on walls, leaving space for operators to fire through.  Operation Health  The second season of Year 2, Operation Health released on 6 June 2017. The operation was an update that fine-tuned many of the game's aspects, including fixes to hitboxes, spawn killing and audio issues. The update resulted in the delay of planned season's content and the cancellation of a map.  Operation Blood Orchid  Operation Blood Orchid was the third season of Year 2 and released on 5 September 2017. The operation introduced a new map set in Hong Kong, two SDU operators named Ying and Lesion, and one Polish GROM operator named Ela. Ying, an attacking operator, utilizes candela cluster charges that can be thrown or attached to a surface to stun enemies, similar to a stun grenade. On the defending team, Lesion uses poison mines that slow and cause damage to an enemy over time when triggered. Ela, also a defending operator, possesses proximity concussion mines that can be attached to multiple surfaces to disorient enemies.  Operation White Noise  Operation White Noise served as the fourth and final season of Year 2 and released on 5 December 2017. The operation introduced a new map set in South Korea, two South Korean operators from the 707th Special Mission Battalion named Dokkaebi and Vigil, and one Polish GROM operator named Zofia. Dokkaebi is an attacker who can hack enemy phones to make them ring, revealing their position. She can also hack the phone of a dead defender to give attackers access to cameras. Vigil is a defender who uses a cloaking device to become invisible to all drones and cameras. On the attacking team, Zofia carries a double-barreled grenade launcher capable of launching explosive or concussion grenades.  Year 3   Operation Chimera  Serving as the first season of Year 3, Operation Chimera released on 6 March 2018. The operation introduced one GIGN operator named Lion, and one Spetsnaz operator named Finka. Both are part of a CBRN specialist detachment of Team Rainbow. As an attacking operator, Lion uses a UAV to expose moving enemies via sonar temporarily; Finka is also an attacking operator and uses nanomachines to temporarily increase the health and accuracy of herself and her teammates, as well as reviving any downed teammates. Her ability also increases their heart and breathing rate, thus weakening them by increasing the damage taken by Smoke's toxic gas canisters, increasing the range Pulse's heartbeat scanner can detect them, and hindering their ability to listen for footsteps. This DLC also introduced a temporary game mode called \\"Outbreak\\", a PvE game mode which tasks operators with containing a biohazard that has turned the citizens of Truth or Consequences, New Mexico into zombie- like monsters.  Operation Para Bellum  Released on 7 June 2018, Operation Para Bellum was the second season of Year 3. The operation introduced a new map set in Tuscany, as well as two GIS operators named Alibi and Maestro. Alibi is a defending operator who can project inanimate holograms of herself, which expose the location of any enemy that interacts with the hologram with their weapons, body, or drone. Also a defender, Maestro can install a bulletproof wall-mounted directed-energy turret that he can then operate remotely, damaging enemies with rapid laser fire. When the turret is firing it is no longer bulletproof, and after a certain number of shots, the turret can overheat and has to cool down.  Operation Grim Sky  Operation Grim Sky, the third season of Year 3, was released on 4 September 2018. The operation introduced two new operators and the first full map redesign for Hereford Base. On attacking is Maverick, a US Delta Force operator who uses a small handheld blowtorch that can create small holes in reinforced walls, opening new lines of sight. On defending is Clash, a Metropolitan Police Service officer who is the first shield-wielding defender. Her shield is similar to Montagne's, with the addition of a device called the Crowd Control Electro Shield, or CCE, which emits an electric field that slows and damages attackers.  Operation Wind Bastion  In the fourth and final season of Year 3, Operation Wind Bastion, which released on 4 December 2018, the operation introduced a new map set in Morocco and two GIGR operators named Kaid and Nomad. Kaid, a defending operator, can throw a gadget called Electroclaws that can electrify reinforced surfaces, barbed wire, and deployable shields. On the attacking side, Nomad possesses a weapon attachment called an AirJab launcher, which launches proximity-triggered air-blast grenades that can stick to surfaces and throw opposing operators to the ground.  Year 4   Operation Burnt Horizon  Operation Burnt Horizon marked the first season of Year 4, which released on 6 March 2019. The operation introduced a new map set in the Outback of Australia, along with two operators from SASR, Mozzie and Gridlock. Mozzie is a defender whose gadget is an autonomous robot called \\"Pest\\" that hacks the attacker's drones, letting him use them. The attacker, Gridlock, has a gadget called \\"Trax Stingers\\" which is a throwable gadget that deploys multiple road spike-like hexagonal stinger mats until they are either destroyed or cover the area. A midseason update in Operation Burnt Horizon introduced a rework of Lion's ability. Instead of giving body outlines of detected enemy operators, Lion and his teammates instead receive a ping of their location. Furthermore, Ubisoft implemented a reduction of duration, warning, and cooldown time of Lion's gadget.  Operation Phantom Sight  Operation Phantom Sight was the second season of Year 4 and released on 11 June 2019. The operation introduced two new operators, N√∏kk and Warden. It also introduced a rework for the map Kafe Dostoyevsky. N√∏kk is an attacking operator from the Danish Jaeger Corps who uses her HEL Presence Reduction Device to muffle her footsteps and wipe her images from cameras. Warden is a defending operator from the United States Secret Service who comes equipped with a pair of Glance Smart Glasses, which eliminate the effects of flashbangs and allow him to see through smoke.  Operation Ember Rise  In the third season of Year 4, Operation Ember Rise, which released on 11 September 2019, the operation introduced a rework of Kanal and two new operators, Amaru and Goyo. A member of the Peruvian APCA, Amaru is an attacking operator who uses the Garra Hook to grapple or hoist herself onto or through ledges, windows, or open hatches. On the defending team, Goyo is a member of the Mexican Fuerzas Especiales who possesses Volc√°n Shields that are similar to deployable shields but armed with incendiary bombs on the rear end, which can be detonated by gunfire.  Operation Shifting Tides  Operation Shifting Tides is the fourth and final season of Year 4, which released on 3 December 2019. The operation introduces a rework of Theme Park and two new operators from a private military company called the Nighthaven Special Intervention Group. From India is Kali, an attacking operator armed with a CSRX 300 bolt-action sniper rifle that can toggle between 5√ó to 12√ó magnification. Her weapon also comes with an under-barrel attachment called the LV Explosive Lance, which is capable of destroying defenders' gadgets that are within its radius of effect. Meanwhile, on the defending team, Wamai is a Kenyan operator who uses the Mag-NET System that captures the projectiles of attacking operators thrown or launched within its radius and then releases them after a short time for them to take effect finally. Wamai is the first DLC defending operator to have an assault rifle in his loadout. With this season, the game introduces a limb penetration system in which some weapon types will be able to hit more than one target at once. This new system will also take damage modifiers and armour ratings into account when it comes to hit registration. In Shifting Tides, the update changed the game's rappel feature in how one exits from rappelling. Before, players would automatically enter an exit animation once they reached the top of a building. With the update, players would now receive a prompt to confirm whether they wish to exit rappel. The new operation also introduces a rework of Jackal's tracking gadget. Among other changes, there are now four different colours of footprints that show how old they are and how many times an enemy operator will be pinged depending on the colour. A change was also made to Smoke's gas grenades in that they will not be able to spread through solid walls and are unable to obstruct vision.  Year 5   Operation Void Edge  Operation Void Edge is the first season of Year 5, which began on 10 March 2020. The season was first announced by Ubisoft on 10 February 2020, during the Six Invitational. The new season introduces Iana, a Dutch attacking operator who formerly worked on a European Union space project. Iana's gadget, the Gemini Replicator, creates a controllable hologram similar to Alibi's gadget, but is mobile and can be used for intelligence gathering. For the defending team, Void Edge introduces Oryx, a Jordanian operator who has no technological gadget. Instead, his ability is the Remah Dash, which can allow him to run through breakable walls (at the cost of five health points per use), jump up through broken hatches, and knockdown opponents. Void Edge also introduces a rework of Oregon in which the most notable alteration is the removal of the tower bomb site. In that site's place is meeting hall and kitchen. There are several operator reworks introduced in the new season. Lesion's Gu Mine will no longer deal initial damage, but will instead deal two health points of damage every few seconds. The Gu Mine icon will also disappear on Lesion's HUD if he loses line of sight on the Gu Mine, making it more difficult for the player to determine which one was triggered. The intent of this rework is for Lesion's gadget to be more useful in slowing attackers than for accurate intelligence gathering. As for Twitch, her drone will have infinite shocks with the caveat of only having three shocks at a time. Instead of giving ten health points of damage to players, the drone will only deal one point per shock. Ubisoft made this change to focus her drone on gadget destruction rather than directly attacking players. Midway through Void Edge, Ubisoft released a patch that made several notable changes to the game. In the patch, the developers reduced J√§ger to a two-speed, two-armour operator. The developers explained the reasoning behind the change in the Designer's Notes that J√§ger had a pick rate in competitive matches that was greater than 90 per cent. Mozzie was another target of the patch, removing the Super Shorty from his loadout. The patch also reduced the number of Volc√°n Shields in Goyo's possession and swapped Buck's frag grenade for a claymore. In the update, Ying was given an additional candela, replaced her claymore with smoke grenades, and increased the damage of the T-95 LSW. However, one week later, Ubisoft issued another update reverting the number of Ying's candelas to three.  Operation Steel Wave  Operation Steel Wave is the second season of Year 5, which began on 16 June 2020. Ubisoft announced the name of the season on 13 May 2020, and revealed the new operators over the next few days. The season introduces Ace, a Norwegian attacker hailing from Nighthaven. Ace's unique gadget is the SELMA Aqua Breacher. This gadget can be thrown in a similar manner to a grenade where it will deploy up to three hydraulically powered breaching charges that will sequentially detonate large holes into soft or reinforced surfaces. It is worth noting that Ace will need two of his available three SELMAs to destroy a single reinforced hatch. The South African defender is Melusi, an operative from a notable anti-poaching task force. Her unique gadget is the Banshee Sonic Defense gadget, which emits a low frequency humming noise that dramatically reduces attacker movement and alerts defenders to their position when within its effective radius. The season brings forth the thoroughly reworked House map which sees reimagined rooms and overall scale adjustments for more balanced gameplay. This season also saw the introduction of a new secondary gadget available to select defenders; the Proximity Alarm. Further operator changes saw the removal of the turning radius penalty of Ela and Zofia's concussion effects, as well as a fixed duration and removal of screen shaking effects from sonic bursts generated by Echo's Yokai drone. Amaru's Garra Hook will no longer destroy wooden barricades on windows it attaches to; only when Amaru goes through the barricades herself. Alibi and Maestro's ACS-12 shotgun now shoots slugs instead of traditional buckshot. Regarding playlists, all Ranked MMR ratings are unified on each platform. Players can no longer obtain different skill ratings by swapping data centers to play Ranked in different regions, and the Champion Rank leaderboard is now worldwide as a result. New prerequisites for Ranked involve a raise in clearance level from 30 to 50 to unlock the Ranked playlist, and eligibility for Champion Rank requires completing at least 100 Ranked games each season as a means of deterring cheaters. Furthermore, a new match cancellation feature has been added to Ranked that will allow players to cancel matches in the event of unbalanced teams at the start of a match. Teams will be able to initiate a cancellation during the Preparation Phase of the first round, followed by a voting prompt to end the match. A majority vote will terminate the match immediately and no penalties or sanctions will be given to either team, unless players abandon the match before the cancellation vote is decided.  Operation Shadow Legacy  Operation Shadow Legacy is the third season of Year 5. Ubisoft announced the name of the season on August 12, 2020. The season introduces Splinter Cell's Sam Fisher, under the moniker of Zero, as Siege's first-ever guest character. Zero's unique gadget is the Argus Launcher, which allows him to deploy multiple two-way cameras on soft or reinforced surfaces that can fire a single-shot laser that can destroy defender gadgets in a single hit. The map Chalet got a major rework, with the kitchen and basement locations staying mostly the same, as Ubisoft believed they were strong locations to begin with. Multiple operators got one of their secondary gadgets replaced with hard breaching charges, which activate when placed and can add a medium-sized hole that players are able to vault through in reinforced surfaces. The breaching charge completely destroys unreinforced doors, windows, and hatches. A map-ban has been added to unranked and ranked modes. A minimum of 1 map out of 3 is voted out at the beginning of a match, with each team voting at the same time. If the majority of the 2 teams vote for different maps, the third is chosen, and the teams progress to the operator ban sequence. If the 2 teams vote for the same map, one of two remaining maps is chosen. Ubisoft has stated that later in the season, they are removing the \\"vote to kick\\" option, as they feel it has strayed from its original purpose and is now used as an extra form of toxicity. Maverick now has 6 canisters in his blowtorch instead of 5, as ubisoft wanted to be more forgiving of players mistakes when opening hatches. The new 1.5x and 2x scopes were added in with this new update, as well as a rework of the holographic and red dot sights for certain operators. A reinforcement pool has been added, meaning that the entire team shares 10 reinforcements, so an afk player does not ruin your plans.

Braguny (, , ) is a rural locality (a selo) in Gudermessky District, Chechnya.  Administrative and municipal status  Municipally, Braguny is incorporated as Bragunskoye rural settlement. It is the administrative center of the municipality and is the only settlement included in it.  Geography  Map of Gudermessky District. Braguny is in the north- west Braguny is located just above the confluence of the Sunzha River into the Terek River. It is located north of the city of Gudermes and north-east of the city of Grozny. The nearest settlements to Braguny are Staro-Scherdinskaya in the north, Khangish-Yurt in the east, Solsabekan-Kotar in the south-east, the city of Gudermes in the south, and Darbankhi in the south-west.  History  Turkic-Kumyk version: According to one version, the area was settled by immigrants from the Crimea, and by pre-Polovtsian Turks displaced on the right bank of the Terek River from the Boragan-Madzhara region. According to N. Semenov, Bora Khan, with Crimean people, left Crimea, when he resettled to the Caspian. Until the 19th century, Braguny was the capital of the Kumyk feudal domain - the Principality of Braguny (). The rulers of the estate - the princes Taimazovs, built their clan to the Crimean khans Gerey. Jan Potocki noted that \\"the princes of the Kumyks all belong to the same family as the shamkhal, excluding those from Braguny, who claim to be from Genghis Khan\\". A letter from the Terek governor in Moscow in 1621 indicates that the Kumyk ruler Soltan-Magmut (Soltan-Mahmud, Soltan-Mut) arrived with 8 princes, including the Bragunsky Kudeney-Murza, Batay-Murza Shikhmurzin and 38 of his bridles. In the 1848 book by Shikhaliev, ‚ÄúThe Kumyk Story about Kumyks,‚Äù much data on the population and length of ownership was given. Sources of the end of the 18th and beginning of the 19th centuries, the Bragun domination is already characterized as Kumyk, subject to the Kumyk princes - ‚ÄúKumyk Aksaevskaya, Andreevskaya, Kostyukovskaya and Bragun villages‚Äù. The authors of the early XIX century also express the idea of the prevailing influence of the Kumyk princes on the Baragun land. In 1812, A. M. Butskovsky writes that it belongs to the ‚ÄúKumyk clan princes: Ustarkhan Gudainatov, Adilgirey Kuchukov and Beysultan Arslanbekov, of whom the first is eldest‚Äù. S. Bronevsky in 1823 reported that Bragun‚Äôs possession ‚Äúbelongs to two Kumyk princes - cousins, Colonel Kuchun-Bek (Kuchuk) Taymazov and Akhtula-Bek‚Äù, but he also notes that this possession ‚Äúis attributed to the Circassian regions according to the natural outline of living natural boundaries, although the Bragun inhabitants, being of Tatar origin, belong to the Kumyk branch itself‚Äù. Johann Peter Falk, describing his journey to the Caucasus in 1773, described the population and wealth of the Braguny possessions, then already subject to Russia. Also, in the XVIII century, Jacob Shtelin confirmed that \\"the place of the confluence of Sunzha into the Terek is owned by Prince Takmazov and his brothers\\". In addition to the Kumyks, Kabardians and Chechens also lived in the property. Chechen version: According to the legend of the Bragunians themselves, the village was founded by the leader of the nomadic tribe Borahan, when, when crossing in the caravan over the Sunzha River, a huge sturgeon squeezed into the spokes of the arba. A letter from the Terek governor to Moscow in 1621 indicates the arrival of the embassy of the Kumyk ruler Soltan-Magmut (Soltan- Mahmud, Soltan-Mut) with the Mychkiz and Okotsk societies, with 8 princes, including the Baragun Kuden-Murza, Batay-Murza Shikhmurzin 38 of his bridles. Braguny is the locality of the society of Bragun Chechens. The ethnic origin of the inhabitants of the village of Braguny is also not fully understood.

Established in 1877 in memory of Queen Stephanie of Hohenzollern-Sigmaringen, this was the first Portuguese hospital specifically dedicated to the healthcare of children, and it remains a national reference in pediatric specialties, both medical and surgical. It serves the south of the country and Insular Portugal. History In the mid-19th century, the city of Lisbon was plagued with outbreaks of cholera and yellow fever. The young King Peter V and his wife Queen Stephanie of Hohenzollern-Sigmaringen paid frequent visits to the hospitalised patients; during one such visit to Saint Joseph's Hospital, the Queen was impressed by the fact that children were treated in the same infirmaries as adults: with the money that had come from her dowry, Queen Stephanie proposed first the creation of a children's infirmary and then of an entire hospital devoted to poor ailing children. The Queen's own premature death of diphtheria in 1859 did not allow her to see her project to completion: her widowed husband King Peter V ordered the construction of the new hospital in a plot of land originally belonging to the extensive grounds of Bemposta Palace. The king passed away childless one year later, and the Bemposta Hospital (as it was originally called) was unveiled by Stephanie's brother-in-law King Lu√≠s I, on 17 July 1877, the anniversary of the Queen's death, having previously ceded ownership of the hospital to the public. The construction of the hospital was carefully planned by a commission presided by the King, and comprising Bernardino Ant√≥nio Gomes Jr., Francisco Ant√≥nio Barral, the Baron of Kessler, Dr. Simas, the Count of Ponte, and General Filipe Folque (Director-General of Geodesic and Cartographic Works). After several contacts with foreign specialists in London, Berlin, and Paris, the chosen project was that of British architect Albert Jenkins Humbert, on the recommendation of Prince Albert. When it was built, Queen Stephanie's Hospital was considered a model children's hospital, encompassing all the modern improvements in hospital construction of the day. Florence Nightingale wrote, on her Notes on Hospitals that \\"if children's hospitals are to be built at all, this is the kind of plan that should be adopted\\", calling its wards the best in Europe. Bernardino Ant√≥nio Gomes, the King's personal physician, wrote that \\"the Bemposta Hospital has the elegance not of lavishness, but of simplicity and harmony\\" and that \\"its magnificence is not that of luxury and sumptuosity, but that of hygiene\\".

Queen Stephanie's Hospital is also notable for having been the place where Saint Jacinta Marto was hospitalised, and in due course died, in 1920 after having succumbed to the great influenza pandemic that swept through Europe following the end of the First World War. By February 1920, Jacinta had developed purulent left pleurisy with fistulisation and osteitis of the 7th and 8th rib. On 10 February, the chief surgeon, Dr. Leonardo de Sousa Castro Freire, assisted by Dr. Elvas removed two ribs only under local anesthetic, since, because of the condition of her heart, she could not be fully anesthetised: she suffered terrible pain, which she said would help to convert many sinners. On 19 February, Jacinta asked the hospital chaplain who heard her confession to bring her Holy Communion and administer Extreme Unction because she was going to die \\"the next night\\". He told her that her condition was not that serious and that he would return the next day. The following day Jacinta was dead.A detailed account of the lives, illnesses and deaths of Francisco and Jacinta Marto is given in de Marchi, John, The True Story of Fatima, 1950 edition, entire text on line, retrieved 19 October 2007.

The book centers on the 1951 New York Giants scheme to read opposing catchers' finger signals relayed from catcher to pitcher with a telescope in the center-field clubhouse during the latter part of the 1951 Major League Baseball season. This led to baseball's famous Shot Heard 'Round the World, when Bobby Thomson hit a three-run homer in the bottom of the ninth inning against Brooklyn Dodgers pitcher Ralph Branca, resulting in winning the three game playoff series and the National League (NL) pennant, with a 5-4 win over the Dodgers. \\"It's been described as the greatest baseball game ever played, and you don't have to be a baseball fan to mark the anniversary.\\" The book expands on an article that Prager wrote in 2001 for the Wall Street Journal. Background 2001 Wall Street Journal article Joshua Prager originally wrote about the signal stealing scheme in a 2001 Wall Street Journal article entitled \\"Was the '51 Giants Comeback a Miracle, Or Did They Simply Steal the Pennant?\\" Tie-breaker series The 1951 National League tie-breaker series was a best-of-three playoff series at the conclusion of Major League Baseball's (MLB) 1951 regular season to decide the winner of the National League (NL) pennant. The games were played on October 1, 2, and 3, 1951, between the New York Giants and Brooklyn Dodgers. It was necessary after both teams finished the season with identical win‚Äìloss records of 96‚Äì58. It is most famous for the walk-off home run hit by Bobby Thomson of the Giants in the deciding game, which has come to be known as baseball's \\"Shot Heard 'Round the World\\". Consequently, the Giants advanced to the 1951 World Series, in which they were defeated by the New York Yankees. In baseball statistics, the tie-breaker series counted as the 155th, 156th, and 157th regular season games by both teams; all events in the games were added to regular season statistics.\\" The Dodgers rebounded to win the National League pennant in 1952, but lost the 1952 World Series to the Yankees four games to three. Thomson's dramatic three-run homer came in the ninth inning of the decisive third game of a three-game playoff for the pennant in which the Giants trailed, 4‚Äì1.

Bisson (8 April 1905 ‚Äì 8 December 1984) was a Brigadier General in the United States Marine Corps who served in both World War II and the Korean War. A naval aviator and communications engineer, he was at the forefront of the Marine Corps' use of radar for early warning and fighter direction. In 1943, as a member of VMF(N)-531, he supervised the installation and operation of the Marine Corps' first Ground-controlled interception (GCI) equipment utilized in a combat zone. During the Battle of Okinawa he commanded the headquarters responsible for coordinating the Marine Corps' ground based air defense units. After the war he commanded Marine Air Control Group 1 and Marine Aircraft Group 13 and also served with the 1st Marine Aircraft Wing during the Korean War. His last assignment was as the Commanding Officer of Marine Corps Air Station Miami, Florida. BGen Bisson's last day on active duty was 31 December 1958. He died from a heart attack a little more than three months later on 19 March 1959 in Solvang, California. Early Years Robert Omer Bisson was born in Abingdon, Illinois on 8 September 1908. He graduated from high school in 1927 and attended the University of Illinois for one year prior to entering the United States Naval Academy in 1928. He graduated on 6 June 1932 and was commissioned a Second Lieutenant in the United States Marine Corps that same day. Pre-war Marine Corps service From July 1932 until June 1933 he attended the Marine Officer's Basic Course. In July 1933 he began his first assignment with the Marine Detachment on board the USS Oklahoma (BB-37). In July 1934 he transferred to the Marine Barracks at Mare Island Naval Shipyard in Vallejo, California. His first assignment with the Fleet Marine Force began in October 1934 when he was assigned to 1st Battalion, 6th Marines at the Marine Corps Base in San Diego, California. Capt Bisson was selected to transition to aviation and in June 1936 he reported to Naval Air Station Pensacola, Florida. He graduated flight training becoming a naval aviator on 27 July 1937. His first duty station as part of Marine Aviation was at Naval Air Station North Island in Coronado, California. In May 1940 he was transferred to the 1st Marine Aircraft Wing (1st MAW) based at Marine Corps Air Facility Quantico, Virginia and assigned to Marine Observation Squadron 1 (VMO-1) which was later re-designated VMO-151. From February - August 1942 he attended the United States Army's Signal Corps School at Fort Monmouth, New Jersey. Here he received instruction on the new technology of radar. Additional schooling was received at the Electronics Specialist Course given at Harvard University and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology from August 1942 until February 1943. World War II From February - August 1942 he attended the United States Army's Signal Corps School at Fort Monmouth, New Jersey. Here he received instruction on the new technology of radar. Additional schooling was received at the Electronics Specialist Course given at Harvard University and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology from August 1942 until February 1943. Once his schooling was complete he joined the newly formed From February - August 1942 he attended the United States Army's Signal Corps School at Fort Monmouth, New Jersey. Here he received instruction on the new technology of radar. Additional schooling was received at the Electronics Specialist Course given at Harvard University and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology from August 1942 until February 1943. Upon graduation he joined the newly formed Marine Night Fighter Squadron 531 (VMF(N)-531) at Marine Corps Air Station Cherry Point, North Carolina as the officer in charge of their Ground Controlled Intercept detachment. In March 1943, Bisson and 4 enlisted men were sent on temporary duty to General Electric in Syracuse, New York to receive instruction on the SCR-527 early warning radar. Newly promoted to Lieutenant Colonel, Bisson and his small radar detachment departed for San Diego on 15 May. At the end of May they set up their GCI equipment near Marine Corps Air Station El Centro, California in order for the squadron to train a bit more prior to deployment. They departed San Diego on 30 July on board the USS Hammondsport (APV-2) arriving at Espiritu Santo on 28 August. The GCI equipment was initially sited at Liapari Point on 18 October however on 25 October it was moved to Pakoi Bay because of operational necessity. From this position they were able to provide early warning and fighter direction coverage for the Navy task forces that were sailing towards Bougainville and Choiseul Island. During this deployment Bisson and his men established radar sites near the coast because the dense foliage of the jungle and uneven terrain were less than ideal for radar operations. They were able to calibrate the SCR-527 for overwater detection including variances for changes in tides. They were also able to keep the gear running despite the problems posed by humidity in the Pacific. Bisson returned from overseas duty in December 1943. On 8 February 1944 he took command of Marine Air Warning Group 2 (MAWG-2) at Marine Corps Air Station Miramar, California. MAWG-2 was responsible for final training and equipping of Marine Corps Air Warning squadrons prior to their deployment overseas. He remained as the Group Commander until 26 December 1944. On 1 February he took command of Marine Aircraft Group 43 (MAG-43) at Marine Corps Air Station Ewa, Hawaii as they were in the final stages of preparation for the assault on Okinawa. For the upcoming battle, the 2nd Marine Aircraft Wing (2d MAW) had been identified as the headquarters for the Tactical Air Force (TAF) overseeing all land-based aircraft during the battle. Bisson's MAG-43 was subordinate to 2d MAW's headquarters and was the administrative headquarters for all members of the TAF's Air Defense Command (ADC) which had BGen William J. Wallace in command. Bisson departed Pearl Harbor on 22 February 1945 on board the USS Allendale. He went ashore on 2 April with BGen Wallace to reconnoiter a position for the ADC's headquarters. The headquarters was established about a half a mile southeast of Yontan Airfield in what is today the village of Yomitan. On 20 July he was promoted to full Colonel. Col Bisson remained in command of MAG-43 until 4 August. He departed for MCAS Miramar the next day. Post-war billets On 25 September 1945 LtCol Bisson took command of Marine Air Control Group 1 at Marine Corps Air Station Cherry Point, North Carolina. He stayed in this role until the summer of 1948. On 20 August 1948 he checked into the Armed Forces Staff College at Naval Support Activity Hampton Roads in Norfolk, Virginia. Upon graduation he was assigned as the Assistant Chief of Staff, G-1 for Marine Air Reserve Training Command out of Naval Air Station Glenview, Illinois. From the summer of 1953 through 2 June 1954 he served as the Commanding Officer of Marine Aircraft Group 13 at Marine Corps Air Station Kaneohe Bay, Hawaii In 1955, after graduating from the United States Army War College he was assigned back to NAS Glenview as the Chief of Staff of the Marine Air Reserve Training Command. In July 1957 he began his final assignment in the Marine Corps as the Commanding Officer of Marine Corps Air Station Miami, Florida. Retirement, Death, and Legacy Robert Bisson was advanced to Brigadier General at retirement for having been commended for heroism in combat. Three months after his official retirement from the Marine Corps, BGen Bisson died from a heart attack in Solvang, California. He was survived by his wife Margaret and two daughters, Margaret and Barbara. BGen Bisson is buried in Arlington National Cemetery in Arlington, Virginia.

Precipitation runoff from the peak drains into Slesse Creek and Pierce Creek, both tributaries of the Chilliwack River. The mountain was named to honor Royal Canadian Air Force First Lieutenant Ronald E. MacFarlane, from nearby Chilliwack, who was killed in action on December 16, 1943, at age 21. The name was officially adopted on April 7, 1955, by the Geographical Names Board of Canada. Geology Mount MacFarlane is related to the Chilliwack batholith, which intruded the region 26 to 29 million years ago after the major orogenic episodes in the region. This is part of the Pemberton Volcanic Belt, an eroded volcanic belt that formed as a result of subduction of the Farallon Plate starting 29 million years ago.Cenozoic to Recent plate configurations in the Pacific Basin: Ridge subduction and slab window magmatism in western North AmericaCatalogue of Canadian volcanoes: Franklin Glacier During the Pleistocene period dating back over two million years ago, glaciation advancing and retreating repeatedly scoured the landscape leaving deposits of rock debris. The \\"U\\"-shaped cross section of the river valleys are a result of recent glaciation. Uplift and faulting in combination with glaciation have been the dominant processes which have created the tall peaks and deep valleys of the North Cascades area. The North Cascades features some of the most rugged topography in the Cascade Range with craggy peaks and ridges, deep glacial valleys, and granite spires. Geological events occurring many years ago created the diverse topography and drastic elevation changes over the Cascade Range leading to various climate differences which lead to vegetation variety defining the ecoregions in this area.

A boot path is visible on the northeast ridge on right Based on the K√∂ppen climate classification, Mount MacFarlane is located in the marine west coast climate zone of western North America. Most weather fronts originate in the Pacific Ocean, and travel east toward the Cascade Range where they are forced upward by the range (Orographic lift), causing them to drop their moisture in the form of rain or snowfall. As a result, the Cascade Mountains experience high precipitation, especially during the winter months in the form of snowfall.

In its native range, a species has co-evolved with pathogens, parasites and predators that limit its population. When it arrives in a new territory, it leaves these old enemies behind, while those in its introduced range are less effective at constraining them. The result is sometimes rampant growth that threatens native species and ecosystems.  Explanations for invasive species success  Ecologists have identified many potential reasons for the success of invasive species, including higher growth rates or seed production than native species, more aggressive dispersal, tolerance of environmental heterogeneity, more efficient use of resources, and phenological advantages such as an earlier or longer flowering season. Invasive species may have greater phenotypic plasticity in important traits than their native competitors, allowing them to tolerate more environmental variation, or exhibit the ability to evolve rapidly to adapt to their new conditions. In addition, some habitats, due to disturbances or other factors, may be more vulnerable to invasion than others. Most exotic species do not become invasive, and some authors suggest that those that do represent repeated and larger introductions that generate propagule pressure. Among the many explanations for invasive success, however, the enemy release hypothesis has had the most support.  Enemy release hypothesis  The enemy release hypothesis (ERH) is most often applied to invasive plants, but there is evidence for its usefulness in other systems, including fish, amphibians, insects, and crustaceans. The ERH assumes that: (1) herbivores, pathogens and parasites suppress plant population growth, (2) these enemies plague native plants more than immigrating non-native species, and (3) non-native plants are able to leverage this advantage into more rapid population growth. An early study of the flowering plant Silene latifolia found that about 60% of its invasive populations in North America were free from herbivory, while 84% of those in its native Europe exhibited damage from at least one herbivore. A study of almost 500 exotic plant species in the United States found that they were infected by 84% fewer fungi and 24% fewer virus species than in their native ranges. And a meta-analysis covering 15 exotic plant studies found the number of insect herbivores on average to be greater in their native than in their introduced range, with overall damage greater on native plants than on the introduced species. Support for the theory, however, is not universal. In some cases, native pathogens, parasites and herbivores present significant biotic resistance to potential invasive species, as do non-native enemies that may have arrived prior to the exotic plant. Enemy release may be weaker, too, when an exotic species is more closely related to native species in their introduced ranges, making them more likely to share herbivores or pathogens. In a meta-analysis of 19 research studies involving 72 pairs of native and invasive plants, invasive exotic species did not incur less damage than their native counterparts and, in fact, exhibited lower relative growth rates. In other cases invasive success was due not to release from herbivory but greater tolerance of it.  Related theories  The ERH is closely related to two other important theories for invasive species success: the evolution of increased competitive ability (EICA) and novel weapons hypotheses. EICA asserts that because exotic plants are released from the burden of defending themselves against herbivores in their native range, they evolve to reallocate those resources to traits, such as growth and seed production, that make them more formidable competitors in their introduced range. ERH is an ecological mechanism, while EICA rests on evolutionary adaptation. The experimental support for EICA is mixed. For example, Solidago altissima plants artificially released from herbivory became more competitive against other plant species. However, a meta-analysis of 30 studies that found evidence of evolutionary shifts in introduced species, showed no indication of a trade-off between herbivore defenses and growth. The novel weapons hypothesis is another perspective on the enemy release hypothesis. Some plants evolve chemical defenses to compete in their original range. In their introduced range, the native species are highly vulnerable to these chemicals because they have no prior experience with them, giving the exotic species a competitive advantage.  Practical applications  A final argument for the ERH lies in the success of biological control of some invasive species, in which herbivores or other enemies from their native environment are introduced to suppress population growth in their adopted range. For example, when conservationists sought to control the invasive St.-John‚Äôs-wort (Hyericum perforatum) in North America, they imported a leaf herbivore (Chrysolina quadrigemina) from its native range in Europe.

It was Bruch's most successful work in his own lifetime. German unification created a wave of patriotic euphoria across the country, and French war reparations created an economic windfall. The time was right for a new work with a theme of the love of homeland. It was popular in Germany and internationally and brought Bruch to Liverpool. Composition It occurred to Bruch to adapt the Homeric epic in September 1871 while he was searching for a new libretto. As he said ‚ÄúThe splendor of this primeval work of poetry became so clear to me that I could no longer dispel the thought of turning it into a series of lyrical scenes... The musical image of the entire work, its form, appeared clearly before my mind‚Äôs eye before I had written a single note.‚Äù He entrusted the work of transforming this detailed outline into a complete work to the librettist Wilhelm Paul Graff. Bruch's work on Odysseus (‚Äúa pleasure impossible to describe‚Äù) proceeded quickly and he had completed it by November 1872. A performance of the six scenes he had completed to date was staged in Bremen on 6 May 1872. When the work was published, it came out with French and English translations (by Natalia Macfarren) as well as the original German. Setting and significance Writing to his sister in 1871, Bruch said that he had selected Homer's narrative as in preference to a religious theme offering the ‚ÄòChristian lamentation and the poetic tears of Bach‚Äôs cantatas.‚Äù In 1873, writing to his publisher Simrock, Bruch said, \\"Biblical subjects have remained and still remain alien to me; the old Masters have produced so many powerful works in this area (i.e. sacred oratorio) that it is possible for us to create independent and original works only in conjunction with other subjects. It is not accidental that all oratorio projects since Mendelssohn have failed.\\" (Later in his career Bruch did however compose oratorios on religious themes). The classical setting was significant; it represented an alternative mythological universe to the Norse themes of Richard Wagner. In contrast to the nationalist mysticism of Wagner, the classical world embodied the hopes of German liberals that the new Reich would become an enlightened, new-classical civilisation. Structure The work is divided into twelve episodes: * 1. Orchestral Introduction * 2. Odysseus On Calypso's Island * 3. Odysseus In The Underworld * 4. Odysseus And The Sirens * 5. The Tempest At Sea * 6. Penelope's Lament * 7. Nausicaa * 8. The Banquet With The Phaiakes * 9. Penelope Weaving A Garment * 10. The Return * 11. Feast In Ithaca * 12. Final Chorus Bruch was careful to ensure that his work remained a dramatic piece of choral music and did not venture into the realm of the operatic. For this reason Penelope's suitors are not portrayed, and the scene where Odysseus kills them is omitted. A traditional religious oratorio had contrasting episodes of recitative and arias but Bruch created a single flowing narrative that did not adhere to this clear distinction. One reason for its eventual decline into obscurity may be that for such a heroic and moving subject, the work seems undramatic, sometimes laboured in its setting of the text, and disjointed in its episodes; there is no narrator to link the 12 self-contained sections. Early critical reception After Bruch directed its premi√®re in Barmen on 8 February 1873, the work was staged with great success and inspired the creation of many other secular oratorios. Bruch, much encouraged by this success, wrote others himself - Achilleus, Gustav Adolf and Das Lied vor der Glocke, but none repeated the outstanding success of Odysseus. During Bruch's lifetime Odysseus was one of his most popular and frequently performed works. Brahms admired it greatly and chose to conduct it himself in 1875 in the last concert he conducted at the Vienna Philharmonic. A performance in Liverpool in 1877 was to lead to Bruch's appointment as principal conductor of the Liverpool Philharmonic Society in 1880. By the end of 1875 it had received at least forty-two performances, and in 1893, when Bruch was made an honorary doctor by Cambridge University, the concert celebrating him opened with an excerpt from it. Later unpopularity The popularity of Odysseus declined rapidly after the First World War. In Britain audiences were no longer keen to listen to music by German composers. Internationally, the rise of modernism in music made Bruch's romantic style seem outdated and in Germany itself, tastes in the Weimar Republic no longer included works associated with the imperialist ambitions of the kaisers. Social changes also worked against Bruch's legacy. Odysseus was written for amateur choral societies, which had been enormously popular in the late nineteenth century. Choral singing was a very common hobby for educated people in Germany and other countries, but declined rapidly in the early twentieth century, and the music it depended on came to be seen as sentimental.

In November 2019, Wang sought political asylum in Australia, claiming to be a spy who was involved in the People's Republic of China's intervention in the affairs of Hong Kong SAR and Taiwan (ROC). The factual accuracy of his claims is disputed. Wang's case drew worldwide attention. Investigation Shanghai police stated that Wang is a convicted fraudster who left mainland China for Hong Kong on bogus travel documents. Online court records appear to confirm he had received a suspended sentence of 18 months from a Fujian court in October 2016. Wang has denied these allegations. The factual accuracy of these claims are disputed, because, according to Alex Joske, the strategic analyst who participated in 60 Minutes's investigation of Wang, Wang claimed he obtained a police check which was clear of any such convictions when he applied for Australian visa. Wang claims that he was involved in the PRC government's operation to support pro- Beijing media outlets in Taiwan and candidates in the 2018 Taiwanese local elections, with the ultimate goal to prevent incumbent ROC President Tsai Ing- wen's re-election in 2020. Wang also claimed to be involved in the abductions of the Causeway Bay Books booksellers in Hong Kong, although Lam Wing-kee, one of the abductees, does not recall meeting him and has reservations about his claims. Lam Wing Kee told Hong Kong media that Wang was likely just repeating details of the abduction that he had ‚Äúheard elsewhere,‚Äù dismissing his claim to have played any central role in the operation. The Australian reported in November 2019 that it had only took Australian security agencies less than a week to conclude that Wang \\"is not the high-level operative-turned-defector he claimed to be,‚Äù and that he \\"was, at most, a bit player on the fringes of the espionage community.\\" The Australian cited Macquarie University China researcher Adam Ni, who pointed out that Wang got the name of the Chinese military institution that he was supposedly working under wrong four times in his testimony. His claims and credibility \\"should be seen with skepticism,\\" Ni said. Korean-language experts also raised skepticism when they noted that the fake South Korean passport that Wang had claimed had been provided to him by his intelligence agency, was actually issued in a common name for women, not men. They stated if he had actually used it for travel, he would \\"almost certainly be detained\\" for having a name that appear female. Leonid Petrov, a Korean security expert at the Australian National University, also said the South Korean passport contained serious discrepancies. And questioned why would the Chinese intelligence ever equip their spies with crude forgeries? Critics pointed out that Wang does not speak Korean, hence the issuance and use of this fake passport for anything other than just ‚Äúflash‚Äù purposes is unprofessional for intelligence operations. Sky News host Sharri Markson reported in the Daily Telegraph that Wang may have only been engaged in low- level work for the Chinese. The Daily Telegraph had also reported that Australian intelligence officials had briefed the Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison on a report witheringly titled ‚ÄúChina Spy Farce‚Äù, with the consensus that it is ‚Äúhighly dubious‚Äù that Wang Liqiang was the high-level Chinese spy that he claims to be, and while Wang may have been involved in ‚Äúvery low-level‚Äù work, he did not operate in Australia and would ‚Äúnot have value‚Äù to the country.  Reactions   Australia  Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison described allegations of a Chinese plot to infiltrate Australia's parliament as \\"deeply disturbing\\". \\"I would caution anyone leaping to any conclusions about these matters. And that's why we have these agencies.\\" On 24 November 2019, the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation (ASIO) confirmed that Wang's allegations were being taken \\"seriously\\", but did not comment on the merits thereof. Labor leader Anthony Albanese said the reports were \\"of real concern\\", and that Wang might have a \\"legitimate claim for asylum\\". Liberal member-of-parliament Andrew Hastie called Wang a \\"friend of democracy\\", and also called for the government to grant Wang's asylum application. James Laurenceson, acting director of the Australia-China Relations Institute at the University of Technology Sydney criticised the Australian media for pushing the Wang story too hastily without having it verified first . He stated ‚ÄúIt is a fact that Australian journalists, commentators and politicians more hawkish on China and more invested in the ‚ÄòChina threat‚Äô narrative were the ones breaking the Wang Liqiang story and talking it up. The Wang Liqiang story is just the latest example of claims running ahead of an evidence base in Australia.‚Äù Speaking on national television, Australian Treasurer Josh Frydenberg declined to comment on ASIO's \\"operational matter,\\" but said that the Australian government \\"makes no apologies for the laws that [it's] introduced around foreign interference and foreign influence.\\"  Mainland China  Ma Xiaoguang, leader of the Taiwan Affairs Office of the Chinese State Council, claimed that \\"the mainland never involves itself in Taiwanese elections, and these reports are complete nonsense.\\" He further stated that whoever \\"made up\\" this story intends to meddle with the Taiwanese election unjustly and that he believed \\"Taiwanese compatriots will see this right through.\\" The Jing'an Branch of the Shanghai Public Security Bureau issued an official statement that Wang was a fugitive in a fraud case and that both his Chinese passport and Hong Kong permanent resident identity card were forged. On 27 November, Chinese state-owned Global Times released an \\"exclusive\\" court video apparently showing Wang on trial for fraud, admitting all charges, and given a suspended sentence of 18 months. However, some critics argued that the video is likely doctored, because it appears \\"blurry\\" and \\"heavily edited,\\" and features mostly the back of the subject.  Taiwan  Wang claimed that he worked with the Hong Kong-based company China Innovation Investment Limited to infiltrate Hong Kong universities and media with pro-Communist Party of China operatives. On 26 November, Taiwanese authorities detained and questioned Chinese businessman Xiang Xin and his wife Qing Gong, executives of China Innovation whom Wang identified as Chinese intelligence operatives. The two were accused of running a spy network directed by high-level members of the People's Liberation Army, Nie Li and Ding Henggao. Han Kuo-yu, the Kuomintang presidential candidate, rejected the claim and said if he had taken even a single dollar (from the Chinese government) for the election campaign, he would withdraw from the election immediately. Weng Yen-ching, former deputy director of Taiwan's Military Intelligence Bureau, said in an interview with United Daily News that Wang \\"obviously isn't\\" a Chinese secret agent. According to him, Wang's \\"lies\\" were \\"grossly unprofessional\\" and demonstrated an \\"extremely shallow\\" understanding of the Chinese intelligence establishment. For example, Wang claimed to be from the PLA's General staff Department, which had been defunct since 2016. He posited that Wang has already been turned away by ASIO, and is simply \\"putting on a show\\" in a bid to gain Australian permanent residency. Chen Hu-men, another former deputy director of the Military Intelligence Department, told the media that Wang's descriptions were \\"blatantly pretentious.\\" Chen further stated that working in 3 jurisdictions at once, which Wang claims to have done, is a \\"major taboo\\" in the intelligence community. President Tsai responded that China obviously intends to interfere with Taiwanese elections. On 25 November, she commanded that the Taiwanese National Security Bureau \\"begin an investigation immediately.\\"  See also  * 2019 Australian Parliament infiltration plot * Australia-China relations * Cross-Strait relations References Category:Chinese defectors Category:Living people Category:Cross-Strait relations Category:Australia‚ÄìChina relations Category:November 2019 events in Australia Category:Right of asylum in Australia Category:Espionage in China Category:Year of birth missing (living people) ","title":"Wang Liqiang"},{"id":"62424806","text":"Vladimir Strizhevsky (1892‚Äì1970) was a Russian actor, screenwriter and film director.

Amateur career After training on and off as a youngster, Smith began to take boxing seriously at the age of 16. During a career in which he compiled a record of 32‚Äì11 while representing Poole ABC, he fought in several ABA Championships, reaching the finals in 2013 and 2016; losing out to Jack Massey at 86kg and Cheavon Clarke at 91kg respectively. Professional career Smith made his professional debut on 16 September 2017 under the tutelage of Shane McGuigan, scoring a first-round technical knockout (TKO) victory over Russ Henshaw at the O2 Academy in Bournemouth, Dorset. After compiling a record of 9‚Äì0 (8 KO), he faced fellow undefeated British prospect Richard Riakporhe (9‚Äì0, 8 KO) for the WBA Inter-Continental cruiserweight title on 20 July 2019 at the O2 Arena in London. The fight was televised live on Sky Sports Box Office as part of the undercard of Dillian Whyte vs. Oscar Rivas. Smith suffered his first professional defeat via split decision (SD) over ten rounds. Two judges scored the bout in favour of Riakporhe with 97‚Äì92 and 95‚Äì94, while the third scored it 96‚Äì93 to Smith. On 23 November 2019, he fought Craig Glover at the M&S; Bank Arena (formerly Echo Arena), Liverpool, with the vacant Commonwealth cruiserweight title on the line. The fight was televised live on Sky Sports in the UK and streamed live on DAZN in the US as part of the undercard for Callum Smith's world title defence against John Ryder. The first-round saw both fighters engage at close-quarters, with Glover suffering a cut above his left eye in the first minute of the bout from an accidental clash of heads. In the second-round, Smith stayed at range behind the jab, landing hooks and straight right hands to bloody Glover's nose. Round three was much of the same, with Smith landing counter hooks as Glover tried to work on the inside. Glover had more success in the fourth, with both fighters landing solid jabs and hooks to the head. In the final 10 seconds of the round, Smith hurt Glover with a straight right hand and followed up with a four punch combination culminating with a left hook which dropped Glover to the canvas seconds before the bell sounding. Less than a minute into the fifth, Smith began to land a variety of heavy punches to the head of Glover, scoring a second knockdown with a powerful left hook to the jaw. Glover was able to get back to his feet before the referee's count of ten only to be met by more heavy shots from Smith, who landed two straight right hands to the side of Glover's head which promoted referee Mark Lyson to call a halt to the contest as Glover was knocked down for a third time, handing Billam-Smith the Commonwealth title via fifth-round TKO. He made the first defence of his Commonwealth title on 7 August 2020, facing Nathan Thorley at the Matchroom Sport headquarters in Brentwood, Essex, live on Sky Sports as part of the undercard for Terri Harper's world title defence against Natasha Jonas. Following a fast start from Smith, he scored a knockdown at the end of the first round after three left hooks forced Thorley to go down on one knee. After trapping Thorley in a corner in the second round, Smith landed a series of right hands to send Thorley to the canvas for a second time. Smith scored a third knockdown with another right hand, with Thorley again making it back to his feet only to see referee Mark Lyson call a halt to the contest, handing Smith a second-round TKO victory to retain his Commonwealth title.

She is also a researcher at the Abdul Latif Jameel Poverty Action Lab (J-PAL LAC), which is a global research center that aims to reduce poverty and improve life quality of people in the Caribbean and Latin America. Lafortune holds a Ph.D. in Economics from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), Cambridge, Massachusetts and her research interests focus on four main fields, including issues related to immigration, as well as economic history, family, labor and development economics.  Education and work  Lafortune graduated with a B.A. in Economics (with honors) and Minor in International Development from McGill University in 2002. She then received her M.A. in Economics from the University of Toronto in 2003. She pursued further studies and earned her Ph.D. in Economics from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in 2008, where she wrote her final dissertation \\"Essays on Matching, Marriage and Human Capital Accumulation\\". She also served for the Government of Canada as an economist at the Economic Studies and Policy Analysis Division of the Department of Finance from 2003 to 2004.  Career and research  Lafortune's research focus revolves around four fields: * Labor Economics * Family Economics * Immigration * Development Economics  Selected works  = Working paper = ‚ÄúBaby Commodity-Booms? The Impact of Commodity Shocks on Fertility Decisions and Outcomes\\" In this research paper, Lafortune collaborates with Francisco Gallego to analyze the impact economic booms have on fertility rates in small, emerging, open economies. Drawing from previous works on the topic, Lafortune re-evaluates empirical data that suggests a positive relationship between economic prosperity and birth rates, births and worse health outcomes of infants, and their relationship to family formation variance. The authors found that the birth rate increases during economically prosperous periods, but this is due to the expansion of families formed before the boom rather than the creation of new families during these periods. The opportunity costs faced by women to choose to have or not to have children are influenced by public policy. Additionally, the opportunity costs are different among women starting a family and women having more children, a present gap in previous literature. Lafortune and Gallego suggest future research to focus on the impact of fatherhood on their assessments. = Publication = \\"Marry for What? Caste and Mate Selection in Modern India\\" Lafortune writes this paper in collaboration with economists Abhijit Banerjee, Esther Duflo and Maitreesh Ghatak for the American Economic Journal. The study focuses on the influence caste systems have on marriage decisions among men and women in India, over economic differentials. This question is relevant since it accounts for ‚Äústatus‚Äù-like attributes (caste) that are missing in the literature of marriage economics, suggesting that economic reasons are the main influence regarding marriage choices in India and other developing countries. Lafortune and her colleagues find that caste is highly valued by Indians who are looking to get married. However, data suggest that this value might change in the future as more people marry outside their caste (a trade-off between caste and higher economic status, education, and/or beauty). Control variables include age, education, wage, location, family origins, and height. The authors conclude that caste preference has not been undermined by economic forces, but the changing trends on these preferences should be analyzed further.  Research publications  * Lafortune, J.

The town of Portage, New York and the hamlet of Portageville are nearby. The three major waterfalls are known as the Upper , Middle , and Lower Falls and pass through Portage Canyon in the southern section of the state park. A stone bridge just below the Lower Falls is part of a trail in the park. The Middle Falls are the highest. Above the Upper Falls, an active railroad trestle passes over the gorge. Thomas Cole painted the falls in 1839. Stereoscopic views of the falls were also created. In 1843, geologist James Hall studied the rock formations and strata in the area. His publication included hand colored drawings of the falls.

The name comes after a 13th-century pear tree that shaded the source spring at the fountain's location. The fountain has also been known as the ' (Laundry of the Pear Tree Canals). Background Detail of the Topographia de la Villa de Madrid . The Ca√±os del Peral Fountain is represented in the upper right, with the number 33. The fountain was documented variously in the 15th century as Hontanillas or Fontanillas and is thought to have been one of the first Turkish baths in Madrid. Water from the canals supplied the population of Madrid through a distribution system made up of water carriers. The water was also used by the ‚Äúlavadores,‚Äù or clothes washers. The discovered part was built in the 17th century and was originally in length, occupying a small valley at the end of Arenal Street. It featured granite ashlars in a padded style. The fountains shared the water from the spring with the royal palace until the mid 18th century. The spring water was transported to the palace via an aqueduct named the Amaniel. It continued to be used as a fountain until it was buried in 1809. It was buried deep, along with the spring's source, and was paved over to prepare for the building of the Teatro Real, the Plaza de Oriente, and the Plaza de Isabel II. Work began on reconditioning the √ìpera Metro station that served the Teatro Real and the two plazas in 2009, which caused the fountain to be rediscovered. Once the restorative work was completed in 2011 the upgraded station, now including an archeological museum, was opened to the public. The museum showcases the fountain of the canals along with other relics found at the site, such as original parts of the Arenal Sewer, and the royal Amaniel Aqueduct. The museum, accessed from the lobby of the √ìpera station, is in size and free to anyone with a metro ticket. Madrid has a reputation for being built on water. A replica of a small part of the fountains was erected in the Plaza Isabel to honour the discovery.

The building used a semi-cooperative ownership model, in which the residents of the largest apartments had an ownership stake in the building while smaller units were rented; the cooperative model and its variations were popular with luxury apartments, as they gave residents control over how the building was run and who could live there. Architects Rissman & Hirschfeld designed the Tudor Revival building; while the Tudor Revival was one of many revival styles that became popular in the early twentieth century, it was relatively uncommon among Chicago's luxury apartments. The building's design features terra cotta arches around the entrances, ornamental terra cotta panels between the windows of the upper and lower floors, a balustrade atop the sixteenth floor, and a two-story penthouse with a broken parapet.

The couple are believed to have lived between 1450 and 1550 - between the year the convent was established and the year the graveyard was secularised. Analysis by archaeologists confirmed that the skeletons belong to a man and a woman around 30 years of age. The couple were buried facing each other, and with their hands interlocked. The male skeleton appears to have died due to a fight or an accident as his sternum is broken, caused by a blow from a blunt object. Another archaeologist places the blame for the man's death on a broken hip. The cause of death of the female is unclear from her skeleton.

Portrayed by Jack Nicholson, the character was based on the iconic supervillain the Joker. His name is a play on the word, Jackanapes.Amazing Heroes #159, pg. 45, Andy Mangel's Backstage: With Sam Hamm This depiction is notable for being one of the first adaptations of the character to have a distinct first and last name, as well as one of the few instances that shows his origins. This iteration of the Joker is a psychopathic mobster who serves as the right-hand man of Gotham City crime boss Carl Grissom, until the latter attempts to have Napier killed. When he encounters the city's new vigilante superhero Batman amid surviving the assassination attempt, Napier ends up falling into a vat of acid at Axis Chemicals. This consequently results in his skin being bleached white, his hair turned green, and a macabre smile created on his face due to a ricocheted bullet off Batman's armour. Soon afterwards, Napier becomes \\"the Joker\\" and kills Grissom to takeover the city's gangland underworld and also wage war on Batman. Ever since Nicholson's portrayal in the film, the name Jack Napier has been used by various adaptations of the character. This interpretation of the character is also responsible for the deaths of Thomas and Martha Wayne, the parents of Batman's alter-ego Bruce Wayne. Fictional character biography Early life Even as a child, Jack Napier was psychologically unstable, but extremely intelligent, showing an advanced knowledge of chemistry, art and science; he was also in and out of juvenile detention facilities for crimes such as arson, assault, and grand theft auto. Napier was charged with assault with a deadly weapon at age 15. When Napier is 26 years old, he and his accomplice Joe Chill rob and murder Thomas and Martha Wayne in the alleyway behind the Monarch Theatre, leaving their young son Bruce as the only survivor. Napier at first prepares to kill Bruce as well, saying to the boy, \\"Have you ever danced with the devil in the pale moon light?\\" - his favorite thing to say right before killing someone. Chill entreats him to run before the police arrive, however, so Napier spares Bruce and leaves, saying in passing, \\"See ya around, kid.\\" Becoming the Joker Napier prior to his disfigurement Years later, Napier moves up in the ranks of the Gotham City mafia, eventually becoming the right-hand-man of crime boss Carl Grissom (Jack Palance). Napier is noted for having a signature deck of cards, with a bullet hole through each card. Napier privately dislikes Grissom, dismissing him as a \\"tired old man\\", and carries on an affair with his boss' moll, Alicia Hunt (Jerry Hall). Grissom finds out about the affair, and in addition of knowing that Napier is staging a coup, sets him up to be killed by Lt. Max Eckhardt (William Hootkins), a GCPD cop on his payroll, at Axis Chemicals, where he sends Napier under the pretense of destroying incriminating documents. Grissom's plan fails, as Gotham City Police Commissioner James Gordon (Pat Hingle) intervenes, as does the masked vigilante, Batman (Michael Keaton). Napier had two chances to escape unharmed, but he squandered them for attempting to kill Gordon and then kills Eckhart. He then shoots at Batman, who deflects the bullet with one of his gauntlets, ricocheting it into Napier's face. Reeling from the pain, Napier loses his balance and falls into a vat of chemicals. Napier survives, but the chemicals turn his skin chalk white, his lips red, and his hair green, while a botched attempt at plastic surgery leaves him with a permanent rictus grin. Driven insane by his reflection, Napier - now calling himself \\"Joker\\" - kills Grissom and takes over his operations . Styling himself as a \\"homicidal artist\\", Joker becomes obsessed with \\"outdoing\\" Batman, who he believes is stealing the spotlight from him. Aided by his right-hand man Bob (Tracey Walter), Joker begins poisoning multiple cosmetic products with \\"Smylex\\", a chemical agent that causes its victims to laugh hysterically as they die, leaving their corpses with a permanent smile. He also turns Alicia into one of his \\"masterpieces\\" by disfiguring her face and drugging her into submission; she eventually commits suicide. Joker also becomes obsessed with photographer Vicki Vale (Kim Basinger), and attacks her while she meets with her boyfriend, billionaire Bruce Wayne - Batman's alter ego. Believing Wayne to be harmless, Joker taunts him with his signature line and shoots him. Wayne had been wearing body armor, however, and survives; he also recognizes Napier as his parents' killer. Downfall and death Joker announces via television broadcast that he plans to give out $20 million at Gotham City's 200th anniversary parade, and challenges Batman to meet him there. Joker keeps his promise of giving away the money, before releasing an airborne toxic version of Smylex onto the crowd via parade floats, killing dozens of people. Batman arrives in the Batwing and dispatches of the balloons before Joker shoots the plane out of the sky with a grenade launcher that disguised as a comically- long prank gun, causing it to crash on the steps of the Gotham Cathedral. Joker kidnaps Vale and takes her to the belfry of the cathedral, where Batman confronts him; during the ensuing struggle, they admit that they \\"made each other\\" after Napier remembers that night in the alley. Thus, this reveals he knows his victims' identities and this leads him to realize Batman's. Batman manages to knock Joker off the balcony, only for him to drag Batman and Vale down with him, causing them to dangle off the ledge. Joker taunts the two of them as a helicopter piloted by his henchmen arrives to take him to safety. Batman fires a grappling hook around Joker's leg, tying him to a gargoyle. The gargoyle eventually breaks free from its foundations, sending Joker falling to his death. Commissioner Gordon finds Joker's corpse, with an activated laugh- box in his pocket. Production Casting A multitude of actors were considered for the role of the Joker before Nicholson's casting. Robin Williams, Tim Curry, Willem Dafoe, Ray Liotta, David Bowie and James Woods were all considered. Tim Burton initially wanted to cast John Glover, but the studio insisted on using a movie star. John Lithgow met with Burton about the part, but during their discussion attempted to talk the budding director out of casting him, which would be something he would later regret. Lithgow was also director Joe Dante's first choice for the role of the Joker when he was attached to direct the film in the early 1980s. Jack Nicholson had been the studio's top choice since 1980. Jon Peters approached Nicholson as far back as 1986, during filming of The Witches of Eastwick. Peter Guber took Burton and Nicholson on a horseback riding excursion in Aspen to get the pair aquatinted and convince him to take the role. Nicholson's contract featured an \\"off-the- clock\\" agreement, specifying the number of hours he could have off, and allowed him to take time off to attend Los Angeles Lakers home games. Design As a part of Nicholson's contract, he was allowed to have approval over the makeup designer to create the look of the character. Nicholson chose Nick Dudman as his makeup designer. Dudman used an acrylic- based makeup for the bleached white face. Dudman cited the scene in the art gallery where Napier gets splashed with water by Vicki Vale as being the most difficult effect to achieve. To achieve the smile, Dudman did a regular face cast of Nicholson with a relaxed face, then asked him to do another one while pulling the largest grin he could muster. Dudman attempted to sculpt a smile that was always there, but required Nicholson to smile in the makeup to take full effect, but wanted to ensure that the prosthetics didn't dilute Nicholson's face. The character's origin in the film of falling into a vat of chemicals was inspired by the then-recent graphic novel Batman: The Killing Joke, written by Alan Moore. However, certain elements of the character's origin were changed, including making him having been a gangster rather than a failed stand-up comedian, and cutting the Red Hood persona from the character. Napier is seen to have always been a criminal, having been responsible for the deaths of Thomas and Martha Wayne, rather than Joe Chill, who instead serves as his accomplice. Planned return In the cancelled fifth film in the series, titled Batman Unchained, Nicholson was intended to return as the character via hallucinations from Scarecrow's Fear Toxins. The character of Harley Quinn was also rumoured to have been involved in the story, and this adaptation was supposed to be the character's daughter, rather than girlfriend, who was seeking revenge on Batman for the death of her father. However, due to the critical and commercial failure of Batman & Robin, the project was cancelled. The Batman series would be rebooted in 2005 by director Christopher Nolan with Batman Begins. The sequel to the film, The Dark Knight, featured the Joker portrayed by actor Heath Ledger. Ledger died before the film's release, and won the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor posthumously. In other media Television *The design of the character was also used as an inspiration for Jeremiah Valeska, portrayed by Cameron Monaghan on the television series Gotham up until the series finale episode \\"The Beginning...\\". *In the Arrowverse television crossover \\"Crisis on Infinite Earths\\", establishing that the setting of Batman and its sequel Batman Returns as existing on a parallel Earth to the Arrowverse series. During the first part of the crossover, it is stated on the headline of a newspaper read by Alexander Knox that \\"Batman Captures Joker\\" despite of the latter supposedly having been dead for years since the film's events, implying either that someone may have succeeded Napier as the Joker, that Napier has been resurrected, or that Napier never actually died. *In the Batwoman episode \\"I'll Be Judge, I'll Be Jury,\\" a television news report makes a passing reference to Jack Napier as the real name of The Joker where he was prosecuted by assistant district attorney Angus Stanton. The episode \\"A Narrow Escape\\" implied that Joker died in battle against Batman. Reception Nicholson's portrayal as The Joker was acclaimed by fans and critics alike. For his performance as the character, Nicholson was nominated for the Golden Globe for Best Actor in a Musical or Comedy, but lost to Morgan Freeman in Driving Miss Daisy. Nicholson was also nominated for the BAFTA Award for Best Actor in a Supporting Role by the British Academy of Film and Television Arts but lost to Ray McAnally in My Left Foot. Nicholson's adaptation of the character was placed as the 45th best movie villain of all time on the American Film Institute's list of 100 Heroes and Villains. Ironically, Michael Keaton's Batman placed as the 46th greatest hero on the same list. Praises from future successors Heath Ledger, who portrayed the character in Christopher Nolan's 2008 film The Dark Knight, has cited Nicholson's portrayal as an influence on his interpretation of the character, stating \\"This character was too good to turn down. And yes, it would be a crime to attempt to [step in or to] follow Jack Nicholson's footpath that he so heavily stands into my memory of The Joker. I mean, I adore what he did and him in general.\\" Mark Hamill, who voiced the character in Batman: The Animated Series, as well as in the Batman: Arkham video game series, has also cited Nicholson's adaptation of the character as an influence, but was told by show producers to avoid using Nicholson's Joker as a direct source of inspiration. Have you ever Danced with the Devil in the Pale Moonlight? The character's quote \\"Have you ever danced with the devil in the pale moonlight?\\" has become synoymous with the character as well as one of the character's most iconic phrases. The quote was nominated for the American Film Institute's 100 Movie Quotes list, but did not make the list. The quote was the title track for the unreleased song written by Prince for his soundtrack for the film. The track, titled \\"Dance with the Devil\\", was cut by Prince due to the darker tone of the song not fitting in with the rest of the upbeat songs on the soundtrack. It was replaced at the last second with \\"Batdance\\". Throughout the music videos for the singles released from the album, Prince was dressed as an amalgam of Nicholson's Joker and Keaton's Batman in a persona he titled Gemini. Nicholson's Joker can be heard in soundbytes during songs like \\"Batdance\\" and \\"Partyman\\". Legacy Since the film's release, many different interpretations of the character of the Joker have featured Jack Napier as his real name. Batman: White Knight Most notably, the alias was used in the comic series Batman: White Knight, where The Joker is seemingly cured of his insanity, and takes up the civilian name of Jack Napier.

She was known as the Queen of Malibu as well as the Founding Mother of Malibu and L.A.'s first high-profile female environmentalist. She holds the distinction of being the first female to serve as president of a railroad company. Additionally, she founded Marblehead Land Company in 1921, and most notably, the Malibu Potteries in 1926, the first business in Malibu. The company originated Malibu tile, and the venture became one of Southern California's most successful of its kind alongside Catalina Pottery, Gladding, McBean, and Batchelder tile. Rindge also founded the Malibu Movie Colony, building and renting cottages‚Äîand later selling them‚Äîto early Hollywood stars such as Bing Crosby, Gloria Swanson, and Mary Pickford. She fought bitterly to preserve her family's rancho, the Rancho Topanga Malibu Sequit which extended from Los Flores Canyon in Malibu into Ventura County. Rindge successfully diverted the course of the Southern Pacific Railway by fighting their efforts to connect their Santa Barbara end terminus with Santa Monica; the route would have been coastal, not only infringing on the family ranch but destroying the natural beauty and topography of the Pacific Coast. In the process, Rindge constructed the Malibu Pier. Rindge subsequently became known for her battle to keep the Pacific Coast Highway‚Äîat the time, Roosevelt Highway‚Äîfrom accomplishing the same and similar goals. Rindge also built the 100-foot-high Rindge Dam. Furthermore, she built what became the Franciscan order's Serra Retreat. Rindge is also known as donor of the land upon which her daughter and son-in-law's home, the historic Adamson House, was built. Early life Rindge was born Rhoda May Knight in 1864, the eighth child of James and Rhoda Roxanna Lathrop Knight. She grew up on a sheep farm outside Trenton, Michigan with 12 siblings. By age 22, she was working as a math teacher at a local schoolhouse. Knight's family was strictly Methodist. Her aunt, Emily Lathrop Preston, the founder and proprietor of a cult-like religious faith-healing health colony in Northern California, first brought Knight out west. Back in Michigan, Knight was paid a visit by Frederick Rindge, who had been a client at Preston's colony. He had seen a photograph of her on Preston's piano, felt enchanted, and asked Preston for her blessing in romantically pursuing her niece. Preston encouraged the coupling. Rindge had proceeded to write Knight letters, leading to their face-to-face acquaintance. Knight and Rindge determined their compatibility and within two days were engaged. They were then married within a week, moving out to California within the year, 1887, by way of first-class Pullman Palace rail car. Upon arrival, they stayed at Emily Preston's ranch before venturing to Southern California. Homes, children, and businesses The Rindge couple had three children: Samuel, Frederick Jr., and Rhoda Agatha. The family first settled into a home in Santa Monica. In the 1890s, the family began utilizing a Victorian ranch home they built in Malibu Canyon, which eventually burned down in a brush fire in 1903. They also had a home in Santa Monica. It had been Rindge Sr.'s dream to come to California for its temperate climate and what he had imagined as the American Riviera when he first came to California with his father on the first transcontinental railroad. He had always wanted a farm by the sea, and once he purchased the Malibu rancho as the final Spanish land grant owner of the property, he established a cattle ranch. He also became deeply involved in civic life, from serving as director of Edison Electric, founding Conservative Life Insurance Company, and promoting Temperance by helping close saloons in Santa Monica to building Santa Monica's First Methodist Episcopal Church and taking the post of vice president of Union Oil. When he died suddenly at the age of 48 in 1905, Rhoda May Knight Rindge was left with the totality of his business dealings, setting the stage for her unusual position at the time as a woman at the helm of a major family estate. Victory over Southern Pacific Railroad and construction of Malibu Pier Prior to her husband's death, there had been word that Southern Pacific intended to connect their Santa Barbara terminus with Santa Monica which would entail running tracks right through the vast 13,315-acre Rindge property. Frederick hatched a plan to take advantage of an obscure Interstate Commerce Commission law that stated if one railway ran through a property, there could be no other railway doing the same. Hence Rindge decided to build his own private track‚Äîa utilitarian one to service his cattle ranch‚Äîbut died before carrying out the plan, leaving the operation up to Rhoda May. She subsequently built the Malibu Pier and 15 miles of standard gauge track, known as the Hueneme, Malibu and Port Los Angeles Railway, that ran down the length of the pier, where a steam-powered crane lifted cattle hides and walnuts onto boats for shipment and grains onto land for cattle-feed. The operation kept Southern Pacific Railroad out of Malibu, diverting its course inland. Court battles over county roads and Roosevelt Highway Rindge had successfully won her Southern Pacific Railway battle, but on her victory's heels came homesteaders along the edge of her property demanding county roads to be laid through her ranch for the public good. Rindge was strictly opposed to the idea, entering the law office of O'Melveny & Myers in 1907 to take up the new fight against the Federal Government and People of the State of California. What ensued was an approximately 16-year fight costing Rindge over $1 million a year, first to keep out the roads, then Roosevelt Highway. The court cases were extremely complex and imbued with intense hostility, with Rindge sabotaging the public's efforts to lay roads with extreme measures. Such measures ranged from employing armed guards on horseback to patrol her property and enforce locked gates to digging up roads and replacing them with alfalfa and pigs. She waged civil suits, numbering in the hundreds, for trespass, libel, and defamation of character. Ultimately, she lost her county roads battle and, finally, her effort against Roosevelt Highway, enumerating four California Supreme Court cases and two United States Supreme Court cases, including Rindge Co. v. County of Los Angeles. Founding of Malibu Potteries In 1926, Rindge found herself land-rich and cash-poor due to her extensive court battles. In an effort to recoup her expenditures, she first drilled for oil on her property, establishing the Rindge derrick on Point Dume, but found none. However, she uncovered clay that she was told were ideal for tile-making. As the 1920s were a real-estate boom in Los Angeles, with thousands upon thousands of homes being built, and furthermore, in the tile-reliant Mission Revival, Mayan Revival, Spanish Colonial Revival, and Moorish Revival styles, a tile business promised to be lucrative. Thereafter, Rindge built Malibu Potteries a half mile east of her pier, right on the beach. She recruited renowned tile and glaze expert Rufus B. Keeler to run the factory. At its peak, 125 employees worked at the factory, producing 30,000 square feet of tile monthly. Women hand-painted tile with substances modernly-regarded as toxic, such as cadmium for oranges, uranium for oranges and reds, cobalt for blues, and lead for yellows. Methods included cuerda seca and cuenca, and patterns and iconography were inspired by books from an expensive library with which Rindge furnished the pottery. The potteries produced not only flat ceramic tiles for ceilings, walls, baseboards, and floors but also ceramic tile fountains, murals, urns, and bathroom built-ins like toothbrush holders and soap dishes. Construction of Serra Retreat and Malibu Movie Colony Despite the success of the pottery, Rindge still struggled to balance her finances, even as her net worth was estimated in the many millions in 1928. Hence, Rindge's next venture was the Malibu Movie Colony‚Äîcottages built on her beachfront by movie studio carpenters that were at first leased to figures in the nascent movie business such as Bing Crosby, Gloria Swanson, Mary Pickford, Anna Q. Nilsson, Dolores del R√≠o, Gary Cooper, Lana Turner, Adela Rogers St. Johns, Carole Lombard, and Clark Gable. In the meantime, Rindge commissioned a 99-foot yacht called The Malibu and began work on a three-wing, 55-room mansion, called the Rindge Castle, atop Laudamus Hill, overlooking the ocean and a vast span of Malibu, with views reaching out to the Pacific Palisades. Nine-thousand cases of Malibu Potteries tile were produced to adorn it, including a massive 13'x 59' all-tile faux Persian carpet, and hand-carved mahogany was to decorate it as well. When the Great Depression hit in 1929, followed by a kiln fire that destroyed most of Malibu Potteries in 1931 (closing the Potteries entirely by 1932), Rindge was plunged into further financial trouble. She could not afford to complete the Rindge Castle, and she was forced to sell off her Malibu Movie Colony properties other assets. By 1942, she was forced to sell her unfinished castle, with the buyer being the Franciscan order. Though most of the castle eventually burned to the ground in the 1970s, various parts were salvaged, including Malibu tile, and the property is still in the hands of the Franciscans as Serra Retreat. Bankruptcy, death, and legacy By 1938, Rindge was bankrupt. Her relationship with one of her sons was fractured, as he held her responsible for depleting the family wealth so severely between her court battles and lavish expenditures. Rindge died in 1941. Despite having been known to the public for so many years as more than ornery, her role in preserving Malibu's ecological landscape is still felt, as large swathes are not only preserved but protected as part of the Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation Area. This includes the sprawling, nature-ensconced Pepperdine University campus, for which her daughter's family donated the first 138 acres‚Äîoriginal Rindge ranch land. World-famous Surfrider Beach, where her pier still stands and the Malibu Potteries lot remains vacant, is protected by the Surfrider Foundation and officially declared as the first- ever World Surfing Reserve via the Save the Waves Coalition. It is also listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Meanwhile, Rindge's pier, regarded as a Southern California landmark, has been a recreation destination since the 1950s and home to fishermen since 1934.http://www.parks.ca.gov/pages/835/files/mailbu_pier_historic_preservation_honored_may_2009.pdf In 1933, Rindge gave permission for the pier to be used in what became the iconic movie King Kong starring Faye Wray, earning its place in film history. The pier was restored in 2009, earning its steward, California State Parks, the Los Angeles Conservancy Preservation Award. In Summer 2009, the pier became home to a surfing museum. As a community, Malibu is known for its wealthy entertainment business denizens, a stage Rindge set by being the first in the area to rent and sell homes to elite actors, directors, producers, and other aristocratic figures. In shaping the city in this way, she ultimately fulfilled her husband's vision for the region as an American Riviera. The tile Rindge produced remains in thousands of homes, the most extensive display remaining being her daughter's home, the Adamson House, slightly west of Rindge's pier, while Los Angeles City Hall, the Mayan Theater, The Roosevelt Hotel, the Geffen Playhouse, Dana Junior High School in San Pedro, and other public buildings across the United States‚Äîand even some abroad‚Äîstill contain their own examples of Malibu tile. Though predating the Potteries by roughly 20 years, hence containing no Malibu tile, the Rindge family home she and her husband built in West Adams Heights, the Frederick Hastings Rindge House, still stands‚Äîthe home Rindge lived in until she died. It is on the National Register of Historic Places and is designated as a Los Angeles Historic- Cultural Monument. Her dam in the Malibu Hills is still extant, though long out of use and plans are in place to tear it down. Rindge's life has been the subject of numerous print and online articles over time, and in 2017, a Los Angeles Times bestseller titled The King and Queen of Malibu: The True Story of the Battle for Paradise.

She starts off by looking historically at what has happened in financial markets that has encouraged political parties to legislate unpopular but needed policies for their economy. She derives that instances for change arrive out of necessity and are spurred on by crises of a large nature. In looking at how the political structures are set up in democracies, Curtis makes mention of the fact that because the effects of policies can take time for their effects to be realised in the economy, many politicians may operate on a 'short-term' basis where politics now plays an important role in whether a government will opt to place a policy in motion or not. She moves on to look at what has transpired in the US and UK markets mainly and categorises the pre-1980's as ruled by the boom and bust cycle in economics. This volatility in the market required the labour force to be flexible enough for people to move in accordance with the changes in the needs of the economy (i.e. the market). The 1990s introduced more stability in the cyclical movements of the markets and as a result, institutions became more reliable, which in turn according to Bronwyn Curtis, led the fluctuations in the market to be manipulated by changes in expectations. To tie this analysis to her topic, Curtis now makes the connection between changes in expectations impacting the market to the need for reliable policies. As an example, the case of the Bank of England stating independence from the government is introduced to look at how trust in the policies implemented by the bank and their commitment to said policies affected expectations and economic growth. In a slight shift in topic, Bronwyn Curtis shifts her focus from trust in institutions to her thoughts on Euroland and the adoption of the European Central Bank (as well as the adoption of the Euro across participating nation states across Europe). She brings up the worry that having participating nations each operating at different economic speeds brings up a disconnect if the policies implemented by the European Central Bank are to be the same across board. What this means is that a country like Italy, who might operate best with higher interest rates will be working with a country like France who might benefit from low and stable interest rates. She also brings up the fact that a small number of member countries in Euroland account for 2/3 of the total GDP for Euroland and yet each country will have 1 vote in the council. This will in turn lead the larger countries to bail out smaller countries who are in need at the cost of their individual growth for the stability of the collective. The 3 main conclusions from this chapter hold that first, the policies that are needed for economic growth and usually not easy for the governments in power to enforce and as such will need to be spurred on by changes in the financial markets that lead to unrest with the society. Second is that change is not undertaken voluntarily, and that similar to the first main point, a large enough crisis is necessary to spur on the demand for change. Lastly, that the way that the Economic and Monetary Union (EMU) in Europe has been designed, will eventually lead to tension between nation states and will eventually dissolve.

In 2018, Doherty was a Screen International Star of Tomorrow, and an Evening Standard Rising Star. In 2019, Doherty appeared as Princess Anne in the third season of The Crown. She knew little about the princess before being cast, and consequently spent hours studying Anne's family history and life. Doherty made a point of only watching footage of the princess at the age she was portraying her, rather than interviews of Anne in later life. Anne's voice is very different from Doherty's, being much lower in pitch; the actress spent time carefully learning and mimicking it, finding that it \\"was the key into her psyche\\". Doherty will also appear in the fourth season of the series. Doherty is a prolific theatre actor. Since graduating from Bristol Old Vic Theatre School in 2015, she has appeared in a number of productions at some of London's leading theatres. Doherty's performances have consistently garnered laudatory reviews from leading theatre critics. Michael Billington named Doherty as 'one of the year's greatest discoveries' after her performance in My Name Is Rachel Corrie, a one-woman play about activist Rachel Corrie. Doherty starred in Jack Thorne's play Junkyard, which lead What's On Stage reviewer Kris Hallett to write \\"Doherty is the star here, and by rights will soon be a star full-stop\\".

Il laissa un fils nomm√© Ouriyangkhata√Ø, qui, disent les Chinois, apres avoir soumis les tribus des Russes, des Polonais, et des Allemands, fut envoy√© pour conqu√©rir le royaume d'Awa et le Tonquin.\\" According to Jean-Pierre Abel-R√©musat, he participated in the conquest of Kievan Rus', conquest of Poland, and conquests of Germanic lands before being sent to China. Campaigns in China and Vietnam Invasion of Yunnan and Tibet During the first phase of the Mongol conquest of the Song dynasty in southern China, Uriyangkhadai led 3,000 Mongol cavalry in Sichuan. Uriyangkhadai led successful campaigns in the southwest of China against the Dali Kingdom alongside Kublai Khan and pacified tribes in Tibet after Kublai Khan's return to northern China, before turning east towards the Tr·∫ßn dynasty by 1257. Uriyangkhadai had significantly more military experience than Kublai Khan and proved invaluable in battle. Invasion of Vietnam In the autumn of 1257, Uriyangkhadai addressed three letters to ƒê·∫°i Vi·ªát emperor Tr·∫ßn Th√°i T√¥ng demanding passage through to southern China. After the three successive envoys were imprisoned in Thang Long (modern-day Hanoi), the capital of the Tr·∫ßn dynasty, Uriyangkhadai invaded ƒê·∫°i Vi·ªát with generals Trechecdu and Aju in the rear. According to Vietnamese sources, the Mongol army consisted of at least 30,000 soldiers of which at least 2,000 were Yi troops from the Dali Kingdom while Western sources estimate that the Mongol army consisted of about 100,000 Mongols with an additional 10,000 Yi soldiers. In 1258, Uriyangkhadai successfully captured Thang Long. While Chinese source material incorrectly stated that Uriyangkhadai withdrew from Vietnam after nine days due to poor climate, his forces did not leave until 1259. Invasion of Guangxi and Hunan Uriyangkhadai left Thang Long in 1259 to invade the Song dynasty in modern-day Guangxi as part of a coordinated Mongol attack with armies attacking in Sichuan under M√∂ngke Khan and other Mongol armies attacking in modern-day Shandong and Henan. Around 17 November 1259 while besieging Ezhou in Hubei, Kublai Khan received a messenger who described Uriyangkhadai's army advances from Thang Long to Tanzhou (modern-day Changsha) in Hunan via Yongzhou (modern-day Nanning) and Guilin in Guangxi. Uriyangkhada's army subsequently fought its way north to rejoin Kublai Khan's army on the northern banks of the Yangtze river, after which both armies returned to northern China due to the succession crisis that emerged as a result of M√∂ngke Khan's death at the Siege of Diaoyucheng on 11 August 1259.

Originally the regiment, like all Italian tank units, was part of the infantry, but on 1 June 1999 it became part of the cavalry. Operationally the regiment was last assigned to the Mechanized Brigade \\"Mantova\\".  History   World War II  The regiment's history began in Italian Libya in spring 1940 when the XXI Assault Tanks Battalion \\"Trombi\\" raised the LXII Assault Tanks Battalion and LXIII Assault Tanks Battalion. Both battalions were intended as supports for the two divisions deployed in Cyrenaica: the LXII for the 62nd Infantry Division \\"Marmarica\\" and the LXIII for the 63rd Infantry Division \\"Cirene\\". All three battalions were equipped with obsolete L3/35 tankettes. On 29 August 1940 both battalions were assigned to the I Tankers Group of the Libyan Tank Command under General Valentino Babini. In September 1940 the battalion participated in the Italian invasion of Egypt and only three months later it was annihilated on 11 December 1940 near Buq Buq during the Battle of Sidi Barrani. The battalion was officially declared dissolved during January 1941.  Cold War  On 2 December 1958 the army raised the III Tank Battalion equipped with M47 Patton tanks in Visco for the 59th Infantry Regiment \\"Calabria\\".

Tank and armored battalions created during the 1975 army reform were all named for officers, soldiers and partisans, who were posthumously awarded Italy's highest military honor the Gold Medal of Military Valour during World War II. The 63rd Tank Battalion's name commemorated 4th Tank Infantry Regiment Second Lieutenant Vincenzo Fioritto, who was killed in action on 10 September 1943 during the attempt to defend Rome against the German Operation Achse. Equipped with Leopard 1A2 main battle tanks the battalion joined the Mechanized Brigade \\"Isonzo\\". For its conduct and work after the 1976 Friuli earthquake the battalion was awarded a Bronze Medal of Army Valour, which was affixed to the battalion's war flag and added to the battalion's coat of arms. On 1 October 1986 the Infantry Division \\"Mantova\\" was disbanded and to retain the historically significant name \\"Mantova\\" the Mechanized Brigade \\"Isonzo\\" was renamed Mechanized Brigade \\"Mantova\\".

In Sinhalese, walauwa refers to a feudal/colonial manor house or ancestral residence of a native Ceylonese headmen. The walauwa were traditionally associated with the homes of the courtiers (radala), members of the royal court in Kandy. It was displaced by their colonial equivalents following the dissolution of the Kingdom of Kandy by the British. Ehelepola Nilame (1773 ‚Äì 1829) was a courtier of the Kingdom of Kandy. He was the first Adigar (a role which combined the powers of a prime minister and a chief justice) from 1811 to 1814 under the reign King Sri Vikrama Rajasinha. He was appointed by the king as the Disawe (local governor) of Sabaragamuva. In 1814 when the king believed he failed to suppress an uprising in Sabaragamuva he sent his forces to capture Ehelepola, who fled from Ratnapura to the British-occupied port of Kalutara. The king retaliated by brutally executing his wife, Kumarihamy and his four children, Loku Bandara, Madduma Bandara, Tikiri Manike and Dingiri Menike. Ehelepola then aided the British in launching an invasion of the Kingdom of Kandy and was instrumental in the Kandyan Convention that followed in March 1815, which led to the annexing of Kingdom of Kandy as part of the British Empire. Ehelepola offered his Walauwa to the Maha Sangha. Following the Uva Rebellion in 1818 the British imprisoned 53 chieftains, nobles and Buddhist prelates in the walauwa. Madugalle Nilame, Ellepola Nilame, Keppatipola Nilame and Kivulegedara Mohottirala were some of the inmates of this prison before they were executed by the British. Ehelapola Walauwa continued to be part of the Kandy prison complex until the country's independence in 1948. After independence, the walauwa continued to be part of Bogambara Prison. In 1998 it was designated as a 'Conserved Building' by the UNESCO as part of the listing of Kandy as a World Heritage City. On 8 July 2005 it was formally included as an 'Archaeological Protected Monument' by the government. On 13 July 2013 the site was transferred from the Department of Prisons to the President, Mahinda Rajapaksa for development as a Cultural and Urban Facility Centre. In June 2018 the walauwa was opened to the public for four days, along with Meda Wasala, Kandy Municipal Council building and Bogambara Prison, as part of a program to promote Kandy's heritage by the Urban Development Authority (UDA), in conjunction with the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA). The Bogambara Remand Prison site comprises three buildings, the former Ehelepola Walawwa and two two-storey cell block buildings. In 2018 the JICA identified that the cell block buildings had been rehabilitated but not properly conserved, with most of the historic materials removed, and replaced with new materials. The walawwa still retained its central courtyard and was not yet renovated but did have a temporary shed structure over the roof to prevent water damage. At the time the UDA were considering converting the building into a restaurant and craft store.

Jews were characterized as rootless cosmopolitans and targeted for persecution. Origins Joseph Stalin After World War II, the Jewish Anti-Fascist Committee (JAC) grew increasingly influential to the post-Holocaust Soviet Jewry, and was accepted as its representative in the West. As its activities sometimes contradicted official Soviet policies (see The Black Book of Soviet Jewry as an example), it became a nuisance to Soviet authorities. The Central Auditing Commission of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union concluded that instead of focusing its attention on the \\"struggle against forces of international reaction\\", the JAC continued the line of the Bund‚Äîa dangerous designation, since former Bund members were to be \\"purged\\". During a meeting with Soviet intelligentsia in 1946, Stalin voiced his concerns about recent developments in Soviet culture, which later would materialize in the \\"battle against cosmopolitanism\\" (see Zhdanov Doctrine). > Recently, a dangerous tendency seems to be seen in some of the literary > works emanating under the pernicious influence of the West and brought about > by the subversive activities of the foreign intelligence. Frequently in the > pages of Soviet literary journals works are found where Soviet people, > builders of communism are shown in pathetic and ludicrous forms. The > positive Soviet hero is derided and inferior before all things foreign and > cosmopolitanism that we all fought against from the time of Lenin, > characteristic of the political leftovers, is many times applauded. In the > theater it seems that Soviet plays are pushed aside by plays from foreign > bourgeois authors. The same thing is starting to happen in Soviet films. In 1946 and 1947, the new campaign against cosmopolitanism affected Soviet scientists, such as the physicist Pyotr Kapitsa and the president of the Academy of Sciences of the Byelorussian SSR, Anton Romanovich Zhebrak. They along with other scientists were denounced for contacts with their Western colleagues and support for \\"bourgeois science\\". In 1947, many literary critics were accused of \\"kneeling before the West\\" (\\"–Ω–∏–∑–∫–æ–ø–æ–∫–ª–æ–Ω—Å—Ç–≤–æ –ø–µ—Ä–µ–¥ –∑–∞–ø–∞–¥–æ–º\\", also \\"–∏–¥–æ–ª–æ–ø–æ–∫–ª–æ–Ω—Å—Ç–≤–æ –ø–µ—Ä–µ–¥ –∑–∞–ø–∞–¥–æ–º\\", \\"idolatry of the West\\", \\"idolization of the West\\"), as well as anti-patriotism and cosmopolitanism. For example, the campaign targeted those who studied the works of Alexander Veselovsky, the founder of Russian comparative literature, which was described as a \\"bourgeois cosmopolitan direction in literary criticism\\". Soviet Union In January 1948, the JAC's head, the popular actor and world-famous public figure Solomon Mikhoels, was killed; his murder was framed as a car accident where a truck ran over him as he was taking a walk on a narrow road. Gennady Kostyrchenko, ¬´–î–ï–õ–û –ú–ò–•–û–≠–õ–°–ê¬ª: –ù–û–í–´–ô –í–ó–ì–õ–Ø–î, 'Lechaim, October 2003This was followed by eventual arrests of JAC's members and its termination. The USSR voted for the 1947 United Nations Partition Plan for Palestine and in May 1948, it recognized the establishment of the state of Israel there, subsequently supporting it with weapons (via Czechoslovakia, in defiance of the embargo) in the 1948 Arab‚ÄìIsraeli war. Many Soviet Jews felt inspired and sympathetic towards Israel and sent thousands of letters to the (still formally existing) JAC with offers to contribute to or even volunteer for Israel's defence. In September 1948, the first Israeli ambassador to the USSR, Golda Meir, arrived in Moscow. Huge enthusiastic crowds (estimated 50,000) gathered along her path and in and around Moscow synagogue when she attended it for Yom Kippur and Rosh Hashanah. These events corresponded in time with a visible upsurge of Russian nationalism orchestrated by official propaganda, the increasingly hostile Cold War and the realization by the Soviet leadership that Israel had chosen the Western option. Domestically, Soviet Jews were being considered a security liability for their international connections, especially to the United States, and growing national awareness. With the United States becoming the opponent of the Soviet Union by the end of 1948, the USSR switched sides in the Arab‚ÄìIsraeli conflict and began supporting the Arabs against Israel, first politically and later also militarily. For his part David Ben-Gurion declared support for the United States in the Korean War, despite opposition from left-wing Israeli parties. From 1950 on, Israeli‚ÄìSoviet relations were an inextricable part of the Cold War‚Äîwith ominous implications for Soviet Jews supporting Israel, or perceived as supporting it. A new stage of the campaign opened on January 28, 1949, when an article entitled \\"About one anti-patriotic group of theatre critics\\" appeared in the newspaper Pravda, an official organ of the Central Committee of the Communist Party: > An anti-patriotic group has developed in theatrical criticism. It consists > of followers of bourgeois aestheticism. They penetrate our press and operate > most freely in the pages of the magazine, Teatr, and the newspaper, > Sovetskoe iskusstvo. These critics have lost their sense of responsibility > to the people. They represent a rootless cosmopolitanism which is deeply > repulsive and inimical to Soviet man. They obstruct the development of > Soviet literature; the feeling of national Soviet pride is alien to them. The campaign included a crusade in the state-controlled mass media to expose literary pseudonyms of Jewish writers by putting their real names in parentheses in order to reveal to the public that they were ethnic Jews. Thirteen Soviet Jewish poets and writers, five of them members of Jewish Anti- Fascist Committee, were executed in the Lubyanka Prison in Moscow on August 12, 1952. Historian Benjamin Pinkus has written that the campaign was not initially antisemitic, and \\"that certain Jews took an active part in the anti- cosmopolitanism campaign‚Äù. However, Jews were disproportionately targeted in terms of the \\"frequency of denunciations\\", \\"intensity of attacks\\", and the severity of sanctions. He concludes \\"...it is no longer possible to doubt the anti-cosmopolitan campaign had acquired a totally Jewish character\\", and posits several reasons supporting \\"the view that the anti-cosmopolitan campaign became an out-and-out anti-Jewish campaign\\".Benjamin Pinkus. ‚ÄòThe Jews of the Soviet Union: The History of a National Minority‚Äô, Cambridge University Press, 1990, pp. 152-157. Czechoslovak Minister of Information and Culture, V√°clav Kopeck√Ω, was known for his antisemitic diatribes in which he criticized Jews for their alleged Zionism and cosmopolitanism. In December 1951, Kopeck√Ω claimed that \\"the great part of people with a Jewish origin\\" subscribe to \\"cosmopolitan thinking\\". According to Kopeck√Ω, the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia was not taking the anti-cosmopolitan campaign seriously enough. Legacy As a result of the campaign, many Soviet Jews were fired from their jobs and Jews were unofficially banned from taking certain jobs. For example, in 1947, Jews constituted 18 per cent of Soviet scientific workers, but by 1970 this number declined to 7 per cent, which was still higher than about 3 to 4 per cent of the total Soviet population at that time they comprised.Paul Johnson, The History of the Jews. London: Weidenfeld & Nicolson, 1987 Anything Jewish became suppressed by the Soviet authorities. For example, the Yiddish verse sung by Mikhoels was cut out from the famous lullaby sung in turns by persons of different ethnicities in the Soviet classic 1936 movie Circus, restored during destalinization.–§–µ—Å—Ç–∏–≤–∞–ª—å –µ–≤—Ä–µ–π—Å–∫–æ–π —Ç–µ–º—ã: –æ —á–µ–º –Ω–∞ Arbuzz J-Fest —Ä–∞—Å—Å–∫–∞–∑—ã–≤–∞–ª–∏ –ö–æ–ª–±–æ–≤—Å–∫–∏–π, –Æ–∑–µ—Ñ–æ–≤–∏—á, –§–µ–¥–æ—Ä—á–µ–Ω–∫–æ –∏ –£–ª–∏—Ü–∫–∞—è American historian Walter Laqueur noted: \\"When, in the 1950s under Stalin, the Jews of the Soviet Union came under severe attack and scores were executed, it was under the banner of anti-Zionism rather than anti-Semitism, which had been given a bad name by Adolf Hitler.\\"Walter Laqueur Dying for Jerusalem: the past, present and future of the Holiest City.

She is a professor of mathematics at Dartmouth College. Education As a high school student, Groszek felt isolated for her interest in mathematics, but she found a sense of community through her participation in the Hampshire College Summer Mathematics Program, and she went on to earn her bachelor's degree at Hampshire College. She completed her Ph.D. in 1981 at Harvard University. Her dissertation, Iterated Perfect Set Forcing and Degrees of Constructibility, was supervised by Akihiro Kanamori. Research With Theodore Slaman, Groszek showed that (if they exist at all) non-constructible real numbers must be widespread, in the sense that every perfect set contains one of them, and they asked analogous questions of the non-computable real numbers. With Slaman, she has also shown that the existence of a maximally independent set of Turing degrees, of cardinality less than the cardinality of the continuum, is independent of ZFC. In the theory of ordinal definable sets, an unordered pair of sets is said to be a Groszek‚ÄìLaver pair if the pair is ordinal definable but neither of its two elements is; this concept is named for Groszek and Richard Laver, who observed the existence of such pairs in certain models of set theory. Service and outreach Groszek was program chair of the 2014 North American annual meeting of the Association for Symbolic Logic.

It is situated southeast of Hope, and northwest of Silvertip Mountain. The peak was first climbed June 15, 1951, by Paul Binkert, John Booth, Dick Chambers, Jim Irving, Don Montgomery, and Jim Teevan. The peak was named for Captain John M. Grant of the Royal Engineers by Fred Beckey in his Cascade Alpine Guide. Precipitation runoff from the peak drains into tributaries of the Fraser River. Geology Mount Grant is related to the Chilliwack batholith, which intruded the region 26 to 29 million years ago after the major orogenic episodes in the region. This is part of the Pemberton Volcanic Belt, an eroded volcanic belt that formed as a result of subduction of the Farallon Plate starting 29 million years ago.Cenozoic to Recent plate configurations in the Pacific Basin: Ridge subduction and slab window magmatism in western North AmericaCatalogue of Canadian volcanoes: Franklin Glacier During the Pleistocene period dating back over two million years ago, glaciation advancing and retreating repeatedly scoured the landscape leaving deposits of rock debris. The \\"U\\"-shaped cross section of the river valleys are a result of recent glaciation. Uplift and faulting in combination with glaciation have been the dominant processes which have created the tall peaks and deep valleys of the North Cascades area. The North Cascades features some of the most rugged topography in the Cascade Range with craggy peaks and ridges, deep glacial valleys, and granite spires. Geological events occurring many years ago created the diverse topography and drastic elevation changes over the Cascade Range leading to various climate differences which lead to vegetation variety defining the ecoregions in this area. Climate Based on the K√∂ppen climate classification, Mount Grant is located in the marine west coast climate zone of western North America. Most weather fronts originate in the Pacific Ocean, and travel east toward the Cascade Range where they are forced upward by the range (Orographic lift), causing them to drop their moisture in the form of rain or snowfall. As a result, the Cascade Mountains experience high precipitation, especially during the winter months in the form of snowfall. Temperatures can drop below ‚àí20 ¬∞C with wind chill factors below ‚àí30 ¬∞C. The months July through September offer the most favorable weather for climbing Mount Grant.

It is the deadliest accident involving the Dornier Do 228. Background The airline operating the plane, Busy Bee Congo, was founded in 2007 and uses Goma as the base for its fleet of Dornier 228s. Due to lack of funds, poverty, lack of oversight, and corruption in government, airline safety in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, especially among local low-price carriers, is infamously lax with all the local carriers banned from operating in the European Union. Accident According to reports the aircraft took off from the airport but suffered engine failure and crashed less than a minute after take off. Witnesses describe the plane spinning three times as it crashed with thick black smoke coming from the engines. The aircraft violently burst in flames after impact in one of the densely populated areas of the city, the fire preventing locals from helping victims caught in the blaze. 19 people on board were killed on impact. One source reports that 2 passengers managed to be pulled from the blaze. The BBC reports that 9 casualties on the ground all came from one family.

Stultz is an American biomolecular engineer, physician-scientist and academic at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and the Massachusetts General Hospital. He is a Professor of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science at MIT, a Professor in the Institute for Medical Engineering & Science (also at MIT), a faculty member in the Harvard-MIT Division of Health Sciences and Technology, and a cardiologist at the Massachusetts General Hospital. Stultz's research is focused on understanding the behavior of biomolecules that are involved in common human diseases; on development of machine learning models to identify high risk patients; and on the development of optimal treatment strategies for high risk patients. His work involves the use of computational modeling and machine learning. He is a past recipient of a Burroughs Wellcome Award in the Biomedical Sciences, and a NSF Career Award. He is also a member of the American Institute for Medical and Biological Engineering College of Fellows.  Education  Stultz received his A.B. magna cum laude in Mathematics and Philosophy from Harvard College in 1988. He then went on to receive a M.D. magna cum laude from Harvard Medical School and a Ph.D. in Biophysics from Harvard University, both in 1997. His Ph.D. thesis work was done in the laboratory of Nobelist Martin Karplus.  Career  Stultz joined Harvard Medical School as a Clinical Fellow in 1997, becoming a Research Fellow in 2000. At the same time, he also worked as an Intern, Resident and Cardiology Fellow at the Brigham & Women's Hospital. He then joined MIT in 2003 as a Postdoctoral Fellow and became an Assistant Professor in 2004. He was subsequently, appointed the Keck Associate Professor of Biomedical Engineering in 2007. In 2014, Stultz became Full Professor. Stultz was also appointed to the Committee on Higher Degrees in Biopyshics at Harvard University in 2004 and joined the cardiology staff at the Massachusetts General Hospital in 2017. In addition to his academic appointments, Stultz is a member of the Research Laboratory of Electronics (RLE), and an associate member of the Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL) at MIT. He currently leads the Computational Cardiovascular Research Group at MIT. Stultz was featured in the 2012 book The Human Face of Big Data, highlighting the software he and co-workers developed, which uses electrocadiographic data to identify patients at high risk for a heart attack. Shores Salter and Stultz‚Äôs efforts to help a marathon bombing survivor in the immediate aftermath of the attack are described in the 2017 book Perfect Strangers.  Research and work  Stultz's research is focused on understanding the behavior of biomolecules that are involved in common human diseases; on development of machine learning models to identify high risk patients; and on the development of optimal treatment strategies for high risk patients. His work involves the use of computational modeling and machine learning. Stultz began his career in computational biophysics, modeling the structure and function of flexible proteins that play a role in a number of common human diseases. His early research focused on building and applying computational tools to improve understanding of disease processes at the molecular level. His work in this area has involved using a combination of both computational/theoretical models coupled with biochemical experiments, which are designed to test and refine these models. Most notably, Stultz‚Äô research group has developed methods for analyzing and modeling intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) that are involved in neurodegenerative disorders. In the mid 2010s, he and his coworkers developed a novel method for modeling IDPs that uses Bayesian statistics to quantify the uncertainty in the underlying structural ensemble. Stultz and his lab have also developed a variational Bayes‚Äô method that enables them to apply these methods to larger systems in a fraction of the CPU time that would be required using a standard Bayes‚Äô formalism. In recent years, work in Stultz‚Äôs group has shifted to the application of signal processing and machine learning tools to help identify patients at elevated risk of cardiovascular death after an acute coronary syndrome. Stultz and collaborators have developed several ECG-based metrics that help in identifying patients at elevated risk of cardiovascular death after an acute coronary syndrome.  Societies and awards  Stultz has received several honors in recognition of his work. These include a James Tolbert Shipley Prize from Harvard Medical School, a Burroughs Wellcome Fund Career Award (2003), the Irving London Teaching Award (2006), the W. M. Keck Career Development Professorship in Biomedical Engineering from MIT (2007), a Career Award from the National Science Foundation (2008), a Ren√©e Finn Faculty Research Innovation Fellowship (2014)..

Nicanor was on route to recapture the city of Babylon from Seleucus, but he was defeated when Seleucus surprised him with an assault on his camp during the night, forcing Antigonus to cease hostilities with the other Diadochi, (Ptolemy, Cassander and Lysimachus) in order to concentrate his efforts on recapturing the city of Babylon himself.  The campaign  After Demetrius‚Äô defeat at Gaza in 312 B.C. Seleucus rushed with a few soldiers to his old satrapy of Babylon, on the way he recruited some soldiers, possibly Silver Shields at Harran, and resumed his advance to retake Babylon. Hearing of this news Nicanor, satrap of the east under Antigonus, quickly assembled an army composed of 10,000 infantry and 7,000 cavalry, with a large contingent under Eaugoras, satrap of Persia, and possibly the remaining Silver Shields who Antigonus had exiled to Arachosia in 316 BC. After assembling his army he marched west, towards Seleucus who could gather no more than 3,400 soldiers, the majority of them infantry, so he decided to shadow Nicanor's movements and waited for him to cross the Tigris hiding in the marshy terrain around it.  The battle  Nicanor crossed the river with part of his army and made camp for the night. The camp was lightly guarded because Nicanor thought Seleucus had fled, it was also separated from the main force who had yet to cross the river; seeing the opportunity Seleucus attacked him during the night, and caught Nicanor by surprise, amidst the fight, Eaugoras was killed and his Persian soldiers fled the battlefield or surrendered to Seleucus, Nicanor‚Äôs army was overwhelmed, but he was able ot escape. The bulk of the remaining soldiers either joined Seleucus or fled.Diodorus, Bibliotheca Historica, 92,3-5.  Aftermath  The news of Seleucus's victory came as a surprise in the west and prompted a shake-up of political alignments, ending the peace.Richard A. Billows, Antigonos the One-Eyed and the Creation of the Hellenistic State, p. 139. When Antigonus was informed of the battle he ordered his son Demetrius with 19,000 soldiers to recapture Babylonia, but Seleucus was now in a much stronger position as many of Nicanor's soldiers had joined the Seleucid ranks after the battle.

It is principally the origin story of Hooded Justice, a minor character from the Watchmen limited series. Synopsis Laurie tries to get Angela to sign a waiver for medical care so they can get the Nostalgia out of her system before it sets in, but Angela slips into a lucid dream. She experiences Will Reeves' memories as one of the first black officers in the New York police force circa 1938. These are intermingled with memories from the 1921 Tulsa race massacre. After attempting to arrest Fred, a white shopkeeper, for setting fire to a Jewish deli, Will is warned not to interfere and be aware of \\"Cyclops\\", and finds Fred walking free hours later. As he walks home, other white officers abduct him, cover him in a hood, and lynch him, but stop before he chokes to death, warning him not to interfere. Leaving the noose on and carrying the hood, Will walks home but observes a young couple being attacked by thugs. Donning the mask, he rescues the couple, who thank him for the help, and news of his deed is covered in the papers, making him a hero. His wife urges him to adopt the role, and he takes on the vigilante name \\"Hooded Justice\\", creating a costume that obscures his ethnicity. He finds the Ku Klux Klan are behind \\"Cyclops\\" but does not know the extent of their plan. Hooded Justice is invited to the Minutemen by Nelson Gardner, the real identity of Captain Metropolis. Will accepts, and he and Nelson engage in sexual relations, but Nelson cautions Will to stay in his masked identity in front of the other Minutemen. Years pass, and Will and June have a son. After a riot in a movie theater, Will discovers \\"Cyclops\\" involves hypnotic-like control of blacks to attack each other using special film projectors, and tracks down the New York operation to a warehouse. He calls Nelson for the Minuteman's help, but Nelson refuses to let them become involved. Will takes out the operation on his own, burning down the warehouse while taking one of the projectors. After yelling at his son for dressing as Hooded Justice, June tells Will to stay away as she is moving back to Tulsa with their son. In the near present, Will is shown responsible for Judd's death, using a modified version of the film projector to coerce Judd into hanging himself, believing Judd is part of \\"Cyclops\\". Angela is brought out of her dreams in Lady Trieu's quarters. Production Jovan Adepo guest-starred as young Will Reeves and the masked viligante Hooded Justice in this episode. \\"This Extraordinary Being\\" is mostly shown in black and white, outside of the opening and closing scenes. Selected elements of some scenes are shown in color, for example, imagery of Will's mother playing the piano in some shots. Additionally, in seemingly one-shot takes, young Will (played by Jovan Adepo) is swapped out in scenes with Angela (Regina King) to show her immersion in the Nostalgia-induced lucid dream. Stephen Williams, a prior collaborator with showrunner Damon Lindelof during Lost, was brought in to direct this episode even before the episode had been written. Williams, as an African-Canadian himself, was drawn in by the premise of the episode from Lindelof's description, and opted to use the black and white filming approach as this episode needed to be presented differently from the rest of the series, using only colored elements to indicate \\"the incursion of other memories that were pivotal and meaningful and significant for Will that imposed themselves on that landscape\\". Williams ran several test filming runs for many of the episode's practical effects using stand-ins for the main actors. Many of the shots where Adepo and King were done with simple camera movement, allowing the actors to switch places during the shot. Other long-takes were also done with practical effects: the shot taken of Will's point-of-view of his near-lynching was done by hoisting the camera out of the operator's hands, holding it there long enough, and then lowering back down to continue the shot, as to create the immersion they needed for the scene. Most of this episode was filmed in Macon, Georgia, which served as a 1930s New York City. Much of the origin of Hooded Justice is based on the material that Alan Moore and Dave Gibbons had established for the Watchmen limited series. While Hooded Justice is a minor character, whose identity was never revealed within the limited series, he played a key role in stopping the attempted rape of Silk Spectre by The Comedian shortly after the Minutemen had posed for their first photo session. Many elements of the associated extra content written by Moore and Gibbons, particularly the fictional Under the Hood memoirs by Nite Owl, were drawn from and referenced in the episode: his saving of a young couple as the first known appearance, his appearance at the Minutemen photo session, and his homosexuality. The episode's title is taken from Nite Owl's introduction of Hooded Justice in Under the Hood.Watchmen Ch. 1, Under the Hood p. 6, next to last paragraph. Will is shown being inducted into the New York Police Department by Samuel J. Battle (played by Philly Plowden), who in reality was the first black officer in the force. Williams points out that Watchmen endeavors to \\"unearth... that part of our collective history that has been neglected, or omitted, like Tulsa 1921, in the pilot.... These are all parts of African American history, and obviously, by extension, therefore straight- up American history that have been given short shrift.\\" While not fully confirmed by the show's staff, the character of Fred, the racist white supermarket owner played by Glenn Fleshler, appears to allude to Fred Trump, the father of Donald Trump, based on both appearance and other elements that aligned with Fred Trump's biography, including his involvement with the KKK. Reception Critical response \\"This Extraordinary Being\\" received critical acclaim. On Rotten Tomatoes, the episode has an approval rating of 96% with an average score of 9.33 out of 10, based on 28 reviews. The site's critical consensus reads, \\"Revealing and relevant, 'This Extraordinary Being' cleverly shows the long-term effects of generational trauma and deep-seated racism.\\" Accolades For the 72nd Primetime Emmy Awards, Damon Lindelof and Cord Jefferson won the award for Outstanding Writing for a Limited Series, Movie, or Dramatic Special for this episode. Director Stephen Williams was nominated for Outstanding Directing for a Limited Series, Movie or Dramatic Special, and Adepo was nominated for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Limited Series or Movie. The episode was nominated for the GLAAD Media Award for Outstanding Individual Episode featuring an LGBTQ character. In addition, Williams was nominated for the Directors Guild of America Award for Outstanding Directing ‚Äì Drama Series for the episode (an award that was won by Nicole Kassell for \\"It's Summer and We're Running Out of Ice\\", another Watchmen episode), while Lindelof and Jefferson were nominated for the NAACP Image Award for Outstanding Writing in a Dramatic Series for the episode, which was won by Nichelle Tramble Spellman for \\"Monster\\", the first episode of her Apple TV+ show Truth Be Told. \\"This Extraordinary Being\\" was nominated for a Hugo for Best Dramatic Presentation, Short Form, alongside \\"A God Walks into Abar\\".

Characters Main characters ; : :Orphen is the main protagonist of the Sorcerous Stabber Orphen series and the title character, is known for his arrogance, gruff demeanor, short temper, and near-obsessive drive to finish what he is working on as soon as possible without distraction. He also strives to remain stoic and detached from others save his closest friends and allies. However, he has a strong sense of humanity and even though he will often complain, he will not abandon a person in need nor tolerate the slaughter of innocent. He is an anti-hero throughout the entire series. In the anime, the only time his attitude changes is when the subject of Azalie is brought up. He will do anything for Azalie, as they have quite a history together, but Orphen keeps his feelings and the story about Azalie to himself at first, only opening up later in the series. However, in the novels, he opens up about Azalie fairly quickly. He later becomes acerbic and callous towards her after she murders Childman and attempts to manipulate him on multiple occasions for her own ends. He, Leticia and Azalie were brought to the school together by Wall Karen because it was believed that they possessed a strong amount of magical power within them. This proved correct; Orphen was a magic prodigy. Orphen eventually becomes the greatest sorcerer in the world. His true name is , and the sorcerers from the Tower of Fang (Heartia, Azalie, Leticia, Comicron, Forte, Korgon and Childman) still refer to him as such. In the novels, Orphen is characterized slightly differently, being more rough, profane and seemingly unstable than his anime portrayal. He suffers from increasing megalomania and what seems to be a type of dissociative identity disorder in which he sometimes thinks of Krylancelo and Orphen as two different individuals. However, through the company of his apprentice, Majic and the heiress Claiomh Everlasting, he steadily becomes more at peace with himself and learns to accept who he is. As a child, Orphen was trained to be a Stabber, which is a sorcerer trained in the art of eliminating other sorcerers with secret assassination techniques and deadly spells beyond conventional knowledge, though he actively resents his training since he despises killing. In the novels, he eventually gains the power and knowledge of the Demon King Swedenborge and temporarily attains the Dark Magic of the Fenrir by merging his mind with Leki's, though both of these magicks can tax on his sanity and health when he utilizes them. By the end of the original novella series, Orphen left the continent of Kiesalhima along with Claiomh Everlasting to settle down on the Hara continent. They later marry and have their daughters, Ratsbane, Edge and Ratchet. By the age of 43, he becomes the head founder of his own magic academy known the Swedenborge School of Sorcery. ; : : Claiomh Everlasting (Cleao in the 1998 anime),https://www.fandompost.com/2019/08/12/sorcerous-stabber-orphen- complete-collection-sdbd-anime-review/ is a girl that joins Orphen on his journey. In the first anime, she carries the Sword of Baltanders, which was entrusted to her by her father on her fifteenth birthday, and lets Orphen hold onto it as long as he does not object to her tagging along. Claiomh also carries in her backpack a Deep Dragon wolf-cub named Leki. She and Orphen constantly quarrel, but she does so to hide her growing affection for him and secretly longs for him from afar. She and Orphen eventually marry at the end of the original novels and have three daughters. She trains with a long sword and quickly becomes proficient with it as she journeys with Orphen and Majic, even able to duel on even grounds with other highly skilled swordsmen. It is later discovered that Claiomh has magical potential, which is unlocked due to Leki merging his mind with hers and she eventually seeks training from Leticia to develop her latent abilities, which she completed in a year's time. She also becomes skilled in using firearms thanks to her training at the Tower of Fang. ; : : Majic is Orphen's apprentice, and the secondary male lead. He is a childhood friend of Claiomh's, despite being three years apart in age, and they attended the same classroom in school before she left for boarding school. In the anime, they were in the same grade in school, but she has since moved on to boarding school. Majic deals with the torment brought about from both Claiomh and Orphen's action on their journey together. His father is paying Orphen to teach him, which at first seems a waste of money to his father. When Orphen repairs a glass that fell with his magic before the father's eyes, the father's opinion about his money being \\"thrown out the window\\" disappears. Majic appears to be a good student, learning as much as he can, and retaining all of what he learns, although his anxiety tends to get the better of him when it comes time to prove himself. Orphen, however, sees significant potential in Majic and encourages him in his training. This gives him courage, which makes his power stronger. Majic looks up to Orphen, and refers to him as \\"master\\" upon Orphen's request. All sorcerers call their \\"teachers\\", who teach them sorcery, \\"master.\\" It is later revealed in the novels that Majic is a vampire, a rare mutagenic trait within humans which he inherited from his mother, Iris Lin, who is a sorceress/assassin said to rival Childman in terms of power and skill. Due to his vampire blood, his magical potential far exceeds Orphen's. By the end of the novels, Majic has become a famous, world-renowned sorcerer and even takes on Ratsbane, Orphen and Cleao's firstborn child, as his apprentice. ; : :One of the race of Deep Dragon (changed to Wolfen in the original English Dub), Leki is a cub who is found and adopted by Claiomh, although it is indicated by his mother that Leki adopted Claiomh, as adult Deep Dragons are more powerful and intelligent by far than humans. Like all Deep Dragons, Leki resembles a wolf rather than a reptilian dragon, and when he uses his innate magic, his eyes will glow a bright green color. As Leki is still very young, he often exhibits young animal-like tendencies, such as chasing after a butterfly. Yet in spite of his animalistic behavior, he is very intelligent and perceptive and has instinctual grasp of Dark Magic. He protects and defends Claiomh whenever he feels the need to, or when Claiomh orders him. He is also unique among his clan since he is able to retain his individuality, partially because of his empathetic connection to Claiomh. Leki will not only protect Claiomh, but anyone who he sees in danger. In the first anime, Leki's collar belongs to one of the three artifacts from the Aisle of Baltanders, the Bracelet of Nomafrozis. In the novel, Leki is eventually able to use telepathy to speak with his human companions and released Claiomh's hidden magical potential by linking with her mind. Throughout the novel series, Leki grows from a small cub to the size of a large dog. When exerting his full power, he will temporarily increase his size to that of an adult Deep Dragon. ; : : Vulcano Volkan is one of the two dwarven brothers who follow along with Orphen on his quest. He frequently refers to himself the \\"Masmaturian Bulldog\\". Volkan always comes up with their plans (which usually turn out to be poorly thought out, utterly bad ideas, and almost never work). He is known to be extremely egotistical, delusional and idiotic. He hates Orphen (whom he refers to as \\"the black wizard\\") and his companions, and always finds a way to ruin whatever they had in mind. He was banished from his home of Matmaturia because of his unapologetic troublemaking, and kidnapped his younger brother, to forcibly accompany him in his exile. It is his fault that Orphen often must use his magic to assault them (himself and Dortin) due to the fact that Volkan owes Orphen an exorbitant amount of money and he refuses to pay Orphen back his debt. Volkan wants only power and money, and any scheme he has in mind has the end result in mind getting him one of the two. None of his schemes ever work, however, due his short-sightedness and stupidity. He constantly bosses Dortin around in a very comical fashion. In spite of his inepitude, he is surprisingly durable as sharp objects such as swords and scythes cannot break his skin and Orphen's magic, no matter how powerful, does not cause him any significant damage. This is largely due to his dwarven physiology. His ego is strong enough to suppress a White Mage within his mind and utilize her sorcery. ; : :Volkan's younger brother. Dortin and Volkan are often viewed as comic relief throughout the series. They are two dwarves who are always low on money, and seem to always find a way to mess up whatever Orphen is trying to accomplish. In the first anime, they worked in Cleao's basement, working as cooks to both pay of their debt to Orphen as well as act as his spies. In the novels, they were forced to work for Claiomh as bodyguards as compensation for breaking them out of jail when they attempted con her older sister, Mariabelle, into a marriage scam. regards to his character, Dortin is the voice of reason (who is often ignored) on his and Volkan's quests. He is kind and knowledgeable, but his swirling glasses give him a rather geekish appearance. When Volkan messes up, Dortin always tries to tell Orphen he had no part in Volkan's schemes, but they both wind up being victims of Orphen's magical blasts anyway. In the anime and novels, Dortin is shown to be quite caring and loyal, as he begs Orphen for help in saving his brother from poisoning and, later in the anime, in defying Volkan's \\"order\\" to run from danger when a friend (Childman) needed his help. Dortin is surprisingly skilled at reading runes and has occasionally helped Orphen in deciphering texts by the Nornir. Like his brother, he is also highly resistant to both physical and magical damage due to his dwarven physiology. ;Lycoris/Licorice Neilson : :An original anime-exclusive character that appears in Revenge, searching for Orphen and journeys with him in order to turn him into the Royal Order. She is a kind, clumsy shy girl who wears glasses which she tends to lose. Unbeknownst to herself, she harbors several secrets and is in fact being manipulated. Supporting characters ; : :She's Orphen's foster sister, best friend, and the Bloody August. They were in the same orphanage and came to the Tower of Fang together, believed to be magical prodigies. She tutored him extensively, and gave him special attention. She was a great sorcerer - considered to be one of the greatest in her generation, and is referred to as the \\"Chaos Witch\\" by some at the Tower. She is a master of Black Magic and one of the few sorcerers that can harness White Magic. However, she had two sides to her. There was the kind, fun-loving and charismatic Azalie, and then the, as Orphen says, \\"scary\\" Azalie. After having her love declaration to her mentor rejected, she seemed to be almost obsessed with her studies; she wanted more power, and one of her experiments turned her into Bloody August - a name given to the demonic dragon that first appeared in August. In the novels, Azalie is returned to a human state fairly early in the series, but her mind has been warped by her time spent as the beast and the cruelties endured by those in the Tower who had been hunting her. Vengeful and partially insane, her main goal is to destroy the Tower and uncover Childman's true ambitions, which leads her to becoming a major antagonist in the series. She becomes increasingly unstable and Orphen is often torn between his attachment to her and his horror at her remorseless violence. ; : :Orphen, Heartia, and Azalie's Master and the most powerful sorcerer of the Kiesalhima Continent. In the novels, His original name was Alfredo Mines and was the disciple and son of Sister Istersiva, a Nornir priestess of the Three Sisters of Fate, as well as a diplomatic ambassador for both the Dragon and human race. He was later sent 200 years into the future by Sister Istersiva with a time spell and lost nearly all memory of his previous life, only recalling his skills. He later adopts the name \\"Childman Powderfield\\" as his primary identity and becomes an assassin, then eventually a teacher at the Tower of Fang. He is Orphen's primary antagonist for the better part of the original anime, as Orphen believes he really wants to kill Azalie. Heartia tries to convince Orphen that Childman isn't his enemy, but in the end, it fails. In actuality, he was trying to restore Azalie himself since he felt personally responsible for the tragedy that befell her. And at some point, things get even worse; when he tries to face the Bloody August, Azalie uses white magic to transfer her soul into his body, leaving Childman's soul trapped within the Bloody August. In the first manga adaptation, however, Orphen continues to secretly train under Childman after leaving the Tower, doing somewhat unsavory odd jobs for him that he does not wish to bring to the notice of the Tower. In the novels, he is killed by Azalie while inhabiting her mutated body, but not before revealing to Orphen that Azalie had transferred her soul to his body. ; : :Orphen's childhood friend and fellow sorcerer. They met at the Tower of Fang. He is on Childman's side, instead of Orphen's, however, making it seem as though Heartia is Orphen's enemy. However, Heartia truly cares about Orphen and considers him to be his best friend. He is also a fan of the (fictional) manga, Black Tiger, and assumes the guise of its main character and namesake on occasion. However, the manga is fairly obscure, so Dortin (Magic in the first anime) mistakenly assumes his name refers to the Penaeus monodon, a type of prawn sometimes called \\"Black Tiger\\", resulting in Heartia's receiving the nickname, \\"Shrimp Man\\", much to his own chagrin. In the novels, the Black Tiger costume that he dons is actually a magical garb created by the Nornir that was owned by the original (real) Black Tiger from over 150 years ago and retains his consciousness within the mask. Heartia's appearances are less prominent in the novel series, though his origins are similar. Heartia was also noted to be a notorious womanizer as he frequently dated multiple female sorcerers at the Tower of Fang, but his relationships typically last for only two weeks. ; : :Childman's rival in the Tower of Fang and enemy to Orphen and Azalie. Although he ranks closely to Childman in terms of recognition, it is heavily implied that his mother Lady Shastanassie, one of the Elders, has influenced this. Indeed, he seems to rely on her for everything from emotional consolation to advice in his endeavors. Deprived of her guidance, he becomes quite mentally unstable, as seen at the end of the first season. Childman himself later states that Flameheart actually had very little strength or potential as a sorcerer. Flameheart is an original character that only appears in the first anime series. ; : : She is Orphen's other foster sister and childhood friend as well as one of his classmates at the Tower, though she is five years older than Orphen. She, Orphen and Azalie grew up together in an orphanage in Raindust before they were taken in by the Tower of Fangs. She has an intense rivalry with Azalie, in spite of the fact that they are cousins, and are often depicted as fighting in the novels. Leticia is considered to be the second most powerful sorcerer of Childman's students besides Azalie and has a fearsome reputation similar to her cousin's. Her most notable strength is the gift of vocal manipulation, which earned her the nickname \\"The Scream of Death\\" while in her studies at the Tower. Later, she is made the Inquisitor of the Tower of Fang and seems to hint at being in love with Orphen. Orphen shortens her name to Tish in most cases. She appears in volumes five and six of the manga, and is seen throughout nearly all of the original set of novels. At Claiomh's behest, she becomes the heiress's master in the art of sorcery. She eventually falls in love and marries Forte, which leads to the birth of her son, Mayor MacCredy. ;Stephanie : : Orphen's old friend. Stephanie used to be a sorcerer named Stephan until he was mortally injured by a fanatical lynch mob that despised sorcerers, and battered his body beyond recognition. This incident required Orphen to save him and take him to a clinic where Orphen was working at the time. During the healing process, Stephan requested that the doctor of the clinic to perform sex reassignment surgery on his body, with the aid of his own magic, and became Stephanie. Consequently, this rendered Stephanie nearly incapable of sorcery. Now, she works as an archaeologist deciphering the runes of the 'deities' (called the Nornir or \\"The Heavenly Ones\\") that fought against the sorcerers years ago. She is first introduced in the series when the group goes to Alenhatan and her familiarity with Orphen makes Claiomh jealous at first. At the end of the second novel, she eventually leaves Alenhatan to return home to her family. In the anime, she still lives in Alenhatan and has a boyfriend named Tim (who she eventually marries) but still often seen helping Orphen and the others when they need someone who knows how to read and use the Nornir language/symbols. ;Lai : : Lai is a sorcerer that goes to the Tower of Fang that is friends with Hardia and is one of Childman's apprentices. Lai is portrayed as a powerful seer and is able to find people or things if he goes into a deep meditation. He can also tell people's 'presence' apart, something that gets him in trouble and sealed into ice by Azalie (who was possessing Childman's body at the time) because he noticed that her presence wasn't in the Bloody August anymore. Lai is an original character that appears only in the anime continuity. ;Mariabella Everlasting : : She is Claiomh's older sister and is seen at the beginning of the anime. She first saw Orphen when he was watching over the Sword of Baltanders and thinks he was watching her (and thinking him handsome she develops a crush on him). In the novel, she meets him during a marriage interview arranged by Volkan. In the anime, she and Claiomh were kidnapped by the Bloody August to get Orphen to give the Sword over, but both were eventually rescued by Orphen. In spite of her demure appearance and personli ;Eris : :An anime original character. She is a student of Hardia's whom harbors a crush on Majic and tends to wear magical girl costumes to match her master's aesthetics. ;Erukarena : :The main villainess of Orphen: Revenge. She is a creature known as Sorcerous Beast, a destructive monster that absorbs and devours all forms of magic. She was sealed away by the Nornir hundreds of years go until she deceived Lycoris' father into capturing and feeding her sorcerers to regain her lost power and break free of her prison. ;Esperanza Reika : :Older sister of Lycoris. ; : :A member of the Childman Class. He was known to have a penchant for weird inventions that often resulted in chaos (although it was revealed that Azalie tweaked some of them without his knowledge). While he lacked in offensive power, he was the best healer of the class and was secretly in love with Leticia. He was burned to cinders during the expedition to hunt Azalie in her Dragon form. ; : :A member of the Childman Class. He is a powerful sorcerer who presides over a large information network. He was always known to be stern, serious and quite studious. Through his information network he ultimately learned of Azalie's survival and Childman's demise. He was set to be Majic's instructor in the Tower of Fangs. ;Uoar Curlaine : :The instructor of the Uoar Class who specializes on Stabbing, the art of Sorcerer assassination. He is a rival to Childman who secretly plots to overthrow the latter's class, viewing them as a threat to his ambitions to seize control of the Tower of Fangs. For a time he trained Orphen, then Krylancelo in assassination techniques. He tried to obtain the World Transcript, a book rumored to be written by the God, Swedenborge and said to contain magic secrets which he believed was the source of Childman's power and influence in the Tower. For that purpose he had his class attack the alumni of the Childman Class taking advantage of Childman's absence. He ultimately fails when Orphen, Forte and Azalie corner him with Orphen nearly killing him. Azalie proceeds to wipe out his class' memories of her and he and his class are arrested by Forte. ;Hydrant : :A member of Uoar's Class and a Stabber whose real name is Miram Toram. Five years ago, he got the left half of his face scarred by Krylancelo in a fit when Hydrant provoked Krylancelo with the revelation that he was trained in order to kill Azalie should the need come. Ever since, he has held a grudge against Orphen and seeks to kill him committing multiple assassinations in the meantime. He is a powerful Stabber with more skill over Sorcery than Orphen, but is weaker in martial arts which Orphen exploits to defeat him. He was nearly killed by Orphen, but was prevented from doing so when Claiomh interrupted their fight. He was eventually arrested along the rest of the Uoar Class. ;Swain : :A member of Uoar's Class and a Stabber. He was sent along with Hydrant to retrieve the World Transcript from the Childman Class by orders of Uoar in order to seize its power and take control over the Tower of Fangs.

She wrote short stories, three novels, and several illustrated collections.  Life  Gertrude Dodd was the daughter of the Methodist minister Benjamin Dodd, and younger sister to the artist Francis Dodd. She was raised in Glasgow, where her brother attended Garnett Hill School and met Muirhead Bone, her future husband. Gertrude and Muirhead became engaged in 1898, but could not afford to marry until five years later, when he published his first portfolio of drawings. They married in 1903 and moved to Thamescote, Chiswick. Their first son, Stephen Bone, was born the next year on 13 November 1904 in Chiswick. A second son, Gavin Bone, was born in 1907. Gertrude Bone, like her father, was a \\"staunch Methodist\\": Stephen Bone remembered his childhood as one in which \\"presents, entertaining, and alcohol were banished; pencil and paper for drawing were deemed sufficient diversion at the house.\\" In 1913, the family moved from Chiswick to Byways, Steep, near Petersfield. In the 1920s and 1930s, Gertrude and Muirhead Bone traveled abroad extensively, especially in Italy and Spain. In 1937, Muirhead Bone was knighted, and Gertrude became Lady Gertrude Bone. Their second son Gavin died in 1942. Muirhead died of cancer in 1953. Their first son Stephen died of cancer in 1958. Gertrude Bone died in 1962.  Writing  Gertrude Bone's first published fiction was Provincial Tales in 1904, which was published with a frontispiece by Muirhead Bone. The book consisted ten short stories which the preface explained would \\"illustrate the colorful language of working people, untainted by education.\\" The author D.H. Lawrence mentioned reading the first two stories, \\"Poverty\\" and \\"The Right Eye,\\" in a letter on 12 January 1921. He had modest praise for her writing: > I like the first two stories of Gertrude Bone immensely -- she is > wonderfully perceptive there. She's got a lot of poetic feeling, a lot of > perceptivity, but she seems scarcely able to concentrate it on her people > she is studying: at least, not always.\\" The first of her three novels was Women of the Country, published in 1913. The novel follows an unmarried, middle-aged cottager, Ann Hilton, who visits the other women in her country village to give them advice. Ann Hilton takes particular interest in a farm girl, Jane Evans, who is seduced and made pregnant by the local squire and dies in the local infirmary. The Oxford Companion to Edwardian fiction describes it as \\"a gentle, meticulously observed story ... notable for its decisive but unsensational focus on the experience of women: the male characters have walk-on parts only.\\" Virginia Woolf wrote a review of the novel for the Times Literary Supplement on 10 July 1913, praising its realistic portrayal of the brutality and profundity of rural living: > These are pictures of an impressionist--that is to say, it is left to us to > make a body for a few vivid words, but Mrs Bone's skill is indisputable. She > never allows us to forget that there is much beauty even in a plain country, > but the great merit of her book is that, without shirking either the > plainness or the meanness, she yet makes us feel the fine quality of the > human nature which persists in its life, in spite of everything. Gertrude Bone also collaborated with her husband and her son Stephen for several books which combined writing and illustration. The book Of the Western Isles, which Stephen illustrated, won a gold medal at the 1925 Paris Universal Exhibition. In 1936, Gertrude and Muirhead Bone published Old Spain, a two- volume collection of Muirhead's watercolors accompanied by text written by Gertrude. This book was considered popular and the initial print run of two hundred and fifty copies, numbered and signed by the artists and the author, was reprinted as Days in Old Spain in 1939 and 1942.

Wolfinger is an American researcher, academic and educator. He is Professor in the Department of Family and Consumer Studies and Adjunct Professor of Sociology at the University of Utah. His research is focused on sociology of the family, religion, social demography and quantitative and qualitative methods. He is the son of Ray Wolfinger.  Education and career  Wolfinger received a B.A. in Sociology from University of California, Berkeley in 1990 and an M.A. in Sociology from University of California, Los Angeles in 1992. In 1998, he received a PhD. in Sociology from University of California, Los Angeles. Wolfinger joined the Department of Family and Consumer Studies at the University of Utah in 1998 as an Assistant Professor, later becoming Associate Professor and then Full Professor. Wolfinger's work has been covered in the New York Times, The Washington Post, USA Today, The Wall Street Journal, and The Los Angeles Times.  Publications  Wolfinger is the author or editor of four books, Understanding the Divorce Cycle: The Children of Divorce in Their Own Marriages (2005), Fragile Families and the Marriage Agenda (2005), Do Babies Matter? Gender and Family in the Ivory Tower (2013), and, Soul Mates: Religion, Sex, Children, and Marriage among African Americans and Latinos (2016). Wolfinger is the author of over 40 scholarly articles and book chapters.  Research  Wolfinger's research interests include marriage and divorce, poverty, religion, and higher education. Much of his research is based on the analysis of data from large national surveys. He has also conducted qualitative research based on interviews and surveys, and has published methodological work on both quantitative and qualitative research methods.  Divorce  Wolfinger's early research examined how divorce runs in families. He found that the rate of divorce transmission between generations, the propensity to divorce as the result of growing up in a divorced family, diminished greatly between 1973 and 1996. His work in this area showed that as the divorce rate increased, its rate of transmission declined. Wolfinger's research on the intergenerational transmission of divorce was published in the monograph Understanding Divorce Cycle: The Children of Divorce in Their Own Marriages. Wolfinger has also conducted research on how divorce affects offspring marriage timing. His research indicated that parental divorce increases the chances of teenage marriage, but past age twenty makes marriage about a third less likely.  Higher education and marriage  Wolfinger worked on The Do Babies Matter project with Mary Ann Mason and Marc Goulden. The project explored how marriage and children differentially affect men and women's academic careers. National panel data from the Survey of Doctorate Recipients showed that family formation completely explains women's fortunes on the academic job market; indeed, single women without young children are more likely than men to obtain tenure- track employment. Marriage and children had smaller effects elsewhere in the academic life cycle.  Religion  In collaboration with W. Bradford Wilcox, Wolfinger explored the relationship between marriage, relationship quality, and religious participation. They found that attendance at religious services has broad salutary effects on relationships. In 2016, Wolfinger and Wilcox published a book on their research, Soul Mates: Religion, Sex, Children, and Marriage among African Americans and Latinos (Oxford University Press). It drew on six national data sets, in-depth interviews with 85 clergy and parishioners, and a year of ethnographic fieldwork.  Economics of single motherhood  In collaboration with Matthew McKeever, Wolfinger has studied trends in the economics of single motherhood. They have analyzed data from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth and the Current Population Survey to show how demographic shifts and changing job skills have affected single mothers‚Äô incomes. Their research emphasizes the contrast between divorc√©es and women who give birth out of wedlock.

It is situated north of the Coquihalla Highway, west of Zopkios Ridge, west of Coquihalla Summit, and south of Alpaca Peak. Precipitation runoff from the peak drains into headwaters of the Coldwater River, as well as tributaries of the Coquihalla River and Anderson River. The mountain was named for the zupjok, (pronounced ZOOP yok), the male progeny of a cattle bull and a female yak, and part of the ungulate names theme for several other nearby peaks that were submitted by Philip Kubik of Vancouver. The mountain's name was officially adopted on February 5, 1976, by the Geographical Names Board of Canada. Geology During the Pleistocene period dating back over two million years ago, glaciation advancing and retreating repeatedly scoured the landscape leaving deposits of rock debris. The \\"U\\"-shaped cross section of the river valleys are a result of recent glaciation. Uplift and faulting in combination with glaciation have been the dominant processes which have created the tall peaks and deep valleys of the North Cascades area. The North Cascades features some of the most rugged topography in the Cascade Range with craggy peaks and ridges, deep glacial valleys, and granite spires. Geological events occurring many years ago created the diverse topography and drastic elevation changes over the Cascade Range leading to various climate differences which lead to vegetation variety defining the ecoregions in this area. Climate Based on the K√∂ppen climate classification, Zupjok Peak is located in the marine west coast climate zone of western North America. Most weather fronts originate in the Pacific Ocean, and travel east toward the Cascade Range where they are forced upward by the range (Orographic lift), causing them to drop their moisture in the form of rain or snowfall. As a result, the Cascade Mountains experience high precipitation, especially during the winter months in the form of snowfall. Temperatures can drop below ‚àí20 ¬∞C with wind chill factors below ‚àí30 ¬∞C. The months July through September offer the most favorable weather for climbing Zupjok Peak.

Skovgaard: The artist's house in Rosenv√¶nget under construction, 1860 Skovgaard purchased one of the first lots when Mozart Waagepetersen started the redevelopment of the Rosendal estate in √òsterbro. Skovgaard knew the area well since his uncle, Hans Christian Aggersborg, with whom he had lived when he first moved to Copenhagen to study at the art academy, was the owner of the country house Villa Aggersborg at a nearby site. Skovgaard, who had that same year become a titular professor at the art academy, in 1860 commissioned the architect Johan Daniel Herholdt to design a house for the site. Joakim Skovgaard in his studio, c. 1926 Skovgaard moved into the house with his wifeGeorgia and their two sons Joakim an Niels, on its completion in 1862. The couple was expecting their third child, Suzette, who was born on 29 January the following year. Georgia Skovgaard died in Copenhagen on 15 July 1868 while giving birth to a stillborn daughter. P. C. Skovgaard lived in the house until his death in 1875. It was then taken over by Joakim Skovgaard. He also had his studio at the site. He lived there until his death in 1933. The house stayed in the Skovgaard family until 1971. Architecture The building was designed more as a practical workshop building for a painter than a home. It is built to a boxy design in yellow brick with ocher-coloured mortar. The walls were originally decomrated with corner lesenes, bands and window frames in red earth coloured finishing. The roof is a saddle roof. The windows are symmetrically arranged but of varying shapes and sizes. Doors and windows are painted green. The interior was originally painted in Pompeian colours with black panels decorated with flowers and animal figures.

It was established in 1967 and was part of the Glenburn Education Trust. It closed in 2016 due to consistently poor results and low pupil numbers, and was noted for having the worst GCSE results in Lancashire.  History  Glenburn Sports College was established in 1967. A 10-week healthy lifestyle course was launched by the West Lancashire Community Leisure Trust in 2009 to help overweight students and their families at the school. It provided nutritional advice and exercise programmes for those aged between seven and thirteen. Leisure Leagues ran a league at the school in 2010 which aimed to help referees run community football leagues and all profits were donated to charity.  Closure  Lancashire County Council began a public consultation on the future of the school in October 2014 after figures showed the number of students had reduced by 54% since 2006, and ran until 14 December 2014. Students, parents, staff, councillors and local residents totalling approximately 400, and West Lancashire MP Rosie Cooper, marched in protest on 15 November 2014 over its potential closure. Parents had already submitted their views to the council and booked appointments with its officers as well as signing petitions, in preparation for the consultation event on 20 November 2014. Following the initial six-week consultation, the council moved to stage two of the consultation in February 2015 despite opposition from the local community, which is the publication of a 'statutory notice'. Rosie Cooper said \\"Whilst this decision is unwelcome news, I will continue to stand should to shoulder with parents and pupils\\" and had questioned the Minister of State for Schools over the possible conflict of interest of the council's Director of Education, who was also the chair of the Glenburn Educational Trust. Stage three involved a further four-week statutory consultation period following the publication of the formal proposals, which allowed interested parties to submit their comments, objections as well as those in support, before a final decision is made. On 19 May 2015, the council agreed to close the school on 31 August 2016 due to consistently poor results, despite the range of additional support that was provided by the council, and low pupil numbers, which \\"made it difficult for it to provide a broad and balanced education\\" and impacted the school's finances and standards. At the time, it had 320 students compared to the school's capacity of more than 1,000 and was noted for having the worst GCSE results in Lancashire. The decision was widely criticised including Rosie Cooper who had been campaigning with students, parents, staff and the local community to keep the school open, stating the concerns over \\"the lack of clarity and commitment and support for existing pupils, especially those taking their GCSEs\\" and referred to the closure as being the \\"cheap and easy option\\". Cooper also said \\"This entire process from start to finish has been a huge mess. It has been flawed and I fear the impact this will have on pupils and their families\\" and \\"Despite 95% being opposed to the closure they are still pushing ahead with it\\". County councillor Matthew Tomlinson said Ofsted inspectors had been concerned for many years and if the council had not closed the school, the Department for Education \\"would probably make us do so\\". Year 7 and 9 students moved to a different school in September 2015 while Year 8 and 10 completed their Key Stage 3 and GCSE studies. = Unsuccessful appeal = Parents, students and staff subsequently launched an appeal to the Office of the Schools Adjudicator, noting the unhappiness over the consultation process and the impact it will have on the local community, including the lack of parental choice, the future need for school places, transport issues and the loss of facilities. It was the last chance for over-turning the closure decision but was unsuccessful after being confirmed it would go ahead in August 2015. The following month, two councillors had written to the Secretary of State for Education Nicky Morgan to reject the closure. = Vandalism and fires = Following the closure, the building was subject to heavy vandalism and concerns were raised by Skelmersdale North Councillor Neil Furey after visiting the site in October 2016, describing it as \\"a disgrace and resembles a war zone\\", and \\"calling for the site to be made more secure and that an urgent resolution is sought to deal with this matter\\". It was also subject to multiple fires; September 2016, November 2016, November 2018 and seven fires over four days in April 2019. Proposed railway station As part of a plan to provide a railway station for Skelmersdale, Lancashire County Council announced in 2017 that they had identified the site of the former college as the preferred location for a new station. The plan, in partnership with Merseytravel and West Lancashire Borough Council, was devised from studies by Network Rail and recommended the site as the best location. The council began negotiations to buy the site from the current owners, Newcastle College.
