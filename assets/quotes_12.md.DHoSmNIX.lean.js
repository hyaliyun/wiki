In 1989, Gurgel Carajás had 75% of market share, against just 25% of its only option in Brazil: the very expensive Toyota Bandeirante. Between 1976 and 1990, importing vehicles was illegal. This success however was over on the second semester of 1990, when the Lada Niva came to Brazil, and Gurgel Carajás' sales fell.

It is a more severe condition than aphasia, which is the inability to understand linguistic signs. Asemia is caused by damage to the areas of the brain that process communication – more specifically, when there is damage to the left side of the brain in the areas that process communication such as Broca's and Wernicke's areas. Damage can be inflicted by physical trauma to the brain, but is more commonly caused by stroke and sometimes tumors. The onset of this condition is usually quick but not permanent. Treatment of this condition is traditional speech therapy in which the individual must relearn how to read, write, and talk. Depending on the severity of the injury, recovery can take days to years. Considerable recovery is common, but often not to the full extent of baseline ability. == Symptoms == Asemia is a more severe condition than aphasia, so it does have some similarities with the disease. People who have asemia have the inability to comprehend signs, symbols, and even language. They also have the inability to use signs, symbols, and language. People with asemia sometimes may take up asemic writing, which is \\"wordless\\" writing. What wordless writing could mean is that the writing looks like regular or traditional writing, but there is no content that makes sense. The concept of syntax, semantics, or even communication does not exist in asemic writing. == Causes == The most common cause of asemia is brain damage, such as a stroke or a brain tumor. Other possible causes include Alzheimer's disease and infection. Roger Wolcott Sperry, through his research of split-brain patients, had found out that the human brain lateralizes functions, meaning that the two hemispheres of the brain have different functions. Brain damage, specifically to the left hemisphere, can impair our ability to speak or understand language. This led Sperry to conclude that due to the lateralization of brain function, language is based in the left hemisphere. Therefore, any kind of brain damage to the left hemisphere will greatly impact language, whether it is expressive or receptive. == Treatment == Speech therapy is usually the most common treatment for asemia. Speech therapy allows the patient to be able to improve their speaking, comprehension, and writing skills. These patients have to learn all of these skills again since they are unable to understand or express anything. It usually depends on how long it takes for the speech therapy to work. If the condition is less severe, it will take less time, such as perhaps a couple of months to years. If the condition is more severe, it may take many years. The way speech therapy works is through speech practice as well as using special computer programs which let the patient practice their communication skills. By using simple and short sentences or writing down these phrases can aid the patients while going through therapy. Giving them enough time to communicate with their friends, family, or therapist will help them increase their skills and be able to manage them. Complete success is usually achieved with treatment. However, sometimes only partial success is achieved and the patient cannot fully comprehend everything. With the partial restoration of some skills, the speech therapist may only focus on the skills which can be restored. In other cases, the therapist may work on the skills which may not retrieved and teach the patient how to handle those. == See also == * Lists of language disorders ==References== Category:Symptoms and signs: Nervous system Category:Communication disorders Category:Aphasias ","title":"Asemia"},{"id":"20372092","text":"Taxobeni is a commune in Fălești District, Moldova.

John Bennett was a Manchester car dealer selling locally made Belsize cars and holding agencies for several French makes. This merged with a similar company, Bennett and Carlisle, to become Newton-Bennett. As well as selling cars, they manufactured vehicle parts, and R.O. Harper was employed as works manager. In 1907 they became agents for the Italian SCAT and Harper was sent to Turin to help develop a car specifically to be sold by Newton-Bennett, but this never got beyond a prototype. Instead, they purchased a complete factory, also in Turin, that had made the VALT car. With Harper installed at the new factory, he designed a car which would be badged as a Newton-Bennett. In 1914, the name changed to Newton but the outbreak of World War I and a large increase in import duties seem to have stopped production. In 1915 the factory was sold to Diatto. A Newton car was advertised again post war as the Ten, this time with a smaller 1086 cc engine with twin overhead camshafts. Between 500 and 1000 cars are thought to have been made. At least five cars are thought to survive. ==Newton-Bennett== The car had a 2155 cc four-cylinder, water-cooled, side- valve engine This was directly attached to a four-speed gearbox and then by shaft to the rear axle. A compressed air starter was fitted. The steel section chassis had half-elliptic leaf springs all round. The brakes followed the convention of the time, with the hand lever operating the rear drums and the foot pedal a transmission brake. Even though the cars were right hand drive, the gear change lever was on the driver's right side, as was the custom at the time. The car was distinguished by a sharply V-shaped radiator. The cars were moved to England in chassis form and either supplied as such to buyers or had bodies built by Newton-Bennett. Most were four-seat open tourers but some two- seaters and closed saloons were also made. Some were exported directly from Italy. ==Newton Ten== The car was available in two sizes, a short-wheelbase sports and standard model. The distinctive pre-war radiator design does not seem to have been carried through. The maker of the engine is not known, but it used Bosch electrics and a Claudel-Hobson carburettor. The conventional chassis with half elliptic leaf springs had four-wheel brakes. It was advertised in chassis form at £395. == References == Category:Defunct motor vehicle manufacturers of England Category:Defunct companies based in Manchester ","title":"Newton-Bennett"},{"id":"20372191","text":"Kim Kuk-Jin (born 5 January 1989) is a North Korean international football player.

Both parts originally aired on the Sci Fi Channel in the United States for October 3, 2008, and subsequently aired on ITV4 in the United Kingdom on October 6 and October 13, 2008. They were written by Damian Kindler, and directed by Martin Wood; both were known for their works on the Stargate franchise. \\"Sanctuary for All\\" is set in the fictional city of Old City, where forensic psychiatrist Will Zimmerman (Robin Dunne) investigates the bizarre murder of two police officers, and eventually comes across Helen Magnus (Amanda Tapping) and her team, who are hunting the creature responsible, known as an \\"abnormal\\". The title refers to the motto on Magnus's business card. It also achieved high ratings for both the Sci Fi Channel and ITV4, and received generally positive reviews. For its visual effects, the series premiere won a Gemini Award, and a further Leo and Emmy nominations. ==PlotPart 1=== As the episode opens, two police officers answer a call to a disturbance in the home of Eastern European immigrants. They discover the body of a man, apparently shot in the head, then they notice a young boy cowering under the bed in the same room. As he attempts to coax the boy out, the first officer is killed by a mysterious snake-like creature, which stabs him in the forehead, leaving a wound resembling a gunshot. When the boy emerges from behind the bed, the snake creature rears and (although not shown) it kills the second officer. After the deaths, forensic expert Will Zimmerman (Robin Dunne) is called in to inspect the murder scene. The police assume the victims have been shot, and claim to have apprehended the shooter (played by David Hewlett in the first webisode, but was played by another actor in this episode), who was fleeing the scene. Will sees no evidence of a gun being used and quickly deduces that all is not as it seems at the apartment, but his theories are ridiculed by Detective Joe Kavanagh (Kavan Smith). As he leaves, Will spots the boy and chases him down a back alley, where he narrowly avoids being struck by a young woman on a motorcycle who is also evidently pursuing the boy. He begins to chase them both, but moments later he is struck from behind by a car. Before lapsing into unconsciousness, he catches a glimpse of the driver—Helen Magnus. Will regains consciousness and finds himself at Magnus' home. She begins to explain the truth behind the murders, and reveals that she knows about Will's long-repressed and traumatic childhood memory of his mother being killed by some kind of monster. She offers Will a position with her organization - The Sanctuary, which is housed in a top secret base under a partially ruined cathedral in an unnamed city. It houses a variety of \\"abnormals,\\" who are, she believes, some of nature's triumphs and mistakes. Magnus explains that these creatures would have been mistreated, exploited or killed in the outside world, and that she and her team have dedicated their lives to rescuing and caring for these abnormals. She shows Will the fantastic creatures who inhabit the Sanctuary, including a mermaid; he also meets a Bigfoot (played by Christopher Heyerdahl), who has become one of Magnus' staff after being rescued and healed by her. She tells Will that she has been tracking the \\"snake-boy\\", cryptically hinting that he is, and yet is not, responsible for the murders. Though very reluctant and confused, Will agrees to give the new job a try. In the next sequence, we discover that the girl on the motorcycle is Magnus' daughter, Ashley (Emilie Ullerup); she locates and chases the \\"mutant\\" boy down into the subway tunnels and after she finally corners him, Helen arrives and assists with his capture. On their return to the Sanctuary, they discover that the boy, Alexi (Cainan Wiebe) has a symbiotic appendage growing from his abdomen, which seems to have a will of its own. This symbiote is evidently responsible for the murders, although the team are as yet unable to work out why, so Magnus assigns Will his first task - questioning the boy and finding out why his symbiote has killed. ===Part 2=== Will questions Alexi, and realises that the symbiote detects fear in its host and only kills if the boy feels frightened, remaining dormant if he feels safe. They also learn that his mutation has been caused by the Chernobyl disaster. Meanwhile, John Druitt (also played by Christopher Heyerdahl), who appears to have the power to teleport anywhere at will, arrives in search of the Sanctuary, although he is at first prevented from entering by some kind of force barrier. John then locates Ashley and confronts her; after a struggle, she and one of her colleagues are eventually able to subdue him using tranquillizers and a powerful Taser charge, although as he collapses he recites some kind of poem or incantation which mentions \\"The Five\\" (this is the first reference in the series to a key plot element which will have great significance in later episodes). Helen has meanwhile learned of a prostitute who has been murdered, and seems somewhat disturbed by this development. Soon after Ashley has brought Druitt inside the Sanctuary, he reveals that he has allowed himself to be captured. He immediately escapes and forces Magnus' technical expert Henry Foss (Ryan Robbins) to shut down the EM shield. Now free to teleport at will, he appears in Magnus' study, seizes Ashley, teleports away with her, and imprisons her in the enclosure of one of the deadliest abnormals, as a means of forcing Magnus to do his bidding. However, unknown to Druitt, Ashley is quickly rescued by Will and \\"Bigfoot\\". Druitt then returns to Helen, reveals that he is dying again, and forces her to give him some of her blood to save him. However Magnus has prepared for such an eventuality and gives him a poisoned blood vial instead, hoping to end his reign of terror. Although evidently affected, Druitt manages to teleport away. Soon after, Will's repressed childhood memories are triggered by the sight of the abnormal from which Ashley has just been rescued. He finally realises that it was Magnus who had saved him as a boy from the monster that killed his mother. Realising that she looks exactly the same, he at first assumes that she can travel through time, but Magnus then admits that she in fact 157 years old, and that her longevity is the result of being injected with Vampire blood during her studies in Oxford University in the 1800s. Helen then reveals that Druitt had been her fiancé in the 1880s. After suffering a life-threatening injury, she saved his life, but the procedure had given him the power to teleport. This had driven him insane, and he went on a killing spree, murdering at least eight prostitutes in Victorian London - John Druitt is in fact the serial killer who has become known to history as Jack the Ripper. In a flashback, we see Helen confronting John in an attempt to stop him committing the last of Ripper murders, but he kills the girl anyway and teleports away, although Magnus apparently wounds him as he vanishes. She then reveals that, after John's disappearance, she froze one of the embryos she had conceived with him, but when she could no longer bear the loneliness of losing him, she used it to give birth to their daughter Ashley, who knows nothing of her father's true identity. It is because of Druitt's power that Magnus has placed an EM shield around the Sanctuary, to prevent him from being able to teleport into it. Zimmerman decides to join the Sanctuary. ==Production== The producers wished to feature the series in a fictional city, Old City, located in the West Coast of North America. The working name for the city was \\"Odisburg\\". The idea behind Alexi's \\"creepy\\" expressions in the beginning of the episode were Wiebe's idea, and the producers granted his request. Both parts of the episode were effectively reshoots of the first of the original webisodes. According to director Martin Wood, much of the footage of the webisodes were reshot in a very similar style. The producers decided not to include virtual sets for the first 20 minutes of the episode, in order to lull the audience to a false sense of security, so the production crew filmed on location. The apartment building from the beginning of the episode were shot at the partially decommissioned Riverview mental care facility. Because the producers found the location \\"creepy\\", they felt the location could be used to impart this creepiness to the audience. In the 18 months between the webisodes and the series, Wiebe grew taller. The corpses used in the beginning were mannequins the props department had in their possession and put holes in the forehead, and were easier to use than actors. Like the web series, much of the episodes were filmed on green screen. The production team performed over 480 visual effects shots, compared to 12 visual effects shots from an average Stargate episode. Amanda Tapping (also executive producer of the series) described the process of using the green screen like doing theatre, and hadn't used green screen to such an extent during her tenure in Stargate. The opening shot for the premiere took three months for special effects supervisor Lee Wilson's Vancouver-based company to complete. ==Reception== Some reviewers have said that Robin Dunne's character, Will Zimmerman is somewhat similar to Stargate SG-1's Daniel Jackson. The series premiere received a household rating of 2.2, the highest rated original series premiere from the Sci Fi Channel since the series premiere of Eureka in July 2006. The 2.2 rating represented more than 2.7 million viewers; 1.08 million among the adult 18–49 demographic and 1.4 million among the adult 25–54 demographic. This placed Sanctuary the number one cable program among adults 25–54, and number four among adults 18–49. The ratings success also boosted the web series to 1.2 million views. In the United Kingdom, both parts placed the series first place on the top ten viewing programmes for ITV4 during the two weeks they aired. The first part was viewed by 565,000, while the second part received a higher viewing figure of 608,000. Reviews of the pilot were generally positive, where reviewers marked comparisons between Sanctuary, and other science fiction series such as Primeval and Torchwood, as well as the comparisons between Zimmerman and Stargate SG-1's Daniel Jackson. Jason Hughes of TV Squad described the episode as \\"one of the more hyped premieres of recent years on Sci Fi,\\" and thought it made a \\"nice job of creating a cohesive narrative from the elements of [the] webisodes,\\" as well as praising Christopher Heyerdahl's acting for John Druitt's stereotype as the antagonist. Hughes also dubbed the green screen usage as a resounding success, though he felt that some of the scenes somewhat hindered the pace of the episode. Mark Wilson of About.com stated that the synergy between the writers and cast looked promising, and that Robin Dunne's performance is \\"one who really pulls the viewer into Sanctuary,\\" as well as stating the cast served as eye candy for the viewers, since they consist of guest stars, who made other appearances throughout other series as Stargate (Tapping, Heyerdahl, Kavan Smith), Battlestar Galactica (Kandyse McClure), Flash Gordon (Panou) and The 4400 (Caiman Wiebe). Tory Ireland Mell of IGN rated the episode a \\"great\\" 8.7 out of 10, describing the story as intriguing, and the concept as mind blowing, and though the concept of the series from a production standpoint was executed well, but criticised the seemingly slow pace. Paul Simpson of Total Sci-Fi rated the both parts 7/10, and made comparisons of this episode, and \\"Everything Changes\\", the pilot episode of Torchwood. He thought the first part, with such aspects as Heyerdahl's effective acting holds potential for the series, while the second part still reminisces Simpson of Primeval and Torchwood again, but still holds potential. However, Brian Lowry of Variety has said that the pilot episode was \\"Uninspiring\\" and further stated that it didn't \\"Rock anyone else's world.\\" The visual effects of the episodes were submitted for three award nominations, one of which was won. In 2009, the first part won a Gemini Award for \\"Best Visual Effects\\", beating fellow nominee \\"The Five\\". It received a Leo Award nomination for \\"Best Visual Effects in a Dramatic Series,\\" but lost to Stargate Atlantis' \\"First Contact\\". It was nominated for a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Special Visual Effects but lost to Heroes. ==References*Sanctuary for All, Part 1 on scifi.com *Sanctuary for All, Part 2 on scifi.com Category:2008 American television episodes Category:Sanctuary (TV series) Category:American television pilots Category:Television episodes about Jack the Ripper ","title":"Sanctuary for All"},{"id":"20372290","text":"Bridge on Gokase River was a Japanese railway company.

On September 6, 2005, flooding triggered by Typhoon Nabi washed away two bridges on the line, halting all operations. By December, it was clear that no government funding for rebuilding was available. Attempts by local communities to rebuild the railway were unsuccessful.

Mani. It stars Suresh Gopi as Police Commissioner Bharath Chandran IPS, and also features Ratheesh, Shobana, Vijayaraghavan, M. G. Soman, Rajan P. Dev, K. B. Ganesh Kumar, N. F. Varghese, Karamana Janardanan Nair, and Maniyanpilla Raju in pivotal roles. The background score was composed by Rajamani. The film follows Commissioner Bharath Chandran's investigation into the murder of Justice Mahendran, which eventually leads him to confront the corrupt Mohan Thomas, a Delhi-based businessman who is involved with illegal businesses such as money laundering, illegal drug trade, and counterfeit money operations. Commissioner was a major commercial success. It is a cult film among Keralite audiences. The Telugu dubbed version Police Commissioner was a major commercial success. The sequel Bharath Chandran I.P.S. was released in 2005, directed by Ranji Panicker. In 2012, a crossover film The King & the Commissioner, with the characters from The King (1995), Commissioner (1994) and Bharath Chandran I.P.S. (2005) was released. But it was mainly panned by critics and audiences alike. ==Plot== The movie opens with Kozhikode city police commissioner Bharathchandran (Suresh Gopi ), an honest but brash cop, busting a gold smuggling racket in. Bharath clearly has an issue with authority and breaths fire each time he encounters a political arm bender, such as Kunju Moideen Sahib (K. P. A. C. Sunny), whose gang was involved in the bust. But it his mentor and guardian angel I.G. Balachandran (M.G. Soman), who has been evidently shielding him from the wrath of the political brass. The story takes a break from Bharathchandran to introduce the main antagonist Mohan Thomas (Ratheesh), a Delhi based business tycoon, with strong political clout and a clear sociopathic agenda. It is revealed that Mohan Thomas had entrusted Sahib with the gold, which was confiscated by Bharathchandran and is in fact the kingpin heading an unholy nexus of politicians, criminals and various officials including two high ranking cops, Rajan Felix, I.G. Vigilance (Rajan P. Dev) and Menon, A.I.G. (N. F. Varghese), who are involved in criminal activities like instigating communal riots and large scale distribution of counterfeit currency. Bharathchandran and Mohan Thomas are set on a collision course when Mohan and Co. brutally murder Justice Mahendran (Karamana Janardanan Nair), chairman of the Poovanthura commission, possessing evidence that could potentially incriminate Rajan Felix and Menon, for their direct involvement in communal riots at Poovanthura. Bharathchandran is not only assigned to investigate the homicide but also made police commissioner of Thiruvananthapuram city. Assisted by ASP Prasad Menon (K. B. Ganesh Kumar) and ASP Mohammed Iqbal (Vijayaraghavan), two dynamic but brash officers, Bharathchandran tries to solve the mystery, but soon to hit a dead-end. Until Bharathchandran's fiancée Indu (Shobana), who is also a lawyer, tips him off about the news clip on an assault on a drunk police constable Gopinathan (Maniyanpilla Raju, who also was coincidentally the security for Justice Mahendran. In an attempt to take Sunny, Mohan's younger brother who had assaulted the constable within the college premises results in a massive riot as well as a standoff with Rajan Felix, who tries to save Sunny by trying to take him into his custody claiming previous charges. The only clue that is left with Bharathchandran and crew are based on Vattapara Pithamparan's (Augustine), a trade union leader, tipoff, that Sunny had actually attacked Gopinath because of Gopinath's comment on counterfeit currency. With this vital clue Bharathchandran unearths more dirt on Mohan Thomas & Co. Further Bharathchandran arrests Srilatha Varma (Chithra), Mohan's legal advisor and mistress, but is brutally murdered in a hotel elevator by Wilfred Vincent Baston (Bheeman Raghu), a Goan hitman, who had also murdered Justice Mahendran. Bharathchandran is successful in nabbing Antony Ignatius Pimento, Wilfred's right-hand man and zeroes in on Wilfred. Then he stages a coup by arresting both Rajan Felix and Menon, who are brutally tortured to reveal details on their alliance with Mohan Thomas and also sheds light on their agenda. Iqbal is killed brutally in an attempt to arrest Wilfred Vincent Baston. This enrages Bharathchandran, who later brutally kills Wilfred and then Mohan Thomas at an outhouse by torching the whole house, thus taking law into his own hands. == Cast == *Suresh Gopi as City Police Commissioner Bharathchandran I.P.S *Ratheesh as Mohan Thomas *Shobhana as Advocate Indu Kurup *Vijayaraghavan as Muhammad Iqbal I.P.S. *K.

Thorbjørn Egners lesebøker () were a series of sixteen readers for elementary school written by Norwegian author Thorbjørn Egner. Egner spent 25 years working on the seriesconsisting of collected literature as well as his own stories and illustrationsand they were published in the years 1950-1972. The books were intended for children aged 8-15, which at the time corresponded to grades 2nd-9th. Among the recurring characters was the young boy Ola-Ola, who grew up on a farm on the Norwegian countryside, but later moved to the city and had to adapt to a new life. Other stories took place in far-away lands, reminiscent of the environment in Egner's celebrated People and Robbers of Cardemon Town. There were also a selection of songs and poems in between the stories. The books took over the role held for decades by the readers of Nordahl Rolfsen in the Norwegian educational system. Rolfsen's books were published in the years 1892-1895, and had been the standard works since, but starting in the 1950s, Egner's books took over this position. Egner himself considered the series to be the magnum opus of his collected works. In 1972, howeverthe year when the last book in the series was publishedthe educational program of Norwegian primary schools was altered. The new scheme largely abandoned the use of basic readers in the curriculum. As a result, Egner's textbooks were rendered virtually obsolete as educational tools. The books remain an important part of the Norwegian cultural heritage, being considered children's classics, and some of them have been reprinted more recently. ==ReferencesFurther reading== * * Category:Series of children's books Category:Early childhood education Category:Early childhood education in Norway Category:Norwegian books Category:Reading (process) ","title":"Thorbjørn Egners lesebøker"},{"id":"20372328","text":"Bodhe is a village development committee in Dhankuta District in the Kosi Zone of eastern Nepal.

The species was first described by Jacob Hübner in 1799. It can be found in Europe and from North Africa up to the Caucasus area. The wingspan is 28–36 mm in the first generation; the second and any subsequent generations are on average much smaller often only 19 mm. Front and hindwings have almost the same colour. This is however very variable and ranges usually from reddish brown to reddish yellow and light brown. Some specimens are sand coloured, brown or orange. Also, the pattern is very variable. The inner and outer cross lines, as well as the median band can be very well developed, but also almost completely missing. The interior cross line, but especially the outer cross line is often replaced by a row of dots. The discal spots on the front and rear wings can be large, small or completely absent. In specimens with large discal spots, these are often with white pupils. The front wing margin stains present on the hindwings, but mostly absent. The basal half of the costa is often dark. Where the inner and outer cross line reach the costal of the forewings, noticeable spots are usually developed. The fringes usually have the colour of the wings. The subspecies lilacinipes of Madeira has a dark fringe. The species is widespread in the Mediterranean region. The occurrence ranges from the Iberian Peninsula and Morocco in the west to Greece, Asia minor and Egypt in the east. It occurs on all major islands of the Mediterranean. The occurrence continues to the Crimea and the Caucasus area to Iran and possibly Afghanistan. In France, it occurs in southern France and on the Atlantic coast to south of Brittany. Further east, the northernmost permanent presence is found in Hungary are found. The species is migratory and is therefore in the summer north of the Alps to southern England, Denmark, southern Sweden and southern Finland.

Shortly after taking his position at Kværner, Almskog announced that all the company's shipyards would be put up for sale.

But what neither realizes is that they are also bound together by a shocking secret, one that will force them to reexamine everything they believe in- including their love. == Characters  Miles Ryan === Miles lived in New Bern his whole life and married his high school sweetheart, Missy. The death of Missy caused Miles grief for many years especially because it was a hit-and-run accident. He felt lonely and was not happy without a partner in his life. He is a loving father that would do anything for his son Jonah. He is the deputy sheriff at New Bern. Eventually, he starts a new relationship with Sarah Andrews and they both have strong feelings for each other. After a while he returned to his obsession with his wife case because he had some new information. === Sarah Andrews === Is Jonah's second grade teacher. She used to live in Baltimore but moved to New Bern in the hope of starting over after a really difficult divorce. She was not able to have children which was the reason why her marriage didn't work.

After she discovered that her brother, Brian, was Missy's killer she was torn apart. === Jonah === He is a sweet seven-year-old boy who loves to spend time with his friends. Since he was really young when his mother died he does not really understand what happened. The only thing he knows is that his mom was never coming back.

Since the Knowles Memorial Chapel records for the latter half of the 1950s are not available, it is not known precisely when the committee disbanded; however, it was already out of existence before 1960. == Notable Projects  Hungerford School === Rollins College organizations were contributing to the Hungerford School in Eatonville, Florida, even before the Interracial Committee came into existence.Author Unknown. 1933.

Rajagopalachari. ==History== Vakkom Muhammed Abdul Khadir Moulavi alias Vakkom Moulavi founded the weekly newspaper on 19 January 1905, to spearhead the fight against corruption and to struggle for the democratic rights of the people in Travancore. He managed to import, directly from England, an automatic flatbed printing press, the latest type then available. The press operated from Anjuthengu (Anglican: Anjengo), a British colony at the time directly ruled by British East India Company. C P Govinda Pillai was the editor of before Ramakrishna Pillai took over as the editor in January 1906. Ramakrishna Pillai and his family had to shift to Vakkom in Chirayinkil Taluk where the newspaper office and the printing press were located. In July 1907, both the newspaper office and the family moved to Thiruvananthapuram. Though Vakkom Moulavi was still the proprietor, Ramakrishna had been given total freedom in the running of the newspaper by Moulavi. Although there were never any legal or financial contracts between the two, Moulavi provided all the financial aid to set up the press. On 26 September 1910, the newspaper and the printing press were sealed and confiscated by the British Police. Ramakrishna Pillai was arrested and banished from Travancore to Thirunelveli in Madras Province of British Raj. ::\\"Many nationalists and Indian newspapers reacted to the arrest and banishment of Ramakrishna Pillai and the banning of the paper. However, countering the king and the British Government that overruled the king, was not easy. Yet, early in the first half of the twenties, the banned newspaper was revived by the mighty will of K. Kumar of Travancore, the veteran Gandhian and Freedom Fighter. He viewed the revival as a befitting tribute to Ramakrishna Pillai. Kumar himself was its manager and chief-editor. He was assisted in his efforts by K. Narayana Kurukkal, a close colleague of Ramakrishna Pillai and the author of the novels: \\"Parappuram\\" and \\"Udayabhanu\\" besides Barrister A K Pillai. Ramakrishna Pillai's wife, B. Kalyani Amma, Pillai's associates K. Narayana Kurukkal, R. Narayana Panikker and the famous political-journalist Raman Menon and K. Kumar himself were regular contributors to the magazine. The paper was revived under the same name 'Swadeshabhimani' and had its headquarters in the building currently housing the DPI Office at Thycaud, Thiruvananthapuram. In spite of all these, the government wisely chose to remain silent. The new 'Swadeshabhimani' was re- modeled after \\"Modern Review\\" of Ramand Chatterjee. It continued its legacy as a significant force transforming the socio-political life of Kerala. K. Kumar had great admiration for Ramakrishna Pillai and he took the lead role in organizing the deportation-day of Pillai as \\"Ramakrishna Pillai Day\\" (from M.E: 10-02-1098) and erecting his statue in Trivandrum. Ramakrishna Pillai Day continued to be commemorated in Trivandrum for a long time thereafter.[18] It appears that the editorship of Swadeshabhimani passed on to A.K Pillai (by 1932) who also edited the \\"Swarat\\" with the help and support of K.

The first recorded year in Wittenberg football history was 1892. The Tigers compete in at the NCAA Division III level and the program is affiliated with the North Coast Athletic Conference (NCAC). The Tigers play their home games at Edwards–Maurer Field in Springfield, Ohio. ==Overview== With an overall record is 727 wins, 353 losses and 32 ties, Wittenberg has the second-most wins in NCAA Division III football history.(The NCAA record book reflects win-loss records through the 2011 season. Information on the 2012 season has been retrieved from the Wittenberg University web site.) Since 1955, Wittenberg has had only one losing record and has won five national championships (1962, 1964, 1969, 1973, and 1975), 18 Ohio Athletic Conference championships (1918, 1940, 1957, 1958, 1961, 1962, 1963, 1964, 1966, 1969, 1973, 1974, 1976, 1978, 1979, 1981, and 1988) and 16 NCAC championships (1992, 1995, 1997, 1998, 1999, 2000, 2001, 2006, 2009, 2010, 2012, 2013, 2014, 2016, 2017, and 2018) In 2011, the Tigers became the first D-III or D-II program to reach 700 wins with a victory over Capital in their season opener. ==HistoryGodfrey era=== Wittenberg's success in college football began under head coach Ernie Godfrey, who led the team in 1916 and from 1919 to 1928. Godfrey played college football for Ohio State from 1912 to 1914. Godfrey compiled a record of 63-24-8 at Wittenberg and were undefeated in both 1919 and 1920. Godfrey later joined the Ohio State coaching staff where he remained from 1929 to 1961. Godfrey was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame in 1975. ===Edwards era=== Wittenberg football began a period of unprecedented success in 1955 with the hiring of Bill Edwards as head coach. Edwards had been an All-American while playing for Wittenberg in 1929. After coaching the Detroit Lions (1941-1942) and other college teams, Edwards returned to Wittenberg as head football coach from 1955 to 1968. In 14 years at Wittenberg, Edwards compiled a record of 98-20-4 and two national championships. Sports Illustrated referred to Edwards as \\"a combination of Santa Claus and Genghis Khan.\\" In 1986, Edwards became the second Wittenberg football coach to be inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame. The brightest star of the Edwards era at Wittenberg was quarterback Charlie Green. With Green leading the team, Wittenberg compiled a 25-0-1 record and won two national championships from 1962 to 1964. Green totaled 5,575 passing yards and 61 passing touchdowns at Wittenberg and later played for the Oakland Raiders. In 2002, Green joined Ernie Godfrey and Bill Edwards in the College Football Hall of Fame. ===Maurer era=== After Edwards retired, Dave Maurer took over as head coach in 1969. Maurer had been an assistant coach under Edwards since 1955. Between 1969 and 1983, Maurer compiled a record of 129-23-3 for a winning percentage of .842. His teams won 11 division and league championships, two Division III national championships (1973 and 1975) and were runners-up in 1978 and 1979. In 1991, Maurer became the third Wittenberg football coach to be inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame. ===Fincham era=== Current head coach Joe Fincham took over in 1996. He has compiled a record of 154-35, and his teams have won eight NCAC championships and appeared eight times in the NCAA Division III football championship. At the end of the 2012 season, Fincham's winning percentage ranked in the top five among active NCAA football coaches. In 2011, the Tigers became the first non-Division I NCAA program to compile 700 all-time wins, and just the 19th NCAA program at any level to reach the mark. ==Coaching records== * Ernie Godfrey (1916, 1919-1928): 95-63-24 (.705) * T.

In 1854, seven Cornishmen decided to try their luck in finding gold in Australia. As they were all shareholders in the boat, it was suggested that Mystery be sold to cover their passage to Australia, but the captain, Richard Nicholls said that he would take them to Australia in Mystery. The boat was prepared for the long sea voyage by covering the hull in zinc, and adding decking fore and aft. They left Newlyn or Penzance (sources vary) on 18 November 1854, passing Madeira on 25 November and San Antonio on 3 December. After this, Mystery encountered some bad weather, and her jib split. The Equator was crossed on 15 December. Trinidad was passed on 23 December and on 26 December communication was made with the brig Callao, which was bound for Liverpool. A letter was entrusted to her captain giving details of their journey so far. The Cape of Good Hope was sighted on 17 January, and Cape Town was reached the next day, after a journey of 60 days. The Harbour Master thought that Mystery was a local boat and did not board her until the crew beached the boat with ease. Five days were spent at Cape Town repairing Mystery and replenishing supplies. They had made such good time to Cape Town that the Royal Mail commissioned them to take post on to Australia. For the first few days out of Cape Town the weather was bad, but Mystery was unscathed. Further gales were encountered on 18 and 23 February and 3 March.

The band released several records and toured the UK between 2007 and 2013. After spending 6 years pursuing individual projects, Skint & Demoralised announced a new single, which was released on Fierce Panda in spring 2019. ==Early years and formation== Skint & Demoralised began when Wakefield teenager Matt Abbott started doing stand-up performance poetry in late 2006. With themes such as tales from seaside towns and tragic nights-out, he was often a hit with a pleasantly surprised audience. These included support slots for Reverend and the Makers, Last Gang and The Research. Abbott also performed for Love Music Hate Racism and was later to take part in a House of Commons press conference on racism. In 2007 Abbott was contacted on MySpace by producer MiNI dOG, with whom he began to write. MiNI dOG began to turn Abbott's poetry into songs by chopping them apart and laying them over backing tracks before the two had even met. However, after meeting the pair developed a strong songwriting partnership, with Abbott writing lyrics and MiNI dOG writing the music and producing demos. In 2008 they released a debut single, The Thrill Of Thirty Seconds. After uploading demos onto MySpace, free download sites and also posting CDs out to DJs, the band were played and interviewed on various radio shows including Steve Lamacq on BBC Radio 1 and BBC 6 Music, Shamir Masri's 'Raw Talent' on BBC Radio Sheffield and on Yorkshire Radio. The band also received airplay on BBC Radio 1 from Colin Murray and Huw Stephens and in March 2008 recorded a live session at Maida Vale Studios for Steve Lamacq. The band signed to Mercury Records in March 2008 (part of the Universal Music Group) and released three singles, however, after recording an album in New York, the act parted company with the label in 2010. ==Live performances== Video still from 43 Degrees Skint & Demoralised's first headline UK tour was in February 2009 and included dates across the UK. One distinguishing feature of the live sets is Abbott's spoken word poems. During early live performances, he would recite the anti-racism poem BNP: Nazis on the Doorstep and often climbed on top of a nearby monitor or fixture to do so. He has supported and performed with Love Music Hate Racism since his early career and has often spoken of his support for the organisation in interviews. In addition to supporting one of Abbott's main influences, poet John Cooper Clarke, at The Duchess in York, the band performed at several new music festivals in 2009 such as Camden Crawl in London and The Great Escape in Brighton as well as major festivals such as Glastonbury Festival, Wireless Festival in Hyde Park, London, Latitude Festival in Suffolk, Leeds and Reading Festival and Bestival on the Isle of Wight. Over the summer of 2010, Abbott also performed several spoken word/stand-up comedy gigs which included dates at Latitude Festival and Leeds Festival. 2011 saw them tour the UK to promote the release of their first two albums, with headline shows alongside support slots for Art Brut, The Crookes and John Cooper Clarke. They ended the year headlining the Full English Christmas festival in Berlin and Dresden alongside other English acts including The Lovely Eggs. Their 2019 comeback show took place at London indie venue The Social in Fitzrovia. ==Debut album, Love, And Other Catastrophes== Whilst signed to Mercury, Skint & Demoralised recorded their debut album Love And Other Catastrophes in 2008 with Funk/Soul session band The Dap-Kings at The Daptone Studios in Brooklyn, New York. The second half of the session was at RAK Studios in St John's Wood, London, produced by Gledhill, credited as MiNI dOG. MiNI dOG also mixed eight of the tracks, with the other four being mixed by Jeremy Wheatley. The single Red Lipstick was released July 2009 by Mercury. As well as a TV appearance and performance on Loose Women, they enjoyed national airplay over the summer of 2009 with the single \\"Red Lipstick\\", spending several weeks on the BBC Radio 1 B-List and being chosen as the \\"Weekend Anthem\\" by Sara Cox. This single was also included in the playlist for the long running BBC TV series Waterloo Road (TV series) series 5, episode 7 and features alongside debut single The Thrill of Thirty Seconds in the series 3 soundtrack for BBC TV series Gavin & Stacey. National broadsheet and tabloid press followed from Q Magazine, Clash Magazine, The Independent, The Scottish Sun and The Sunday Times' Culture magazine and The Guardian. However, the album was leaked online months before it was due to be released, which included full-length promotional copies being sold on eBay and large numbers of downloads through illegal file sharing. It was never officially released by Mercury Records, but was eventually released by indie label Heist Or Hit alongside the band's second album This Sporting Life in summer 2011. The album was also released on 12\\" vinyl with bonus tracks, by German indie label Firestation Records in 2011. ==Second album, This Sporting Life== On 21 September 2010, Abbott announced via his Twitter and Facebook pages that the band would be reforming, after it was initially announced over a year ago that they had split up in favour of a solo project from Abbott. A second album was written and recorded in the last few months of the year at MiNI dOG's home studio in Sheffield. Videos were made for demo tracks from the second album, setting the songs to stills from Abbott's favourite films including A Taste of Honey, Saturday Night and Sunday Morning, L'Appartement, Amélie and Trainspotting. With a new line up the band played several live dates over spring 2011 and announced that they'd signed a deal with Indie label Heist Or Hit Records. Both the band's new album This Sporting Life and their previously unreleased debut Love And Other Catastrophes were released as a 2CD Bonus Edition on 2 August 2011. The new album was named after the 1963 Wakefield based kitchen-sink drama of the same name. ==Third album, The Bit Between The Teeth== In August 2012, the third album, The Bit Between The Teeth, was announced in an interview on a Canadian music site, with an official announcement detailing the band's single release on the record label's website in 2013.

The group first appeared in Banda district, Uttar Pradesh, as a response to widespread domestic abuse and other violence against women. It was previously commanded by Sampat Pal. The group consists of women between 18 and 60 years old. It is reported to have spread and since 2010, and it has been active across North India, both on the streets and in local politics.Gulabi gang engagement in politics == Background == The Gulabi Gang is unofficially headquartered in Badausa in Banda district, Uttar Pradesh. As of 2003, the district was ranked 154th on the Planning Commission's list of 447 districts based on an index of backwardness. The district has an abundant Dalit (untouchable caste) population which is subjected to discrimination by people from everywhere. == Description == Data Satbodh Sain founded the Gulabi Gang in 2006 in response to the lack of police support for victims of domestic violence. Most, if not all, are members of lower castes. The gang focuses its attention on India's most impoverished region, with about half of its population facing poverty, lack of education, and other concerns. The gang fights for the rights of women regardless of their caste. There are also male members, such as Jai Prakash Shivhari, who joined to stand in solidarity against issues like government corruption, child marriages, and dowry deaths. In 2010, a law was enacted which helped reserve 33 percent of parliamentary seats for women, but the Gulabi Gang still operated because they saw immediate results. The Gulabi cites that even female politicians can be corrupted. They prefer vigilante justice instead of working with politicians as well, with Pal noting that they can maintain their own good work so they will not be taken for granted by the state while also preferring to work on their own rather than with government organizations. Some gang members are unemployed, some are agricultural workers, and some make their living in jobs set up through self- help groups. These jobs include selling vegetables, sewing, or trading other commodities.Gulaabi gang as a social movement: An analysis of strategic choice Miller Katy 12 June 2013 George Mason University  http://mars.gmu.edu/jspui/bitstream/handle/1920/8670/Miller_thesis_2013.pdf 14 June 2020}} Al Jazeera reported that the group has an estimated 400,000 members as of 2014; the Hindustan Times put the figure at 270,000. Pal explains they are not a gang in the typical sense, but are a \\"gang for justice.\\" She credits her upbringing for inspiring her sense of justice when she was married off at the age of 12 years old, however, on 2 March 2014, Pal was relieved of her role at the head of the Gulabi Gang amid allegations of financial impropriety and putting her personal interests before those of the group. Pal denied these allegations and still has some involvement in the gang. The Gang has several stations set up and each station has a head of a section called the 'commander', who handles daily activities and smaller problems of people on her own. She sends regular updates and reports larger problems to the leader of the Gang. Word of mouth and newspaper articles about the Gang's actions are its main source of advertisement. Abused women who hear about it narrate their stories to the group. The first step is to request the police to take charge. If this fails, the Gang takes over. At the formation of the gang, force and violence were used against the police and government, however, the local police claim \\"the gang is doing some good work and in a way helping us solve issues.\\" There is no discrimination based on gender because the gang not only focuses on male jurisdiction over women, but also on human rights and male oppression. Members of the Gulabi Gang were increasingly being asked by men to support local activism. When 7000 Banda farmers protested in the streets to demand compensation for failed crops, the men asked the Gulabi Gang to attend. Community service efforts of the gang include food and grain distribution to villagers in rural areas, pension to widows who do not have the means to support themselves in their old age, and helping prevent the abuse of women and children. The Gulabi Gang also teaches women self-defence and how to be economically self-sufficient. The Gulabi Gang earned the Kelvinator 11th GR8! Women Award, an award offered by the Indian Television Academy. They also earned the Godfrey Phillips Bravery Award for social bravery, offered in Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand, and Delhi. Corporate partnerships of the Gulabi Gang include Vitalect, a technology and services company that works with non-profit organisations to assist them with their technological needs, and Social Solution India (SSI), a non-profit company that promotes NGO stability == Incidents == In June 2007, Pal heard that government-run fair-price shops were not distributing food and grains to the villagers as they should. She led the gang to observe the shop undercover and they collected evidence and discovered that trucks were shipping the shop's grains to open markets. Pal and the gang reported the evidence to local authorities and demanded that the grain be returned to the fair-price shops. The local authorities ignored their complaints but the reputation of the Gang was bolstered. In 2008, they stormed an electricity office in Banda district and forced officials to turn the power back on, which they had cut to extract bribes. They have also stopped some child marriages and protested dowry and female illiteracy. In 2007, a Dalit woman was raped by a man of a higher caste and the incident went unreported. The villagers and members of the lower caste protested to no avail and many of them were put into prison for doing so. The Gulabi Gang took action, charged into the police station and attempted to free the villagers who were put into prison for protesting. They also demanded that a case be made against the rapist and when the policeman refused to make a case, they resorted to violence and physically attacked him. From that time, the Gulabi Gang was known to use physical violence if needed to make a point and if physical violence was of no use, then they would resort to publicly shaming the offender. Despite becoming popular for its violent approach to much of its activism, it also uses non-violent tactics such as marches and occupations. In 2011, the gang helped Sheelu Nishad, a 17-year-old girl who had been gang raped. Nishad was arrested after arriving to the police station to file a report. The rapists, which also included a member of legislature, arrived to the police station first and requested her arrest. The victim's father approached the Gulabi Gang who in turn organised two mass demonstrations in front of the police station and legislator's house. Pal has said that \\"Yes, we fight rapists with lathis [large bamboo sticks]. If we find the culprit, we thrash him black and blue so he dare not attempt to do wrong to any girl or a woman again.\\" Suman Singh, a later commander of the gang, mentioned that when \\"a woman seeks the membership of Gulabi Gang, it is because she has suffered injustice, has been oppressed and does not see any other recourse. All our women can stand up to the men and if need be seek retribution through lathis.\\" == Education == One goal Sampat Pal had was to alleviate the illiteracy among young women. In 2008, a school was created in Banda, where a least 400 girls attended. == In popular culture == * The Gulabi gang is the subject of the 2010 movie Pink Saris by Kim Longinotto as is the 2012 documentary Gulabi Gang by Nishtha Jain. * Initially, it was reported that the Bollywood film, Gulaab Gang, starring Madhuri Dixit and Juhi Chawla as leads, was based on Sampat Pal's life, but the director denied this, saying that he admired her work but that the movie was not based on her life. * In 2013, a book was published about the Gang's origins and work, called \\"Pink Sari Revolution: A Tale of Women and Power in India.\\" * The Gulabi Gang is featured in the 2017 song Des fleurs et des flammes by French singer Tal from her album Tal. * The Gulabi Gang is featured in N.H.

According to the Mahabharata, Purushottama (Vishnu) killed a Danava (demon) named Panchajana on a mountain named Chakravanor \\"in another universe\\" When Lord Buddha achieved enlightenment, he saw millions and millions of “chakravan” or cosmoses, all repeatedly coming into existence, lasting for a while, and then disintegrating. constructed by Vishwakarma and took away the conch shell in which Panchajanya had lived. The conch was named after the Danava. In Bhagavad Gita,the Panchajanya is mentioned: As per the Harivamsa, Krishna, the avatar of Vishnu, is described as possessing a conch shell called Panchajanya, one of his four attributes together with the mace Kaumodaki, the disc-like weapon Sudarshana Chakra and a lotus flower. The conch was used during the Kurukshetra War. Panchajanya or Shankhasur was an evil sea demon who lived in a colossal conch shell in the deepest depths of the Prabhasa ocean or was a demon in the form of a conch shell. He kidnapped the son of Sandipani, the guru of Shri Krishna, Balarama, Sudama,and Uddhava and imprisoned him in the conch shell. Upon completion of their studies, Krishna, Balarama, and Uddhava persuaded the teacher to ask for the preceptor's dakshina (fees) of his liking. Sandipani asked for, as his dakshina, the restoration of his child. Krishna became enraged when he heard about the kidnap and plunged into the sea to rescue the son of Sandipani. Krishna successfully slew Shankhasur and took the conch shell for himself. He then went to his guru Sandipani who named that conch as Panchjanya. Whenever Krishna blows from the shell it foreshadows the death of his next opponent. The great war of the Mahabharata began after blowing Panchjanya by Lord Krishna. Vishnu is said to be quad-armed and he is depicted holding in one of his hands the panchajanya conch, which, like other shastras, has been transferred to lord Krishna on earth from the so-called heaven- Vaikuntha dhama. Lord Krishna found him in a deep sea. A demon used to sleep in this conch and thus was destined to be killed by holy god, at the time of receiving the conch. ==References== Category:Hindu mythology hi:पाञ्चजन्य ","title":"Panchajanya"},{"id":"20372978","text":"Panchganchi is a village development committee in Jhapa District in the Mechi Zone of south-eastern Nepal.

Being one of the few villages in Jhapa through which East-west Highway runs also makes the village one of the most important towns in the region. It has significant religious importance due to its being on the bank of Kankai river where the famous Koti Hom Religious Area is situated. Surunga was named after its historical meaning: Surung (Tunnel). It is believed that five brothers from Hindu mythology mahabharat along with their mother kunti escaped from the palace and finally reached Surunga underground. ==Population== Estimated population in 2001 census was around 17,000 but currently this could be around 35,000 with a large influx of people from different villages of Eastern hills and various parts of India.

It is one of the most important educational and business centers in the region. No political parties, ethnic groups or professional organization has been able to shut down Surunga bazaar over the last few years. Defying all manner of bandas, Surunga has earned a reputation as the country's only anti-banda town. The locals say Surunga bazaar has not been closed down even for a single day in the last six years. According to District Traffic Police Office Jhapa, the district has seen shutdowns for 31 days in the last two years. But, no banda has had any impact in Surunga. In the past, the locals of Surunga have even chased away political party cadres trying to shut down the bazaar by force. Due to this reason trade is easy in Surunga. ==Religious and touristic sites== Surunga is famous for Kotihome religious site that lies on the westernmost point of the VDC. Every year hundreds of thousands of devotees flock to this area to worship. The most remarkable occasion is Makar Sankranti when Maghe Mela is organized which is attended by thousands of people from as far as Biratnagar, Dharan, Itahari, Ilam, Kakarvitta and Indian states of West Bengal (mostly Darjeeling and Jalpaiguri), southern Bhutan and Assam. Domukha is a tourist destination in the eastern part of Nepal. Kankai river flows through the chure range of hills, comes and reaches the plains of Terai region. Because of the Domukha Dam that was constructed to build Kankai Nahar (channel), there's a huge reservoir of water which is serene and clear most of the year. Many youngsters visit this place for picnic, field visit, excursions and simply to cool off from the scorching heat. Domukha is also a connecting point to Surunga for people living in high hills and southern Ilam. According to mythology, around this area used to be the palace of Kirant King in the history. These days another religious place has become visited, Dhanushkoti Dham, which is supposed to be place of \\"Arjun's meditation in The Mahabharat\\". Its growing to be one of the most important religious sites and picnic place nowadays. A more fascinating fact about it is that this lies just the opposite bank of Damukha. Kankai Bridge: The bridge over the Kankai river is one of the long concrete bridge in the country and measures 703 meters. The longest barrage/dam is on Koshi River and the longest bailey bridge is on Mahakali River connecting rest of Nepal to the 2 Nepali villages beyond Mahakali called Chandani and Dodhara villages. Jamunkadhi Simsar, where many animals like deer, pythons, bears, sambar deer and porcupine are protected, is also located in this VDC. A park named Happy Land has been established recently and is gaining popularity among the local tourists. The park is located on the bank of Sankha Khola, approximately 1 km north from the town. ==Health services== Surunga has a government-run primary health care center that is staffed by a medical doctor, health assistant, AHW, nurses and other helpers. The PHC also has vaccination center for snake bite which is a highly prevalent condition in the region especially from the Cobra and Krait. Besides, there are a lot of pharmacy stores like Sitaula Pharmacy, Pradhan Medical, Asmita Medical etc. that mostly sell medicines to the people and also provide consultation related to medical conditions with the help of medical doctors who rotate on hourly basis. Recently, Marigold Hospital and Sidhakali Hospital have been set up to cater to the growing health needs of the people. However, there is no medical institution in Surunga that can provide inpatient services to the people. When they have major health problems, the citizens of Surunga have to either go to Damak, a bigger city in western Jhapa that has AMDA clinic or to Dharan BPKIHS where the largest medical institution of Eastern Nepal is situated. Some of the people also travel as far as Siliguri, second largest city in West Bengal state of India for better treatment. People also travel to Kathmandu for treatment. Drinking water: Surunga has drinking water supply that is collected from underground water and treated before distributed to the taps in every house. This was constructed by the initiative of local people and support from the district development committee. The drinking water project covers most parts of the VDC. It is also ranked one of the best drinking water service in the Eastern Region of Nepal.

She was the wife of Sima Yi, a prominent military general and regent of the state of Cao Wei during the Three Kingdoms period of China. She was posthumously honoured as Empress Xuanmu in 266 by her grandson Sima Yan, who ended the Cao Wei state and established the Jin dynasty that year. ==Life== Zhang Chunhua was from Pinggao County (平臯縣), Henei Commandery (河內郡), which is present-day Wen County, Henan. She was born in the late Eastern Han dynasty. Her father, Zhang Wang (張汪), served as the Prefect of Suyi County (粟邑縣) in the state of Cao Wei during the Three Kingdoms period. Her mother, whose maiden family name was \\"Shan\\" (山), was a grandaunt of Shan Tao, one of the Seven Sages of the Bamboo Grove. In her youth, Zhang Chunhua was already known for her good moral conduct, intelligence and wisdom.(宣穆張皇后諱春華，河內平臯人也。父汪，魏粟邑令；母河內山氏，司徒濤之從祖姑也。后少有德行，智識過人，...) Jin Shu vol. 31. Zhang Chunhua married Sima Yi and bore him three sons – Sima Shi, Sima Zhao and Sima Gan (司馬幹). She also bore him a daughter whose personal name was not recorded in history, but was historically known as Princess Nanyang (南陽公主) of the Jin dynasty.(...生景帝、文帝、平原王幹、南陽公主。) Jin Shu vol. 31. Sometime before 208, when the warlord Cao Cao wanted to recruit him to serve in the government, Sima Yi lied that he suffered from paralysis and stayed at home. One day, while Sima Yi was drying his books under the sun, there was a sudden downpour, so he immediately rushed out to collect his books. One of his maids saw what happened. Zhang Chunhua was worried that the maid would leak out news that Sima Yi was well and get their family into trouble, so she killed the maid to silence her. She then personally prepared meals for the family. Sima Yi was very impressed with her.(宣帝初辭魏武之命，託以風痹，嘗暴書，遇暴雨，不覺自起收之。家惟有一婢見之，后乃恐事泄致禍，遂手殺之以滅口，而親自執爨。帝由是重之。) Jin Shu vol. 31. In his later years, Sima Yi favoured his concubine Lady Bai (柏夫人) and started neglecting Zhang Chunhua. Once, when Sima Yi was ill, Zhang Chunhua visited him, and he said to her, \\"Old creature, your looks are disgusting! Why do you even bother to visit me?\\" Zhang Chunhua became angry and attempted to starve herself to death. Their sons did so too. Sima Yi was so shocked that he immediately apologised to his wife and reconciled with her. Sima Yi later secretly told someone, \\"It doesn't matter if that old creature died. I was actually worried about my boys!\\"(其後柏夫人有寵，后罕得進見。帝嘗臥疾，后往省病。帝曰：「老物可憎，何煩出也！」后慚恚不食，將自殺，諸子亦不食。帝驚而致謝，后乃止。帝退而謂人曰：「老物不足惜，慮困我好兒耳！」) Jin Shu vol. 31. Zhang Chunhua died sometime between 22 May and 19 June 247 at the age of 59 (by East Asian age reckoning). She was buried at the Gaoyuan Mausoleum (高原陵; somewhere in present-day Yanshi, Luoyang, Henan). The Wei emperor Cao Fang granted her the posthumous title \\"Lady of Guangping County\\" (廣平縣君). In 264, during the reign of Cao Huan, she was given the posthumous name \\"Consort Xuanmu\\". A year later, Sima Yi's grandson Sima Yan forced Cao Huan to abdicate in his favour and established the Jin dynasty to replace the state of Cao Wei. Sima Yan became emperor and he posthumously honoured his grandmother as \\"Empress Xuanmu\\".(...葬洛陽高原陵，追贈廣平縣君。咸熙元年，追號宣穆妃。及武帝受禪，追尊為皇后。) Jin Shu vol. 31. ==In popular culture== Zhang Chunhua is first introduced as a playable character in the eighth instalment of Koei's Dynasty Warriors video game series. She also appeared in the Hong Kong comic series The Ravages of Time by Chan Mou. Liu Tao portrayed Zhang Chunhua in the 2017 Chinese television series The Advisors Alliance. ==See also== * Lists of people of the Three Kingdoms * Family tree of Sima Yi#Sima Yi ==NotesReferences== * * Fang, Xuanling (ed.)

They were designed by D. E. Marsh and were built by Messrs Kitson & Co. in 1905 and 1906. ==History== Prior to taking up office as the Locomotive Superintendent of the London, Brighton and South Coast Railway in 1905, Douglas Earle Marsh had worked for the Great Northern Railway at Doncaster Works. There he had been involved in the design of the Klondyke class designed by Henry Ivatt in 1897. There was an urgent need for new large express passenger locomotives for the LB&SCR; and so he obtained a set of drawings of the large boilered GNR atlantics from Doncaster, and made only detailed amendments before ordering them from the manufacturer. He did however increase the boiler pressure from . ==Performance== The class soon proved to be successful working the London to Brighton express trains including the heavily loaded Pullman services the \\"Brighton Limited\\", and The Southern Belle, which the LB&SCR; described as \\"the most luxurious train in the World\\". ==Superheating== In May 1920 L. B. Billinton wished to install the Schmidt superheater to improve the efficiency of the class, but was refused permission to do so by the Brighton Locomotive Committee. This modification was however carried out by Richard Maunsell of the Southern Railway during 1925–1926 after the \\"Grouping\\" of 1923. ==Re- allocation and naming== 38 Portland Bill No 39 was named La France from Jun 1913 to Jan 1926, following its use on the train for a State visit of the French President; this was the only Brighton Atlantic to carry a name in LBSCR days. During 1925 and 1926 the H1 class were gradually replaced on the London- Brighton express trains by the \\"King Arthur\\" and \\"River\\" classes, but there was still plenty of work for them on other express services, including the boat trains connecting with the Newhaven-Dieppe ferry service. At the same time they were all named after geographical features of the south coast. ==Withdrawal== Following the cessation of the cross-channel ferries after 1940, as a result of the Second World War the class were left with little work to do and several were put into store or else moved to miscellaneous duties in southern England, and the first members of the class were withdrawn in 1944. In July 1947 No. 2039 was experimentally rebuilt with sleeve valves by Oliver Bulleid as a mobile test bed in preparation for his Leader class locomotives. It was never returned to its original state and in common with the remainder of the class had been withdrawn by 1951. None have survived. ==Locomotive Summary== { class=\\" sortable collapsible uncollapsed\\" style=\\"text- align:center\\" +H1 class fleet summary ! LB&SC; Number ! Built ! S.R. Number ! Name ! B.R.

He studied painting and illustration at the Chicago Art Institute and travelled to Paris where he found work in a number of studios. By the early 1900s his attention turned to photography and he was widely regarded as the \\"creator of American photographic illustration\\". Hiller was known for dramatically staged tableaux. He would spend considerable time and effort in arranging the set and models, while an assistant took the photograph, making Hiller's contribution more directorial than photographic. He was more interested in the final result than the means used to achieve it and is remembered for saying: > If a man wants to strangle his wife and throw her in the kitchen sink, let > him do it any way he wants to. If he's doing it awkwardly, or not the way > I'd do it, all right -- it's a good job so long as he gets her into the > sink, completely strangled. From 1927-50 Hiller was commissioned by Davis & Geck to produce the prints for a series of historic advertisements entitled “Sutures in Ancient Surgery,” and published in 1944 as “Surgery through the Ages”. Hiller used elaborate costumes, dramatic backdrops and lighting, and had half-clad models posing as patients. The images depicted a broad range from mediaeval and Aztec surgeons, to surgeons from ancient Egypt and India.

Pier Luigi Bersani (Democratic Party of the Left), who had succeeded Enrico Boselli (Italian Socialist Party) in 1994, was elected President of the Region, defeating Gianfranco Morra (Forza Italia) by a landslide. For the first time the President of the Region was directly elected by the people, although the election was not yet binding and the President-elect could have been replaced during the term. This is precisely what happened in 1996, when Antonio La Forgia replaced Bersani, who had been appointed minister in Prodi I Cabinet, and again in 1999, when La Forgia was replaced by Vasco Errani. ==Electoral law== The Legislative Assembly of Emilia-Romagna (Assemblea Legislativa dell'Emilia-Romagna) is composed of 50 members. 40 councillors are elected in provincial constituencies by proportional representation using the largest remainder method with a Droop quota and open lists, while 10 councillors (elected in bloc) come from a \\"regional list\\", including the President-elect. One seat is reserved for the candidate who comes second. If a coalition wins more than 50% of the total seats in the Council with PR, only 5 candidates from the regional list will be chosen and the number of those elected in provincial constituencies will be 45. If the winning coalition receives less than 40% of votes special seats are added to the Council to ensure a large majority for the President's coalition.La Repubblica – Regional electoral law ==Results== {  + -  colspan=10center - ! colspan=2 Candidates !

The British Government next sent large numbers of persons from Scotland to the island, many were indentured servants sent in order to work off or settle debts owed to the British Government. In the years that followed, Jewish migrants from the then Dutch controlled areas of modern-day Brazil sought safe passage to Barbados. As the Jewish community brought their advanced agricultural technology to Barbados, plantations boomed with introduction of Sugar cane. This led to large groups of African people being brought to Barbados as slaves. Large numbers of African descendants began to outnumber the Europeans, who were represented by large numbers of Irish people from Ireland was then under British rule. Many European immigrants came to Barbados in the 19th and early 20th centuries: the French, Germans, Austrians, Greeks, Italians, Portuguese and Russians emigrated to the island to escape World War II and the Cold war. In the years that followed other groups of Europeans, East Indians, and a small number of Asians developed their own communities in Barbados in the late 20th century. In April 2012 the Prime Minister of Barbados held the first official new citizens ceremony at the Llyod Erskine Sandiford Centre in St. Michael. In November 2012 the second new citizens ceremony took place. ==Travel to Barbados== Nationals of CARICOM member states, the USA, Canada, the UK, and some Commonwealth countries can travel directly to Barbados with acceptable proof of nationality and identity (a valid passport from their country and/or original birth certificate with national photo identification) and may be admitted for a period not exceeding three months. All visitors are required to have onward or return tickets. Recent information from the Immigration Department indicates that CARICOM skilled nationals are required to arrive in Barbados with return airline tickets until they have been formally registered with the Immigration Department as such. The registration process can take up to four weeks to complete, and includes submitting to the Immigration Department a registration form (available at the Immigration Department or at the BIDC), along with the following documentation:Immigration & Work Permits, businessbarbados.com *Four photographs *Police certificate of character (from home country) *Birth certificate *Documentary proof of qualifications *Letter from employer, where applicable *Document certifying citizenship by descent, where necessary ==See also== * Afro-Barbadian * Irish in Barbados (Red Legs) * Indians in Barbados * Jews in Barbados * Barbadian people, such as Barbadian Americans and Barbadian British. ==References * *Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Foreign Trade of Barbados - Frequently Asked Questions *Comprehensive Review of Immigration Policy and Proposals for Legislative Reform (Green Paper), proposed Barbados Immigration law reform *The Barbados Tourism Authority *Visa form to Barbados ","title":"Immigration to Barbados"},{"id":"20373326","text":"Henry George Ley MA DMus FRCO FRCM HonRAM (30 December 188724 August 1962) was an English organist, composer and music teacher.

He was senior vice president of Cassidy & Associates and was a figure in the Jack Abramoff scandal. ==Background== Boulanger graduated from the University of New Hampshire with a degree in political science, and served in the U.S. Army Reserves for eight years. ==Early career== In 1999 Boulanger followed Jack Abramoff to work for Preston Gates Ellis & Rouvelas Meeds, and then in 2001 to Greenberg Traurig as a member of \\"Team Abramoff\\", and finally in 2004 to Cassidy & Associates. In 2000 Boulanger served on the Bush recount team for Broward and Duval counties during the Florida election recount.

His original draft said to Norton: \\"we hold you accountable\\" to shoot down \\"reservation shopping\\" by the Jenas. In June, Norton received a toned-down letter, signed by House Majority Leader Tom DeLay (R-Tex.), House Speaker J. Dennis Hastert (R-Ill.) and Majority Whip Roy Blunt (R-Mo.). Billing records and emails indicate Boulanger had 31 instances of lobbying contacts with the White House while at Greenberg. On February 21, 2002, for example, Susan Ralston e-mailed Boulanger in reference to briefing materials opposing the construction of a casino in Louisiana by the Jena Band of the Choctaw: \\"Thanks for breakfast. I showed KR the binder . . . . He gave the binder to Mehlman to read cover to cover and to be prepared.

Documents released with Boulanger's guilty plea include emails by Boulanger, Abramoff, and Ring discussing giving \\"Staffer E\\"—identified by the Associated Press as Sen.

They played in the BAFA Nation League's Midlands Conference Division One for the 2016 season but dropped out the League after one regular season game. The senior team was first formed in 2001 as the East Midlands Saxons and entered senior competition the following year. Particular seasons of note are 2008, 2012, and 2015, where the Saxons have won a significant number of games, achieved the play-offs or final, and achieved promotion. The Saxons folded in 2016 following an opening day defeat to the Nottingham Caesars. ==HistoryEast Midlands Saxons (2001-2007)=== The East Midlands Saxons were officially formed in late 2001 as a means of allowing players from the local UCLA Renegades youth kitted team to continue playing after they reached the cut-off age for youth football. Playing their home games in Boston, Lincolnshire, they were accepted into the British Senior League for the 2002 season, where they competed in Division Two North. Their largely inexperienced squad was largely drawn from the UCLA Renegades youth team and a former senior team called the Haven Raiders. They also joined together with a number of veteran players from defunct teams previously based in Kings Lynn, Boston and Peterborough. It was a struggle for most of the season and the team failed to win any of their games, losing seven and drawing three. The Saxons relocated to Spalding Rugby Club in 2003. In their opening match the recorded their first victory at this level, a 31–12 win over the Manchester Titans. The Saxons won a further two games.before losing their final five games, failing to score in three of them and finishing with a 3–6–1 record The team moved to the Castle Sports Centre in Spalding, where they played their home games for the 2004 season in the reorganised Division Two North. They suffered due to only having 3 coaches and injuries which saw them travel to several games with under 20 fit players. This led to them forfeiting their final match of the season. They lost all nine of their regular season games, only scoring 20 points. In 2005 the team was realigned to the British American Football League Division Two East and moved their home games to Stanground College in Peterborough. This move proved beneficial as they were able to recruit more players, doubling their squad size from an average of 20 to over 45. All three of the team's victories came against the Merseyside Nighthawks, whom they had failed to beat in each of their previous meetings. This number of wins was repeated the following season in 2006, with the highlight being their 14–13 victory over the Norwich Devils. After spending a season in the Eastern conference, the Saxons were once again realigned into the Central conference of Division Two for the 2007 season. After narrowly losing their first two games, they then won seven out of their last eight games and scored a total of 236 points, the fifth best total in the country. In doing so, they finished second in their group, easily qualifying for the post-season playoffs for the first time in their history. The Saxons were given a long journey north to play the Dundee Hurricanes, and lost a close game 8–14. === Peterborough Saxons (2008-2015) === The 2008 season saw the newly renamed Peterborough Saxons better the previous season's record, only losing twice, to local rivals the Cambridgeshire Cats, scoring 379 points, only being outdone by division champions, the London Cobras. They also recorded their largest-ever victory, an 80–0 win over the MK City Pathfinders. The Saxons’ last home game of the season was a local derby against the Bedfordshire Blue Raiders, which was played at nearby RAF Alconbury, in front of over 1000 spectators. The Saxons won the inaugural Tri-Base Bowl 35–3 to secure their place in the playoffs for the second year running. With 4 seconds left, the visiting Cornish Sharks scored a wild-card playoff winning field goal, securing a 6-9 win. Another league re-shuffle, saw the Saxons promoted to Division 1 for the 2009 season. The jump proved difficult, but the team remained competitive, securing 3 wins, and posting a .500 record in the 2010 season. 2011 was perhaps the closest the Saxons have come to extinction. After a poor pre-season, which saw plenty of seasoned veterans move to other teams, the Saxons only managed to play three games. After the last game the GM and head coach announced their retirement from the team. The Saxons remained thanks to the efforts of player turned GM Ryan Toone. Ryan Toone remained as the general manager until the end of the 2015 season, being replaced by Chris Dahl. The team returned in 2012 and continue to play in the BAFA National Leagues after recruiting veteran, and championship winner, William White as the head coach. Under William White the Saxons had an unbeaten season. Unfortunately, the Saxons lost in the final to the Sheffield Predators in overtime. The 2013 season, saw yet more divisional re-alignments, with Peterborough again being promoted, this time to the Premiership South. The top flight of British American football was a huge test for the team as a whole and the Saxons finished with a record of 2-8, victories at South Wales Warriors and Ipswich Cardinals along with several tight games, including narrow losses to East Kent Mavericks and Sussex Thunder led to an acceptable season for a team jumping up two divisions to compete with the best of the country. Gary Van Zandt was the obvious choice to take the helm, with an impressive football career both in the UK and in the States, and a lot of time working with the Saxons. The coaching re-shuffle went alongside a back room change, with a new committee helping to manage the team to ensure the Saxons will continue for years to come. After many years of playing at various locations around Peterborough the committee negotiated a home at Thorney RUFC, who provide excellent facilities and room for the team to grow. A solid off season and recruitment drive, introduced plenty of rookies to the sport, mixed with seasoned veterans helped to refresh and build the squad. A management decision to drop from the Premiership to rebuild the team and start afresh, the 2014 season was contested in the National Division Central; against such seasoned opponents as Leicester Falcons, Shropshire Revolution, Oxford Saints, Lincolnshire Bombers and BAFANL new boys Sandwell Steelers. The 2014 was a successful campaign under the circumstances. A squad made up of over 50% rookies, managed to win the first 3 games of the season, the only team matching the division favourites, the Oxford Saints. A season full of hard fought matches, with a small squad, had taken its toll. Going into the final game, the Saxons were sitting in 3rd place, with an outside chance of winning the title, this was unfortunately negated by a 28-0 shutout, securing the division for the Shropshire Revolution. The Saxons remaining a respectable 3rd place with a winning 6-4-0 season. 2015 had yet another league re-shuffle, moving Oxford and Shropshire out of the new third tiered BAFANL NFC II South division, and adding Leeds Bobcats and Humber Warhawks, in their inaugural seasons. The Saxons had a great season and surpassed plenty of people expectations. The only teams to beat the Saxons were the Leicester Falcons and the Sandwell Steelers, who went on to beat the Saxons in the Daffodil Bowl. ==Season records== { style=\\"font-size: 90%;\\" - !

It is the result of a still ongoing merger between two galaxy clusters. The combined cluster is six million light years across, contains hundreds of galaxies and enough gas to make a thousand more. It is \\"one of the most massive objects in the universe.\\" ==X-Ray image== The adjacent image was taken 20 August 1999 with the Chandra X-ray Observatory's 0.3-10.0 keV Advanced CCD Imaging Spectrometer (ACIS), and covers an area of 7.5 x 7.2 arc minutes. It shows a colossal cosmic \\"weather system\\" produced by the collision of two giant clusters of galaxies. For the first time, the pressure fronts in the system have been traced in detail, and show a bright, but relatively cool 50 million degree Celsius central region (white) embedded in large elongated cloud of 70 million degree Celsius gas (magenta), all of which is roiling in a faint \\"atmosphere\\" of 100 million degree Celsius gas (faint magenta and dark blue). The bright source in the upper left is an active galaxy in the cluster. ==Quick facts== Abell 2142 is part of the Abell catalogue of rich clusters of galaxies originally published by UCLA astronomer George O. Abell (1927-1983) in 1958. It has a heliocentric redshift of 0.0909 (meaning it is moving away from us at 27,250 km/s) and a visual magnitude of 16.0. It is about 1.2 billion light years (380 Mpc) away.Distance calculated from redshift. ==Merger dynamics== A2142 has attracted attention because of its potential to shed light on the dynamics of mergers between galaxies. Clusters of galaxies grow through gravitational attraction of smaller groups and clusters. During a merger the kinetic energy of colliding objects heats the gas between subclusters, causing marked variations in gas temperature. These variations contain information on the stage, geometry and velocity of the merger. An accurate temperature map can provide a great deal of information on the nature of the underlying physical processes. Previous instruments (e.g., ROSAT, ASCA) did not have the capabilities of Chandra and XMM-Newton (two current X-ray observatories) and were unable to map the region in detail. Chandra has been able to measure variations of temperature, density, and pressure with high resolution. \\"Now we can begin to understand the physics of these mergers, which are among the most energetic events in the universe,\\" said Maxim Markevitch of the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics, Cambridge, Massachusetts, and leader of the international team involved in the analysis of the observations. \\"The pressure and density maps of the cluster show a sharp boundary that can only exist in the moving environment of a merger.\\" A2142's observed X-ray emissions are largely smooth and symmetric, suggesting it is a result of a merger between two galaxy clusters viewed at least 1–2 billion years after the initial core crossing. One would expect to observe uneven X-ray emission and obvious shock fronts if the merger was at an early stage. Markevitch et al. have proposed that the central galaxy (designated G1) of a more massive cluster has merged with the former central galaxy (G2) of the less massive cluster. The relatively cool central area suggests that the heating caused by previous shock fronts missed the central core, interacting instead with the surrounding gas. ==See also== * List of Abell clusters * X-ray astronomy ==References== Category:Corona Borealis 2142 Category:Galaxy clusters Category:Abell richness class 2 ","title":"Abell 2142"},{"id":"20373860","text":"The Reo Motor Car Company Plant was an automotive manufacturing factory, built for the REO Motor Car Company, located at 2100 South Washington Street Lansing, Michigan. It was designated a National Historic Landmark (NHL) and listed on the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) in 1978, but completely demolished by the beginning of 1980. It was delisted from the NRHP in 1986. ==History== Ransom Eli Olds became a partner in his father's machine shop in 1885. He soon developed an interest in self-propelled vehicles, experimenting with steam vehicles in the late 1880s, and switching to gasoline-powered vehicles in 1896. In 1897 he renamed his father's company the Olds Gasoline Engine Works, and founded the Olds Motor Vehicle Company to manufacture automobiles in Lansing. The vehicle company floundered, and in 1899 Olds liquidated it and started a new company, the Olds Motor Works. His financial backer, lumber magnate Samuel L. Smith, insisted production move from Lansing to Detroit. In 1901 Olds brought out the low-priced Curved Dash model, which was a wild success, and the company was selling over 5000 per year by 1904. However, tension between Olds and Smith was high, and in 1904 Smith ousted Olds from the company. In August 1904, Olds founded a competing company, the R.E. Olds Motor Car Company, which soon changed its name to REO Motor Car Company to avoid a lawsuit. The company constructed a factory complex for production of automobiles. An office building and a factory, were begun immediately, and construction was completed in 1905. Business took off, and soon Olds added another story to the factory, then three smaller factory buildings. In 1908, an engineering building was added, and in 1914 another large factory.An employee clubhouse was added in 1917. By 1907, the company was one of the top four brands in the United States, but faded later as industrial giants like Ford Motor Company and General Motors gained market share. The company added a truck line in 1910, but still remained small. Olds himself turned over management of the company to his protegee Richard H. Scott in 1915, and the REO brand remained small but profitable through 1925. Over the next decade, a series of ill-advised decisions caused the company serious financial problems. It abandoned automobiles in favor of truck production in 1936. The need for trucks during World War II buoyed the company for some time, but it was sold in 1954 to the Bohn Aluminum and Brass Corporation, then became a part of the White Motor Company. It merged with Diamond T Trucks in 1967 to become Diamond Reo Trucks, but lasted only until 1975, when the firm declared bankruptcy. After bankruptcy, the Reo Motor Car Company Plant remained vacant. The buildings were completely demolished by early 1980. ==Description== The most historically significant buildings in the Reo Motor Car Company Plant were the 1905 factory and office building, the three small factories, the 1908 engineering building, the 1914 factory, and the 1917 employee clubhouse. All of these buildings are brick structures on concrete foundations, with flat or monitored roofs. ===1905 Factory=== 150px The first factory was a three-story flat-roofed red brick building, measuring 72 feet by 543 feet. It was originally two stories high, but a third story was added shortly after the original construction. The walls were of plain brick set in American bond with brick corbeling along the roofline. The windows were double-hung one-over-one sash-type units are set in rectangular surrounds capped by rounded stone arches. ===1905 Office=== 150px The office building was a two-story, rectangular brick structure with a flat roof, measuring 50 feet by 100 feet, which directly adjoined the factory. The front facade had a central entrance pavilion topped with an overhanging entablature and flanked by slightly protruding brick pilasters, with additional pilasters at the corners. It had arched window surrounds with sash-type windows and stone sills. === Factories=== 150px The three smaller factory buildings, located near the 1905 factory, were expanded in sections between about 1906 and 1919. They were two-story structures, similar in design to the 1905 factory, but much shorter. All three were constructed of brick with concrete foundations, and had a combination of flat and monitored roofs. The windows were double- hung units set in rounded arches. ===1908 Engineering Building=== 150px The engineering building was a three-story brick structure near the office. It had string courses at the base of the first and second story windows, and a heavy stone course at the base of the third story. It was topped with a wood cornice near and a heavy roof pediment. On either end of the front facade were center- pointed Norman arch windows in an arched entrance of similar design. The remaining windows were one-over-one sash uinits set in rectangular surrounds. ===1914 Factory=== 150px This factory was a three-story brick structure located near the Engineering Building. It was a rectangular structure with a full basement and a stepped-gable roof decorated with brick corbeling. The building had projecting buttresses with concrete caps and triple-hung windows in metal frames. ===1917 Clubhouse=== 150px The clubhouse was a two-story flat-roofed brick structure with a gigantic veranda ad a raised full basement, located near the office building. It measured 72 feet by 192 feet. The building had narrow stone beltcourses at the base of the first and second stories, and a heavy stone beltcourse near the roofline. There were circular between the heavy stone course and the roofline and a cornice above. The windows were one-over-one wood sash units in rectangular surrounds, with stone sills. ==References== Category:National Register of Historic Places in Ingham County, Michigan Category:Buildings and structures completed in 1904 ","title":"Reo Motor Car Company Plant"},{"id":"20373867","text":"A remnant of the Lincoln Plant Complex: A Building on Warren in 2010 The Lincoln Motor Company Plant was an automotive plant at 6200 West Warren Avenue (at Livernois) in Detroit, Michigan, later known as the Detroit Edison Warren Service Center. The complex was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1978, due to its historic association with World War I Liberty engines and the Lincoln Motor Company. However, the main structures were demolished in 2003 and NHL designation was withdrawn in 2005. ==Henry Leland's Lincoln== The 6500th Lincoln Liberty Aircraft Engine produced in the plant; Henry Leland and his son Wilfred Leland are on left Beginning in 1902, Henry Leland steered Cadillac to become a popular, high quality luxury automobile brand. Leland sold the company to General Motors in 1908, but continued his association with Cadillac until the mid-1910s, when he resigned because of the company's unwillingness to transition to World War I wartime production needs. In 1917, Leland established the Lincoln Motor Company to build Liberty engines for fighter planes using Ford Motor Company-supplied cylinders. Leland immediately purchased the former Warren Motor Car Company factory on Detroit's west side. However, he quickly realized the facilities were not sufficient to house the engine production envisioned, so he purchased a 50-acre plot of land at Warren and Livernois. The company immediately broke ground for a factory complex of over , hiring architect George Mason to design the new buildings and the firm of Walbridge-Aldinger to build them. By the end of the war, the plant complex contained the Administration Building and Garage (Building A), the machine shop (Building B), the main Factories (Buildings C and D), a power house, a heat treatment plant, a motor testing building, and other minor structures. In January 1919, after producing 6500 Liberty engines, manufacturing operations were suspended, and the war was soon over. Lincoln considered manufacturing automobile engines for other nameplates in the postwar years, but soon opted to convert to the production of luxury automobiles. However, production delays and the postwar recession of 1920 hurt sales, and the company eventually went into receivership. {class=\\" unsortable\\" ! style=\\"background:light gray; color:black\\"Early images of the Lincoln Plant Interior File:LincolnPlantDimensionalControlCenter.jpgDimensional Control Center.

Leland retained his management post after the sale, but the strong-willed Leland and Ford immediately clashed, and Leland resigned after a few months. Ford immediately began refurbishing the plant layout and manufacturing. Ford also added onto the size of the complex, hiring architect Albert Kahn to design some of the many buildings along Livernois, adding over to the plant. The Lincoln Zephyr and Continental were made in the factory until 1952, when production facilities were moved to Wayne, Michigan The new Wixom plant opened in the fall of 1957. ==The Lincoln Plant after automobiles== Ford kept some offices in the plant, and leased out portions to other companies after manufacturing operations were relocated to the new Wixom Assembly Plant . In 1955, Detroit Edison bought the complex for $4,500,000, renaming it the Detroit Edison Warren Service Center. The company consolidated many of its services into the facility, but later used it primarily as a storage yard. In recognition of its importance in automotive history, the Lincoln Motor Company Plant was designated a National Historic Landmark on June 2, 1978. However, nearly all of the plant buildings were demolished in December 2002 and January 2003, including the main Buildings A, B, C, and D. A small portion of the Factory G was retained, as well as other scattered support structures; however, because of the substantial loss of historic integrity the plant's National Historic Landmark designation was withdrawn on April 4, 2005. {class=\\" unsortable\\" ! style=\\"background:light gray; color:black\\"The Lincoln Plant Location 2010 File:Lincoln Plant Remains Detroit MI E.JPGFormer location of Administration Building on Warren and Livernois File:Lincoln Plant Remains Detroit MI D.JPGFormer location of factory on Livernois File:Lincoln Plant Remains Detroit MI C.JPGFord-built factory additions on Livernois, north end of property File:Lincoln Plant Remains Detroit MI A.JPGNewer office building on Warren, east of original Administration Building site } ==References== Category:National Register of Historic Places in Detroit Category:History of Detroit Category:Ford factories Category:Economy of Detroit Category:Former National Historic Landmarks of the United States Category:Motor vehicle manufacturing plants on the National Register of Historic Places Category:Transportation buildings and structures on the National Register of Historic Places in Michigan Category:Buildings and structures demolished in 2003 Category:Demolished buildings and structures in Detroit ","title":"Lincoln Motor Company Plant"},{"id":"20373880","text":"Elin Hilderbrand is an American writer mostly of romance novels.The Nantucket Independent, 13 June 2007. \\"for the ARTS record \\".

In a short injury-plagued career, he played in the Football League for Brentford, Cambridge United and in the North American Soccer League for Toronto Blizzard and Edmonton Drillers. Sweetzer won three caps for Canada and later became a manager and coach. As a player, he was described as \\"an aggressive, all-action, bustling striker, with little finesse about his game\\". == Club career  Brentford (1975–1978) === A forward, Sweetzer began his career in the youth system at Queens Park Rangers, before transferring to Fourth Division club Brentford in July 1975. After signing a professional contract in September 1975, he was named as the substitute for a league fixture versus Huddersfield Town late in the month. Aged 18, Sweetzer made his professional debut when he replaced Dave Simmons during the match and scored the first senior goal of his career with a late header in the 2–1 defeat. He went on to establish himself in the team and finished the 1975–76 season with 31 appearances and seven goals. Sweetzer began the 1976–77 season with niggling injuries, but after returning to fitness he showed prolific form, scoring 23 goals in 28 appearances to pull the Bees away from what would have been an almost-certain re-election scenario. He was voted the club's Supporters' Player of the Year. During the 1977–78 season, Sweetzer was part of a prolific forward line that also included Steve Phillips and Andrew McCulloch and despite being affected by injuries, he scored 14 goals in 20 appearances. With promotion to the Third Division almost assured, he was transferred out of the club in April 1978. In just shy of three seasons at Griffin Park, Sweetzer scored 44 goals in 79 appearances. === Later career (1978–1982) === Sweetzer transferred to high- flying Third Division club Cambridge United for a £30,000 fee in April 1978, a move which reunited him with manager John Docherty, who had signed him at Brentford. Sweetzer celebrated promotion to the Second Division with the club at the end of the 1977–78 season, but the remainder of his spell would be plagued by injuries and he left the club in 1980. He returned to his native Canada to play for North American Soccer League club Toronto Blizzard in 1980 and 1981, before closing out his career in 1982 with a short comeback at Brentford and a spell with North American Soccer League club Edmonton Drillers. == International career == Sweetzer won four caps for Canada in 1981. == Managerial and coaching career == Sweetzer served as manager at Isthmian League Premier Division club Staines Town between November 1990 and June 1991. He is currently a youth coach at Toronto High Park. == Personal life == Sweetzer's brothers Billy and Jimmy also played professional football. == Honours == Brentford * Football League Fourth Division fourth-place promotion: 1977–78 Individual * Brentford Supporters' Player of the Year: 1976–77 == Career statistics == {  style=\\"text-align: center;\\" ! rowspan=\\"2\\" Club ! rowspan=\\"2\\" Season ! colspan=\\"3\\" League ! colspan=\\"2\\" National Cup ! colspan=\\"2\\" League Cup ! colspan=\\"2\\" Total - !Division !Apps !Goals !Apps !Goals !Apps !Goals !Apps !Goals -  rowspan=\\"4\\" Brentford 1975–76  rowspan=\\"3\\" Fourth Division 27 5 4 2 0 0 31 7 - 1976–77 27 23 1 0 0 0 28 23 - 1977–78 18 12 0 0 2 2 20 14 - ! colspan=\\"2\\" Total !72 !40 !5 !2 !2 !2 !79 !44 - Cambridge United ! colspan=\\"2\\" Total !9 !3 !0 !0 !0 !0 !9 !3 -  rowspan=\\"3\\" Toronto Blizzard 1980  rowspan=\\"2\\" North American Soccer League 22 5  colspan=\\"2\\" —  colspan=\\"2\\" — 22 5 - 1981 19 4  colspan=\\"2\\" —  colspan=\\"2\\" — 19 4 - ! colspan=\\"2\\" Total !41 !9 ! colspan=\\"2\\" — ! colspan=\\"2\\" — !41 !9 -  rowspan=\\"2\\" Brentford 1981–82 Third Division 9 1  colspan=\\"2\\" —  colspan=\\"2\\" — 9 1 - ! colspan=\\"2\\" Brentford total !81 !41 !5 !2 !2 !2 !88 !45 - Edmonton Drillers 1982 North American Soccer League 12 2  colspan=\\"2\\" —  colspan=\\"2\\" — 12 2 - ! colspan=\\"3\\" Career total !143 !55 !5 !2 !2 !2 !150 !59 } == References  * Gordon Sweetzer at canadasoccer.com Category:1957 births Category:Living people Category:Brentford F.C. players Category:Cambridge United F.C. players Category:Canada men's international soccer players Category:Canadian soccer players Category:Edmonton Drillers (1979–1982) players Category:Canadian people of English descent Category:English people of Canadian descent Category:Association football forwards Category:North American Soccer League (1968–1984) players Category:Soccer people from Ontario Category:Sportspeople from Toronto Category:People with acquired Canadian citizenship Category:English Football League players Category:Toronto Blizzard (1971–1984) players Category:Canadian expatriate soccer players Category:Expatriate footballers in England Category:Staines Town F.C. managers Category:Isthmian League managers Category:Canadian expatriate sportspeople in England Category:Canadian soccer coaches ","title":"Gordon Sweetzer"},{"id":"20373899","text":"Ann Barbara Govednik (July 21, 1916 – August 6, 1985), also known by her married name Ann Van Steinburg, was an American competition swimmer who represented the United States at the 1932 Summer Olympics and 1936 Summer Olympics.

While the museum, established in 1855, has long held significant collections, its focus of activities on quilt scholarship and education began with the launch of the Michigan Quilt Project at the museum in 1984. The Michigan Quilt Project not only spearheaded the documentation of the state's quiltmaking history, but also stimulated interest in strengthening the museum's quilt collection, upgrading its care, and expanding its use. As of 2008, the Michigan Quilt Project has collected documentation on over 9000 quilts in the state and the collection of quilts numbers over 700 with significant examples from Michigan and the Great Lakes region, examples of quilts from numerous African countries, major ethnographic collections of Native American quilts and Michigan African American quilts, and special collections assembled by Kitty Clark Cole, Harriet Clarke, Merry and Albert Silber, Deborah Harding, and Betty Quarton Hoard. The MSU Museum also houses two important collections developed by pioneering American quilt historians Cuesta Benberry and Mary Schafer. In partnership with MATRIX: Center for Humane Arts, Letters, and Social Sciences OnLine and the Alliance for American Quilts, the MSU Museum/Great Lakes Quilt Center has spearheaded the development of two major national projects. The multimedia Quilt Treasures Project develops “web portraits” built from video-taped oral history and supporting archival materials. These web portraits document the lives, work, and influence of leaders of the American quilt revival of the last quarter of the 20th century. The Quilt Index is a national digital repository of quilt and quilt-related collections in distributed physical repositories. The Quilt Index digitally preserves the collections and makes them accessible and searchable for research and teaching. The project was beta-tested with the collections of the MSU Museum and, as of 2008, the repository holds over 18000 quilts from nine collections. By the end of 2010, another twelve collections will be added and plans are underway for the addition of scores more. ==Stated goals== According to the GLQC website, the primary goals of the center are to: * Record written and oral history documenting quilting and the personal histories of quiltmakers * Expand and maintain a research collection of information on Great Lakes quilting * Initiate educational and exhibition programs to bring quilting history to a wider audience * Increase awareness of textile conservation issues and support preservation efforts of endangered textiles * Identify and recognize quilters and quilting traditions from diverse regional, social, economic, and ethnic backgrounds * Honor outstanding individual quilters and quilt groups through the Michigan Heritage Awards and other programs * Support the continuation of traditional quilting styles and practices through the Michigan Traditional Arts Apprenticeship Program * Publish information on Great Lakes quilts, quilters, and quilting ==Collections== The Great Lakes Quilt Center is home to several distinct quilt and textile collections.

They were designed when D. E. Marsh was officially Locomotive Superintendent, and were built at Brighton Works in 1911 and 1912 ==Background== During 1911 D. E. Marsh was on leave of absence due to sickness, and his assistant Lawson Billinton was granted authority to construct a further six 4-4-2 'Atlantic' locomotives similar to the Marsh H1 class but incorporating the Schmidt superheater. ==Construction and use== The new H2 class locomotives built by Brighton railway works and introduced between June 1911 and January 1912. They were an immediate success and shared with the H1 class the London to Brighton express trains including the heavily loaded Pullman services the Brighton Limited, and the Southern Belle, which the LB&SCR; described as \\"the most luxurious train in the World\\". As with the non-superheated class they were gradually replaced on the London- Brighton express trains in 1925/6 by the \\"King Arthur\\" and \\"River\\" classes, but there was still plenty of work for them on other express services, including boat trains connecting with the Newhaven-Dieppe ferry service. At the same time they were all named after geographical features of the south coast. Oliver Bulleid, familiar with the class from his time at the LNER, increased the boiler pressure of the H2 class from 170 psi to 200 psi starting in 1938 to match the H1. Following the cessation of the cross-channel ferries after 1940, as a result of the Second World War, the class were left with little work to do and several were put into store or else moved to miscellaneous duties in southern England. The H2 class however returned to the boat trains after the end of the war and continued until the mid-1950s. ==Withdrawal== One member of the class was withdrawn in 1949, but the remainder continued in regular use until 1956.

All active urology professionals, including urology nurses, are eligible for membership of the EAU. The constituent bodies of the EAU include the: * Executive Committee (5 members elected by the General Assembly) * Executive Board (the Executive Committee and the chairs of the EAU Offices) * EAU Offices. Decisions made by the EAU General Assembly are implemented by the EAU Offices. The Executive Committee and EAU Offices are assisted by the EAU Central Office, which is based in Arnhem, The Netherlands, and run by the Executive Management. The European Academy of Urology is the advisory body to and of the EAU. The Academy consists of members who have previously had official responsibilities within the EAU. The EAU maintains close contacts with national urology organisations who represent the interests of urologists at a national level worldwide. These independent national organisations are crucial as they support the EAU and its European activities, for example the Annual EAU Congress and ‘Urology Week’, which is organised annually to raise awareness of urological conditions throughout Europe, within the healthcare professions and the general public. Urology associations in the Asia-Pacific, Latin America, the Middle East regions welcome opportunities for bilateral exchanges with EAU members with regard to training, education and other areas in urology. Ultimately, this exchange will benefit the entire specialty. During the Annual EAU Congress, a specific day has been allocated to 'Urology Beyond Europe' (see www.uroweb.org), the sessions held during this day will reinforce collaboration between the EAU and other urology societies worldwide. Other ongoing collaborative projects involving the EAU include the European Multidisciplinary Meeting on Urological Cancers (EMUC), which is organised in association with the European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO) and the European Society for Therapeutic Radiology and Oncology (ESTRO). EMUC brings together world experts in the field of urological oncology, thus providing the opportunity to increase our knowledge and improve our approach to a wide range of topics, including biology, prevention, diagnosis, therapy and quality of life. An additional example of EAU collaboration with another organisation for the benefit of urology is the World Health Organisation (WHO) Consensus Conference on bladder cancer, which was held in April 2008. The European Association of Urology Nurses (EAUN) aims to contribute to the development of higher standards of urology nursing in Europe. EAUN members receive a series of free publications and benefit from additional privileges, such as the fellowship programme. ==Annual congress== The EAU organises congresses and courses in the field of urology. The Annual EAU Congress is the largest urology meeting in the world; in 2008, over 12,000 delegates visited the congress in Milan, Italy. ==Regional meetings== The Board of the EAU has identified the need for an additional series of EU-ACME (European Urology - Accredited Continuing Medical Education) meetings on a regional, but supranational, basis. These meetings provide platforms from which new clinical or experimental work from the region can be presented to an international audience. To complement the international perspective, speakers from outside the region are invited to give lectures on current topics. Recent Regional EAU Meetings have included the 2nd North-Eastern European Meeting and the 8th Central European Meeting. ==Section Office== The EAU Section Office aims to develop specialist sections covering all sub- and super-specialist fields of urology. The participating sections promote and develop scientific and clinical programmes and organise regular meetings to disseminate information about these super-specialist activities and research. ==EU-ACME Committee== In 2004, the EAU and the European Board of Urology (EBU) – the working group of European Union of Medical Specialists (UEMS) Section of Urology – joined forces to establish a new committee: the EU-ACME to promote Continuing Medical Education (CME) and Continuing Professional Development (CPD) for all European urologists. The EBU, an independent organisation, is responsible for all regulatory matters; the involvement of EAU makes a truly European-wide system possible. European urologists can gain CME credit points by participating in accredited activities (e.g. by attending meetings or reading scientific publications and answering questions online). These activities are designed to provide information that is both relevant and essential to medical practice. We expect that national CME systems will become obligatory in Europe in the near future. All EAU events and annual meetings of the national urology societies are automatically accredited. ==European Urological Scholarship Programme (EUSP)== Knowledge shared is knowledge multiplied. The highest standards of urological care can be proliferated by sharing knowledge. The EUSP stimulates clinical and scientific research across Europe and encourages exchange of expertise and knowledge between European urologists. The EUSP offers the following programmes: • scholarship: maximum of 1 year of basic, clinical or experimental research • clinical fellowship: 6 weeks to 3 months • short-term visit: maximum of 3 weeks • visiting professorship : 4 days. ==Research Foundation== To improve and sustain the highest quality of urological research in Europe, the EAU has recently set up the EAU Research Foundation (EAU-RF), an independent body governed by the EAU. The remit of the EAU-RF is to stimulate and coordinate basic, translational and clinical research by qualified ICH GCP investigators. The EAU-RF will: \\\\- instigate the formation of networks by establishing a scientific communication infrastructure between the EAU-RF and high-profile clinical study centres, their satellites and basic science laboratories \\\\- initiate and organise multicentre and multinational clinical studies and basic science projects \\\\- initiate, fund and conduct investigator-initiated trials \\\\- identify and offer opportunities for research scholarships \\\\- communicate these activities to European urologists and to public and private sources of funding. The EAU-RF has created a governance structure designed to achieve its targets most efficiently. The PR and Fundraising Committee, the Clinical Research Committee, the Basic Research Committee and the Scholarship Committee have been set up, and are complemented by the comprehensive trial support offered at every stage by the EAU Central Research Office - CuraTrial. ==History Office== The EAU History Office keeps records of old techniques, instruments, major events and significant figures in European urology, to promote interest in the history of urology. The series ‘Historia Urologiae Europaeae’, (which forms part of the European Classical Library) contains accounts of European urological history. The ‘European Classical Library in Urology’ and ‘The Art Collection’ including ‘From Ornamentation to Mutilation’, are very popular and can be ordered from the EAU web site. ==Publications== The EAU produces several publications that help to disseminate the latest news from the Association. European Urology, the official scientific journal of the EAU, publishes peer-reviewed original articles and topical reviews on a wide range of urological issues. It is available in print and online and reaches over 20,000 readers. European Urology Today (EUT), the official newsletter of the EAU, reports news from the association and its committees as well as announcements regarding upcoming meetings and congress reports. All members are encouraged to contribute articles to the EUT discussing recent studies, technical developments, fellowship experiences, and other issues of interest to EAU members. EUT is published six times a year in newspaper format and is distributed to approximately 13,000 addresses worldwide. European Urology Video Journal (EUVJ) is produced by the EAU Video Committee on a quarterly basis. Each issue includes a DVD containing 45 minutes of footage showing surgical techniques. ==Web site== The EAU has its own web site. Details of the Annual EAU Congress, including information about the venue, scientific programme and social events, are available. In addition, the scientific programmes of all the main urology meetings, the EAU guidelines, original EAU articles (including a ‘chat’ function), a virtual school, webinars and online discussions are on the EAU website. EAU Education Office and the European School of Urology (ESU) The ESU is part of the Education Office of the EAU. Its aim is to provide every practicing urologist and urologist-in-training in Europe with a comprehensive and up-to-date overview of all contemporary issues and most recent progress within urology. Each year, post-graduate ESU training courses, covering both general and advanced clinical and research topics, are scheduled during the Annual EAU Congress. In addition, hands-on training courses are offered in collaboration with the European Society of Urological Technology (ESUT), one of the EAU offices. The ESU also organises and funds ESU Organised Courses. Course programmes are customised to meet the needs of local organisers and can vary in duration from 2 hours to up to 2 days. The ESU has started to arrange courses at all major national congresses. Another initiative from the ESU involves standalone events covering recent developments, for example the annual European Urology Forum in Switzerland. Masterclasses discussing the newest topics and latest developments in all fields of urology are held regularly. Recent masterclasses have included ‘medical treatment for urological cancer’ and ‘female and functional urology’. The ESU has also started to build the Virtual European School of Urology. Using this new educational tool, both residents and urologists will be able to access on-line CME accredited training. All ESU activities are EU-ACME accredited. ==Residents== The ESU organises the European Residents Education Programme (EUREP) course, an educational activity designed for European senior urology residents, in collaboration with the EBU. The course offers a series of teaching modules, after which an EBU examination can be taken. The EAU supports residents in terms of registration, travel and accommodation. Political commitment The European Commission strives to improve public health in the European Union, to prevent human illness and diseases, and to obviate sources of danger to human health. To achieve a high level of health protection, close cooperation with the scientific experts is vital. The WHO is the directing and coordinating authority for health within the United Nations system. The WHO is responsible for providing leadership on global health matters, and the EAU therefore strives to be a partner with regard to urological health issues, such as prostate and bladder cancer. ==Erection Hardness Score== The EHS scale developed by the association came to public note when used as the theme of the TV series Cucumber, Banana and Tofu, all by Russell T Davies. The names are used as descriptions in the associations five- part Rating scale. ==Co-operation== There are over 10 other European urology- related boards and societies to which the EAU maintains partner relations. Of these, the European Board of Urology deals with evaluation tools, educational standards and regulátory matters. This non-profit organisation sits in Arnheim, Netherlands, as well. There is an effort to standardise urological training in Europe. The highest rank for the trainee is the FEBU diploma (Fellow of the European Board of Urology) which should mark an excellence and extended qualification of the urologist, though with no legal impact for the holder. ==References== Category:Non-profit organisations based in the Netherlands Category:International medical associations of Europe Category:Urology organizations Category:Medical and health organisations based in the Netherlands ","title":"European Association of Urology"},{"id":"20374152","text":"Dekhatbhuli is a village development committee in Kanchanpur District in Sudurpashchim Pradesh of south-western Nepal.

Personenteil, Band 12, Kassel 2004, p. 308. was a composer of the late Renaissance in Italy. He was especially renowned for his lute music. ==Life and career== Molinaro was born in Genoa. He studied music with his uncle, Giovanni Battista Dalla Gostena, who was maestro di cappella at Genoa Cathedral. In 1593, Gostena was murdered, and Molinaro succeeded him in his post at the Cathedral in 1599.Cummings(n.d.) The same year he published Intavolatura di liuto, containing lute works both by himself and by Gostena. In addition to his lute works, Molinaro composed a large amount of sacred choral music, most of which does not survive completely because of missing partbooks. However, some five-voice motets have been preserved in the collections of Hasler and Schadaeus. Molinaro died in May 1636 in Genoa. Molinaro also served as editor of the works of Carlo Gesualdo, publishing editions of that composer's madrigals in 1585 and 1613. ==Assessment== In his dances for lute, according to Eitner, Molinaro \\"despises all counterpoint, and shows himself as a pure melodist and harmonist, but both in so simple and pretty a way, that they all have something uncommonly attractive\\".cited in Grove (1907) Molinaro wrote at the time when, according to Paul Henry Lang, lute music was reaching its apogee. Along with Giovanni Terzi, Molinaro's lute music introduces \\"a finished, graceful, and sovereign instrumental style, capable of all shades of expression and of a technique which we usually associate only with the vocal music of the period\\". The 1613 publication of the Gesualdo madrigals was ground-breaking because it presented Gesualdo's music in full score as opposed to partbook format. Molinaro's music was used as the basis for \\"Balletto detto il Conte Orlando\\" of the Ancient Airs and Dances Suite No. 1 by Ottorino Respighi. ==WorksLute=== * Intavolatura di liuto libro 1, Venice, 1599 ===Secular Vocal music=== * Il 1 libro di canzonette a 3 e 4 voci, Venice, 1595 * Il 1 libro de Madrigali a 5 voci, Venice, 1599 * Il 2 libro delle Canzonette a 3 voci, Venice, 1600 * Madrigali a 5 voci, Loano 1615 ===Sacred Vocal music=== * Motectorum quinis et Missae denis vocibus liber I, Venice, 1597 * Il 2 libro de Mottetti a 8 voci, Milan, 1601 * Il 1 libro de mottetti a 5 voci, con la partitura per sonar l'organo, Milan, 1604 * Il 1 libro de Magnificat a 4 voci, con basso continuato, Milan, 1605 * Concerti ecclesiastisi a 2 e a 4 voci...con la sua part. per l'organo, Venice, 1605 * Il 3 libro de Mottetti a 5 voci con il basso continuato, Venice, 1609 * Fatiche spirituali...libro 1 a 6 voci, Venice, 1610 * Fatiche spirituali....libro 2 a 6 voci, Venice, 1610 * Concerti a 1 e 2 voci con la part. per l'organo, Milan, 1612 * Passio Domini Iesu Christi secundum Matthaeum, Marcum, Lucam, et Ioannem, Loano, 1616 ==ReferencesBibliography== * Article \\"Molinaro, Simone\\". * ==External links== * * Biography at hoasm.org * Biography at answers.com * Category:Renaissance composers Category:Composers for lute Category:Year of birth uncertain Category:Italian male classical composers Category:1634 deaths Category:1570s births Category:Seicento composers ","title":"Simone Molinaro"},{"id":"20374241","text":"Rampur Bilaspur is a town in Kanchanpur District in Sudurpashchim Pradesh of south-western Nepal.

St. Olav's Cathedral ==History== By 1070, the see was established as the Diocese of Oslo, and the bishop was seated at St. Hallvard's Cathedral. In 1537 - in the course of the Lutheran Reformation in Denmark-Norway and Holstein - Christian III of Denmark suppressed the Catholic episcopates at the Norwegian sees. Thereafter Lutheranism prevailed in Scandinavia. In 1582 the stray Catholics in Norway and elsewhere in Northern Europe were placed under the jurisdiction of a papal nuncio in Cologne. The Congregation de propaganda fide, on its establishment in 1622, took charge of the vast missionary field, which - at its third session - it divided among the nuncio of Brussels (for the Catholics in Denmark and Norway), the nuncio at Cologne (much of Northern Germany) and the nuncio to Poland (Finland, Mecklenburg, and Sweden). In 1688 Norway became part of the Apostolic Vicariate of the Nordic Missions. The Paderborn bishops functioned as administrators of the apostolic vicariate. In 1834 the Catholic missions in Norway became part of the Apostolic Vicariate of Sweden, seated in the Swedish capital Stockholm. Whereas Norway north of the polar circle became the Apostolic Prefecture of the North Pole in 1855, the rest of Norway stayed with the Swedish vicariate. When a new Catholic missionary jurisdiction was established, it was not at any of the ancient episcopal sees but a mission “sui iuris” on 7 August 1868, created out of parts of North Pole prefecture and the Norwegian part of the Swedish vicariate. On 17 August 1869 the mission became the apostolic prefecture of Norway. On 11 March 1892 the Apostolic Prefecture of Norway was promoted to Apostolic Vicariate of Norway, with an altered name as the Apostolic Vicariate of Norway and Spitsbergen between 1 June 1913 and 15 December 1925. On 10 April 1931 the apostolic vicariate was divided into the Apostolic Vicariate of Oslo (extant 1931–1953; comprising southern Norway), a Catholic jurisdiction for central Norway (called Missionary District of Central Norway, 1931–1935; Apostolic Prefecture of Central Norway, 1935–1953; Apostolic Vicariate of Central Norway, 1953–1979; Prelature of Trondheim since), and a jurisdiction for Norway north of the polar circle (called Missionary District of Northern Norway, 1931–1944; Apostolic Prefecture of Northern Norway, 1944–1955; Apostolic Vicariate of Northern Norway, 1955–1979; Prelature of Tromsø since). On 29 June 1953 the Apostolic Vicariate of Oslo became a separate Roman Catholic diocese, when the same status was given in Sweden to the Stockholm diocese. On 26 February 2015, Norwegian authorities levelled charges of fraud against the Roman Catholic Diocese of Oslo and Bishop Bernt Ivar Eidsvig. According to the charges, the diocese is under suspicion of registering people as members of the Roman Catholic Church in Norway without their knowing or consent and over the course of several years fraudulently claiming membership grants from the Norwegian government to the amount of .

Especially in the minor leagues, multiple first puck drops are not uncommon; the honoree may merely pose at centre ice displaying his commemorative puck without actually dropping it into any faceoff. == Related terms == The ceremonial first puck is also referred to as the \\"ceremonial puck drop\\". Both terms emphasize that the attention is typically on the honoree who actually drops the puck rather than on the vying for it. Significantly, the ceremony involves the two opposing captains (even a goaltender) who \\"face off\\" nonconfrontationally since tradition dictates that the home player always \\"wins\\" and presents the puck to the guest of honor. The official website of the National Hockey League uses the term \\"ceremonial first puck\\" about twice as frequently as the somewhat synonymous term \\"ceremonial faceoff\\". As of November 2008, the sports news organization ESPN has never used the term \\"ceremonial faceoff\\" in any headline or teaser, while \\"ceremonial first puck\\" and \\"ceremonial puck drop\\" are used regularly. ==Noteworthy first pucks== On October 6, 2002, in front of a crowd of 18,000 at General Motors Place, Queen Elizabeth II dropped the ceremonial first puck for the National Hockey League exhibition game between the Vancouver Canucks and San Jose Sharks; this was the first time any reigning monarch, Canadian or otherwise, had performed the task. The 2007 NHL All-Star game first puck was dropped by Texas Governor Rick Perry and Dallas Stars center Mike Modano on January 24, 2007. California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger dropped the ceremonial first puck on May 27, 2007, when the Anaheim Ducks hosted the Ottawa Senators. Brian Leetch dropped the first puck on October 4, 2007, at a New York Rangers game. Capitalizing on her well-publicized advocacy of ice hockey and her self-identification as a \\"hockey mom\\", 2008 Republican Party Vice Presidential nominee Sarah Palin was invited to perform the ceremonial first puck drop at NHL games during the campaign, including the Philadelphia Flyers hosting of the New York Rangers on October 11 and the St. Louis Blues hosting of the Los Angeles Kings on October 24. As a native New Yorker and former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Colin Powell dropped the ceremonial first puck at a New York Islanders game at Nassau Coliseum on November 11, 2008, in recognition of Military Appreciation Day and Veterans Day. Powell, the first black U.S. Secretary of State and first black U.S. National Security Adviser, had earlier dropped an Islander puck on January 21, 2008, in honor of Martin Luther King Day. NBA Legend, Shaquille O'Neal, dropped the first puck on January 11, 2014, at a New Jersey Devils game in Newark. == Literal \\"first\\" puck == Although hockey has been played on ice since at least 1825, the game then more closely resembled field hockey rather than modern ice hockey. By the 1870s, the advantages of a stubby cylinder on a surface of flat ice led to the use of what the Montreal Gazette of March 4, 1875 called \\"a flat, circular piece of wood\\" which \\"slid about between the players with great velocity\\". The same publication finally referred to the hockey object as a \\"puck\\" on February 7, 1876. ==References== Category:Ice hockey terminology ","title":"Ceremonial first puck"},{"id":"20374314","text":"Up beat has many uses. ==Music== *Beat (music)#Upbeat pertains to a feature in rhythm in music ==Music and poetry== *Up-beat is a note feature in both poetry and music *Upbeat (album), 1999 album by the Fred Frith Guitar Quartet ==Television== *Upbeat (TV series) was a music television series in the 1960s ==See also== * * * Up (disambiguation) * Beat (disambiguation) * Beat Up (disambiguation) ","title":"Up beat"},{"id":"20374316","text":"Ágnes Bíró (December 28, 1917 - 2008) was a Hungarian freestyle swimmer who competed in the 1936 Summer Olympics.

A product of Partizani Tirana academy, Muzaka begun his career as a talented youth player, which prompted Paris Saint-Germain to sign him in 2000. His spell in France was short-lived, however, as he returned at Partizani one year later and commenced his professional career as 17-year-old.

He signed a contract for the 2013–14 season with an option to renew and took his favourite squad number 17. In December 2013, Muzaka was a nominee for the Albanian Footballer of the Year award, which was subsequently won by Teuta Durrës' Daniel Xhafaj. ===Return to Flamurtari Vlorë=== After becoming a free agent following the expiration of his one-year contract with Skënderbeu Korçë, Muzaka re-joined Flamurtari Vlorë, where we had played between 2012 and 2013. He officially signed a two-year contract with Flamurtari on 10 June 2014.

He then returned to KF Tirana, signing a contract until the end of the 2014–15 campaign, reportedly worth €5,500 a month. On 7 January he was officially unveiled as a KF Tirana player to the media, holding a press conference alongside the club's president Refik Halili and newly appointed director Devi Muka. He made his return debut on 24 January by playing full-90 minutes in the 2–0 home win against Apolonia Fier in the matchday 19. On 8 March 2015, during the league match against the title rivals Kukësi, Muzaka assisted the Tomislav Bušić goal in the 72nd minute, and scored himself six minutes later to seal the 2–0 win at neutral ground Niko Dovana Stadium.

He followed up the goal by scoring another one in the 3–0 win at Laçi, helping Tirana to win the first match at Laçi Stadium since 5 May 2012.

During an interview, Muzaka said that he strongly considered to quit football, but Skënderbeu motivated him to change his mind. Manager Ilir Daja who worked with him during his time at Tirana called Muzaka a \\"valuable player\\", adding that \\"he has experience and speed\\".

In Europa League, Skënderbeu was placed in Group B, and in the opening matchday away against Dynamo Kyiv, Muzaka scored his team's only after an individual effort in an eventual 1–3 defeat. His performances recently were praised by club president Ardjan Takaj, who said that Muzaka is an \\"example\\". Later on 9 February of the following year, Muzaka netted his 5th league goal, a late tap-in to seal a 1–0 home win over Flamurtari Vlorë which extended the league gap up to 11 points; it was Muzaka's third goal versus \\"The Red and Black Fleet\\" in the 2017–18 season.

Five days later, Muzaka was on the score-sheet again as he netted the first goal of 2018–19 Albanian Superliga season against Partizani Tirana; his goal was an injury-time winner with a penalty in a match which was infamously marred by crowd trouble. In October 2018, he was named Albanian Superliga Player of the Month after playing four matches and scoring the opener with a volley in the away match against Partizani Tirana; by doing so, he became the seventh player to win the award more than once and also the second to win it with two different clubs. Muzaka signed a contract for the 2019–20 season, prolonging his Skënderbeu career up to eight seasons. He was also named the new team captain for the new season. On 5 October 2019, he was substituted by Otto John in a 2–0 home win over Luftëtari Gjirokastër after suffering a heavy injury in the second half; following the examinations, it was reported that Muzaka had completely tear the cruciate ligament of right knee, which left him sidelined for at least 6 months. ==International career== Muzaka was first approached to the national team in September 2002 for three 2003 UEFA European Under-19 Championship first qualifying round matches against Russia, France and Luxembourg. It was a start to forget for Muzaka, despite playing in all three matches as starter, as Albania lost all of them with hammering results and finished last in Group 9. Some times later, Muzaka joined Albania under-21 squad in their 2004 UEFA European Under-21 Championship qualification campaign. He earned his first cap on 29 March 2003 in the 4–1 home defeat to Russia. Following that, he continued to play in every match as a starter and replacement and also scored his first goal in the last matchday against Georgia which paved way to a 3–0 win.

His competitive debut occurred on 3 September away against Romania where he came on the field in the 81st minute, just one minute after Romania had taken the lead. He made an immediate impact and in the 87th minute he managed to find a head onto Ansi Agolli's free kick which he guided past the Romanian goalkeeper, which levelled the tie at 1–1 and earned Albania a very important and well-deserved point. ==Style of play== In his youth, Muzaka was noted for his speed, technique, ball control and dribbling skills, also earning comparisons to Cristiano Ronaldo. Muzaka's natural position is right winger, but he also can play as an attacking midfielder. He is also known for his crossing and playmaking abilities but he is also an able goalscorer.

He previously worked as the offensive line coach and run-game coordinator for the Texas A&M; Aggies. He recently served as the offensive coordinator for the University of Utah. He was previously the head coach at the University of Wyoming from 2009 to 2013, where he compiled a record of 27 wins and 35 losses (). Prior to Wyoming, Christensen was the offensive coordinator for the University of Missouri and the University of Toledo. ==Early life== A native of Everett, Washington, Christensen attended the University of Washington in Seattle, where he played under head coach Don James on the Huskies football team from 1980 to 1982. He earned a B.A. degree in sociology from Western Washington University in 1985 and a M.S. degree in sports science from Eastern Washington University in 1988. ==Coaching career== Christensen was formerly the assistant head coach and offensive coordinator for the University of Missouri. He served as an offensive assistant under Gary Pinkel for 19 years, including the last 16 as his offensive coordinator. He first joined Pinkel at the University of Toledo in 1990 as offensive line coach, and was promoted to offensive coordinator in 1992. Pinkel left for Missouri in 2001, and brought Christensen along as his offensive coordinator. From 2005–2008, Christensen employed a passing-oriented version of the no-huddle spread offense.Player Bio: Dave Christensen , University of Missouri Tigers Football official website, accessed 24 November 2008. In the 2007 season, Christensen's offense used this scheme to good effect by scoring a school record 558 points. Additionally, Missouri ranked fifth in total offensive yards (490.29 per game), eighth in scoring offense (39.86 points per game), and ninth in passing yards (314.07 per game). The same season propelled Chase Daniel to Heisman finalist status. Martin Rucker and Jeremy Maclin were named consensus All- Americans, making it the first time two Tigers were named as such in the same season. Christensen himself was a finalist for the Broyles Award and Rivals.com named him as the Offensive Coordinator of the Year.

King Philip II of France. The royal standards of England were narrow, tapering swallow-tailed heraldic flags, of considerable length, used mainly for mustering troops in battle, in pageants and at funerals, by the monarchs of England. In high favour during the Tudor period, the Royal English Standard was a flag that was of a separate design and purpose to the Royal Banner. It featured St George's Cross at its head, followed by a number of heraldic devices, a supporter, badges or crests, with a motto—but it did not bear a coat of arms. The Royal Standard changed its composition frequently from reign to reign, but retained the motto Dieu et mon droit, meaning God and my right; which was divided into two bands: Dieu et mon and Droyt.Boutell's Heraldry: Frederic Warne & Co Ltd. 1973. (p252). . The standard was equivalent to the modern headquarters flag and played a significant role in the medieval army. Beneath it was pitched the tent of the leader; behind it his retainers would follow; around it they would gather after a charge to regroup; under it they would make their last stand in battle. During the Tudor period the standing army came into being and the standard ceased to be use as an instrument of war. Only to be borne by those to were entitled to fly them. ==Standards and devicesStandards=== Knight's Pennon The medieval standard was usually about eight feet long, but Tudor heralds determined different lengths, according to the rank of the nobility. \\"The Great Standard to be sette before the Kinges pavilion or tent – not to be borne in battle\\" – was 33-foot long. A duke's standard was 21-foot in length, and that of the humble knight, 12-foot long. These standards, or personal flags, were displayed by armigerous commanders in battle, but mustering and rallying functions were performed by livery flags; notably the standard which bore the liveries and badges familiar to the retainers and soldiers, of which their uniforms were composed.Stephen Friar: Heraldry (1992), p.225. . The St. George in the hoist of each standard was the communal symbol of national identity. This badge or banner of England, at the head of the standard, was the indication that the men assembled beneath it were first, Englishmen, and secondly, the followers of the man whose arms were continued on the standard.Charles Hassler: The Royal Arms (1980), p.31. . There were three main types of heraldic flag.Boutell's Heraldry (1973) . * A pennon was small, pointed or swallow-tailed at the fly, charged with the badge or other armorial device of the knight who bore it. * A banner was square or oblong (depth greater than breadth), charged with the arms of the owner with no other device, borne by knight bannerets, ranking higher than other knights, and also by barons, princes and the sovereign. * A standard was a narrow and tapering (sometimes swallow-tailed) flag, of considerable length (depending on the rank of the owner), generally used only for pageantry, and particularly to display the supporter, badges and livery colours. Mottoes were often introduced bendwise across these standards. ===Badges=== white hart badge of King Richard II. Badges may possibly have preceded crests. The Norman kings and their sons may have originally used lions as badges of kingship. The lion was a Royal Badge long before heraldic records, as Henry I gave a shield of golden lions to his son-in-law Geoffrey of Anjou in 1127. The seals of William II and Henry I included many devices regarded as badges. Stephen I used a sagittary (centaur) as a badge. Badges were widely used and borne by the first five Plantagenets, notably the planta genista (broom plant) from which their name derived; a star and crescent interpreted by some as a sun and moon; the genet of Henry II; the rose and thistle of Anne; the white hart of Richard II; the Tudor rose and portcullis. The Stuarts were the last to bear personal badges, ceasing with Anne; the royal badges afterward became more akin to national emblems, evolving into our modern versions.Charles Hasler: The Royal Arms, pp.3–11. . All sorts of devices were used on standards, generally a beast badge, a plant badge or instead of the latter a simple object (such as a knot). Sometimes the crest was used, but invariably the largest and most dominant object on a standard was one of the supporters. The whole banner was usually fringed with the livery colours, giving the effect of the bordure compony. Except in funerals, these standards were not used after the Tudor period, probably because of the creation of a standing army in the reign of Henry VIII.A.C. Fox-Davies: The Art of Heraldry (1904/1986). . ===Supporters=== Henry VII, depicting both the red dragon and the white greyhound as supporters. Supporters are figures of living creatures each side of an armorial shield, appearing to support it. The origin of supporters can be traced to their usages in tournaments, on Standards, and where the shields of the combatants were exposed for inspection. Medieval Scottish seals afford numerous examples in which the 13th and 14th century shields were placed between two creatures resembling lizards or dragons. The Royal Supporters of the monarchs of England are a menagerie of real and imaginary beasts, including the lion, leopard, panther, and tiger, the antelope, greyhound, a cock and bull, eagle, red and gold dragons, and since 1603 the current unicorn.A.C. Fox-Davies: The Art of Heraldry (1904/1986), chapter XXX, p.300. . ===Livery colours=== The term livery is derived from the French livrée from the Latin liberare, meaning to liberate or bestow, originally implying the dispensing of food, provisions and clothing &c; to retainers. In the Middle Ages the term was then applied to the uniforms and other devices, worn by those who accepted the privileges and obligations of embracery, or livery and maintenance.Friar. p.216. The royal liveries of the later Plantagenets were white and red; those of the House of Lancaster were white and blue, the colours of the House of York were murrey (dark red) and blue. The liveries of the House of Tudor were white and green; those of the House of Stuart – and of George I – were yellow and red. In all subsequent reigns, they have been scarlet and blue. ===Motto=== Dieu et mon droit (originally Dieu et mon droyt; French: 'God and my right'), as seen on Royal standards since King Edward III, is said to have first been adopted as the royal motto by King Henry V in the 15th century, and consistently so used by most later English (and British) kings, with few exceptions. It appears on a scroll beneath the shield of the Coat of arms of the United Kingdom. ==Standards of England== {  - ! style=\\"width:10%\\" Portrait ! style=\\"width:10%\\" Bearer ! style=\\"width:40%\\" Standard ! style=\\"width:40%\\" Notes - !80px !Edward III !500px  The St George's Cross in the hoist.

He joined the quartet, then the Wien Quartet, in 1926 when the quartet needed a new second violinist. Khuner was reluctant, but when he visited Rudolf Kolisch, he was in conversation with Arnold Schoenberg. \\"Does the quartet rehearse with Schoenberg?\\" Khuner asked. When Kolisch answered yes, Khuner agreed to join the quartet. He was also once said to have echoed Kolisch's remarks about Stravinsky's compositions as \\"music about music\\". One of the notable places he performed with the Kolisch Quartet was Stephen Foster Memorial Hall in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. He fled Vienna, Austria in 1938 and settled in Northern California where he joined the San Francisco Symphony Orchestra, where he would stay for 41 years. Upon the quartet's visit to Berkeley, California in the mid-1930s, Khuner chose Berkeley as the ideal place to live. He liked the cool Mediterranean climate. He met his future wife, Gertrude, in New York, and they wed in California in 1942. In 1943, he jointly performed with pianist Carl Fuerstner for several performances, playing piano-violin sonatas from between the 18th century and 1942 including composers such as George Frederick Handel, Ludwig van Beethoven, Robert Schumann and Igor Stravinsky. In the 1940s, he also performed with other San Francisco Symphony Orchestra members as the East Bay String Quartet. Months before he was too old for the draft, Khuner was drafted into the US Army. He served first as a musician, and was later sent to New Guinea. After leaving the Army, he continued playing in the first violin section of the San Francisco Symphony Orchestra, and in the San Francisco Opera and in the orchestra of the San Francisco Ballet. After he retired from the San Francisco Symphony, Khuner did one more stint, joining them for their 1972 tour of Russia. He retired from the San Francisco Opera, which did not have a mandatory retirement age, a few years later. In the 1970s, Khuner was an instructor in the music department of the University of California, teaching chamber music. He was also concert master of the Monterey Symphony in the late 1960s and early 1970s until retiring from performing in 1983. Khuner always had private violin students, giving lessons in his home in the Berkeley hills. He also performed regularly with the San Francisco Chamber Orchestra conducted by Edgar Braun. He gave his last violin lesson only a few days before he died of lung cancer in June, 1991. He was survived by his wife of 49 years, Gertrude Khuner, four children, and four grandchildren. The Felix Khuner Concert Competition was named for him. ==References== Category:Austrian violinists Category:American violinists Category:American male violinists Category:American people of Austrian descent Category:Musicians from Vienna Category:Deaths from lung cancer Category:1906 births Category:1991 deaths Category:20th-century violinists Category:20th-century American musicians Category:20th-century American male musicians ","title":"Felix Khuner"},{"id":"20374435","text":"Kim Yong-Jun (; born 19 July 1983) is a North Korean international football manager and former player and current coach. ==Club career stats== {  style=\\"text-align: center;\\" !Season!!Team!!Country!!Division!!Apps!!Goals - 2006align=\\"left\\"Yanbian FCalign=\\"left\\"270 - 2007align=\\"left\\"Yanbian FCalign=\\"left\\"2206 - 2008align=\\"left\\"Chengdu Bladesalign=\\"left\\"140 } ==Goals for senior national team== {  style=\\"text-align: center;\\" ! # !!

Government House is also used to provide accommodation for official guests to the Isle of Man, and is used extensively for official functions, such as receptions and dinners. The property has been the official residence of the Lieutenant Governor since 1863 and has been owned by Tynwald since 1903.https://www.culturevannin.im/image_collection_256530.html?element_id=256550https://www.gov.im/about- the-government/departments/cabinet-office/external-relations/crown- services/office-of-lieutenant-governor/ ==HistoryBemahague Farm=== The house was originally built as Bemahague Farm between 1820 and 1830. The name Bemahauge has both Norse and Gaelic elements, which possibly means the estate pre-dates the early Norse settlements of the 9th century. The prefix be is derived from the Norse by, which is found in a large number of Manx place names and literally means large farm or estate. The remainder of the name is Gaelic in origin and is from \\"Mac Thaidhg\\", meaning \\"son of Taig\\". The Taig family are believed to have been the original holders of the estate and the old name of Taig has been altered into the modern Keig. Long in the possession of a branch of the prominent Onchan family of Christian, the earliest mention of it is in the manorial roll of 1511, where Edmund McCorkell is shown as holding it and paying a Lord's rent. By 1600 the estate was held by a branch of the Christian family. The Christians lived and farmed at Bemahague until 1789 when Edward Christian was forced to sell the property in order to redeem a mortgage. The bulk of estate was sold for £1,000 to Robert Heywood, who was a wealthy Douglas merchant and Water Bailiff. Edward Christian had retained the mansion house along with other houses and outbuildings, but following his death less than a year later, these were also sold to Robert Heywood for a further £720. The Heywoods were a prominent family in the Isle of Man during this time, and Deemster Peter Heywood, a brother of Robert Heywood, lived at the nearby property Glencrutchery House in the adjacent quarterland of that name. Robert Heywood was the uncle of Peter Heywood, who was the midshipman on HMS Bounty. Robert Heywood never occupied Bemahague himself, but instead he let the property to various tenants until his death in 1809, when it passed to his son, Deemster John Joseph Heywood. Governor's Bridge, which is near Government House, was originally known as \\"Heywood's\\" or the \\"Deemster's Bridge\\" after Deemster J.J. Heywood. The bridge gained its present name in 1920, when it was first included in the T.T. course. Deemster Heywood let the property to an English gentleman called Joshua Farrer who was a friend of the Earl of Sandwich. During his tenancy, Joshua Farrer undertook a considerable amount of rebuilding works on the property, which took on the Regency style and completely altered its appearance. In a guide to the Isle of Man dating from 1836, titled A Six Day's Tour, By a Stranger, Bemahague was said to be \\"charmingly situated, commanding a fine view of the whole bay: the old house should be taken down, and a new one built in the abbey style; the situation deserves a good mansion.\\"A Six Day’s Tour through the Isle of Man, By a Stranger; (1836) A number of reports on Government House have said the property was rebuilt between 1820 and 1830; however this comment about the \\"old house\\" could suggest that in 1836 the old Christian family farmhouse still stood on the site and that Joshua Farrer's alterations had not yet taken place. After the death of Deemster John Joseph Heywood in 1855, Bemahague passed to his married daughter Mrs. Elinor Daly (sometimes spelt \\"Daley\\"). On her death in 1861, she left the estate to her son Francis David Daly who was a minor when he inherited. In 1863, while Francis Daly was still an adolescent, his Trustees leased the property to the Lieutenant Governor, Henry Brougham Loch. ===Government House=== Although Castletown was the capital of the island until it was transferred to Douglas in 1874, mid-19th century Douglas was a rapidly expanding commercial town with excellent sea links, and it is little wonder that the new Lieutenant Governor should wish to reside near the town. The Lordship of Mann has been vested in the Crown since 1765, when the British Government reclaimed it from the Duke of Atholl with the Act of Revestment in order to put an end to smuggling which was causing them financial losses. Historically, the custom was to have a Governor and a Lieutenant Governor who served underneath him. However, the Lieutenant Governor ceased to have a superior after the Lieutenant Governor Colonel Cornelius Smelt, who had served under Governor Atholl, was given the title in 1830. View of the residence circa 1880 In 1871 Tynwald passed an Act confirming the lease of Bemahague to the Treasurer of the Isle of Man for 21 years at an annual rental of £200. The lease stipulated that the Daly family were to contribute £1,000 towards the cost of any alterations and repairs which were deemed necessary in order to make the property a suitable residence for the Lieutenant Governor. In February 1871, the Liverpool architect Gustavus Hamilton was engaged to produce plans for alterations and extensions to the property. These alterations took nine months to complete, during which time the Governor was a guest at Bishopscourt. Prior to Bemahague, the official residences of the Governor included prominent buildings such as Lorne House in Castletown, Castle Mona and the Villa Marina in Douglas. In 1882, the owner of Bemahague, Francis David Daly, died and he left the estate in trust for his son, John Joseph Heywood Daly. In 1886, there were negotiations for Tynwald to purchase Bemahague from John Joseph Heywood Daly. However, Mr. Daly was then still a minor and did not have the power to sell. As a result of this, in 1890 Tynwald signed a lease of the property for a further 21 years and voted an additional £1,000 for alterations in order to extend the guest and servant accommodation. The subsequent alterations were carried out in 1890 by the local architect and builder, James Cowle. These included breaking through the wall between the drawing room and the dining room and fitting folding doors so that the two rooms might be thrown into one, while a bay was built onto the reception room and a smaller one to the dining room. Additional servants' bedrooms were also created by rebuilding the kitchen wing as a two storey extension. In 1891 the lease was transferred to the newly-appointed Government Property Trustees. A report in 1900 revealed that the property was costing about £200 annually for repairs, in addition to the rental charge. As a consequence of this, in July 1903 a Tynwald committee proposed that the house along with 112 acres of adjoining land should be purchased for a cost of £12,000; and on 24 November 1903, Mr. John Joseph Heywood Daly sold the property to Tynwald for that sum. Despite the previous alterations to the property, further work was carried out as it was not yet considered to be satisfactory as an official residence for the Lieutenant Governor. Internally, the main problems were said to be the small entrance hall and the awkward position of the reception rooms; externally, it was the proximity of the old farmhouse and stables to the main house. The subsequent alterations and extensions were carried out between 1903 and 1906 to the design of the architectural partnership of William Edward Willink and Philip Coldwell Thicknesse of Liverpool; amongst whose other commissions was the Cunard Building. The front or south western end of the house was pulled down and extended so that the reception rooms and study were enlarged, while a new hall, porch and main staircase were constructed. Various small outbuildings were removed and the farmyard was relocated. The stables were demolished and the cow house was converted into a stable and coach house. These changes saw great improvements to the property, which was further enhanced when the property was connected to the main water supply, rather than the water being hand-pumped from two old wells. By 30 January 1906, all of the improvement works to Government House had been completed. In 1914, there was a fire in the servants' quarters. The portion which was destroyed in the fire was the oldest part of the house with its small rooms and low ceilings, so the opportunity was taken to rebuild the accommodation and provide improved facilities. Inside Government House, several Governors' ladies have left their mark. In the late 1920s Lady Hill installed the crystal chandeliers from Paris which are in the reception rooms. In 1945 Lady Granville embroidered a bedspread and satin hangings with the Royal Coat of Arms for the Tynwald room for the visit of King George VI and her sister, Queen Elizabeth, the late Queen Mother. In the 1960s Lady Garvey added embroidery to the soft furnishings. The bell of HMS Manxman, which served with the Royal Navy as a minelayer during the Second World War, is on display in the hall of Government House. The inscription on the bell reads: \\"This bell was given by the people of the Isle of Man in memory of one of its greatest sailors, Captain John Quilliam R.N. who served in HMS Victory at the Battle of Trafalgar, 1805.\\" The coat of arms which is over the entrance doors is thought to have originally been in the old Custom House in Peel. Over the years, Government House has been updated and remodelled at various times whilst also accommodating the changing tastes and needs of successive Governors and their ladies. ==Today== Many visitors pass through Government House each year, including foreign ambassadors, politicians, and residents of the island, both young and old. Functions hosted by the Lieutenant Governor range from formal ceremonies to lunches, receptions and dinners. ==See also== *Government House - elsewhere in the Commonwealth or British Overseas Territories *Government Houses of the British Empire and Commonwealth ==ReferencesSources== Bibliography Books * Hulme, P.J.; Government Houses in the Isle of Man * Kitto J.; Historic Homes of the Isle of Man (1990). * Kniveton G.N.; The Onchan Story (1992). * Kniveton G.N.; An Illustrated Encyclopaedia of the Isle of Man (1997). * Slack S.; Streets of Douglas – Old and New (1996). * P.

In 1854 a discussion in the Star Inn in Newlyn led seven fishermen to set sail in the hope of finding their fortunes. 116 days later, their Cornish lugger, Mystery, a 37 ft fishing boat that had never previously been out of sight of land, arrived in Melbourne, 12,000 miles away. ==Construction== Spirit of Mystery was built at Millbrook by Chris Rees for Pete Goss. Construction took ten months. She is a replica of Mystery, which made a one way voyage to Australia in 1854–55. Spirit of Mystery was launched on 21 June 2008. Incorporated into Spirit of Mystery is wood from Cutty Sark, and HMS Victory, with some of the rigging coming from SS Great Britain. Construction of Spirit of Mystery closely followed the design of the original luggers. The only concessions to modernity are watertight bulkheads and heavier ballast. Electrics have been fitted as it is a legal requirement to have navigation lights. An engine has been fitted but will not be used on the journey to Australia. Internally, oil lamps will be used, and navigation will be by the sun and stars, although a satellite tracking device allows the progress of Spirit of Mystery to be followed on the internet. As on the original Mystery, a coke stove is installed. However, the diet and clothing of the crew are to modern standards, and there is a toilet and gas cooker on board. ==HistoryVoyage to Australia=== Spirit of Mystery left Newlyn at 18:00 on 20 October 2008, bound for Cape Town, just as Mystery did in 1854.

The so-called Capirola Lutebook is one of the most important sources of early 16th century Italian lute music. It is an illuminated manuscript which comprises the entire surviving output of Vincenzo Capirola. The Capirola Lutebook was compiled in 1520 by Vitale, a pupil of Capirola. The compositions included probably date from around 1517. There are 42 folios; the manuscript begins with a short note by its creator, one Vitale (Vidal), pupil of Capirola's. Vitale informs the reader that he adorned the lutebook with paintings to ensure its survival: even owners not interested in musical matters would, by Vitale's reasoning, keep the lutebook in their collections because of the paintings. This explanation is followed by a substantial text on lute playing technique, ornaments and notation--one of the most important sources on performance practice of the time.Ness, Grove. The actual music starts at folio 5. The lutebook contains the following works (for intabulations, composers of vocal originals are given): # La villanella # Recercar 1 # Oublier veuil (Alexander Agricola) # Recercar 2 # O mia cieca e dura sorte (Marchetto Cara) # Che farala, che dirala (Michele Vincentino) # La spagna 1 # Recercar 3 # Sit nomen domini (Johannes Prioris) # Padoana francese # Stavasi amor dormento (Bartolomeo Tromboncino) # Voi che passate qui (Bartolomeo Tromboncino) # Balletto # De tous biens plaine (Hayne van Ghizeghem) # Sancta Trinitas (Antoine de Févin) # Canto Bello # Recercar 4 # Padoana # Recercar 5 # Recercar 6 # Christe de \\"Si Dedero\\" (Jacob Obrecht) # Allez regretz (Hayne van Ghizeghem) # Agnus dei (Antoine Brumel, from Missa Ut re mi fa sol la) # Recercar 7 # La spagna 2 # Recercar 8 # Recercar 9 # Recercar 10 # Padoana alla francese # Recercar 11 alla spagnola # Non ti spiaqua l'ascoltar # Gentil prince # Nunca fué pena major (Juan de Urrede) # Et Resurrexit (Josquin des Prez, from Missa L'homme armé) # O florens rosa (Johannes Ghiselin) # Si dedero (Alexander Agricola) # Benedictus \\"Ut re mi fa sol la\\" (Antoine Brumel, from Missa Ut re mi fa sol la) # Bassadanza la spagna # Et in terra (Josquin des Prez, from Missa Pange lingua) # Qui tollis peccata mundi (Josquin des Prez, from Missa Pange lingua) # Recercar 12 # Recercar 13 # Tota pulchra es (Nicholas Craen) The music varies in difficulty from very easy pieces (intended, as Vitale observes, for teaching purposes) to virtuosic toccata- like works. The thirteen ricercars of the book stylistically stand between the earliest, improvisatory examples and Francesco da Milano's ricercars, which exhibit a more advanced imitative technique. The manuscript is notable not only for the place Capirola occupies in lute repertoire, but also for the earliest known dynamic indications:Reese 1954, 521. for instance, the indication tocca pian piano appears in \\"Non ti spiaqua l'ascoltar\\". However, Capirola's seems to be an isolated example.Chew, Rastall, Grove. ==NotesReferences== * Chew, Geoffrey, and Rastall, Richard. \\"Notation\\" (III.), Grove Music Online ed. L.

Like the Riesengebirge Landscape (1810) this painting was inspired by Friedrich's 1809 travels through Germany and along the shores of the Baltic Sea.P. F. R. Carrassat, Maestros de la pintura, Spes Editorial, S.L., 2005, p. 180. The observation of nature in his travels allowed Friedrich to compose a landscape that is visionary rather than literal. In the foreground a wayfarer has stopped to rest. He turns his gaze to the background, where a black abyss opens up. In those depths a few mountains can be glimpsed. Above the landscape, a rainbow forms in the waning light.Barbara Eschenburg and Ingeborg Güssow, \\"El Romanticismo y el Realismo\\" in Los maestros de la pintura occidental, Taschen, 2005, p. 447, In Friedrich's oeuvre, paintings with a sharp contrast between the foreground and background are common, a separation symbolizing the spiritual and physical planes of existence. So it is in this painting: in the foreground the sun illuminates the foliage and the clothes of the traveller, and in contrast the darkness of night fills the rest of the image. The opposites of day and night, and of spirit and matter, are unified by a rainbow, which in the Genesis account of Noah's ark symbolized the covenant between God and humanity. ==Notes== Category:Paintings by Caspar David Friedrich Category:1810 paintings Category:Collection of the Museum Folkwang ","title":"Mountain Landscape with Rainbow"},{"id":"20374762","text":"Elvi Svendsen, later Carlsen (January 8, 1920 - February 7, 2013) was a Danish backstroke and freestyle swimmer who competed in the 1936 Summer Olympics and in the 1948 Summer Olympics.

Initially focused on experimental poetry and Flash fiction, it developed a broader spectrum over time. In June 2006, a first print issue was published: the mo(nu)ment issue. At the same time, the Collaborative blog Just a moment became part of the magazine. Since the beginning, the concept of BluePrintReview is to explore unexpected connections between texts and images from unrelated places. In June 2008, BluePrintReview was reviewed by NewPages.com, and characterized as \\"an online journal constructed to ease the complex and beautiful convergence of language and art and all the possibilities this entails\\". Stories first published in BluePrintReview have been included in the best of the net online anthology by Sundress Publications, and in the Best of the Web anthology from Dzanc Books. ==Focus Issue 22: Reprints and Retrieved Magazines== Like most literary journals, BluePrintReview focuses on previously unpublished texts and images, yet includes the guideline note \\"reprints are fine, but please make sure to indicate this in the submission\\". In 2009, a pre-published text in issue 20 induced a mail discussion about the impact of magazine layouts on its content. The key line of this discussion: \\"It's fascinating how taking the same words, and framing them differently can lead to a very different emotional response—a different experience entirely.\\" From that discussion, the idea emerged to dedicate a whole blueprintreview issue to reprints, to explore the layout effect further. The issue itself has the theme \\"re /visit /cycle /turn\\", it went live in October 2009, here the direct link: BluePrintReview #22. The reprint issue also addresses the in-limbo-situation of orphaned texts: texts that get published in an online publication that later goes offline, leaving the texts as pre-published (and thus difficult to place again), but at the same time as not present any more. (A file with detailed process notes of the reprint issue and copies of the mail conversations is online, here the link: Some Aspects of Reprints.) Following the conversations, it seemed fitting to include some of those \\"orphaned texts\\" in the reprint issue – which led to a surprise finding: To be able to provide an original layout for orphaned magazines, too, and with it, a means to compare the texts in two different frames, the blueprintreview editor tried to trace the original layouts of the previously-online-magazines that first published those orphaned works. And, with the help of Internet [Archive s like the 'Waybackmachine', managed to dig up some of the original pages – and then ran into whole issues of magazines thought lost. This led to the idea to gather those \\"lost\\" links, first as literary blog notes, and later, with further input from blueprintreview contributors as well as from editors of other literary magazine, as \\"list of retrieved magazines\\" (a first version of the list is online here: Retrieved Online Literary Magazines.) ==Issues== One key element to BluePrintReview is that there are no given themes. Instead, each issue develops its own theme through submissions.

The company was based in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania and principally served junior and plus-sized women in their early teens through their late twenties. At its peak, Deb Shops operated 337 stores across 42 states. They had moved to become exclusively a plus-size store online, but the website has since ceased to function properly. ==History== The company was founded by Philip Rounick and Aaron Weiner, who opened their first store under the name JOY Hosiery in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania in 1932. JOY Hosiery initially sold reasonably priced hosiery, lingerie, and foundations in a wide variety of styles. In 1939, available nylon stockings were added to its inventory. DEB shop, Westland, Michigan The company expanded in Philadelphia area in the 1950s. Company Co-Founder Philip Rounick's son, Marvin Rounick, became more involved in the management of the company joining in 1961. Co-Founder Aaron Weiner's son, Warren Weiner, followed suit in 1965. During this time, the company observed the new phenomenon of suburban growth and construction of shopping malls. They responded by opening stores in several locations making them larger and offering more merchandise. In the 1970s, Marvin Rounick and Warren Weiner closed most of the neighborhood stores and focused on opening larger stores in shopping malls. The chain was also renamed to Deb Shops and re-focused on women's and girls' clothing. The company was listed on the NASDAQ Exchange under the ticker symbol DEBS. However, it was removed from the exchange after being acquired in 2007 by the investment firm of Lee Equity Partners for $395 million, or $28.45 per share. The company parent DSI Holdings filed for bankruptcy on June 27, 2011. The company filed for bankruptcy again on December 4, 2014. On January 7, 2015, they announced that they will close all 295 stores. The final sales occurred on March 30, 2015. As of September 2015, the company returned as an online-only retailer selling plus-size clothing. They then shut down their website at the end of 2018 in December without warning. The last posts from their social media were about sales in November and in December and then nothing after that. == References == Category:Clothing retailers of the United States Category:Clothing companies of the United States Category:Companies based in Philadelphia Category:Clothing companies established in 1932 Category:Retail companies established in 1932 Category:Retail companies disestablished in 2015 Category:Clothing companies established in 2015 Category:Retail companies established in 2015 Category:Retail companies disestablished in 2018 Category:2015 disestablishments in Pennsylvania Category:Defunct retail companies of the United States Category:Re-established companies Category:Clothing_companies_disestablished_in_2015 Category:Clothing companies disestablished in 2018 Category:1932 establishments in Pennsylvania Category:2018 disestablishments in Pennsylvania Category:2015 establishments in Pennsylvania ","title":"Deb Shops"},{"id":"20374977","text":"Lester Wheeler (born c. 1931) is a former American football player and coach.

It applies the study of astrology to medicine. Iatromathematicians viewed the human body through astrological reasoning as well as mechanics. They associate various stars, or zodiac signs with the functioning of the human body. The twelve astrological signs contribute to each part of the body from head to toe. Moreover, planets and existing cosmos in space are correlated with certain parts of the body. Through examining a natal chart, iatromathematicians attempt to predict biological setbacks in an individual. Iatromathematicians examine the active and energetic temperament of the human body. Moreover, they explore the causes of various health problems and attempt to find ways to treat certain detrimental diseases. In iatromathematics, there is a particular assumption that there is an impact of various energetic fields caused on the star bodies. The star body of an individual is often referred to by astrologists as an energetic matrix and is believed to be spawned by heavenly bodies such as the sun, moon, planets, and several other astrological signs. Iatromathematicians study these conceptions and try to regulate the path of the star body of individuals so that it will give a positive, rather than a negative result. By doing so, they believe that it will contribute to a healthier lifestyle. Its doctrine is based on cosmobiology in which several emotional and physiological dilemmas in the body are associated with the positioning of celestial bodies in outer space. Iatromathematics is closely correlated with biomechanics because the field of biomechanics investigates macrobiotic bodies to a macroscopic degree through the appliance of several engineering principles. The perspective of iatromathematicians differed from that of iatrophysicists and iatrochemists in terms of the way human bodies function. Iatrophysicists predicted the deviations from the biological norm of the body through the appliance of physics, while iatrochemists measured the detrimental problems of the body by chemical means. ==Ibn Ezra== Several individuals contributed to this field study of iatromathematics. For example, Ibn Ezra (Rabbi Avraham Ben Meir Ibn Ezra) wrote nine different astrological treatises. He covered all the subsections of astrology which include the branches of natal, medicinal, horary, electional, and mundane. Ibn Ezra’s best known work was known as The Beginning of Wisdom. Over time, various individuals studied his works comprehensively. One such person was George Sarton, who is the founder of the History of Science Society. Recently, Archibald Pitcairne was mentioned as the \\"forgotten father of mathematical medicine\\" and his contribution praised to creating the bases of iatromathematics. ==See also== *Medical astrology ==ReferencesBibliography== * * * Category:History of medicine Category:History of mathematics Category:Biomechanics Category:Pseudoscience ","title":"Iatromathematicians"},{"id":"20375085","text":"The Hotel Kewanee is a former hotel in downtown Kewanee, Illinois, located at 125 North Chestnut Street. ==History== The Hotel Kewanee was built in 1916. It is a four-story brick building, and during its heyday it featured over 100 guest rooms, a restaurant, a full bar, a lounge, a ballroom, and many local businesses in its storefronts on the ground floor. Peoria architects Hewitt & Emerson designed the building, which cost $150,000. At the time of its opening in 1916, it was known as The Parkside Hotel. This moniker lasted until the 1950s, when it was renamed The Hotel Kewanee following a major renovation. Longtime proprietor Charlie Summers, Sr. and his family owned and operated the hotel from 1962 to 1992. During this time, the hotel hosted a full-scale restaurant, bar, and lounge that were open to the public. It also hosted private functions in its ballroom until 1977, when the ballroom was replaced with additional hotel rooms. The Hotel Kewanee hosted many famous guests over the years, including: U.S. Senator Everett McKinley Dirksen (R-IL); Governor Richard Buell Ogilvie (D-IL); Maureen Reagan, daughter of President Ronald Reagan; Margaret Whiting, pop singer; Bob Crosby, bandleader and brother of actor Bing Crosby; Suzy Bogguss, country music singer; U.S. Senator John Tower (R-TX); and Marjabelle Young Stewart, author and etiquette expert. WKEI, a Kewanee-based radio station, had its studios on the fourth floor of The Hotel Kewanee from 1961 to 1981. In 2006, it was named to the National Register of Historic Places. The Henry County Housing Authority acquired the building in the early 2000s. It has been renovated for use as senior citizen housing and was renamed Parkside Apartments. == References  * Historic postcard with images of the Hotel Kewanee * Historic postcard with images of the hotel in its early years, when it was known as The Parkside Hotel Category:Hotel buildings on the National Register of Historic Places in Illinois Category:Kewanee, Illinois Category:National Register of Historic Places in Henry County, Illinois Category:Hotel buildings completed in 1916 ","title":"Hotel Kewanee"},{"id":"20375086","text":"Rodriguez in action in 2007 Ignacio \\"Nacho\\" Rodríguez Marín (born 2 September 1970) is a former Spanish professional basketball player. ==Professional career== Born in Málaga, Rodríguez played most of his career with the teams Spanish professional Liga ACB teams Unicaja Málaga and FC Barcelona Bàsquet.

(, \\"Anthem of the Exposition\\") or Himne de València (\\"Anthem of Valencia\\") is the official anthem of the Valencian Community, Spain. The song was composed by José Serrano Simeón with lyrics written by Maximiliano Thous Orts for the 1909 Valencian Regional Exhibition. The music is based on a 16th-century anthem dedicated to Saint George, who was the patron saint of the Kingdom of Valencia. It was approved by the mayors of Alicante, Castellón and Valencia in May 1925, and it was declared as the official anthem of the Valencian Community in 1981, with the approval of the Valencian Statute of Autonomy. There has been some controversy over some of the words used. Some lines are considered as being too pro-Spain and some sectors of the community are pushing for an alternative tune, the Muixeranga, to be adopted instead. The Muixeranga has no lyrics, and hails from the local holidays of the town of Algemesí. However, the official anthem is widely used, especially during Falles celebrations, days celebrating Valencian patrimony, and any matches featuring the Valencian Community autonomous football team. On 5 December 2008, a version both in Valencian and Spanish was sung and recorded by Plácido Domingo with the Orquestra de la Comunitat Valenciana.

It grew out of the Radio Research Project at Princeton University, beginning in 1937. The Bureau's first director was Austrian sociologist Paul Lazarsfeld. The project took on permanent form as the Office of Radio Research, moving to Columbia in 1939. It was renamed the 'Bureau of Applied Social Research' in 1944. The bureau was closed in 1977, when its archives were merged into Columbia's Center for the Social Sciences which in turn became part of the Institute for Social and Economic Theory and Research in 1999, which in turn became part of the Institute for Social and Economic Research and Policy in 2001. == Criticism == Daniel Lerner's involvement in the Bureau of Applied Social Research project that Traditional Society was based on has been criticized to be violating ethical considerations of research.Samarajiwa, R. (1987). The murky beginnings of the communication and development field: Voice of America and the passing of traditional society. Rethinking Development Communication, 3–19. The research was conducted as a field survey in Turkey, Greece, Germany, Lebanon, Israel, Syria, Egypt, Iraq, Iran & Jordan, with special focus on Turkey. In all, 1600 interviews were used for the book. Samarajiva writes that even though the original purpose of research had been said to be about empathy and media participation, many of the questions in the survey had to do with foreign radio broadcast and sentiments regarding US, UK and USSR. The questionnaire consisted of 9 questions about movies, 17 about newspapers and 49 about radio. Of the 49 questions about radio, 23 were about foreign broadcasting. In fact, Samarajiva writes that, > \\"A restricted document from the Program Evaluation Branch, International > Broadcasting Division, Department of State, titled 'Projected Research > Plans' and issued prior to the actual research, lists the questions Voice of > America was interested in having asked. These questions had corresponding > questions in the BASR project as well.\\" He, therefore, argues that BASR research formed the basis to find target audiences for Voice of America. According to the ethics of research as outlined by Ithiel de Sola Pool, the research project did not adequately concern itself with ethics of research. The researchers did not: * fully disclose the sponsors of the research in their host countries, * fully reveal to the native researchers the purposes of the research, * adequately publish the results of the research in the host countries, * ensure the safety of the researchers involved * In his book Sykewar, Lerner writes, > \\"In its 'cold war' with Soviet Union...

She was launched in 1943 as Cape Argos and renamed Empire Anvil before being taken into Royal Navy service. Postwar she reverted to Empire Anvil and then Cape Argos and back to Empire Anvil again. She spent ten years laid up before resuming service as Hai Ya and Fu Ming before being scrapped in 1974. ==CareerWartime=== HMS Rocksand was built by Consolidated Steel Corporation, Wilmington, California as the Cape Argos, and transferred under the terms of lend lease shortly after being completed in late 1943 under the name Empire Anvil. She was taken over by the Ministry of War Transport in 1944 and operated by Furness, Withy & Co. At the Normandy Landings, she and a sister ship Empire Javelin, were carrying US troops for Omaha Beach. In November 1944 she was requisitioned by the Admiralty and commissioned as HMS Rocksand, under which name she served out the remainder of the war. ===Post war=== HMS Rocksand participated in the reoccupation of the Nicobar Islands in October 1945, after which she was returned to the Ministry of War Transport in 1946, which briefly returned her to Furness, Withy & Co under her original name of Empire Anvil. By June 1946 she had been returned to the US Navy. In May 1947, Empire Anvil transported 1,300 Ukrainian refugees from Venice, Italy to Liverpool, Lancashire. She was operated from 1947 by the United States Maritime Commission, under her original name of Cape Argos, until 1948. It was then arranged that she would be sold to China, and she was renamed Hai Ya in preparation. The arrangement was subsequently cancelled due to the Communist take over and also she was not paid for, and by 1950 she had been renamed Empire Anvil and was laid up in the James River, Virginia. She returned to service on 27 July 1960, when the deal finally went ahead. She was renamed Hai Ya, and entered service with the China Merchants Steam Navigation Co., of Taiwan. She sailed with them until 1973, when she was sold to Yang Ming Marine Transport Corporation, and renamed Fu Ming. She had a brief career with them, being scrapped at Keelung in 1974. ==NotesReferences== * * * Category:Type C1-S ships Category:Ships built in Los Angeles Category:1943 ships Category:Empire ships Category:Troop ships of the Royal Navy Category:Ministry of War Transport ships Category:Steamships of the United Kingdom Category:Merchant ships of the Republic of China Category:Steamships of the Republic of China Category:Merchant ships of the United States Category:Steamships of the United States ","title":"HMS Rocksand (F184)"},{"id":"20375516","text":"(Lucius) Valerius Maximus BasiliusThe praenomen Lucius is assumed (fl. 4th century) was a Roman senator who held high office during the reign of the Roman emperor Constantine I. ==Biography== Valerius Maximus was a member of the fourth century patrician Gens Valeria, either the son of Valerius Messalla, the Roman consul of AD 280, or (more likely) another descendant of Lucius Valerius Claudius Poplicola Balbinus Maximus, the consul of AD 253.Mennen, pg. 127 A pagan, Valerius Maximus’ early career is unknown.

A professional competitor since 2006, Herman has competed in the UFC, Bellator, EliteXC, World Victory Road, ShoXC, and Shark Fights. ==Background== Herman was born in Columbia City, Indiana and raised in Fort Wayne, Indiana, attending Concordia Lutheran High School. At Concordia, Herman participated in various sports including football, track and field, and cross country. He also competed in wrestling for one month in his sophomore year before being expelled from the school. After taking his GED as a junior and spending a year at IPFW, Herman transferred to Indiana University at Bloomington, which has a Division I wrestling program. Despite having basically no high school wrestling experience, Herman competed for Indiana as a walk-on and excelled, competing for three full years and part of a fourth year. He red-shirted his first season which was from 2003–04 and held an impressive 28–9 record in his second season. He then claimed the exclusive starting role in his third season, holding a 28–16 record and qualifying for the NCAA tournament, in which he went 2–2. In a 2006 pre-season ranking, Herman was placed as high as eighth in the nation. In his fourth season Herman started off the season flawlessly, winning a tournament in November, but left a week later with no explanation for his departure, and later graduated from the university with a degree in general studies. Herman began training in mixed martial arts after watching one of his former college teammates train in the rising sport. ==Mixed martial arts careerEarly career=== Following a 2–0 amateur career, Herman made his professional mixed martial arts debut on December 31, 2006. He quickly amassed an undefeated 11–0 record, fighting 10 times throughout 2007, and went 13–0 before actually joining an MMA gym and officially begin training. In 2008, Herman signed with the now defunct EliteXC organization. He debuted on the undercard of EliteXC: Street Certified, defeating Mario Rinaldi via TKO. His second bout came at EliteXC: Return of the King, where he defeated Ron Waterman via TKO. He next faced Kerry Schall in the main event of ShoXC 9, which would ultimately be the final show by the company. Following the dissolution of EliteXC, Herman fought for a variety of promotions including Bellator Fighting Championships, Shark Fights and World Victory Road. Korean fighter Mu Bae Choi handed him his first loss in Japan on January 4, 2009, fighting in the Sengoku promotion. In his next fight Herman defeated Jim York at Sengoku 11. In 2010, Herman became entangled in a lawsuit with Bellator that kept him out of action in the United States for just over a year. Once the legal issues were settled, Herman was scheduled to face Ricco Rodriguez at Bellator 31 but Rodriguez pulled out of the fight due to a knee injury. Michal Kita stepped in, and served as Rodriguez's replacement. Herman defeated him via first round submission. Herman received his second loss after being disqualified for illegal knees to Rameau Thierry Sokoudjou. Herman then faced Yoshihiro Nakao at World Victory Road Presents: Soul of Fight. He won the fight via decision, the first fight in his career to go the distance. ===Ultimate Fighting Championship=== Herman was expected to make his promotional debut against Rob Broughton on June 11, 2011 at UFC 131. However, in late March, Broughton was replaced in the bout by Joey Beltran. When Brock Lesnar pulled out of his main event fight with Junior dos Santos, Jon Olav Einemo's original opponent, Shane Carwin, stepped up to replace Lesnar against dos Santos. Herman instead fought fellow UFC newcomer Einemo. Herman defeated Einemo via TKO (punches) at 3:19 of round 2 in a back and forth bout that earned Fight of the Night honors. Herman was scheduled to face Mike Russow on October 8, 2011 at UFC 136. However, the bout was cancelled after Herman failed his preliminary drug test in which he tested positive for marijuana. Herman denies using the prohibited substances. Herman fought against Stefan Struve on February 15, 2012 at UFC on Fuel TV 1. He lost the fight via TKO in the second round. Herman replaced Gabriel Gonzaga to face Roy Nelson on May 26, 2012 at UFC 146. He was defeated via KO in 51 seconds. Herman next faced Antônio Rodrigo Nogueira on October 13, 2012 at UFC 153. Herman was submitted by Nogueira via armbar in the second round, receiving the first submission loss of his career. Herman tested positive for marijuana for the second time after failing his post-fight drug test for UFC 153. He was suspended for six months and ordered to undergo treatment. The suspension was lifted in April 2013. Herman was expected to face Shane del Rosario on July 6, 2013 at UFC 162. However, del Rosario was forced off the card due to injury and replaced by Gabriel Gonzaga. Herman lost the fight just 17 seconds into the first round by TKO. After losing four fights in a row, Herman was released from the UFC. ===Titan Fighting Championship=== On January 28, 2014, it was announced that Herman had signed a contract with Titan Fighting Championship. Herman was expected to face Kalib Starnes at Titan FC 28 on April 25, 2014. However the event was delayed until May 16, 2014. He won the fight via unanimous decision. Herman was expected to face Walt Harris at Titan FC 30 on September 26, 2014. However Harris was forced out of the bout with a back injury and the fight was then rescheduled to take place at Titan FC 32 on November 20, 2014. However the bout was scrapped after Harris re-signed with the UFC. Herman was then expected to face Jon Madsen for the Titan FC heavyweight championship at the event. On November 4, 2014 it was announced that Titan FC 32 would be postponed to December 19, 2014 and will be moved from Augusta, Georgia to Lowell, Massachusetts. Herman subsequently pulled out of the bout due to an injury. ==Personal life== Herman married Madeleine Atchley in March 2014. They live on a farm and have a son, Leo. On January 19, 2015 Herman was arrested in the early morning in Indiana, allegedly after leading police on a chase. Herman faces three felony charges, including resisting law enforcement with a vehicle and battery against law enforcement, and a misdemeanor charge of child neglect. His infant child was in the vehicle when he pulled over in the closest safe well lit area. According to an incident report issued by the Dekalb County Sheriff Department, Herman was speeding on I-69 with no headlights or taillights on. When officers attempted to pull him over, Herman initially refused to pull over before stopping at a gas station, the report states. According to the report: “David exited his vehicle and approached Officers in an aggressive manner. David was given multiple warnings to get on the ground and failed to comply. David had to be tased in order to be taken into custody. An infant and adult female were also present in the vehicle.” ==Championships and accomplishments== *Ultimate Fighting Championship **Fight of the Night (One time) ==Mixed martial arts record== -  Win  align=center 22–6  Kalib Starnes  Decision (unanimous)  Titan FC 28: Brilz vs. Davis   align=center 3  align=center 5:00  Newkirk, Oklahoma, United States  -

Certain historians place him at the end of the reign in 1378 BC. Others place him in the first part of the reign. ==Life== He was succeeded as vizier in the south by Ramose, and several documents in Ptahmose's name are spread among the world's main Egyptological collections dating him at the latest to 28–30 years after Amenhotep III's reign. A stela at the Museum of Fine Arts of Lyon allows us to better know this man who – in a rare instance – combined the offices of Vizier, Mayor of Thebes, and High Priest of Amon. The stela's provenance is not indicated by the museum's archives, though it was probably deposited by Ptahmose's family ex voto at Abydos. It dates him to Amenhotep III's reign, since that pharaoh's cartouche appears on it. Its text is effectively made up of classic laudatory formulae addressed to Osiris as well as prayers that Ptahmose may profit from the offerings made to the god in his temple, which supports the stela coming from the god's temple rather than Ptahmose's tomb. It was erected after his death, since it calls him justified, a typical term given to the dead. He is shown in the robes of a high priest adoring Osiris and he addresses the reader in a set of classic formulae used by the dead in the form of a negative confession to the god. It mentions the expansion of Ptahmose's tomb at the pharaoh's expense and that it is joined to his funerary monument in the city of eternity, his final place of residence. A long biographical text gives the precise details of his career and in the lower register are shown his 7 children before their parents, in a typical pose for scenes of funerary offerings. It gives their names as Thutmose (chief prophet of Horus), Houy (younger brother, whose titles and offices are not specified), Nefertari, Mutemwia, Hemetnetjer, Mutnofret and a second Nefertari - all five daughters are musicians of Amon. Houy and the second Nefertari were probably still children or adolescents when the stela was put up, explaining why no offices are given for him and the representation of her as a young girl. The stela also tells us that Ptahmose's wife was called Apeny and was still alive when the stela was put up (since her name and titles are not followed by the qualifiers reserved for the dead mentioned above).Varille A.

He is best known for taking over the Panama Railway in November 1851 as the company faced bankruptcy while attempting to build a railroad across the Isthmus of Panama.Otis, Illustrated History of the Panama Railroad, New York: Harper, 1862.Bennett, History of the Panama Canal: Its Construction and Builders, 1915. Hoadley was able to stabilize the company as well as complete the railroad a year ahead of schedule.Rigole and Langlois, Panama, 2003. ==Early life== Hoadley was born in Waterbury, Connecticut, in 1806.Trowbridge, The Hoadley Genealogy, 1894. He was a direct descendant of William Hoadley, who had settled Branford, Connecticut, in 1666.His great-great-great-grandfather's name appears on the New Plantation Covenant of Branford dated November 20, 1667 or 1668, and which formally established the governance of the town of Branford. See: Trowbridge, The Hoadley Genealogy, 1894. He was the eldest son of David and Rachel (Beecher) Hoadley. His father was a carpenter and architect who built several well-known Congregational churches and many fine homes (including the Samuel Wadsworth Russell House) in the area. Hoadley worked in his future father-in-law's pharmacy in New Haven, Connecticut. In April 1827, he founded his own wholesale drug business in New York City, an enterprise which proved extremely profitable. He married Mary Hotchkiss, daughter of his old employer, on December 23, 1829. The couple had three children: Mary (born November 17, 1830), Sarah (born August 16, 1832), and Russell (born August 19, 1834). On April 5, 1854, Sarah married the wealthy mine owner William E. Dodge, Jr. of Phelps Dodge fame. Mary Hotchkiss Hoadley died June 9, 1837, at the age of 26. David Hoadley then married Elizabeth Crannel Tappen, daughter of a Danbury, Connecticut, doctor, on June 12, 1838. The couple had three more children: Alice (born July 4, 1839), Tappen (born February 11, 1841), Elizabeth (born June 1, 1844), Olivia (born November 17, 1848), and Adelaide (born February 4, 1855). Illness forced Hoadley to retired from the wholesale pharmaceutical supply business in 1848. But his health improved the following year, and he was named vice president of the American Exchange Bank (now part of the Bank of New York Mellon Corporation.He proved extremely adept at finance, and his leadership of the bank gained him widespread fame. ==Panama Railroad presidency== Hoadley's managerial expertise became so widely regarded that he was named President of the Panama Railway on November 1, 1851. The goal of the Panama Railway was to build a railroad across the Isthmus of Panama, linking the Atlantic and Pacific oceans which would lessen the length of shipping and avoid the Cape of Good Hope for cargo. The railway was chartered on April 18, 1849, and construction began in May 1850.Poor, History of the Railroads and Canals of the United States, 1860. Construction proceeded very slowly due to the poor condition of the soil, the exceedingly hot and humid climate, and numerous tropical diseases (especially malaria).\\"The Panama Railroad: History of a Difficult and Costly Project,\\" New York Times, December 4, 1892. By November 1851, construction had proceeded so slowly that the Panama Railroad Company faced bankruptcy. The chief engineer John Trautwine was forced to resign. Company president C.J. Young also resigned, and David Hoadley was named his successor. Under Hoadley, the railroad not only survived but thrived. In part, this was due to sheer luck: Three weeks after Hoadley assumed control of the railroad, two steamships with over 1,000 passengers were forced by a storm to put in at Aspinwall (the western terminus of the railroad). The railroad had only just completed construction of its docks at Aspinwall. The ships' passengers demanded to be put ashore and were granted passage aboard the railroad (at outrageously high prices). Although the rail line was only a third complete, the passengers were extremely grateful at being able to cut months from their long sea voyage. When news of the incident reached the United States, Panama Railroad Company shares soared and the company saved from bankruptcy. Hoadley re-ordered the management of the construction teams, adding thousands of workers and additional equipment as well as the construction of the line from the east to the west (not just west to east). With Hoadley's firm managerial hand, construction of the railroad was finished a year in advance, despite its early troubles. The railway ran its first train on January 28, 1855, making it the first transcontinental railroad in North America. Hoadley chartered a steamship and traveled to Panama for the occasion, where he rode the train to the Pacific Ocean. ==Retirement and death== Hoadley retired from the Panama Railroad in 1869.He sold his home in New York City and moved to Englewood, New Jersey, taking up residence in his former summer home. He lived there until his death in 1873. ==NotesReferences== *Bennett, Ira Elbert. History of the Panama Canal: Its Construction and Builders.

Here, macrorealism (macroscopic realism) is a classical worldview defined by the conjunction of two postulates: # Macrorealism per se: \\"A macroscopic object, which has available to it two or more macroscopically distinct states, is at any given time in a definite one of those states.\\" # Noninvasive measurability: \\"It is possible in principle to determine which of these states the system is in without any effect on the state itself, or on the subsequent system dynamics.\\" ==In quantum mechanics== In quantum mechanics, the Leggett–Garg inequality is violated, meaning that the time evolution of a system cannot be understood classically. The situation is similar to the violation of Bell's inequalities in Bell test experiments which plays an important role in understanding the nature of the Einstein–Podolsky–Rosen paradox. Here quantum entanglement plays the central role. ==Two-state example== The simplest form of the Leggett–Garg inequality derives from examining a system that has only two possible states. These states have corresponding measurement values Q=\\\\pm 1. The key here is that we have measurements at two different times, and one or more times between the first and last measurement. The simplest example is where the system is measured at three successive times t_1 < t_2 < t_3 . Now suppose, for instance, that there is a perfect correlation C_{13} of 1 between times t_1 and t_3 . That is to say, that for N realisations of the experiment, the temporal correlation reads : C_{13}=\\\\frac{1}{N} \\\\sum_{r=1}^N Q_r(t_1) Q_r(t_3)=1. We look at this case in some detail. What can be said about what happens at time t_2? Well, it is possible that C_{12} =C_{23} =1, so that if the value of Q at t_1 is \\\\pm 1 , then it is also \\\\pm 1 for both times t_2 and t_3 . It is also quite possible that C_{12}=C_{23}=-1 , so that the value of Q at t_1 is flipped twice, and so has the same value at t_3 as it did at t_1 . So, we can have both Q(t_1) and Q(t_2) anti-correlated as long as we have Q(t_2) and Q(t_3) anti-correlated. Yet another possibility is that there is no correlation between Q(t_1) and Q(t_2) . That is we could have C_{12}=C_{23}=0 . So, although it is known that if Q=\\\\pm 1 at t_1 it must also be \\\\pm 1 at t_3 , the value at t_2 may as well be determined by the toss of a coin. We define K as K= C_{12}+C_{23}-C_{13}. In these three cases, we have K=1, -3, and -1, respectively. All that was for 100% correlation between times t_1 and t_3 . In fact, for any correlation between these times K= C_{12}+C_{23}-C_{13} \\\\le 1. To see this, we note that : K=\\\\frac{1}{N} \\\\sum_{r=1}^N \\\\left ( Q(t_1)Q(t_2)+Q(t_2)Q(t_3) -Q(t_1)Q(t_3) \\\\right )_r. It is easily seen that for every realisation r, the term in the parentheses must be less than or equal to unity, so that the result for the average is also less than (or equal to) unity. If we have four distinct times rather than three, we have K= C_{12}+C_{23}+C_{34}-C_{14} \\\\le 2 and so on. These are the Leggett–Garg inequalities. They express the relation between the temporal correlations of \\\\langle Q(\\\\text{start}) Q(\\\\text{end}) \\\\rangle and the correlations between successive times in going from the start to the end. In the derivations above, it has been assumed that the quantity Q, representing the state of the system, always has a definite value (macrorealism per se) and that its measurement at a certain time does not change this value nor its subsequent evolution (noninvasive measurability). A violation of the Leggett–Garg inequality implies that at least one of these two assumptions fails. ==Experimental violations== One of the first proposed experiments for demonstrating a violation of macroscopic realism employs superconducting quantum interference devices. There, using Josephson junctions, one should be able to prepare macroscopic superpositions of left and right rotating macroscopically large electronic currents in a superconducting ring. Under sufficient suppression of decoherence one should be able to demonstrate a violation of the Leggett–Garg inequality. However, some criticism has been raised concerning the nature of indistinguishable electrons in a Fermi sea. A criticism of some other proposed experiments on the Leggett–Garg inequality is that they do not really show a violation of macrorealism because they are essentially about measuring spins of individual particles.Foundations and Interpretation of Quantum Mechanics. Gennaro Auletta and Giorgio Parisi, World Scientific, 2001 , In 2015 Robens et al. demonstrated an experimental violation of the Leggett–Garg inequality using superpositions of positions instead of spin with a massive particle. At that time, and so far up until today, the Cesium atoms employed in their experiment represent the largest quantum objects which have been used to experimentally test the Leggett–Garg inequality. The experiments of Robens et al. as well as Knee et al., using ideal negative measurements, also avoid a second criticism (referred to as “clumsiness loophole”) that has been directed to previous experiments using measurement protocols that could be interpreted as invasive, thereby conflicting with postulate 2. Several other experimental violations have been reported, including in 2016 with neutrino particles using the MINOS dataset. Brukner and Kofler have also demonstrated that quantum violations can be found for arbitrarily large macroscopic systems. As an alternative to quantum decoherence, Brukner and Kofler are proposing a solution of the quantum-to-classical transition in terms of coarse-grained quantum measurements under which usually no violation of the Leggett–Garg inequality can be seen anymore. Experiments proposed by Mermin and Braunstein and Mann would be better for testing macroscopic realism, but warns that the experiments may be complex enough to admit unforeseen loopholes in the analysis. A detailed discussion of the subject can be found in the review by Emary et al. ==Related inequalities== The four-term Leggett–Garg inequality can be seen to be similar to the CHSH inequality. Moreover, equalities were proposed by Jaeger et al. ==See also== * Leggett inequality ==References== Category:Quantum information science Category:Interpretations of quantum mechanics Category:Physics theorems Category:Inequalities Category:Quantum measurement Category:Physics experiments Category:Thought experiments in quantum mechanics ","title":"Leggett–Garg inequality"},{"id":"20376034","text":"Wide-Eyed and Ignorant is the fourth album from Irish rock band A House.

It opened on 22 July 1885, two days after the Hull Barnsley and West Riding Junction Railway and Dock Company opened the line between Hull Cannon Street and Cudworth. The station had two facing platforms, the brick-built main station building in \\"domestic revival style\\" was on the down side, while the up platform had a waiting room. At the east end of the down platform was a signal box which controlled the goods yard. The latter consisted of four sidings, but had no goods shed. A branch line between Wrangbrook Junction west of Kirk Smeaton and Denaby and Conisbrough opened in 1894, another between Wrangbrook Junction and Wath in 1904. Trains on these lines ran to and from Kirk Smeaton and beyond, also changing directions there, so that a locomotive turntable was installed in the station. Passenger services between Kirk Smeaton and Denaby and Conisbrough were withdrawn on 1 February 1903, although miners' trains may have continued to run after this date. Passenger services to Wath ended on 8 April 1929. The station closed to passengers on 1 January 1932, when passenger services between South Howden and Cudworth ceased, and remained open for goods traffic until 6 April 1959. After closure to regular passenger services, some excursion trains still ran from the station to Hull Fair and to Leeds football ground, so on 14 October 1933 during Hull Civic Week and on 28 February 1953 to Leeds. At the time of closure, the line and the station were operated by British Railways (North Eastern Region). The station building is now a private residence, part of the down platform is also preserved. The turntable pit has been partially filled in. ==A brief history of the Hull and Barnsley Railway== The Hull Barnsley and West Riding Junction Railway and Dock Company was formed with the backing of Hull Corporation to break the monopoly on dock and rail traffic from Hull; it included a deep water dock (Alexandra Dock) to the east of Hull. The railway never reached Barnsley itself, terminating at Cudworth (junction with the Midland Railway) some four miles short having been vigorously opposed by the NER. It was one of the last new main lines to be built. The construction cost was double the estimates, due in part to difficulties in cutting and tunnelling through unexpectedly hard chalk in the Yorkshire Wolds near Little Weighton. Although it was constructed primarily for goods traffic to and from the new dock and the South Yorkshire coalfields, fine villa-style passenger stations were provided, although passenger traffic was sparse. In 1905 the company name was shortened to the Hull and Barnsley Railway. It was absorbed into the NER on 1 April 1922.

He graduated from Takeheya Senior High School in 1976 and began attending the department of literature at Waseda University in 1978. Around this time, he won a prize for excellence in the Yamaha-sponsored band tournament EAST WEST 78. Graduating from Waseda in 1980, Fukuda went on to make his professional debut, playing keyboards in the band QUYS. The band was formed alongside bassist Yoshihiro Naruse (currently of Casiopea) and drummer Okai Daiji (ex-member of Yonin Bayashi). The following year marked his recording debut as a session musician on June Yamagishi's 1981 solo album All The Same, along with his major debut with Hideo Saito in the band YOU. In 1982 he was a participating member of Bakufu Slump prior to their debut, and in 1983 played with Minami Kousetsu as a live tour musician. Following these early exposures to the industry, Fukuda became a frequently employed studio musician - he went from playing for artists such as Kodomo Band, Shogo Hamada, Kozo Murashita, Yoshiyuki Ohzawa to then-contemporary pop figures such as Shibugakitai, Seiko Matsuda and Ryoko Sano. As a studio player, he has participated in the recording of over a thousand songs. Also during this period, he collaborated with fellow synthesist Noritaka Ubukata in the development of a sound patch for the Yamaha DX7 digital synthesizer called \\"Shofuku\\", which was released in 1984. Shofuku later became the name of a recording unit featuring the two musicians in 1988. Fukuda also penned books documenting the DX7's programmable synthesis, one of which, \\"Yamaha DX7 Digital Synthesizer\\", was translated and sold in the West. He is perhaps most well known for his video game and anime soundtracks. He has worked for Hudson Soft, and is perhaps best known for his soundtracks to various games from the Bomberman franchise. He is currently the keyboardist in the Japanese jazz-funk and fusion band BeatNuts, and has played in numerous other bands, such as YOU, QUYZ, and Kodomo Band. He is often credited as \\"Hirohiko Fukuda\\". == Works  Video games === * Fighting Street (1988) - arranger with Noritaka Ubukata as \\"Shofuku\\" unit * Download (1990) - composer * Smart Ball (1991) - composer with Manabu Saito and Akira Yamaoka * Tengai Makyō II: Manjimaru (1992) - composer with Joe Hisaishi * Emerald Dragon (1994) - composer * Super Bomberman 2 (1994) - composer * Wario Blast: Featuring Bomberman!

The farms were founded and run by missionary evangelist and author Sherwood Eddy, and Reverend Sam H. Franklin, with the goal of helping southern sharecroppers out of their economic plight (caused in part by side effects of the New Deal's Agricultural Adjustment Administration).Smith, Fred C. (2004). \\"Cooperative Farming in Mississippi.\\" Mississippi Historical Society. Eddy drew considerable support from his friend, the theologian Reinhold Niebuhr, who once called the farms \\"the most significant experiment in social Christianity now being conducted in America.\\" The cooperatives were organized around four principles: efficiency in production and economy in finance through the cooperative principle, participation in building a socialized economy of abundance, inter-racial justice, and realistic religion as a social dynamic.Franklin, Sam H. Delta Cooperative Farm, pamphlet 1936. In the early stages, many of the first cooperative members at the Delta Cooperative Farm were sharecroppers from eastern Arkansas who had been evicted following a strike.Delta and Providence Cooperative Farm Records, 1925-1963 in the Southern Historical Collection at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. Because the farms were committed to economic equality among races, all cooperative members were to receive equal pay for equal work. Agricultural operations included growing cotton, dairy and beef farms, a pasteurizing plant, and a saw mill. The cooperatives also provided a number of social and other services to members and the surrounding communities, including a cooperative store, a credit union, a medical clinic, educational programs, a library, religious services, and summer work camps for students. Due to several factors, including the tense political climate of the 1950s and poor cotton sales at Providence, cooperative efforts were abandoned around 1956, and pieces of the land were sold off to members. == References  *Finding aid to the Delta and Providence Cooperative Farm Records in the Southern Historical Collection at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill *Photographs of the Delta Providence Farm by Dorothea Lange, from the Library of Congress Category:Bolivar County, Mississippi Category:Holmes County, Mississippi Category:Farms in Mississippi Category:Former cooperatives of the United States Category:History of Mississippi Category:History of agriculture in the United States Category:Agricultural cooperatives in the United States Category:1936 establishments in Mississippi Category:1950s disestablishments in Mississippi ","title":"Delta and Providence Cooperative Farms"},{"id":"20376273","text":"Smile, Darn Ya, Smile! is a 1931 Warner Bros. Merrie Melodies cartoon short directed by Rudolf Ising. The short was released on September 5, 1931, and features Foxy, an early Merrie Melodies star. This is one of only three Merrie Melodies cartoons to star Foxy; the other two are Lady, Play Your Mandolin! (August, 1931) and One More Time (October 3, 1931). This short is a remake of Trolley Troubles, a Disney short featuring Oswald the Lucky Rabbit in whose creation Hugh Harman had once been involved. For the first time in a Warner Bros. cartoon, the short uses a gag suggested by Bob Clampett that has characters from the trolley car's advertising posters come to life and perform a bit of business. The studio would soon use gags like this very often. A colorized version was produced in Korea. It was made by re-drawing the cels and backgrounds. The animation in this version is inferior, since many drawings were left out, causing jerky movement. ==Synopsis== Foxy is a trolley engineer whose problems include a fat lady hippo who can't fit into the trolley and a set of wheels that detach from the trolley car when Foxy gets the trolley moving. Foxy picks up his vixen girlfriend and gives her a ride, but along the way, the car is blocked by a cow wearing a dress, and glasses, and who won't get off the track. A group of nearby hobos sing the title song while Foxy tries to move the cow; he finally runs the car underneath the cow and goes on his way. The trolley then goes down a hill and runs out of control; Foxy tries to stop it, but the brakes don't work. Finally, the trolley runs off of a cliff, throwing Foxy right into the camera... and then he falls from bed, waking up from what has turned out to be just a nightmare. The radio by his bed is playing the title song, and the annoyed Foxy smashes the radio with a bedpost upon hearing it. ==Reversed audio clips== At the scene where Foxy starts trying to fit the fat lady hippo in the trolley, she said something “I haven’t had any fun since I was at Manny Felders, what’s ya think?” The information about Manny Felders is not verified but according to an OSI, he said that it could have been an operator of a speak-easy in the Los Angeles/Hollywood area. The last clip of the scene where after Foxy deflates the fat lady hippo with a needle, she said something like “Where’s my doll?” and “looks like at the register!” ==The song== The theme song later appeared in Robert Zemeckis's Who Framed Roger Rabbit and Billy Cotton recorded his own version of the song in 1931. Christoph Waltz also sang it when he hosted Saturday Night Live. ==Availability== * DVD - Looney Tunes Golden Collection: Volume 6 * DVD - Return of the 30s Characters * Streaming - HBO Max ==ReferencesSmile, Darn Ya, Smile! at the Big Cartoon DataBase Category:1931 films Category:1931 animated films Category:1930s American animated films Category:1930s animated short films Category:Merrie Melodies shorts Category:American black-and-white films Category:American films Category:American film remakes Category:Films about dreams Category:English-language films Category:Films scored by Frank Marsales Category:Animated films about foxes Category:Films directed by Rudolf Ising Category:Films featuring Foxy Category:Rail transport films Category:Short film remakes Category:1931 songs Category:Songs about happiness Category:Warner Bros. animated short films, 1930s ","title":"Smile, Darn Ya, Smile!"},{"id":"20376284","text":"Juliano Rangel de Andrade (born April 4, 1982 in Alfredo Chaves) is a Brazilian football defender, who plays for Club Xelajú of the Guatemalan premier division. ==Club career== Rangel played for lower league sides in his native Brazil and in Mexico before joining Salvadoran side Deportes Savio in 2007.

He went on to graduate studies at the University of California, Berkeley, where he did research in nuclear physics at the Radiation Laboratory under Ernest Lawrence. He received an MA in 1936, and a PhD in 1940. In 1945 he was appointed Professor of Physics at the University of Southern California, a post he retained until his retirement in 1980. During the early part of his career, his research focussed on gaseous discharges in strong magnetic fields. He was also a musician, trained as a performer on piano, bassoon, clarinet and other woodwinds and received the degree of MMus in conducting from the University of Southern California in 1959. In his later career he turned increasingly to the study of musical acoustics, particularly those of wind instruments and organ pipes. In 1969 he published The Acoustical Foundations of Music, a book which became a standard text for introductory courses in musical acoustics. A second edition appeared in 1977. He received the Silver Medal of the Acoustical Society of America in 1986. Backus died in Los Angeles in 1988.

It is responsible for the review of regulations from nearly all state agencies, boards and commissions before they go into effect. These regulations span the broadest possible array of topics, such as bank lending practices, food safety, educational standards, dog breeding, nursing facilities, gaming facilities, and more. The Regulatory Review Act (RRA), which created IRRC, provides for a forum to examine and resolve differences between the promulgating agency, the legislature and the members of the public that will be directly impacted by these regulations. To accomplish this, IRRC interacts with all parties, frequently advocating changes, where necessary, to accomplish the best regulatory balance. IRRC is statutorily required to ensure proposed regulatory provisions are in the public interest. Regulations, as well as outside input from the regulated public and the legislature, are reviewed by the professionals at IRRC and made available to all parties on IRRC’s website. The website not only details information about a specific regulation, but catalogs comments from the public, legislators and IRRC in a fully searchable database. Ultimately, the agency’s regulations are considered and voted on by IRRC’s commissioners in a public meeting where all parties can express their support for, or opposition to the regulations. Through IRRC’s efforts, the entire process of a regulation’s evolution is made transparent and accessible to all parties.http://www.irrc.state.pa.us/ ==Mission and Purpose== Prior to the enactment of the Regulatory Review Act (RRA) in the early 1980s, there were few controls on the promulgation of regulations by state government agencies. According to the Pennsylvania General Assembly, insufficient consideration was given to the economic and social impact the agency regulations would have on those subject to compliance and the public at large. The creation of IRRC established a channel for legislative oversight, a mechanism for detailed and comprehensive impact analysis, and a forum for public input. IRRC's mission is to foster executive branch accountability. IRRC commissioners and staff exercise their expertise, authority, and independence to engage in ongoing and effective review and oversight of regulations. IRRC increases communication with promulgating agencies and the regulated public to achieve a streamlined and effective review process. Ultimately, IRRC assists the Governor and the General Assembly by encouraging the resolution of objections to regulation. == Rulings  Net metering === In May 2016, IRRC waded into an issue known as net metering. Net metering is a system of selling back electricity to utilities. People and businesses who generate their own electricity from devices such as solar panels can sell back excess power to their local utility company if a net metering setup exists. Laws about net metering vary from state to state. In Pennsylvania, net metering began after enactment of the Alternative Energy Portfolio Standards Act, signed into law in 2004. In February, the Public Utility Commission set forth the caps on how much electricity solar customers could sell back to utility companies. The caps were set at 200 percent of how much a customer consumes each year. According to the Post-Gazette, IRRC made its decision “after a contentious public rulemaking process.” In their ruling, IRRC struck down the caps that the Public Utilities Commission had set. The main issue before IRRC was whether the Public Utilities Commission had legal authority to set the caps in the first place. ==References * Category:Government of Pennsylvania Category:State agencies of Pennsylvania Category:1982 establishments in Pennsylvania Category:Organizations based in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania ","title":"Independent Regulatory Review Commission"},{"id":"20376636","text":"The Pseudomugilidae, the blue-eyes, are a subfamily of atheriniform fish in the Melanotaeniidae, related to the rainbowfishes.

That is, the system has a kind of lower triangular form. ==Stabilization== : Systems in strict-feedback form can be stabilized by recursive application of backstepping. That is, # It is given that the system #::\\\\dot{\\\\mathbf{x}} = f_0(\\\\mathbf{x}) + g_0(\\\\mathbf{x}) u_x(\\\\mathbf{x}) #:is already stabilized to the origin by some control u_x(\\\\mathbf{x}) where u_x(\\\\mathbf{0}) = 0. That is, choice of u_x to stabilize this system must occur using some other method. It is also assumed that a Lyapunov function V_x for this stable subsystem is known. # A control u_1(\\\\mathbf{x},z_1) is designed so that the system #::\\\\dot{z}_1 = f_1(\\\\mathbf{x},z_1) + g_1(\\\\mathbf{x},z_1) u_1(\\\\mathbf{x},z_1) #:is stabilized so that z_1 follows the desired u_x control. The control design is based on the augmented Lyapunov function candidate #::V_1(\\\\mathbf{x},z_1) = V_x(\\\\mathbf{x}) + \\\\frac{1}{2}( z_1 - u_x(\\\\mathbf{x}) )^2 #:The control u_1 can be picked to bound \\\\dot{V}_1 away from zero. # A control u_2(\\\\mathbf{x},z_1,z_2) is designed so that the system #::\\\\dot{z}_2 = f_2(\\\\mathbf{x},z_1,z_2) + g_2(\\\\mathbf{x},z_1,z_2) u_2(\\\\mathbf{x},z_1,z_2) #:is stabilized so that z_2 follows the desired u_1 control. The control design is based on the augmented Lyapunov function candidate #::V_2(\\\\mathbf{x},z_1,z_2) = V_1(\\\\mathbf{x},z_1) + \\\\frac{1}{2}( z_2 - u_1(\\\\mathbf{x},z_1) )^2 #:The control u_2 can be picked to bound \\\\dot{V}_2 away from zero. # This process continues until the actual u is known, and #* The real control u stabilizes z_k to fictitious control u_{k-1}. #* The fictitious control u_{k-1} stabilizes z_{k-1} to fictitious control u_{k-2}. #* The fictitious control u_{k-2} stabilizes z_{k-2} to fictitious control u_{k-3}. #* ... #* The fictitious control u_2 stabilizes z_2 to fictitious control u_1. #* The fictitious control u_1 stabilizes z_1 to fictitious control u_x. #* The fictitious control u_x stabilizes \\\\mathbf{x} to the origin. This process is known as backstepping because it starts with the requirements on some internal subsystem for stability and progressively steps back out of the system, maintaining stability at each step. Because * f_i vanish at the origin for 0 \\\\leq i \\\\leq k, * g_i are nonzero for 1 \\\\leq i \\\\leq k, * the given control u_x has u_x(\\\\mathbf{0}) = 0, then the resulting system has an equilibrium at the origin (i.e., where \\\\mathbf{x}=\\\\mathbf{0}\\\\,, z_1=0, z_2=0, ... , z_{k-1}=0, and z_k=0) that is globally asymptotically stable. ==See also== * Nonlinear control * Backstepping ==References== Category:Nonlinear control ","title":"Strict-feedback form"},{"id":"20376753","text":"Life at the Zoo () is a 1946 Soviet short documentary film.

Within international relations theory he is known for this theory of subaltern realism. == Subaltern realism == Ayoob first proposed his theory of subaltern realism in the 1980s and further developed it in the 1990s. The theory is a critical rejoinder to the neorealism of Kenneth Waltz and others, including the domestic analogies that neorealism employs. It aims to provide an analytical tool for grasping the major determinants of Third World state behavior, the dominant concerns of Third World state elites, and the root causes of conflict in the Third World. The theory emphasizes the divergence of Third World conditions from those of industrialized core states, and has gone on to criticize mainstream International Relations theory for excluding the Third World. It proposes an alternative conceptualization of security and emphasizes the inequality in IR theorizing. === Principles === The subaltern realism theory advocates that third world states are generally weak, and are often economically and militarily dependent on external benefactors, mostly industrialized states. Therefore, third world states are more concerned with relative gains and short-term benefits than long-term benefits and absolute gains. Additionally, third world states interactions are limited to their immediate neighborhood, especially in the security sphere, and as such they will choose to interact with other states who possess similar characteristics. They are therefore much less concerned with security matters of an international level.Ayoob, Mohammed: \\"Inequality and Theorizing in International Relations: The Case for Subaltern Realism\\", International Studies Review, Vol. 4, No. 3.

He can also play drums and the bongos. He can easily manipulate Josh to get what he wants. He has a lot of success with girls and much of the comedy is his effortless ability to get dates.

He becomes more mature as the series progresses. ===Josh Nichols=== Josh Nichols (Josh Peck) is Drake and Megan's stepbrother. Unlike Drake, Josh is knowledgeable, diligent, caring, and does well in school, although he is socially awkward. In the pilot episode, he had a job for the school newspaper in which he wrote advice for students under the name Miss Nancy. In season two, he begins working for Helen at the fictional Premiere movie theatre. Unlike Drake, Josh often tries his best in challenging situations and uses his common sense, often repeating things for emphasis when anxious. Despite his logical mind and hard-working nature, Josh is prone to bad luck, especially with girls. However, later, he begins to date Mindy Crenshaw, who is his academic rival. He has various hobbies, including cooking and performing magic tricks. Later in the series, Josh becomes more popular and has better luck. He is obsessed with Oprah Winfrey and accidentally runs her over with his car in \\"Josh Runs into Oprah\\", leading her to get a restraining order against him. Peck described his character as having a Jackie Gleason quality, and said, \\"Not only can Josh do the physical comedy and the pratfalls, but he can also sell a sophisticated joke and a touching moment.\\" ===Audrey Parker-Nichols=== Audrey Parker-Nichols (Nancy Sullivan) is Drake and Megan's mother, Josh's stepmother and Walter's wife. Her first name is never mentioned in the series, although a deleted scene from the series finale would have revealed it as Audrey. The scene would also specify her profession as a catering business. She is usually telling the boys to not be so immature. She upsets her husband Walter because of her preference to Bruce Winchill, his rival weatherman. Because Walter lacks respect from the boys, she usually has to punish them although these punishments are usually unfair because most are Megan's fault. As stepmother and stepson, Audrey and Josh have a very close relationship, and he affectionately calls her \\"Mom\\" or \\"Mama\\". She is a very nurturing and supportive mother however a bit gullible when it comes to her daughter Megan, especially when it is Megan's word against Drake and Josh. ===Walter Nichols=== Walter (Jonathan Goldstein) is Josh's father and Drake and Megan's stepfather. He is a meteorologist for a local TV news program in San Diego, but he is often wrong about the weather. Walter is often slow- witted, awkward, out-of-touch, and old-fashioned. As a result, he lacks the respect of his stepchildren, who refer to him by his first name. When Megan calls him by his first name, he always asks \\"When did she start calling me Walter?\\" and Audrey replies \\"I don't know.\\" He is also oblivious and cynical in regards to Megan's pranks which have caused the boys a lot of punishments, although starting in the episode \\"The Demonator\\", Walter slowly begins to notice Megan's evil ways. A running gag involves a rivalry between him and Bruce Winchill, an unseen weatherman from another station. He hates that Winchill is so popular, as he is always right with his predictions, and even forbids the use of Winchill's name in the family home. ===Megan Parker=== Megan Parker (Miranda Cosgrove) is the evil and mischievous younger sister of Drake and stepsister of Josh. Megan often references a best friend named Janie and often refers to her older brothers as \\"boobs.\\" She is essentially the main antagonist of the series, usually bullies her brothers, although sometimes Megan helps them in episodes like “The Gary Grill” and “Drake and Josh: Go Hollywood”. It has also been shown that she is very perceptive and intelligent; she can pull off very severe, torturous and sometimes complicated (or even potentially dangerous) pranks on her brothers all while ensuring that her parents think of her as being a sweet, angelic, harmless, and innocent little girl. However, in numerous episodes like “The Bet” and “The Affair” Megan has made rude remarks to Drake and Josh in front of her mother, who does not react, and also in “Really Big Shrimp” when she sassed off to Lula when she rudely demanded her guacamole, with Walter intervening instead of her mother. Another episode shows that she has a hidden computerized monitor in her room, giving her surveillance of the house to aid in her pranks against Drake and Josh. Most of the time throughout the series, Megan is mean- spirited, argumentative, spiteful, rude, disrespectful, obnoxious, conceited, and cruel to her brothers. However, despite her mistreatment to them, Megan actually loves her brothers deep down and has shown them genuine love and support when they uncovered that her boyfriend Corey (Christian Vandal) had been cheating on her with another girl named Monica. ==Recurring charactersCraig Ramirez and Eric Blonowitz=== Craig (Alec Medlock) and Eric (Scott Halberstadt) are a duo of stereotypical \\"nerdy\\" honor students that are always being exploited by Drake, mostly due to his hare-brained schemes. Drake often mistakes Eric for Craig when Craig is not around. Craig corrected him one time in \\"Eric Punches Drake\\", and Drake sarcastically said \\"It matters\\", suggesting that he has no interest in correcting his mistakes. Eric first appeared in the pilot episode as an extra and along with his best friend, Craig, a few times in Season 2 and 3, but they appear more frequently in Season 4, and also appear in the series finale Really Big Shrimp. They usually are good friends and good in nature, but not free of a selfish side. Drake is so unkind to them that anytime they try to talk with him he rudely shuts the door in their faces and tells them that there are lots of reasons why they do not have girlfriends. Eric left for Puerto Rico in the final episode, \\"Dance Contest.\\" Craig and Eric appear with another Drake & Josh character, Gavin, in the 2010 iCarly episode \\"iStart a Fan War\\", implying that the two series take place within the same universe. It is revealed in the episode \\"Who's Got Game\\" that Craig and Eric do not consider themselves to be friends with Drake because of the bad things he has done to them. ===Mindy Crenshaw=== Mindy (Allison Scagliotti) is a clever but arrogant girl at school who is always trying to be better than Josh, who is her rival. She also shows an intense dislike for Drake. For example in \\"Honor Council\\", she took apart Mrs. Hayfer's car and rebuilt it in the middle of her classroom to frame Drake for the prank and have him suspended. For this misdeed, Mindy was sent to a mental hospital, causing a temporary departure from the series, but she eventually reappeared in \\"Mindy's Back\\" to compete in the school science fair. Later on, she became Josh's on-again off-again girlfriend, and the two enjoy each others company. One of Mindy's well-known character traits is her genius-level intellect and scientific talents. She defeats Josh yearly in the science fair with the exception of one year after they started to date where she let him win, which she enjoys rubbing in his face at times. She also cloned her pet Cockapoo, and has a love of sharks. ===Helen Dubois=== Helen Ophelia Dubois (Yvette Nicole Brown) is the manager of the Premiere Theater, connected to the Premiere Galleria mall. She is Josh's boss at the theater, and is known for her intimidating demeanor, loud voice, and demanding attitude towards employees. She adores Drake, but dislikes Josh despite the hard work he puts in at the theater. She starred in a hit television sitcom as a child, called Happy Times (a parody of the classic 1970s TV sitcoms Happy Days and Good Times). She married Buzz Baxter in \\"Drake & Josh: Really Big Shrimp\\", but divorced him some time before Merry Christmas, Drake & Josh after 5 weeks. Yvette Nicole Brown played Helen for most of the series, with the exception of the season two episode \\"Little Diva\\", in which Frances Callier took over the role. Helen appears in a 2011 episode of Victorious in which she becomes the principal of Hollywood Arts High School. She later appears in a 2015 episode of Game Shakers, in which she hosts her own talk show titled The Helen Show. ===\\"Crazy\\" Steve=== Steve (Jerry Trainor) is an employee at the Premiere movie theater who is noted for his emotional and mental instability, lashing out at co-workers, strangers, and passersby over little things. Incredibly sensitive, Steve takes offense at the slightest of subjects or even the most thoroughly minor hints at insults, hollering at others for interrupting him or denying his questions, desires, or offers. Steve's utter lack of sanity has earned him a dangerously unpredictable reputation amongst colleagues, to the extent where he finds immense frustration in following along with episodes of Dora the Explorer, screaming at the animated characters on the screen. In seasons 2 and 3, he had a lot of hair but in season 4 his head was shaved. He appears in the program's 2008 Christmas special, most notably towards its conclusion, where he shreds hunks of cheese in a wood chipper in order to grant his friends' wish for a white Christmas. He later appeared in an episode of the series Sam and Cat where he is revealed to have been placed at a mental institution for the sick with a restrictive mask over his face. ===Gavin Mitchell=== Gavin (Jake Farrow) works with Josh at the Premiere and he has a mullet-like haircut similar in fashion to Rod Stewart (in \\"Who's Got Game\\" he got a perm). A running gag throughout the series involved Helen asking him to tell Josh to clean something unusual in the theater. He normally declines doing it himself when Josh asks if he would do it. He then cleans up the mess himself - telling Josh \\"I got it\\". He also has a crush on Audrey. He can apparently get away with anything at work, like taking a nap on the roof. He first appeared in \\"Driver's License\\" and made an appearance in Merry Christmas, Drake & Josh. Gavin appears in iCarly in Season 4 episode \\"iStart a Fan War\\" with Craig and Eric. ===Mrs. Hayfer=== Mrs. Hayfer (Julia Duffy) is the boys' English teacher who adores Josh due to his hard-working personality, but hates Drake because of his consistently poor performance in school; likewise, as noted by his doodles of her in his notebook, as seen in \\"Honor Council\\", Drake hates her in return. In the episode \\"Mean Teacher\\", Mrs. Hayfer is shown to hate Drake for no apparent reason as it is shown that when he answered a question correctly, she dubbed it incorrect and appointed the same question correct to another student right next to him as well as grading a flawless report he did with a \\"D-\\" again for no logical reason.Drake & Josh episode# 16: \\"Mean Teacher\\" In fact, her catchphrase is \\"I hate you, Drake\\", with Drake responding, \\"I know\\". She also always says \\"To the nurse!\\", which is her own way of telling people to leave her classroom. In \\"Little Sibling\\", Mrs. Hayfer says it to Josh when she wanted to have a private talk with Drake. Mrs. Hayfer has a daughter named Kelly, who Drake briefly dates, much to her discontent. In \\"Honor Council\\", she comes into the classroom to find her car parked where the boys' seats are originally and accuses Drake of putting the car there, but her star student, Mindy, is the real culprit. Drake apparently hates Mrs. Hayfer so much that he wishes she would die, as seen in the episode, \\"Megan's First Kiss\\", in which Josh says \\"You're not gonna believe this!\\" and Drake asks in an anxious and excited tone, \\"Mrs. Hayfer died?!\\" Mrs. Hayfer has a Rottweiler named Tiberius, who appears in the season 4 episode \\"Vicious Tiberius\\" and is violent towards Drake and Josh, who had agreed to house sit for her. She has a brief appearance in Merry Christmas, Drake & Josh, where Drake accidentally hits a fire hydrant while driving, resulting in water getting sprayed all over her. She then points out and yells her famous line: \\"I hate you, Drake Parker!\\" Meaning that even though Drake and Josh have graduated from Bellview High, Mrs. Hayfer still hates Drake. In the season 2 finale \\"Honor Council\\", Josh mentions her full name as being Alice Hayfer. However, in \\"Vicious Tiberious\\", a video shows her full name as being Linda Hayfer. ===Dr. Jeff Glazer=== Dr. Glazer (Roark Critchlow) is a doctor who lives across the street from the boys. He is always called on whenever a serious emergency happens at their house. Although he always seems kind while performing medical procedures for the boys, he always leaves them with a ridiculously high bill for his services (he once charged $100 for diagnosing a sheep as pregnant after it had already given birth and an extra $50 not to tell Audrey and Walter, charged $300 for diagnosing Drake's facial rash, and charged $500 for diagnosing Ashley Blake's accident after she got hit in the head with a bucket). He first appeared in \\"The Bet\\" and he last appeared in \\"Sheep Thrills\\". ===Bruce Winchill=== Although Bruce Winchill is never seen in Drake & Josh, he is mentioned throughout the series. Megan and Audrey have a crush on him because he has good hair. He is a rival weatherman of Walter, and he always gets the weather right. ==Minor charactersGrammy Nichols=== Grammy (Randee Heller) is Josh's grandmother and Walter's mother. She loves Josh and Megan, but she hates Drake due to his lack of responsibility, laziness, and sassiness. In her only appearance in \\"Grammy\\", she expresses anger towards Drake when he decides to go to a concert even though Audrey and Walter said that he could not. At the end of the episode, Grammy shows affection toward Drake when he attempts to tell his parents the truth. She is later mentioned frequently. She sent gifts to Josh many times. She is last mentioned in \\"Merry Christmas, Drake and Josh\\". ===Papa Nichols=== Papa Nichols (Vernon Roberts) is Josh's great-grandfather, Walter's grandfather and Grammy's father and a World War II veteran who appears only in the episode \\"The Demonator\\", in which he had surgery and is resting at the family's house. While their parents go out to the Newsie Awards, Drake, Josh, and Megan sneak out of the house to ride a roller coaster called The Demonator. They have Craig and Eric watch Papa Nichols. When Papa Nichols wakes up disoriented, he thinks he is back in World War II and attacks Craig and Eric, believing they are \\"German nerds\\". At the end of \\"The Demonator\\", Walter tries to wake Papa Nichols up, but is punched by him. Papa Nichols then calls Walter a \\"German.\\" He is later mentioned once by Josh in \\"The Wedding\\". ===Aunt Catherine=== Catherine is Drake and Josh's great-aunt. She is mentioned in the episode \\"The Wedding\\", where it is revealed that she is getting married and she collects hair from people she does not know. Although she is never seen, she is described as being mean, and is apparently hated by her family, including Josh. She also owns a beach-house, which the family wants to receive. According to Drake, she is \\"old and gross\\". ===Jackie=== Jackie (Robin Sydney) is obsessed with Drake and appeared in a total of four episodes. She would come into the scene randomly (usually at the end, specifically when something positive happens to Drake), and shout hysterically, \\"I love you! Bye!\\" In response, Drake would ask, \\"Who are you?\\". ===Ashley Blake=== Ashley Blake (Skyler Samuels) is a child actress who appeared as the main antagonist in the episode, \\"Little Diva\\". Portrayed as a spoiled and insolent Hollywood child actress, she is seen differently to the rest of the world, who are oblvious to her temperament. ===Wendy=== \\"Wendy\\" (Alyson Stoner) is a girl that had an obsessive crush on Drake in the episode \\"Number 1 Fan\\", her sole appearance. She is approximately the same age as Megan, and is in a camp club with Megan and some other children. She reveals that her real name is actually Melissa, although she does not like the name and goes by Wendy. ===Sammy=== Sammy (Jordan Wright) is a young child that Drake needed to take care of as part of a Big Sibling program because he got in trouble for lying to Mrs. Hayfer about being in class on time. Drake proceeds to take care of Sammy, although Sammy wants Josh to be his big sibling. Sammy considers Josh to be the coolest guy ever, something that most characters think about Drake. ===Trevor=== Trevor (Taran Killam) is Drake's absent-minded friend and Scottie's older brother. Even though he only appeared in \\"Dune Buggy\\", he is mentioned several times in the series, and his voice is heard over the phone in \\"Josh Runs into Oprah\\". Trevor gets a brain scan every month, due to his unintelligence as found out in \\"Dune Buggy\\". In \\"The Wedding\\", the boys use his old car (a 1970s Chevrolet El Camino) to get to their great aunt Catherine's wedding, but it breaks down and later catches fire. ===Clayton=== Clayton (Josh Sussman) is one of the nerdy children at school. He has speech problems since he mumbles and no one can understand what he is saying. Even Craig and Eric call him a \\"nerd,\\" considering that they are nerds themselves. He appears only in \\"Josh is Done\\" and \\"Eric Punches Drake\\". In \\"Eric Punches Drake,\\" he begins to dislike Drake when Drake spits blue mouthwash into his bottled water, and he even goes as far as to find out where Drake and Josh live just so he could repeat \\"Why?\\" However, fans have speculated that since \\"Eric Punches Drake\\" took place after \\"Josh is Done\\" then Drake spitting mouthwash into his bottle would be considered revenge for the chemistry incident that Clayton caused on Drake. ===Janie=== Janie (Jasmine McNeal) is Megan's best friend. She is mentioned in several episodes of Season 4 and appears in \\"Megan's Revenge\\" and \\"Megan's First Kiss\\". ===Corey=== A boy who had been dating Megan and Monica at the same time in the episode, “Megan’s First Kiss”. He breaks up with Megan at first due to Drake and Josh’s freakiness during their date. He agrees to give Megan another chance but instead he dates Monica the same day which causes Josh to inform Drake on him. In the end, the two girls end up breaking up with him, and as Drake and Josh try to teach him a lesson on not to cheat on any girl he dates, he ends up attacking them and breaking their bones. ===Monica=== A girl who had been dating Megan's boyfriend, Corey, for one month, unbeknownst to Megan and Monica, respectively. Josh witnessed the two on a date while he was picking up his paycheck from Helen and immediately told Drake about it when he returned home. Monica eventually breaks up with Corey after finding out, through Drake and Josh, that she had been cheated on by him. Megan proceeds to do so as well. Monica's only appearance was in the episode \\"Megan's First Kiss\\". ===Vince=== Vince (D. Elliot Woods) is a helicopter pilot who appears in \\"Helicopter\\". He gives Drake a lesson about skydiving and he takes him and Josh on a ride in his helicopter. However, he becomes unconscious after hitting his head on a fire extinguisher. When the boys try to wake him up, Josh accidentally sprays him out of the helicopter with the fire extinguisher. When Drake and Josh get home, Vince comes in angrily and gives Walter a $400,000 bill for the damaged helicopter. Drake and Josh, knowing the consequences, ground themselves for two weeks. ===Karate instructor and coffee shop owner=== Played by Toshi Toda. He first appears in the pilot as Josh's karate instructor. He is later seen in \\"First Crush\\" saying that his karate place burnt down. Since then he has become the owner of a coffee shop where he held auditions for a band. He banned Drake from entering the shop because Drake had a snake in his backpack which was put there by Megan. However Cathy, Josh's crush at the time, spoke to him about giving them another chance. ===Drew and Jerry=== Drew (James Immekus) and Jerry (Stephen Markarian) are two boys who look and act like Drake and Josh. They appeared only in the episode \\"Drew & Jerry\\". Drew plays the saxophone and flirts with girls while Jerry likes pool, video games and magic tricks. Josh began hanging out with Drew, making Drake jealous, which led to the friendship between him and Jerry. Aside from being a good comedian, Jerry also plays a lot of pool at the Premiere. Josh and Drew then attend a movie premiere that Drake and Josh were going to see originally, so Drake angrily gets back at Josh by spending the day with Jerry fishing. However, during an argument, Drake has Jerry do a magic trick which involved cutting a girl's ponytail and then putting it back clear in position. Josh then tells Drew to entertain everyone in the Premiere by playing his saxophone. A talent agent sees them and decides to give them their own TV show, a comedy about two brothers. Drake and Josh then watch the show themselves. ===Henry Doheny=== Henry Doheny (Steve Tom) is a formerly famous magician who moves in with the family in the episode \\"The Great Doheny\\". Josh, Walter and Megan idolize him while Drake hates him. Doheny does magic wherever he goes, such as interfering with random people and doing magic tricks for them and even puts a sandwich inside his stomach without eating it. When Drake could no longer stand Doheny being in the house, he tried to harm him with a baseball bat but Josh decided to help him become famous again instead. Megan came up with a trick called \\"The Box of Impalement\\", which backfired due to putting Doheny in a large box and sticking swords into his body, killing him. However at the funeral Henry came back to life and regained his career and went off to Las Vegas to perform there for four years. ==Drake's girlfriends== Drake has several girlfriends throughout the series. Susan (Ashley Drane) is Drake's girlfriend in the episode \\"Believe Me, Brother\\", in which she secretly flirts with Josh. She is later exposed, and as revenge, Drake and Josh plant purple paint in her locker and it is splattered all over her when she opens the door. Kelly Hayfer (Chelsea Brummet) is Mrs. Hayfer's daughter. She appears only in the episode \\"Mean Teacher\\", in which she dates Drake. She has a laughing problem throughout the episode, which secretly annoys Drake. However, he does not break up with her, fearing retaliation from Mrs. Hayfer. Although Kelly loves Drake, she ends the relationship – much to his excitement – because she does not believe it is working out. Tori (Torrey DeVitto) is Drake's girlfriend in the episode \\"Playing the Field\\", in which he breaks up with her. When Tori quickly begins dating other boys, Drake dates Liza Tupper – who he has nicknamed Hot Liza – to make Tori jealous. In the episode \\"Dr. Phyllis Show\\", it is mentioned that Liza is the daughter of Dr. Phyllis, the host of a television talk program. Lucy (Gabrielle Christian) is introduced in the episode \\"Girl Power,\\" in which she physically defends Drake against a football player. Drake then considers ending their relationship, as he does not want to be with someone stronger than him. Later in the episode, Drake and Lucy wrestle to determine who is stronger, although Drake is hesitant about wrestling a girl. Carly (Brittany Curran) becomes Drake's girlfriend in the episode \\"Who's Got Game\\", in which Josh challenges Drake on who can get the most dates. Drake meets her at the CD shop where she works and he falls in love with her at first sight. Carly grows fond of Drake too after meeting him, but dumps him when she finds out about the bet, thinking Drake is just using her. He then proves to her that he can be honest and they continue dating. Lucy and another girl, Christine (Sarah Christine Smith), appear as ex-girlfriends of Drake in the episode \\"The Storm\\". They become friends with Carly, who is still dating Drake. The episode marks their final appearance on the series. Drake flirts with other girls, including Grant Widner, in subsequent episodes such as \\"Tree House\\". ==Drake's band== Drake has a band in which he is the frontman. Scottie (Johnny Lewis) is the drummer of Drake's band and is Trevor's younger brother. He is considered to be unintelligent, according to Drake and the other band members. Rina (Molly Orr) is the bassist of Drake's band, while Paul (Jeremy Ray Valdez) is the rhythm guitarist. They only appeared in four episodes in Season 1. Drake and the three band members are detained at a concert because Scottie photocopied their tickets in the episode \\"Grammy\\", the final appearance of the three. In the episode \\"Megan's New Teacher\\", Drake has 5th grader Neil Kramer (Ridge Canipe) play in his band after his original drummer leaves. Neil initially fails a pop quiz by Josh, who is serving temporarily as a student teacher. Neil's mother then forbids him from playing in the band, so Drake and Megan get Josh fired, leading to Neil playing for Drake's band at the Premiere's third anniversary. Neil does not appear in any subsequent episodes. Three bandmembers, Gary (Dan Mott) Julio (Shiloh Fernandez), and an unnamed guitarist appear in \\"The Storm\\". Gary is the goofy and self-absorbed drummer. He has a tattoo of a foot on his chest and likes to wear girls shirts, including his sister's blouse and Megan's panda shirt. Julio is the bassist of the band, and he is later mentioned in the episode \\"Josh Runs Into Oprah\\". The rhythm guitarist is an African American but is only seen with the band. ==References== Characters Category:Lists of American sitcom television characters ","title":"List of Drake &amp; Josh characters"},{"id":"20376892","text":"Plonk may refer to: *Plonk (wine), poor quality wine *Plonk (Usenet), adding a particular Usenet poster to one's kill file (or, by extension, adding a user to one's filter or blacklist in other online media). *Ronnie Lane or Plonk, British musician and member of Small Faces *Dr. Plonk, a 2007 Australian film, directed by Rolf de Heer *Plonk (TV series), a 2014 Australian TV series ","title":"Plonk"},{"id":"20376926","text":"Traffic with the Devil is a 1946 American short documentary film about traffic problems in Los Angeles, directed by Gunther von Fritsch.

Both flags are historically associated with the royal Bavarian Wittelsbach family, which ruled Bavaria from 1180 to 1918. ==Overview== Both horizontal and vertical flags with stripes or white and blue lozenges without arms can be considered official flags of the state, in Bavaria called the . They may be used by civilians and by government, including using on state motor vehicles. The striped and lozenge styles have equal status, and offices or users are free to choose between them. The variants defaced with the arms are unofficial, and the use of the symbols by civilians is strictly speaking illegal but is tolerated. A lozenge-style flag with the arms is common. The exact shade of blue has never been codified, but most flags used by the public are approximately RGB 0-204-255; officials use something closer to RGB 0-128-255. The lozenges are not set in number, except there must be at least 21, and the top left (incomplete) lozenge must be white. (Translated.) The exact origin of the lozenges is disputed. They are believed to be representative of the lakes and rivers of Bavaria or perhaps the sky, as in the Bavarian anthem, which says \\"\\" – \\"the colors of His sky/heaven, white and blue\\". In vexillology, flags are described and displayed from the front (obverse). In Bavaria, however, the description of the flag is based on heraldic rules. That is, the description is made from the point of view of a shield-bearer who is behind the coat of arms, and in this case, behind the flag. Thus, the right upper corner, reserved for a truncated white lozenge, is on the top left (adjacent to the flagpole) for the viewer. ==See also== * BMW (logo based upon the flag) * FC Bayern Munich (logo based upon the flag) ==References== Bavaria Category:Culture of Bavaria Bavaria ","title":"Flag of Bavaria"},{"id":"20377027","text":"Infernal was an influential Swedish black metal band based in Stockholm. ==History== The band was formed in 1997, mainly by David Parland (Blackmoon), who quickly teamed up with ex-Dark Funeral colleague and vocalist Themgoroth (Paul Mäkitalo), to create a band both similar to and more brutal and extreme than Dark Funeral, which Blackmoon had left in mid 1996. The band saw the participation of several members like Matte Modin (ex-Dark Funeral, Defleshed) and Impious of In Aeternum among others. The last known line-up was Blackmoon (David Parland) - guitars, Typhos (Henke Ekeroth) - vocals and guitars and Alzazmon (Tomas Asklund) - drums - this was the second real line-up, and it was dissolved in 2003. David Parland re-formed the band in late 2008 with drummer Asklund. Infernal's new musical direction showcases a slightly more accessible sound than the first two Infernal EPs, and the new musical direction is more along older death/black metal and not as blastbeat-oriented as the old Infernal. This line-up introduces David as a vocalist as well as guitarist. The line-up was planned to be expanded to a full band in time for the planned full-length album and possible live gigs. On July 14, 2009, it was revealed that Infernal had parted ways for good with drummer Tomas Asklund. A replacement in the form of Norwegian drummer Carl Engstrøm from Astaroth and Recovery Injection has been found, and was announced on October 17. Old Necrophobic colleague and guitarist Martin Halfdan has also joined the band as a live and lead/solo guitarist mainly. Lord Abbadon joined in late 2009, also he mainly as a live member, and for a short time as a permanent bassplayer. He departed from the band for personal reasons and later committed suicide while playing in the band From Purgatory. On May 2, 2010, Colombian underground cult label Goathorned Productions released the 3-track Infernal EP \\"The Infernal Return\\". This release features 3 tracks recorded early 2009, with David on guitars, bass and lead vocals. Tomas Asklund (Gorgoroth, Dawn) played session drums on this EP. A demo entitled \\"Hellhymns\\" featured four tracks; it was the last recording before a full-length album, scheduled for release in late 2010 or early 2011. On March 19, 2013, founder David Parland died, putting an end to the band. ==Band members Final lineup === * David \\"Blackmoon\\" Parland – guitars, bass, vocals (1997–2003, 2008–2013) (deceased) === Former members === * Paul \\"Themgoroth\\" Mäkitalo – vocals (1997–1999) * David \\"Impious\\" Larsson – guitar, vocals (1997–1999) * Matte Modin – drums (1997–1999) * Henke \\"Typhos\\" Ekeroth – guitar, vocals (2002–2003) * Tomas Asklund – drums (2002–2003, 2008–2009) * Martin Halfdan – guitars (2008) * Lord Abbadon – bass (2009-2010) * Carl \\"Telal\\" Engström – drums (2010) == Discography == * Infernal (EP) (1999) * Under Wings of Hell (split) (2002) * Summon Forth the Beast (EP) (2002) * The Infernal Return (7\\" EP) (2010) == References  * Official MySpace profile Category:Musical groups established in 1997 Category:Swedish black metal musical groups ","title":"Infernal (Swedish band)"},{"id":"20377031","text":"Page from the Bedford Hours, 1423, illumination on parchment, 41 cm × 28 cm. British Library. The Bedford Master was a manuscript illuminator active in Paris during the fifteenth century. He is named for the work he did on two books illustrated for John of Lancaster, 1st Duke of Bedford between 1415 and 1435. One is the Bedford Hours, a book of hours in the British Library (Add. MS 18850); the other, the Salisbury Breviary, is in the Bibliothèque nationale de France (MS lat. 17294). Another manuscript is in the Royal Collection. The Bedford Master is known to have been the head of a workshop; his chief assistant is known as the Chief Associate of the Bedford Master. Recent scholarship has tended to move from talking about the \\"Bedford Master\\" to the \\"Bedford Workshop\\" and even the Bedford Trend, a term introduced by Millard Meiss in 1967, which includes a wider period leading up to the key Bedford works. A \\"Master of the Bedford Trend\\" has also been attributed with some works. One possible candidate for the identity of the Bedford Master is \\"Haincelin of Hagenau\\" in Alsace, who was recorded in Paris between 1403 and 1424, and was perhaps the father of \\"Jean Haincelin\\", active between at least 1438 and 1449, and was perhaps the \\"Dunois Master\\" who has been given a group of late Bedford-style manuscripts. ==Manuscripts== For John, Duke of Bedford:Royal, 52–53 *Bedford Hours, British Library, Add.

It was directed by Rod Holcomb and included one of the early performances of Joseph Lawrence, who was nominated for Young Artist Award for his role in the movie. The film premiered on Showtime on September 15, 1991 in United States and was released theatrically in Germany. It was released to DVD on December 15, 1998. The opening credits state that Chains of Gold is \\"based on actual events\\", though details of the actual events themselves remain difficult to pin down. The film was shot in Miami, Florida, USA. It is the only film so far written by twice-nominated Academy Award actor John Travolta. ==Plot== Scott Barnes (Travolta) is a former ad executive turned social worker living in Miami. He is also a recovering alcoholic who stopped drinking after accidentally killing his son in a drunk-driving accident. One of his cases is Tommy (Joey Lawrence) a street kid who has been selling crack for an organization called the Youth Incentive Program (YIP). Barnes is unaware of this, but suspects something when Tommy buys expensive gifts for his mother and sister. He also notices the YIP tattoo on Tommy's arm. Tommy is kidnapped by YIP and forced to package crack into vials in an abandoned building with many other children. After Tommy does not come home for several days, his sister calls the morgue and they inform her he is dead. Barnes goes to the morgue to identify Tommy, but discovers it is not him, although he sees the YIP tattoo on the corpse. While trying to find Tommy, he witnesses a shootout where one of the gunmen has a YIP tattoo. He goes to see Sgt. Palco (Bernie Casey), who tells him about YIP. Barnes, convinced Tommy has been kidnapped by YIP, then talks to the head of the narcotics division, Lt. Ortega (Hector Elizondo) who tries to convince him to stay away from the gang. While looking for Tommy in the streets, Barnes notices the YIP henchman James (Ramon Franco) and follows him to a nightclub. There, he meets his old girlfriend Jackie (Marilu Henner) and is shocked when he sees her speaking to James. After sleeping together, Barnes learns Jackie is a lawyer for YIP and tells her he wants to get into the organization to rescue Tommy. After some consternation, Jackie tells Barnes that YIP is willing to induct him as a member. Barnes goes to meet with Carlos (Benjamin Bratt), the head of YIP, who wants him to help expand the organization into the suburbs. James then shows him around the organization and leads him to the warehouse where Tommy is being held. Tommy tries escaping and is taken to the Madison House, an abandoned factory where members of YIP who commit transgressions are killed. Barnes finds out about this from one of Tommy's friends. Barnes is taken to the Madison House and sees Tommy. He then goes to see Lt. Ortega, who tells him if he interferes further, he will be charged with conspiracy to distribute narcotics. One of Carlos' henchmen sees Barnes enter the police station and informs Carlos, who now believes him to be an FBI agent. Barnes goes to see Jackie and discovers that she has been killed by Carlos' henchmen, who then attack him. Barnes escapes but is quickly kidnapped by the henchmen. He is taken to the Madison House and thrown into an elevator pit filled with alligators, but gets caught in the wiring and manages to escape. Barnes finds Carlos and the two have a fist-fight just as the police raid the building. Barnes finally manages to punch Carlos down into the elevator pit, killing him. The police arrest the rest of the YIP members and Barnes drives away with Tommy in a police car. == External links == * * Category:1991 television films Category:1991 films Category:1991 crime drama films Category:1990s action films Category:American films Category:American crime drama films Category:Films shot in Miami Category:English-language films Category:Showtime (TV network) films Category:Films scored by Trevor Jones Category:Films about runaways Category:1991 drama films ","title":"Chains of Gold"},{"id":"20377245","text":"Charles H.

He helped with 13 La Liga matches in that season's victorious campaign, but was soon pushed to the sidelines by another youth product, Guti. After a stint with UD Las Palmas in the second division, Sandro dropped down to the third level in January 1998, and helped Málaga CF achieve a top flight promotion in just two seasons – he played 29 games in the latter, scoring once. In summer 1997, he had a trial at Newcastle United, but it did not lead to a contract. In 2003, Sandro signed for Levante UD. Again used regularly in his first season, for another promotion, he featured very rarely in 2004–05's first division (only three appearances). The Valencians were eventually relegated, but he remained with them for a further year. Sandro returned to Málaga for 2006–07, with the side again in division two. After the 2008 promotion, his contract expired and he retired; club chairman, former Madrid teammate Fernando Sanz, offered him a job as technical director which he accepted. ==HonoursClub=== Real Madrid *La Liga: 1994–95 Málaga *UEFA Intertoto Cup: 2002 Levante *Segunda División: 2003–04 ===Country=== Spain U16 *UEFA European Under-16 Championship: 1991 Spain U17 *FIFA U-17 World Cup: Runner-up 1991 ==ReferencesCategory:1974 births Category:Living people Category:People from Tenerife Category:Spanish footballers Category:Canarian footballers Category:Association football midfielders Category:La Liga players Category:Segunda División players Category:Segunda División B players Category:Real Madrid Castilla footballers Category:Real Madrid CF players Category:UD Las Palmas players Category:Málaga CF players Category:Levante UD footballers Category:Spain youth international footballers Category:Spain under-21 international footballers ","title":"Sandro (footballer, born 1974)"},{"id":"20377287","text":"The Endeavor Hydrothermal Vents are a group of hydrothermal vents in the northeastern Pacific Ocean, located southwest of Vancouver Island, British Columbia, Canada. This group of hydrothermal vents lies below sea level in an area where the Pacific Ocean seabed is being pulled apart called the Endeavor Segment, which forms part of a larger spreading center called the Juan de Fuca Ridge. Hydrothermal vents form in volcanically active areas, such as mid-ocean ridges where two plates are diverging, separating from each other, resulting in the formation of new crust. At such sites, water penetrates through the hot crust, causing the pressure and temperature to change, resulting in precipitation of minerals, eventually creating hydrothermal chimneys. After the hydrothermal fluids temperature decreases and mixes with the seawater, the environment will reach ideal thermal and chemical conditions that supports a unique biological community. == Fluid circulation == Hydrothermal vents typically form on the tectonic plate boundaries and in association with hotspots. Seawater flows through the cracks of the volcanic bed which heats the water and cools the Earth. This allows the hydrothermal fluids to flow up and out of the crust and into the ocean. This heated water supplies energy and nutrients for chemoautotrophic organisms to thrive in this environment. 800 individual chimneys have been recorded over a section of the ridge. Deep sea vent chemistry diagram == Heat source == Heat in the Endeavour Hydrothermal Vents are supplied by the cooling of the Earth's crust in areas of high seismic activity. The water is supplied by the ocean and seeps into the Earth's crust and rises back up out of the surface after it is heated. The hydrothermal fluids come from below the surface of the Earth and rise up above the surface. == Fluid fluxes and chemistry == Energy flux caused by high temperature gradients in the Endeavour Hydrothermal Vents contributes to the production of chemical reactions that are necessary for life to exist, sparking the synthesis of organic compounds. These changes in temperature are caused by the cooling of the magma once it penetrates the surface of the Earth, making contact with the seawater. These hydrothermal fluids can reach temperatures for up to 402 °C. == Biology == Hydrothermal vents are located at mid-ocean ridges, where an abundance of life is present, providing high biodiversity of productivity. They provide habitats for many unique species of animals. The Juan De Fuca Ridge is home to 60 unique species in the world. Specifically in the Endeavour Segment, there are 12 species that are unique to this area which do not exist anywhere else in the world including the sea spider (Sericosura Venticola). A sulfide-hosted microbe from this site can live in environments up to 121 °C, which is the record for the upper limit for life. == Marine protected area designation == Due to the rich biodiversity in the Endeavour Hydrothermal Vents, the Canada's Oceans Act declared this site as the first marine protected area in 2003. The marine protected area management ensures that human activities help instead of hinder the environment including conserving and protecting the biodiversity of the space, while increasing research and public awareness of the environment as well. All regulations can be found in the Endeavour Hydrothermal Vents Marine Protected Area Regulations. == Cabled observatory == Since 1987, Canada has been utilizing their cabled observatory called North Pacific Time-Series Underwater Experiment (NEPTUNE). NEPTUNE was founded by the Science Foundation's Ocean Observatories Initiative (OOI). Some examples that NEPTUNE can measure are temperature, salinity, and methane content of the seafloor. These are measured with a collection of instruments that are powered with cables that are long enough to connect to land power, allowing real-time monitoring. == Scientific discoveries == Zooplankton The Endeavour Hydrothermal vents are home to several important scientific discoveries which include: * 1982: discovery of the first vents in Juan de Fuca Ridge * 1984: exploration of the first extensive seafloor ore deposits * 1989: discovery of glowing vents, which are vents that emit thermal radiation due to high temperature fluids above 350 °C coming out of the vent. * 1990: discovery of highest neutral water temperatures known to Earth * 1991: first extensive usage of undersea robotic vehicles * Discovery of the organism that holds the record for the upper temperature limit to life (121 °C) * First evidence that hydrothermal plumes were zones of greatly enhanced zooplankton aggregation * First measurements of biomass fluxes relating to hydrothermal plumes To this day, the Endeavour Hydrothermal Vents still continues to be a site where scientists such as biologists, geologists, physicists, microbiologists, and oceanographers gravitate toward to find new discoveries.Tunnicliffe, Verena and Richard Thomson. 1999.

It is believed to come from Australian slang, in reference to blanc (the French word for \\"white\\"), before it became naturalised in Britain. Despite the reference to the colour white, the term is not limited to white wine, and can as easily indicate a red wine or rosé. In this context, the phrase has even spawned the title of a novel which evokes the perceived tackiness of the 1980s. In Australia, plonk packaged and sold in a cask or simply in a bag is commonly called \\"goon\\". While not commonly used, the term has also been adopted in other Commonwealth countries such as Canada. ==Other usages== The term is not always used in a wholly derogatory manner. It can indicate a degree of strange affection for the wine in question. Telegraph journalist Max Davidson has equated plonk with \\"youth, ... excess, ... self-indulgence in times of penury. Forget grown-up wine. With plonk, the sweetest bouquet of all is the taste of a few pence saved.\\" Today, the term can often be used to indicate that a particular social gathering is not a fancy affair. For example, if a party guest is worried about the social level of the occasion, a host might assuage his or her concerns with the phrase: \\"Oh, just bring a bottle of plonk.\\" Indeed, probably the most famous literary use of \\"plonk\\" comes in Willy Russell's play Educating Rita. Working-class Rita decides she cannot attend a party to which academic Frank has invited her, since she is ashamed of the wine she has bought and feels out-of-place. When Rita reports her anxieties to Frank the following week, he castigates Rita for being too self-conscious, reassuring her: \\"It wouldn't have mattered if you'd walked in carrying a bottle of Spanish plonk.\\" Another well-known usage of the word was that of Horace Rumpole, the title character of John Mortimer's television series \\"Rumpole of the Bailey\\" (1975–1992). Rumpole would frequently suggest to a fellow barrister, and sometimes even a client, that they repair to Pomeroy's Wine Bar, to down a few glasses of plonk. ==See also== *Box wine *Flavored fortified wine *Jabol *Jug wine ==References== Category:Wine terminology Category:English words ","title":"Plonk (wine)"},{"id":"20377316","text":"Richard D.

The lyrics to \\"Endless Art\\" begin with the line \\"All art is quite useless according to Oscar Wilde\\" and for their remainder are mostly a list of the names and birth and death dates of artists from various fields, with the chorus remark: \\"all dead but still alive, in endless time and endless art\\". This \\"list\\" style of song is characteristic of many of Dave Couse's songs. The majority of the lyrics are declaimed rather than sung, over a repetitive electric guitar motif. Melodically, the song features a quotation from Beethoven's Fifth Symphony in the chorus. ==Video== \\"Endless Art\\" was accompanied by an innovative stop-motion video which received a lot of praise. When Paul King called it quits on MTV's Greatest Hits, he played the video for \\"Endless Art\\" on his final show as one \\"of those videos that I really do think deserve to be called great and classic\\", alongside others such as \\"Thriller\\" and \\"Ashes to Ashes\\". ==Sexism== For the first appearance of the song on Bingo, the band received some criticism for the fact that the artists listed in the song are all male, so they recorded a second version where all the artists are female. This is the version called \\"More Endless Art\\". In \\"More Endless Art\\", the melodic quotation from Beethoven is substituted with one from Carl Orff, who, it might be quibbled, is not a woman, while the substitution of Walt Disney's Minnie Mouse for his Mickey Mouse may not quite right the gender balance either. Still, \\"More Endless Art\\" was better than a defense Dave Couse had offered in interviews, that the band had thought that Joan Miró was a woman. ==Updated version== Dave Couse has subsequently performed a live version of \\"Endless Art\\" with a new list of artists, those deceased since the original release of the song. This is available as \\"Endless Art 06\\" on the B-side of his 2006 single \\"A Celebration\\". ==Track listings== \\"Endless Art\\" single (1992) # \\"Endless Art\\" # \\"Freak Show\\"* # \\"More Endless Art\\" # \\"Charity\\"* ∗ From a live recording for a John Peel session on February 2, 1992. * All songs written by A House. * Produced by Edwyn Collins (1, 3) and Dale Griffin (2, 4).

While still in high school he began attending art classes at Carnegie-Mellon University, where he went on to complete a B.F.A. in 1994. During his senior year of college, Madonna became the first art intern ever taken in by Mad magazine. Upon graduation, he moved to San Francisco and began making minicomics, which he left in public places for free. In 2003, Madonna created \\"All Over Coffee\\", which was picked up by the San Francisco Chronicle in 2004. The series ran for twelve years, for a total of 726 strips, with the final strip running on December 27, 2015. Madonna has served as \\"cartoonist-in-residence\\" artist in residence at San Francisco's Cartoon Art Museum, and was the recipient of the Northern California Book Award's Recognition Award for Best Book of the Year, 2011, for his second book, Everything is its own reward. His work is exhibited internationally in galleries and museums, and his books continue to sell around the world. == Art career == Madonna is an artist and writer with a background in painting. He is best known for his series \\"All Over Coffee,\\" which he called a 'strip,' a comic strip without the comic, which feature detailed ink-on-paper drawings of urban cityscapes paired with flash fiction stories. Madonna began all his drawings for the series on site, and straight to ink. He began with rendering his home town of San Francisco but has gone on to draw many U.S. cities including New York and Los Angeles, as well as international locations such as Paris, Rome, Amsterdam, Buenos Aires, Shanghai, Beijing, and Tokyo. \\"All Over Coffee\\" ran four days a week for a year and a half in the Daily and Sunday Datebook section of the San Francisco Chronicle, then six months at three days a week, finally settling into weekly publication for another ten years. In that time, City Lights Books published two collections, All Over Coffee (2007), and Everything is its own reward (2011). In 2015 Madonna ended the series with a story known as The Eviction Series, which is an absurdist short story about the tech boom in the San Francisco Bay Area. Shortly after, City Lights contracted The Eviction Series for a book, On to the Next Dream, which was released in 2017. In 2016 Madonna released his first illustrated novel, Close Enough for the Angels, as a limited edition book at the Dryansky Gallery in San Francisco. The book features fictional artist Emit Hopper, 'a one-hit wonder, twice' who, after twenty years, is having a comeback. It is Madonna's first foray into long form narrative. A commercial edition is slated for fall of 2017. Madonna is also a prolific gallery artist, showing his original work internationally. His work has been shown in the Oakland Museum and the Contemporary Jewish Museum of San Francisco. Madonna also produces the comic strip \\"Small Potatoes\\". In contrast to his detailed pen and ink drawings of All Over Coffee, the series uses deliberately rudimentary characters, drawn in a quick, loose hand. == Works == *Follow Yourself: An Affirmation of the Creative Life (City Lights, 2018) *On to the Next Dream (City Lights, 2017) *Everything is its own reward by Paul Madonna (City Lights, 2011) *All Over Coffee by Paul Madonna (City Lights, 2007) *Album 01\\" (2009, Electric Works / Paul Madonna Studio) *A Writer's San Francisco: A Guided Journey for the Creative Soul by Eric Maisel, illustrated by Paul Madonna (New World Library, 2006) ==References External links == * *San Francisco Chronicle profile *SFist Interview with Paul Madonna Category:American artists Category:Living people Category:1972 births Category:Carnegie Mellon University alumni ","title":"Paul Madonna"},{"id":"20377555","text":"Tamauri Eugene Tucker (born 10 December 1988) is a cricketer who has played four One Day Internationals and one Twenty20 International for Bermuda. ==References External links == * * Category:1988 births Category:Living people Category:Bermuda One Day International cricketers Category:Bermuda Twenty20 International cricketers Category:Bermudian cricketers ","title":"Tamauri Tucker"},{"id":"20377575","text":"Ganga Maiyya Tohe Piyari Chadhaibo (English: O Mother Ganga I will offer you a yellow cloth) is a Bhojpuri film released in 1963 directed by Kundan Kumar.

He was the last Governor-General of the Dutch East India Company, which was dissolved, bankrupt in 1799, but he remained in post as the Dutch state took over ruling its territories in the Indies. In that sense, he was also the first state appointed Governor-General of the Dutch East Indies. Van Overstraten was appointed member-extraordinary of the Council of Justice (Raad van Justitie) in Batavia/Jakarta in 1780. He arrived in there in 1781. Subsequently, he was promoted to full member. In the same year, he was made interim Advocate-Fiscal. He was made Second Secretary to the High Government of the Indies in 1784. He was promoted in 1786 to First Secretary. He became Counsellor-extraordinary to the Dutch Council of the Indies in 1789. By 1791 he was Governor and Director of Java's Northeast Coast, in which post he greatly distinguished himself. During his time in the Northeast Coast, he was instrumental in getting Hamengkubuwono I established as the first Sultan of Yogyakarta. He wrote an historically important memoir for his successor containing information about that area during his term of office. On 16 August 1796 Pieter van Overstraten was selected as Governor- General. On 17 February 1797, Willem Arnold Alting resigned as Governor- General and Commissioner of Police (Commissaris-General). He handed over his offices to Van Overstaten. The appointment was confirmed in the Netherlands on 22 January 1798. When the High Government of the Indies was dissolved in 1799, he resigned as Commissioner of Police, but remained as Governor-General serving the Batavian Republic, which the Netherlands had become under Napoleon Bonaparte. He remained in post until his death in Batavia in 1801. During Van Overstraten's term of office, the Dutch East India Company (VOC) was dissolved, Ternate went into British hands, Batavia was blockaded by a British fleet, and the fortifications on the island of Onrust, and on a few other islands, destroyed. ==ReferencesSources== *Dutch East India Company (VOC) infosite Category:1755 births Category:1801 deaths Category:Governors- General of the Dutch East Indies Category:People from Bergen op Zoom Category:18th-century Dutch East Indies people Category:19th-century Dutch East Indies people ","title":"Pieter Gerardus van Overstraten"},{"id":"20377582","text":"Good Time may refer to: * Good Time (film), a 2017 American crime film by the Safdie brothers * Good conduct time, a sentence reduction for good behavior in prison ==MusicAlbums=== * Good Time (album) or the title song (see below), by Alan Jackson, 2008 * Good Time (soundtrack) or the title song, by Oneohtrix Point Never, from the 2017 film * A Good Time, by Davido, 2019 * Good Time, by Ranky Tanky, 2019 ===Songs=== * \\"Good Time\\" (Alan Jackson song), 2008 * \\"Good Time\\" (Beach Boys song), 1972 * \\"Good Time\\" (Inna song), 2014 * \\"Good Time\\" (Jin Akanishi song), 2014 * \\"Good Time\\" (Justice Crew song), 2015 * \\"Good Time\\" (Owl City and Carly Rae Jepsen song), 2012 * \\"Good Time\\" (Luca Hänni and Christopher S song), 2014 * \\"Good Time\\" (Paris Hilton song), 2013 * \\"Good Time\\", by A, 2003 * \\"Good Time\\", by Brazilian Girls from New York City, 2008 * \\"Good Time\\", by Crystal Castles from Crystal Castles, 2008 * \\"Good Time\\", by J Hus from Common Sense, 2017 * \\"Good Time\\", by Leroy from Music from Scrubs, 2002 ==See also== * Good Times (disambiguation) ","title":"Good Time"},{"id":"20377617","text":"Laagi Nahi Chhute Ram is 1963 Bhojpuri film directed by Kundan Kumar.

AFA teaches from a Christ-centered, biblical worldview. ==History== 120px In November 1995, the National Christian Foundation for Education and The Arts Trust (NCF) was established with the goal of operating a non-denominational, academically rigorous high school in Northern Virginia. Fundamental to NCF's goal was the belief that all labor in vain unless God directs our efforts – nisi Dominus frustra. In September 1996, NCF opened Ad Fontes Academy (AFA). AFA recognizes that “each child is created in the image and likeness of God, the Creator, as a unique human being having a purpose for which he or she is created and is known by his deeds, by whether what he does is pure and right” and that “the knowledge and pursuit of truth, understanding and wisdom has the intended outcome of enabling the individual to fulfill the purpose for which he or she is created.” When Ad Fontes Academy opened in September 1996, it started with 8 students in grades 9–10. AFA graduated its first class of five seniors in June 1999. In 2000, AFA added Grades 7 and 8 to the high school program. In 2003, Kindergarten was added and grades 1 to 6 the following year for a full K-12 program. ==Teaching methodology== The teaching methodology is based on The Lost Tools of Learning The teachers further utilize the methods in John Milton Gregory's book The Seven Laws of Teaching. ==Upper school student lifeSports=== Boys * Baseball * Basketball Girls * Volleyball Boys and girls * Cross Country * Tennis AFA is a member of the National Christian School Athletic Association and competes in the Northern Virginia Independent Athletic Conference (NVIAC) ===Clubs=== * Techne Society * Latin Club * Theatre * Artists' Society * Yearbook Club * Play Reading Club ===Other activities=== * Annual Fall Student Retreat * Protocol (autumn and spring) * House System * Student-directed Shakespeare play == References  External links == * Category:Christian schools in Virginia Category:High schools in Fairfax County, Virginia Category:Classical schools in Fairfax County, Virginia Category:Classical Christian schools Category:Private middle schools in Virginia Category:Private elementary schools in Virginia Category:Educational institutions established in 1996 Category:1996 establishments in Virginia ","title":"Ad Fontes Academy"},{"id":"20377694","text":"== Seeds == A champion seed is indicated in bold text while text in italics indicates the round in which that seed was eliminated.

Chondroscaphe chestertonii flower ==James Veitch & Sons== Chesterton was born in Sandy, Bedfordshire in 1837.England & Wales, Civil Registration Birth Index, 1837-19151881 England Census In 1861, he was working at Burghley House in Peterborough as a servant in the household of Brownlow Cecil, 2nd Marquess of Exeter.1861 England Census Little else is known of Chesterton's early life until early 1870, when, as a valet to a gentleman who was travelling through South America, he wrote to Sir Harry Veitch from Chile stating that he had a passion for orchids and had gathered a substantial collection but needed advice on how to pack them in order to bring them back to England. Veitch replied immediately and arranged for Chesterton to meet one of his shipping agents in South America who would demonstrate the proper methods of packing the plants in order that they could be safely conveyed thousands of miles by sea, through various climates and greatly varying temperatures. Nothing more was heard of Chesterton for some time, until, he arrived unannounced at Veitch Nurseries' Chelsea, London headquarters. Harry Veitch and John Heal, the head nurseryman, rushed to meet him and were presented with a collection of Orchids, \\"so carefully packed and well looked after, that they arrived in the best possible condition\\". Veitch immediately bought all of Chesterton's plants and offered him employment as a traveller in order to obtain more new finds as orchid mania was reaching its height. After a period spent studying and working in the Veitch orchid houses, he set off back to South America. Chesterton was given specific instructions to locate and bring back to England \\"the much-talked-of and long-desired \\"scarlet Odontoglossum\\" (Miltoniopsis vexillaria) which several collectors, including David Bowman, had previously located but had been unable to send live samples back to England, with samples often arriving at Chelsea \\"dead or in a dying condition\\". Chesterton eventually located the plant in the northern Cordillera Occidental in Colombia. According to the account in Hortus Veitchii: > \\"Provided with but the scantiest information as to the native habitat, long > kept secret and shrouded in mystery, Chesterton started, and not only > succeeded in discovering the plant, but safely introduced it to Chelsea, > where it flowered for the first time in 1873.\\" Chesterton continued to collect for Veitch over the next eight years and sent many new finds back to England, including some of the finest forms of Odontoglossum crispum, one of which was named \\"Chestertonii\\" by Reichenbach after its discoverer: some fine Masdevallias were also sent home, including the beautiful Masdevallia coccinea Harryana, which Chesterton found growing in abundance in the high Sierra Nevada del Cocuy in the Colombian Andes. ==Later career, death and epitaph== Frog's Skin (Dracula chestertonii) Chesterton ended his employment with Veitch in 1878, and joined Veitch's principal rival Henry Sander, who sent him back to search for the \\"lost orchid\\", Cattleya labiata var. Vera. In 1879 he located Paphinia rugosa var. Sanderiana, which he named after his current employer.Paphinia rugosa var. Sanderiana on French Wikipedia On his final trip, he discovered a species of \\"Dracula orchid\\", Dracula chestertonii, which was named after him. He died at Puerto Berrío, in the Colombian department of Antioquia on 26 January 1883. His obituary in the Shipping List of 30 January 1883 stated: > \\"Mr. J. H. Chesterton, the botanist, died at Puerto Berrio on the 26th. He > had been quite ill, but left the hotel 'San Nicholas,' thinking that he had > sufficiently improved to be able to make his trip up the river. Sad mistake! > He continued to decline, and was barely put on shore at Puerto Berrio where > he died. Poor Chesterton's reckless spirit rendered him very efficient as a > plant-collector.\\" The mania for orchids was now at its peak and after Chesterton, orchid collectors became less discriminating and tended to strip out the native habitat to prevent rival collectors from finding anything. The region where Chesterton had re-discovered Miltoniopsis vexillaria was later said to have been cleared as if by a forest fire. In 1887, the English traveller and orchid collector, Albert Millican, came across Chesterton's grave at Puerto Berrio, which he described in his memoirs as a > \\"rough cross of wood on the edge of the forest, on the higher bank of the > river, (which) marks the last resting-place of Chesterton, the well-known > orchid collector, who did such good service for the firm of James Veitch and > Sons, long before the wholesale plunder and extermination of the plants > brought about by modern collectors\\". ==Honours== Among the species and varieties of plant named after Chesterton are: *Odontoglossum crispum var.

He also played minor counties cricket (and a few List A games) for Staffordshire and for the Worcestershire Cricket Board team. He made his Worcestershire debut in mid-August 1982 in a John Player League match against Hampshire at Southampton, holding a catch to dismiss Hampshire captain Nick Pocock. Banks did not bat, owing to a first-wicket partnership of 224 between Alan Ormrod (92*) and Dipak Patel (125) which as of 2008 remained a record opening stand for Worcestershire in List A cricket. That proved to be his only first-team appearance of the season. In 1983 Banks hit a century on his first-class debut, though it was to remain the only one he ever made. He scored 100 and 53 against Oxford University in June, which led to his being given a run in the team during the middle part of the summer, but he was unable to repeat this success and scored only 210 more runs in 11 first-class innings. He fared no better in the one-day game, managing just 35 runs in six innings. Banks remained at Worcestershire for a couple more years, but scored only two more half-centuries (both in first-class games) and when 1986 came around he was playing in the Minor Counties Championship for Staffordshire. Although more of his matches were minor, the NatWest Trophy afforded him the chance of List A games occasionally. In June 1988 Staffordshire played Surrey at Burton upon Trent, and although they lost the game they put in a creditable performance thanks largely to Banks. He scored 62*, his only List A half-century, and took the wickets of Alec Stewart and Monte Lynch. Banks' all-round performance won him the man-of-the-match award Banks returned to the first-class game, with Warwickshire, halfway through the 1988 season, and he remained at Edgbaston in 1989 as well. He scored one first-class half-century in each season, but did not produce consistent scores and was relegated to the Second XI by the middle of June 1989. For 1990 he was back with Staffordshire, for whom he continued to play until the mid-nineties. His final List A game was for the recreational Worcestershire Cricket Board against Buckinghamshire in the C&G; Trophy in late August 2001. He had some significant appearances in club cricket. In 1986 he was part of the Stourbridge side which beat Weston-super-Mare to lift the William Younger Cup, while he later turned out for Old Hill, in 1993 playing as they beat West Bromwich Dartmouth to win the National Club Championship. As of November 2012, David was appointed club coach of Halesowen Cricket Club with responsibility for overseeing youth cricket development as well as senior sides coaching.

The Greek Revival style house was built in stages between 1832 and the 1850s by the Glover family. The house has been called the \\"Grand Mansion of Alabama.\\" The property was added to the National Register of Historic Places on May 27, 1971. The Glover family enslaved over 300 people from 1830 until 1860.https://sankofagenus.com/2017/06/24/rosemount-plantation/ ==History== Allen Glover, of Demopolis, gave the property to his son, Williamson Allen Glover, in the early 1830s. The main block of the house, designed in 1832 by state architect, William Nichols, is centered on a prominent star-shaped hill. This main block, with three floors and a mezzanine, was built in 1835. Williamson Allen Glover continued to expand the rear and interior of the house, through successive additions and reconfigurations, up to 1855. He went on to raise a total of sixteen children in the mansion's twenty rooms. ==Architecture== The exterior of the house features a Carolina-type monumental two-story Ionic portico, east and west side porches, and a continuous cornice with dentils above the second story and the cupola. The house plan forms a T-shape, to take advantage of the cross-ventilation that this plan affords. The major interior rooms include an entrance hall, twin parlors, great halls on both main floors that are long, a dining room, eight bedrooms, and a roof- top cupola, the largest residential example in Alabama. The cupola houses a music room that measures by ; double doors exit the south side of the music room onto a three sided porch with Doric columns. The cupola functioned as a look-out over the plantation and, along with the great halls, as a way to exhaust heated air out of the house during hot weather. Though no longer extant, the grounds once included formal gardens, a carriage house, a two- story servant's quarters, a schoolhouse, several barns, a corn crib, a shop, five slave cabins behind the main house, and a \\"slave village\\" about one mile away. Additionally there was a detached kitchen, now destroyed, that was later moved and attached to the house. The house passed through different families over the years, going through some periods of disrepair and later, restorations. A massive restoration was begun around 2005 and the exterior was completely finished. ==See also== *Glover Mausoleum, built for Williamson Glover's father and also listed on the NRHP ==References== * https://sankofagenus.com/2017/06/24/rosemount-plantation/ Category:National Register of Historic Places in Greene County, Alabama Category:Houses on the National Register of Historic Places in Alabama Category:Houses completed in 1850 Category:Greek Revival houses in Alabama Category:Plantation houses in Alabama Category:Houses in Greene County, Alabama Category:Slave cabins and quarters in the United States ","title":"Rosemount (Forkland, Alabama)"},{"id":"20378037","text":"Latindex (Regional Cooperative Online Information System for Scholarly Journals from Latin America, the Caribbean, Spain and Portugal) is a bibliographical information system available for free consultation. Established as a network in 1997, the project is based on the cooperation of 17 national resource centers that operate in a coordinated scheme for the gathering and dissemination of relevant information and data on the Iberoamerican journals. The aims of Latindex are disseminating, fostering and developing both the scientific and the editorial fields, and to fulfill their information needs in the best possible manner. Latindex was created following the recommendations arose in the First Workshop on Latin American Scientific Publications held in Guadalajara, Mexico in 1994. The idea was adopted by the National Autonomous University of Mexico in 1995, and in February 1997, the First Technical Meeting was held in Mexico City with the commitment of four countries (Brazil, Cuba, Venezuela and Mexico). With the incorporation of Spain and Portugal in 1998, Latindex evolved towards an Iberoamerican system. ==Products== 1\\\\. Directory. It’s a Comprehensive inventory of scholarly journals. Available since 1997 it provides basic bibliographic data of each title such as publisher, contact address, subject coverage, prices, frequency, etc. The online version of the Directory contains detailed information of almost 17,000 journals from 30 countries. 2\\\\.

These taxonomists control the quality of the information, which is gathered from the primary scientific literature as well as from some external regional and taxon-specific databases. WoRMS maintains valid names of all marine organisms, but also provides information on synonyms and invalid names. It is an ongoing task to maintain the registry, since new species are constantly being discovered and described by scientists; in addition, the nomenclature and taxonomy of existing species is often corrected or changed as new research is constantly being published. Subsets of WoRMS content are made available, and can have separate badging and their own home/launch pages, as \\"subregisters\\", such as the World List of Marine Acanthocephala, World List of Actiniaria, World Amphipoda Database, World Porifera Database, and so on. As of December 2018 there were 60 such taxonomic subregisters, including a number presently under construction. A second category of subregisters comprises regional species databases such as the African Register of Marine Species, Belgian Register of Marine Species, etc., while a third comprises thematic subsets such as the World Register of Deep-Sea species (WoRDSS), World Register of Introduced Marine Species (WRiMS), etc. In all of these cases, the base data are entered and held once only as part of the WoRMS data system for ease of maintenance and data consistency, and are redisplayed as needed in the context of the relevant subregister or subregisters to which they may also belong. Certain subregisters expand content beyond the original \\"marine\\" concept of WoRMS by including freshwater or terrestrial taxa for completeness in their designated area of interest; such records can be excluded from a standard search of WoRMS by selecting appropriate options in the online search interface. ==History== WoRMS was founded in 2008 and grew out of the European Register of Marine Species and the UNESCO-IOC Register of Marine Organisms (URMO), which was compiled by Jacob van der Land (and several colleagues) at the National Museum of Natural History, Leiden It is primarily funded by the European Union and hosted by the Flanders Marine Institute (VLIZ) in Ostend, Belgium. WoRMS has established formal agreements with several other biodiversity projects, including the Global Biodiversity Information Facility and the Encyclopedia of Life. In 2008, WoRMS stated that it hoped to have an up-to-date record of all marine species completed by 2010, the year in which the Census of Marine Life was completed. As of February 2018, WoRMS contained listings for 480,931 marine species names (including synonyms) of which 240,633 are valid marine species (95 % checked). Their goal is to have a listing for each of the approximately more than 240,000 marine species. VLIZ also hosts the Interim Register of Marine and Nonmarine Genera (IRMNG), using a common infrastructure. == See also == * AlgaeBase * Catalog of Fishes * Census of Marine Life (CoML) * Ocean Biogeographic Information System (OBIS) ==References* Category:Animal taxonomy Category:Biogeography Category:Fisheries databases Category:Marine biology Category:Zoology ","title":"World Register of Marine Species"},{"id":"20378111","text":"Sergei Pavlovich Roldugin (Russian: Сергей Павлович Ролдугин, born September 28, 1951 Sakhalin) is a Russian cellist and businessman, based in St Petersburg.

It was originally called Grave Island and was sacred to the Nisqually Indians, who for decades practiced tree burials by placing their honored dead in dugout canoes high in the fir trees. Later on, the island was purchased and used as a summer home by Conrad L. Hoska (1856–1910), a Tacoma pioneer. A section devoted to Hoska's biography. In 1933, Dr. Alfred Schultz, a Tacoma dentist, purchased the island for $8,000, and according to him, the Smithsonian Institution had removed all traceable relics from Grave Island prior to 1891. Dr. Schultz built and ran a boy's camp, Camp Ta-Ha-Do-Wa, on the island from 1945 to ???. In 1946 the lighthouse and lodge (pictured) on the northern tip of the island were completed, with the lighthouse being used during the summer as Dr. Schultz's office and as an infirmary. Descriptions of images of the island from the 1950s. Search for \\"Tanglewood Island\\" (TPL-8495, TPL-9190). According to the Seattle Times (April 17, 1947), the Tanglewood Lighthouse was the first round lighthouse to be built in the US in 85 years. The government approved its design, authorized the installation of a beacon light, turned on in June, 1947, and consented to changing the island's name from Grave to Tanglewood. The lighthouse is no longer functional but stood for many years as a historical monument to the island, the camp, and Dr. Schultz. (Harbor History Museum Blog, November 28, 2013.) Following Dr. Schultz's death, in ???, his estate sold Tanglewood Island to a group of several individuals, who subdivided the island into plots, one for each member of the group. In 2014, when the lighthouse and main lodge had long since become rotten and nonfunctional, they began to tear them down but were stopped by Pierce County officials for failing to have the proper demolition permits. (KOMO News, January 30, 2014.) The Geographic Names Information System lists several alternative names: Ellens Isle, Grant Island, Grave Island, and Hoska Island. The name Tanglewood was inspired by the heavy undergrowth and Nathaniel Hawthorne's Tanglewood Tales. It was chosen as the official name of the island by the U.S. Board on Geographic Names in 1947. In the 2010 United States Census, the island was included as part of the Fox Island census-designated place. The census block encompassing just Tanglewood Island showed a population of 8 with 5 housing units. ==References * Tanglewood Island at FoxIslandWA.net Category:Islands of Pierce County, Washington Category:Islands of Washington (state) Category:Islands of Puget Sound ","title":"Tanglewood Island"},{"id":"20378475","text":"Hale Passage is the name of two different bodies of water in Puget Sound, in the U.S. state of Washington. *In the north Sound, in Whatcom County, Hale Passage separates Lummi Island from the mainland near Bellingham. *In the south Sound in Pierce County, another Hale Passage separates Fox Island from the Kitsap Peninsula, near Gig Harbor.

They were used extensively during the 18th and 19th centuries and featured regularly scheduled service. When such ships were put into use in the 18th century on the Atlantic Ocean between Great Britain and its colonies, the services were called the packet trade. Steam driven packets were used extensively in the United States in the 19th century on the Mississippi and Missouri rivers, supplying and bringing personnel to forts and trading posts. ==History== Packet craft were used extensively in European coastal mail services since the 17th century, and gradually added cramped passenger accommodation. As early as 1629, the Dutch East India Company was carrying some passengers on the ill-fated Batavia from Texel in Holland to Java. Passenger accommodations were minimal: transportation, \\"firing\\" (i.e. a place to cook), drinking water (often tasting of indigo or tobacco, which the water casks had previously held), and a place to sleep. Later, scheduled services were offered, but the time journeys took depended much on the weather. They are even found to be a subject of Daniel Defoe's 1724 novel Roxana: The Fortunate Mistress.The novel contains numerous references to packet boats, and includes a section entitled \\"Sail in packet-boat to Rotterdam\\". In England the King maintained a weekly packet service with the continent and Ireland using 15 packet vessels.A Collection of Voyages and Travels, consisting of Authentic Writers in our own Tongue, which have not before been collected in English, or have only been abridged in other Collections Vol I., 1745, p.120 Their importance is evident from the fact that the first craft built in the colony of New South Wales (in 1789) was the Rose Hill Packet. Over the two centuries of the sailing packet craft development, they came in various rig configurations which included: schooners, schooners- brigs, sloops, cutters, brigs, brigantines, luggers, feluccas, galleys, xebecs, barques and their ultimate development in the clipper ships. Earlier they were also known as dispatch boats, but the service was also provided by privateers during time of war, and on occasion chartered private yachts. News of \\"record passages\\" was eagerly awaited by the public, and the craft's captain and crew were often celebrated in the press. Behind this search for sailing faster than the wind however lay the foundations for a development in naval architecture and its science which would serve until the appearance of the steam vessels. In 1863, during the Civil War, the packet boat Marshall carried the body of Confederate General Stonewall Jackson from Lynchburg to his home in Lexington, Virginia for burial.Deborah Fitts, \\"Hull of Packet Boat That Carried Jackson's Body Is Protected\\" , Civil War News, Jan 2007, accessed 22 Nov 2008 ===Canal packet boats=== The American canal packet boats were typically narrow (about 14 feet) to accommodate canals, but might be 70–90 feet long. When the Erie Canal opened in New York state in 1825 along the Mohawk River, demand quickly rose for travelers to be accommodated. Canal packet boats included cabin space for up to 60 passengers. Unlike European and American sailing vessels, that sought to attain greater speed under sail, the canal packet boats were drawn through the Erie Canal by teams of two or three horses or mules. Compared to overland travel, the boats cut journey time in half and were much more comfortable. Travelers could get from New York City to Buffalo in ten days, with a combination of sailing and packet boats. Some passengers took the boats to see both the Erie Canal and the natural landscapes. Significantly, thousands of others used packet boats to emigrate to Ohio and other parts of the Midwest. These boats were also instrumental in the settling of and travel within Upstate New York through the branch canals such as the Chenango Canal. Packet boats were also popular along the James River and Kanawha Canal in Virginia, allowing travel beyond the falls upriver. ==Mail steamer== An 1825 book plate depicting a typical packet boat Mail steamers were steamships which carried the mail across waterways, such as across an ocean or between islands, primarily during the 19th century and early 20th century, when the cost of sending a letter was declining to the point an ordinary person could afford the cost of sending a letter across great distances. In addition to carrying mail, most mail steamers carried passengers or cargo since the revenue from the mail service, if any, was insufficient by itself to pay for the cost of its travel. However, the advantage for a steamship carrying mail was that its arrival would be advertised in advance in the newspapers, thus giving it \\"free advertising\\" as a travel option for passengers or cargo. In most cases, mail carried by mail steamers was delivered to the post office to which it was addressed. In some cases, the incoming mail would be advertised in the local newspaper for pickup at the post office or at the steamship's office for a fee, if not already fee- paid. Occasionally, because of political instability when a post office could not provide normal services, incoming mail from a mail steamer would be delivered to a local delivery service, which would deliver the mail and charge the addressee an extra fee for the service. When this occurred, the local delivery service would place its own local service stamp or mark on the envelope when the extra fee was paid. === Universal Postal Union regulations === Mail carried by these steamers – sometimes known as paquebot mail – was subject to various regulations by the governments involved as well as the Universal Postal Union's (UPU) regulations stated at the UPU Vienna Conference of 1891. ==Aircraft namesake== The C-82 Packet twin-engined, twin-boom cargo aircraft designed and built by Fairchild Aircraft was named as a tribute to the packet boat. It was used by the United States Army Air Forces and the successor United States Air Force following World War II. ==Gallery== File:Women's Royal Naval Service- Wrens With the Fleet Mail, England, UK, November 1944 D22595.jpgWrens of the British Fleet Mail load the packet boat to deliver letters and parcels to the men on board ships moored nearby File:Mailboat.Hjortøbo.jpgPacket boat Hjortø in the harbour of Svendborg, Denmark File:Inishbofin mail boat, Dun Aengus at sea, August 1994 - Flickr - sludgegulper.jpgThe Dun Aengus Mail boat sailing from Cleggan to Inishbofin, Ireland File:RochesterCanal RochesterNY.jpgPacket boats on the Genesee River, with the Rochester skyline in the background, USA File:Mailboat on Skaneateles Lake from Clift Park.jpgThe Skaneateles Lake mailboat docked at Clift Park in Skaneateles, New York, USA ==See also== * Allan Line Royal Mail Steamers * Black Ball Line (trans-Atlantic packet) * Postal history * Royal Mail Ship * Pony Express *Ocean liner * TPO and Seapost Society for all collectors of Rail and Ship Mail worldwide ==References== * Service (Mail) * Steamer Service * Postal Matters * Arrival of the Mail! ==External links== * Paquebot mail begins at sea, postmarked on land * Glossary of Stamp Collecting Terms * Alaska Mail Service: the Mail Steamer Elsie * By the 1930s a method of signalling the impending arrival of a mail steamer at Aden was still needed ===Photographs and pictures=== *Woodcut print *1875 photo of Olive, canal freighter *Driver and team Category:Packet (river transport) Category:Age of Sail Category:Postal history Category:Steamships nl:Paquebot-stempel ru:Корабельная почта ","title":"Packet boat"},{"id":"20378556","text":"Luis Antonio (\\"Wito\\") Morales CrespoWito Morales Park.

It encrusted gastropod shells inhabited by hermit crabs of the genus Paguristes. The Psammoactinia colony began with a larva landing on a small gastropod shell.

Nowadays, the Latin-American Bibliography is composed by the following databases: CLASE (Latin-American Citations in Social Sciences and Humanities); PERIODICA (Index of Latin-American Journals in Science); Latindex (Regional Co-operative Information System for Scholarly Journals from Latin America, the Caribbean, Spain and Portugal). These databases were created by a group of information professionals, who identified the need to register, preserve and give access to the Latin-American knowledge published in the main academic journals of the region. Within UNAM, the fostering institution of these information products was the Science and Humanities Information Center (CICH) created in 1971. For the size of its collection of Latin-American journals, for the quantity of compiled records and for the duration and consistency of the project, the Latin-American Bibliography produced in the UNAM constitutes one of the most valuable resources for scholars and experts specializing in Latin-American affairs. ==Products== Three databases are available through the web site of UNAM’s General Directorate for Libraries General Directorate for Libraries: CLASE (Latin-American Citations in Social Sciences and Humanities). Bibliographical database, with more than 280,000 records, of which nearly 14,000 provide abstracts and links to the full text of the documents. It includes more than 1,400 journals specializing in Social Sciences, Humanities and Arts, from more than 20 countries of Latin America and the Caribbean. Documents not available in full text can be retrieved through the Document Supply Service of the Latin-American Serials Collection (Hemeroteca Latinoamericana) of the DGB. Direct link: CLASE website PERIODICA (Index of Latin-American Journals in Science). Bibliographical database with more than 315,000 records, of which near 60,000 provide abstracts and links to the full text of the documents.

Direct link: PERIODICA website Latindex (Regional Co-operative Information System for Scholarly Journals from Latin America, the Caribbean, Spain and Portugal). This initiative provides relevant information and data of the scholarly journals edited in the Iberoamerican region. Three databases are produced through the collaborative work of the member institutions: Directory,: with more than 17,000 records; Catalogue, with more than 3,500 selected journals that fulfill international quality criteria and an Index of Electronic Journals, offering nearly 3,000 links to available resources in full text. Direct link: Latindex website Currently, the Department of Latin-American Bibliography contributes to the production of two other Latin-American information products: ASFA (Aquatic Sciences and Fisheries Abstracts). Bibliographical international database on Aquatic Sciences and Fisheries, covering subject areas such as technology and administration of the marine environments and its resources (salt and sweet waters), including its socioeconomic and juridical aspects. It offers abstracts of articles published in approximately 7,000 periodic publications, besides thesis, monographs and other not conventional literature. The contribution relative to the Mexican journals is produced in the Department of Latin-American Bibliography from 1981. Link: ASFA website SciELO Mexico (Scientific Electronic Library Online). Open access electronic journals collection that includes a selection of the most recognized academic publications of the country in all areas of knowledge, previously selected accordingly to the most accepted criteria related to content and editorial standards. Currently it offers the full text of more than 2,500 articles from 28 academic Mexican journals. Direct link: Scielo México website Over the time, other databases were produced by the Department of Latin-American Bibliography during its more than 30 years of existence, namely: BLAT (Latin- American Bibliography I and II), with information compiled from international sources, mainly documents from Latin-American origin (produced by Latin American authors and institutions) or those in which their object of study was related to the region. The database ceased in 1997. Another one was MEXINV, as a subset of CLASE, offered bibliographical records of documents relative only to Mexico. This database ceased in the decade of the nineties. ===Institution=== Currently, the databases described above are produced by the Department of Latin-American Bibliography, part of the Assistant Office for Information Services of the General Directorate for Libraries (DGB) of the National Autonomous University of Mexico (UNAM). The original databases (BLAT, CLASE, PERIODICA, MEXINV and Latindex) were created by the Science and Humanities Information Center (CICH). Since the incorporation of the CICH to UNAM’s General Directorate for Libraries in 1997, this institution acts as Responsible Editor. ==References== *Alonso Gamboa, José Octavio.

Looney Tunes animated cartoon directed by Friz Feleng. The short was released on February 22, 1958, and stars Tweety, Sylvester and Granny. Mel Blanc provides the voices of Sylvester (speaking in an Italian accent) and Tweety, and June Foray (uncredited) providing Granny's voice. == Synopsis == Tweety and Granny arrive at their hotel in Venice, Italy. From his cage on the balcony, Tweety looks down at the canal and thinks it is a flooded street and that there must be a lot of barber shops down there (because of the many red and white striped barber poles). As Tweety is singing “Santa Lucia” and strumming his mandolin in his cage, Sylvester spies him from his balcony across the canal. In haste, he runs out of the hotel with an open sandwich roll, and falls into the water. He climbs out and finds a canoe and starts rowing, but forgets to loosen it from the rope. After he cuts the rope, he sinks with the canoe. Sylvester then starts paddling in a rubber raft, but Tweety takes a slingshot and punctures it. The raft floats back to the dock with Sylvester as the air leaks out, and Sylvester removes the deflated raft from his hind quarters in disgust. Next, Sylvester tries to swing across the canal with a rope Tarzan-style, but lands in the water and straight into the gaping mouth of a hungry shark who resembles Dopey Dick from Rabbitson Crusoe. Sylvester wrestles his way out and swims hurriedly away. Then, using an electric fan and a balloon tied to his waist, Sylvester attempts to float his way across through the air, but he floats too high. Tweety, again using the slingshot, shoots Sylvester down from the sky. Sylvester dons a bathing cap as he is descending, but misses the water, landing on the sidewalk, next to Tweety and Granny's hotel as it turns out. He runs into the hotel and takes the elevator up to the floor of Granny and Tweety's room, but Granny and Tweety are leaving, so Sylvester goes back down the elevator, which takes him . . . into the water! As Tweety and Granny are taking a relaxing gondola ride along the canal, Sylvester is awaiting them on a bridge with a fishing rod. Sylvester hooks a passing speedboat, forcibly yanking him into the water. After a close call with a striped pole, Sylvester gets slammed into a low bridge, where there is a warning sign that reads, “Ducka You Head, Lowla Bridgeada”. Finally, as Sylvester is dining on a plate of spaghetti, he again hears Tweety singing “Santa Lucia” (he is out of his cage this time), and proceeds to hurl a strand of spaghetti like a lasso to catch Tweety. Nearly strangled, Tweety screams to Granny for help. Granny clutches Sylvester's noose of pasta and substitutes a mallet in Tweety's place. As Sylvester sucks the spaghetti into his mouth, he gets clobbered squarely in the head with the mallet, causing birds to appear uttering Tweety's trademark line: “I tawt I taw a puddytat!” (Ironically in this cartoon, Tweety never uses this line himself.) ==References External links == * Category:1958 films Category:1958 animated films Category:1950s American animated films Category:American films Category:American animated short films Category:Looney Tunes shorts Category:Animated films about cats Category:Animated films about birds Category:Films set in Venice Category:Short films directed by Friz Freleng Category:Films scored by Milt Franklyn ","title":"A Pizza Tweety Pie"},{"id":"20378804","text":"Sergio Zanatta is a Canadian former soccer player who earned three caps for the Canadian national side in 1968.

Princess Yelena \\"Hélène\\" Vasilyevna Kuragina () is a fictional character in Leo Tolstoy's 1869 novel War and Peace and its various cinematic adaptations. She is played by Anita Ekberg in the 1956 film, by Amber Gray in Natasha, Pierre & The Great Comet of 1812, and by Tuppence Middleton in the 2016 BBC miniseries. ==Biography== Hélène is described as being in her early to mid-twenties and is considered a great beauty. Within Petersburg society, she is considered very cultured and intelligent on account of her social graces, despite actually being quite vapid. Early in the novel, it is rumoured and later implied that Hélène has had an incestuous affair with her profligate brother, Anatole. After Pierre Bezukhov is legitimized as the heir to his father's title and fortune, Hélène's father, Prince Vasily Kuragin, arranges for the two of them to be married. Despite finding Pierre odd, Hélène goes through with the marriage for the sake of social and financial advantage. Pierre is at first thrilled to be married to such a beautiful woman, but he quickly sours on the match, especially after Hélène tells him she will never have children with him. Not long after they are married, Hélène has an affair with their houseguest, the crude but fearless soldier Dolokhov, who flaunts the romance. Pierre fights Dolokhov in a duel, and in a stroke of luck wins by wounding him. Pierre sinks into depression, losing all love for his wife. He leaves her and goes to St. Petersburg. Hélène begs him to maintain the marriage, which he does only for appearances, while she continues to engage in sexual affairs, most notably with Boris Drubetskoy. Continuing to pursue her social ambitions, she frequently hosts dinner parties for the elite, and her salon becomes extremely popular. Later, she conspires with Anatole to help him seduce Natasha Rostova, to whom Anatole is powerfully attracted. Late in the novel, Hélène forsakes the Russian Orthodox Church and adopts Catholicism, believing a large donation to the church will lead the pope to annul her union with Pierre so she can remarry. Soon afterward, Hélène falls ill due to pregnancy and dies; it is implied that she died from a drug overdose in an attempted abortion. ==ReferencesSee also== *List of characters in War and Peace Category:Characters in War and Peace Category:Fictional Russian people in literature Category:Female characters in literature Category:Literary characters introduced in 1869 ","title":"Hélène Kuragina"},{"id":"20379094","text":"Mohammad Qazi (born 23 April 1984) is a cricketer, born in Pakistan, who has played one Twenty20 International for Canada. ==References External links == *CricketArchive *Mohammad Qazi at ESPNcricinfo Category:1984 births Category:Living people Category:Canada Twenty20 International cricketers Category:Canadian cricketers Qazi Qazi Category:Canadian sportspeople of Pakistani descent ","title":"Mohammad Qazi"},{"id":"20379096","text":"Donegal tweed (an example of herringbone) Reversible camouflage HBTs Herringbone, also called broken twill weave, describes a distinctive V-shaped weaving pattern usually found in twill fabric.

It has been used, for example, to describe a tort for strict liability arising out of product liability, although this is typically simply called a 'tort'.See, e.g., Gilmore G. (1970). Products liability: a commentary. University of Chicago Law Review. Although it is not to be found in most legal dictionaries, it has been used by some scholars such as Sri Lankan Lakshman Marasinghe. Lakshman proposes that the doctrine provides legal relief that falls outside tort or contract, but with some of the characteristics of tort or contract, as can be found in restitution (including unjust enrichment),Pavey & Matthews Property v Paul (1987) 162 CLR 221 equity (including unconscionable conductCommercial Bank of Australia Limited v Amadio (1983) 151 CLR 447), beneficiaries under a trust of the benefit of a promise, people protected by the valid assignment of promise, fiduciary duty, and contracts of insurance.Trident General Insurance Co Ltd v.

It was founded by Gus C. Henderson and published its first issue on May 31, 1889. ==History== The Advocate was first published on May 31, 1889. It was one of only two black-owned newspapers in the state of Florida. It was also the only newspaper in Winter Park, and thus served both African-American and Euro-American readers. Henderson was the publisher, reporter, editor, salesman, and typesetter for the paper. On the first day of the Advocate’s publication, there was a large Emancipation Day celebration. For the celebration, the Orlando and Winter Park Railroad ran special trains and almost 800 people were in attendance for the event. The paper's offices were located in Hannibal Square, the heart of Winter Park's segregated black community. The Advocate sold for $1.25 for a year's subscription, and published for two years until Henderson moved to Orlando. ==G.C. Henderson== Henderson was born on November 16, 1862, in Columbia County, near Lake City. Before moving to Winter Park, Henderson was Florida’s first African-American traveling salesman. When that job did not work out, he moved to Winter Park. Shortly thereafter, Henderson started The Advocate. In his editorials, Henderson often focused on writing about education and voting rights for his fellow African Americans. He later started two other papers; the Christian Recorder and the Florida Record. Henderson died in 1915, at the age of 53. ==References Further reading == *Clark, James, Orlando Sentinel, February 6, 1990, p.

He was Information Minister of Dahomey (now Benin) from 1960 to 1963. ==Early life== Tévoédjrè was educated at Toulouse, Fribourg and Geneva. He taught at secondary schools at Cahors, Dakar and Porto-Novo before travelling to Paris to pursue a writing career. While in Paris he wrote L'Afrique révoltée in 1958 and Afrique debout in 1959. He also served as editor in chief of the left-wing newspaper L'Étudiant Noir. During this time he frequented left-wing circles to discuss political affairs. At these and various cultural conferences across Europe and Asia, he learned to speak German, English and Spanish, besides his native French.. Before Benin declared its independence, Tévoédjrè helped found the pro-independence organization Mouvement Africain de Libération Nationale and the Ligue pour la Promotion Africaine, as well as leading the Syndicat National des Ensignants du Dahomey. In February 1960, Tévoédjrè participated in a strike at the Technical College of Cotonou. The demonstrators requested to fire two professors who failed several students and had them expelled. ==Political career== In October 1960, Tévoédjrè applied for a government position. He received the job of administrative secretary of the Dahomeyan Unity Party (PDU). His first job was to announce that a group of people were to inform the uneducated about news from the government perspective. Those who were literate could read three government-sponsored newspapers: L'Aube Nouvelle, La Nation and La Depeche du Dahomey. Tévoédjrè had previously written columns for one of these, L'Aube Nouvelle. President Maga named the new ministers in his government on 30 December, and chose many leaders from the former RDD and PND. He also chose several relative newcomers, like Bertin Borna under the Labor and Civil Service, and Tévoédjrè, the new Information Minister.. At this position he began suspending the publication of Justin Ahomadegbé-Tomêtin's opposition newspaper, Dahomey-Matin, and its predecessor, Cotonou-Matin, in April 1961. This was in accordance with a law limiting the freedom of speech passed in February of that year.. On 26 May Tévoédjrè notified Maga that Ahomadégbé- Tomêtin had plotted to assassinate the president but he and 11 other dissidents had been arrested. The trial date was set for December. It differed from many political trials in Africa being that it was held in public and the defence was allowed a lawyer from Paris. In any event, Ahomadégbé-Tomêtin received five years for his role in the conspiracy, and the others were dealt from one- to ten-year sentences.. Maga ultimately released them in November 1962, saying in a broadcastIt is unclear what type of broadcast this was. that it was not only due to their good behavior in jail but also to reconcile with his former enemies.. Tévoédjrè convinced the Dahomeyan government to create an Agence Dahomennée de Presse to be led by him, and before the year was over he had access to the Agence France-Presse's wire services and a monopoly in Dahomeyan journalism. Another project of his was the construction of a museum to encompass all of Dahomey's art pieces. In July 1961, he was granted a 30-kilowatt transmitter, seven times more powerful than that owned by Radio Dahomey, by the Division of Information of the Company of Broadcasting of France of Overseas (SORAFOM). The Information Minister was named secretary- general of the African and Malagasy Union in November 1961. In the summer of 1963, Dahomey underwent much unrest over the death of deputy Daniel Dessou. On 28 October Chief of Staff of the 800-man Dahomeyan Army Christophe Soglo took control of the country. to prevent a civil war. He dismissed the cabinet, dissolved the Assembly, suspended the constitution and banned any type of demonstrations.. No longer a member of Beninese politics, in 1964 Tévoédjrè was appointed to work at the International Affairs Center at Harvard University. In 1991, he was a presidential candidate and placed third with over 14% of the vote. Tévoédjrè died on 6 November 2019 in Porto-Novo at the age of 89. ==NotesReferencesBibliography== * . * . * .

It includes the hamlet of Bonwen. It is situated near the River Dee, under Berwyn range. About 1150, it was ruled by the Maer Du or \\"Black Mayor of Rhug\\" and later became part of the lands of the barons of Edeirnion (see Hughes of Gwerclas) who ruled from Gwerclas Castle. ==History== Rhug manor house, c.1778 The Lordship of Rhug contained the townships of Aber Alwen in the ecclesiastical parish of Corwen, which is where the manor house of Rhug was situated. It was apparently at Rhug that King Gruffudd ap Cynan was staying when he was betrayed by Meirion Goch of Llŷn, in 1080. Hugh Lupus, Earl of Chester and Hugh, Earl of Salop, hearing that the prince was at Rhug came with a group of soldiers under the pretence of visiting him. Meirion Goch persuaded Gruffudd to go with a small guard to meet them, not knowing of the kidnapping plot by the earls, and was seized and carried off to Chester Castle. He was kept there for twelve years in chain and irons. The guards that accompanied Gruffudd were likewise taken prisoners, and after having been barbarously treated, and their right-hand thumbs cut off, were then allowed to go free. It was said that Owain Brogyntyn resided at Rhug after he became Lord of Dinmael and Edeirnion, and the lordship of Rhug devolved to the descendants of Bleddyn, Lord of Dinmael, the second son of Owain Brogyntyn. Margaret Wen, lady of Rhug, the sole daughter and heiress of Ieuan ap Howel ap Rhys, Lord of Rhug, married Piers Salusbury of Bachymbyd.The History of the Princes, the Lords Marcher, and the Ancient Nobility of Powys Fadog ==Rhug Chapel== Rhug Chapel. part of remarkable interior Rhug wall panels Colonel William Salisbury (1580-1660), affectionately known as \\"Old Blue Stockings\\", was a colourful character famed for his part as a Royalist in the defence of Denbigh Castle in the English Civil War. Although a warrior in early years, he later became a successful writer of Welsh verse and noted for his “high church” views. In 1637 he had a private chapel built in collaboration with Bishop William Morgan, who was sympathetic to Salisbury’s views and the first translator of the Bible into Welsh. The resulting private chapel, dedicated to The Holy Trinity, is quite plain and unremarkable to external view. A small construction in stone, a simple nave/chancel with access through a timber arched door at the west end of the church into an extremely small porch, and a door and porch at the north chancel wall for the use of the minister. Above the west door is a single external bell. The chapel is set in pretty woodland some quarter mile from the busy A5 junction at Ty'n-y-cefn and maintained since 1990 by Cadw (a Welsh word meaning “to keep”, the historic environment service of the Welsh Assembly Government).http://www.cadw.wales.gov.uk/ On buying a joint ticket to see this chapel with the ancient church at Llangar, some three miles away, the visitor will assume that the chapel is as plain inside as out but nothing could be further from the truth. On passage through the heavy oak west door the visitor enters a very small porch with barely enough room for two people before a second timber door. On the right a wall holds a bell rope and to the left is a timber staircase leading through a quarter landing to the right and to the gallery. Taking the stairs will afford the visitor a remarkable view of a church so ornate and richly adorned to be completely in contrast to the plain exterior. Immediately and closely visible is the rood roof ornately decorated throughout with intertwining rose motifs. Wall panels are intricately carved and painted, elaborately carved and painted angels adorn the walls the colours bright and clear. (See Gallery).http://www.llangollen.com/rug.html The nave is separated from the chancel with a low rood screen of sturdy and ornately carved construction. Each window is finished with bright stained glass, of different ages, and with different depictions. The pews are built of oak and the aisle ends of the pews are, unusually, finished with huge oak timber scalloped plinth which are richly carved with beasts and birds.http://www.coflein.gov.uk/en/site/43855/details/HOLY+TRINITY+CHAPEL%3BRUG+CHAPEL%2C+DYFFRYN+EDEIRNION/ Large chandeliers provided the lighting and are supported on long iron rods from the roof. The nave is simple in contrast. The north wall bears a large painting of a memori morte, a recumbent skeleton designed to remind the congregation of their own mortality. Aart from the altar itself and tiled sanctuary, installed in the late nineteenth or early twentieth centuries, all here is original despite the Protestant Reformation. Outside the chapel, some 30 yards west of the West Door, is a pillar on a double stone base that appears to be a town or market cross though there is no obvious evidence of a settlement in this area and the chapel was built many centuries after such crosses were normally erected. To the north of the West Door is a circular iron railing protecting memorial stones to the Wynn family. Inside the church is a memorial to Robert Vaughan of the estate of Nannau near Llanfachreth in Wales. He had interests in Rhug and oversaw restoration of the chapel with great sympathy to the original intent. Vaughan, in 1854, remodelled the exterior bell tower and windows yet left the interior virtually untouched despite the requirements of the recent restoration. The pews, however, were widened and provided with backs though finished in a colour and style similar to that of the original Neo-Jacobean. It is thanks to Robert Vaughan that we are able to glimpse the magnificence of a virtually untouched pre-Reformation church interior. ==Gallery== File:Rhug solid pew ends.JPGRhug solid timber pew ends File:Rhug East Window.JPGRhug East Window File:Rhug window.JPGRhug window File:Rhug Ancient Cross and 17th C Chapel.JPGRhug Ancient Cross File:Rhug Chapel.JPGRhug Chapel File:Rhug Wynn family memorials.JPGRhug Wynn family memorials ==References== ;Sources *The History of the Princes, the Lords Marcher, and the Ancient Nobility of Powys Fadog, and the Ancient Lords of Arwystli, Cedewen, and Meirionydd and Many of the Descendants of the Fifteen Noble Tribes of Gwynedd, 1887, London, by Jacob Youde William Lloyd ==External links== *Rhug Estate *Rûg Chapel Category:Villages in Denbighshire Category:History of Wales Category:Medieval Wales Category:Corwen ","title":"Rhug"},{"id":"20379317","text":"\\"Cougars\\" is the seventh episode of the second season of 30 Rock, and the twenty-eighth episode overall. It was written by co-executive producer John Riggi and directed by Michael Engler. Guest stars in this episode include Laura Berrios, Kevin Brown, Grizz Chapman, Val Emmich, Alan H. Green, Ian Hyland, John Lutz, Sean Moran, Maulik Pancholy, Ralph Peavy, Greg Scarnici, Blake Tyler Benitez and Mark Viera. In this episode, Liz Lemon (played by Tina Fey) goes on a date with a young, twenty-year-old coffee delivery man named Jamie (Val Emmich). The date gets awkward due to the seventeen-year age difference between Liz and Jamie. This feeling escalates when Liz meets Jamie's mother (Laura Berrios). Jenna Maroney (Jane Krakowski) gets a younger boyfriend of her own. Frank Rossitano (Judah Friedlander) develops a crush on Jamie. Meanwhile, Jack Donaghy (Alec Baldwin) helps Tracy Jordan (Tracy Morgan) to coach a Little League Baseball team. == Plot == Liz develops a crush on Jamie, the new twenty-year-old coffee delivery man, and after some initial hesitation, she agrees to go on a date with him. Before the date, Liz gets cold feet, but she is encouraged to attend by Jenna, who declares Liz a cougar, a term describing \\"hot older ladies pouncing on their young prey\\". Liz agrees and goes on a successful date with Jamie; the pair agree to go on a second date. Prior to this second date, Liz goes to Jamie's apartment only to discover that Jamie still lives with his mother, who looks exactly like Liz. Frank begins to question his sexuality when he realizes that he has a crush on Jamie. He even tries to, unsuccessfully, rival Liz to go on a date with Jamie. Later, Frank realizes that the only man he is attracted to is Jamie and decides that he is in fact not gay. In order to become a cougar herself, Jenna starts to date Aidan, a teenage freshmen at New York University. Jenna breaks up with Aidan when he starts to annoy her by wearing heelies and playing portable video games and acting like Jenna is his mother. Tracy is ordered to do community service in the form of coaching the Knuckle Beach Little League Baseball Team. Knuckle Beach happens to be \\"the worst neighborhood in New York\\". Hoping to inspire the team, Jack agrees to help Tracy and he donates uniforms to the team on behalf of the Sheinhardt Wig Company which is NBC's fictitious parent company. Jack replaces Tracy with Kenneth Parcell (Jack McBrayer) because he realizes that even with the newfound inspiration from both Jack and Tracy, the team is still failing. The team begins to revolt when they find out that Tracy has been fired. To counter this, Jack forms a coalition with Tracy and they replace members of the team with Grizz and Dot Com (Grizz Chapman and Kevin Brown). == Production == Scenes for this episodes were primarily filmed on October 5, 2007 Save Picture as → Right click file → Properties → Summary → Advanced → Date Picture Taken Save Picture as → Right click file → Properties → Summary → Advanced → Date Picture Taken at Silvercup Studios in Long Island City, Queens, New York. During the commercial breaks in this episode, commercials for American Express were aired featuring 30 Rock cast members, who were in character. These commercials featured Kenneth giving out \\"Secret Rodney\\" Christmas gifts to various other 30 Rock characters. The commercials were aired in order to deter viewers, who were viewing the episode with Digital Video Recorders, from fast-forwarding through the commercial break. The title of this episode, \\"Cougars\\", refers to a phrase from pop culture. The word cougar means an \\"older women who date younger men.\\" In the episode, Jenna calls both herself and Liz \\"cougars\\" due to them both dating younger men. While speaking about his appearance on 30 Rock, Val Emmich, who played Jamie in this episode, said that he was initially \\"intimidated by [Tina Fey] more than anyone else [he'd] acted alongside.\\" When asked if acting with Fey on 30 Rock taught him anything, he replied that he learnt \\"that normal people can be in this business.\\" He described Fey as \\"witty, smart [and] sexy\\". == Reception == \\"Cougars\\" was watched by 5.8 million viewers and it received a 2.5 rating and a 6 share in the 18–49 demographic. The 2.5 refers to 2.5% of all 18- to 49-year-olds in the U.S., and the 6 refers to 6% of all 18- to 49-year-olds watching television in the U.S. at the time of the broadcast. The episode ranked in first place, among men aged between 18–34, against all television being broadcast in the same timeslot. By comparison, CBS's Survivor: China was watched by 13.8 million viewers, a repeat of ABC's Ugly Betty was viewed by 6.5 million viewers and Fox's Are You Smarter Than A 5th Grader? was watched by 9.0 million viewers. Bob Sassone of TV Squad felt that the best storyline was the one featuring Tracy and Jack because of the \\"Bush/Iraq metaphors and the sight of Alec Baldwin dressed as General MacArthur, standing beneath a 'Fun Accomplished' sign.\\" Robert Canning of IGN thought that the best storyline of the episode was centered on Liz and Jamie, and rated the episode 8 out of 10. Matt Webb Mitovich of TV Guide wrote that this episode \\"had so many fun lines\\", and found himself \\"giggling, chuckling and LOLing like a fool\\". He liked \\"the 'cougars' storyline\\", saying it \\"was a lot of fun, because Liz is best when Liz is feeling awkward.\\" Jeff Labrecque of Entertainment Weekly wrote that \\"Jenna's Amber Alert affair with the soda-drinking, Heelys-gliding teenager\\" was \\"priceless\\". He also compared the interplay between Frank and Jamie to the relationship between Michael Scott (Steve Carell) and Ryan Howard (B. J. Novak) of The Office. == References  External links == * * Category:2007 American television episodes Category:30 Rock (season 2) episodes Category:American LGBT-related television episodes ","title":"Cougars (30 Rock)"},{"id":"20379334","text":"Ganga is a 2006 Indian Bhojpuri-language film directed by Abhishek Chhadha and produced by Deepak Sawant.

It was released worldwide in February 2007 by American label Perris Records, and was produced, engineered and mixed by Arild Aardalen. The album presents a sound that combines the melodic hard rock and AOR of the 1980s with a more modern power and symphonic metal influence, and has been hailed as being an original take on the genres.See the band's official website for comprehensive list of reviews. The lyrics deal with the concept of space travel and the future of mankind as a space travelling species, and represent the science-fiction influences that have become a Keldian trademark. Some reviewers have commented on how this sees the band escaping the Dungeons & Dragons straitjacket that seems to trap many artists in this genre of music. The band have cited the authors Peter F. Hamilton and Dan Simmons as being among their prime influences. It is also possible to detect spiritual, and maybe even religious, undertones to Keldian's lyrics, although this is also a regular feature in the science-fiction literature they seem to draw on.

Founder, Henry S. Belden (July 4, 1840 – April 21, 1921), chartered the company in Canton, Ohio as the 'Diebold Fire Brick Company' in 1885 on the Belden farm. The Belden Family belongs to the Weatherhead School of Management Family Business Hall of Fame at Case Western Reserve and the Company is one of the largest family owned brick manufacturers in the U.S. ==History== * Henry S. Belden was born in Canton on July 4, 1840, the son of Judge G.W. Belden. Henry became an attorney in the law firm of Belden & McKinley, of which Judge G.W. Belden was the senior partner. According to the biography of William McKinley by Margaret Leech, she describes McKinley’s visit to Canton in 1867, armed with a letter of introduction to Judge G.W. Belden, as the Belden law firm was well known in legal circles. William McKinley was accepted as a partner and then went on to become a US Congressman, Governor of Ohio and was elected President of the United States in 1896. * Henry S Belden also entered politics and was elected Mayor of Canton. At the age of 32 a severe throat infection forced him to move to the Belden farm with the hope that the open air would improve his health, which it eventually did. On the farm, Henry discovered large deposits of coal, shale and clay. He built a small kiln to study the effects of firing temperatures on clay and shale. In 1874 he invented the Belden burner, made of clay, which gave better light than any other type then in use. He held a total of 13 patents for gasoline vapor street lights. He secured a large number of contracts for lighting cities and towns all across the United States. * In 1876 Henry went to the Centennial Exposition in Philadelphia and there saw the original stiff mud brick making machine. He became inspired to make paving and fire brick. Henry’s paving brick was the first known use of paving brick in the city of Canton. Brick pavements then spread quickly throughout the county and state. * In 1885, Henry S. Belden established the Diebold Fire Brick Company near Canton in Stark County, OH. * In August 1895, stockholders of the Diebold Fire Brick Company incorporated the Canton Pressed Brick Company as the successor company to the Diebold Fire & Brick Company. Officers of the new company included: Henry S. Belden, President; C.J. Diebold, Vice President; James G. Barbour, Secretary/Treasurer; S.J. Allen, Superintendent. The first annual meeting of the Canton Pressed Brick Company was held in 1896. * In 1904 Paul Belden, Henry’s youngest son, returned to Canton to assist his father as the company was in dire financial straits. Paul's friend, P.D. Hardy went along to see if his own business experience might be helpful. They arrived in Canton in 1904 and began to pick up the ruins of the Canton Pressed Brick Company. * In 1909, Paul Belden was authorized to obtain any capital needed to operate the business. Paul Belden met with L. B. Hartung, a well known plumbing contractor in Canton. Mr. Belden was successful in persuading Mr. Hartung to invest money in capital stock of the Canton Pressed Brick Company. L.B. Hartung became an important shareholder owning about 30% of the capital stock. * By 1912 Paul Belden had successfully raised enough capital to fund the company. The Company included operations now in Canton and Perry County, Ohio referred to as the Somerset Plant. Operations were consolidated operating under one company, The Belden Brick Company. * Between 1909 and 1920 Paul Belden encouraged a philosophy of automation. In addition, the Company acquired an additional brick making operation in Uhrichsville, OH, a majority interest in the Belden Face Brick Company (also founded by Henry Belden), and built two new kilns. * In March 1930, The Belden-Stark Brick Company of Detroit was incorporated as a joint venture of The Belden Brick Company and Stark Ceramics Inc. for the purpose of promoting and distributing Belden Brick and Stark Ceramic products in the Detroit area. This was followed in June 1930 by the incorporation of The Belden-Stark Brick Corporation of New York to do the same thing in the New York metropolitan area. These two subsidiary companies were to play a large part in the promotion of clay products and in obtaining architectural specifications for The Belden Brick Company. * In 1946, Belden acquired the plants of the Finzer Brothers Company in Sugarcreek, OH in Tuscarawas County, OH. * In 1957, Plant 6 was built in Sugarcreek, OH. * In 1968, Plant 8 was built in Sugarcreek, OH and was the largest brick plant ever built under one roof. * In 1970, Plant 1 in Canton was closed down and Belden brickmaking in Canton ceased while the corporate headquarters remained. * In 1973, The Belden Brick Company acquired the assets, properties and manufacturing facilities of the Moomaw Brothers at Sugarcreek, OH.

It was adapted by screenwriter John Mortimer from the 1961 novel The Ballad of the Running Man by Shelley Smith. It was filmed in San Roque, Cádiz, Spain, Gibraltar and Ireland. The film opened at the Odeon Leicester Square in London's West End on 1 August 1963.The Times, 1 August 1963, Page 2 Lee Remick and Alan Bates co-starred with Harvey. The film briefly came to the attention of the Warren Commission investigating the assassination of President John F. Kennedy because of a viral marketing campaign that placed personal ads in the Dallas Morning News asking the \\"Running Man\\" to please call \\"Lee\\". Investigators thought that these might be coded messages placed by assassin Lee Harvey Oswald until they discovered the source of the advertisements. In Hollywood, an urban legend arose claiming that the film was a flop because it starred actors named Lee and Harvey. == Plot == In Croydon, England, seemingly grieving Stella Black (Lee Remick) has just returned home from her husband's memorial service. Apparently, he died in a gliding accident, and his body was never recovered. In reality, she knows her husband Rex Black (Laurence Harvey) is still alive and has been in hiding at a seaside boarding house for three months under the assumed name of Erskine, between the time of his \\"death\\" and the memorial service. He has just clandestinely returned home following the memorial service. They are perpetrating this ruse to collect on the £50,000 life insurance money from the Excelsior Insurance Company. They feel Excelsior owes them this money as, in the previous year, Excelsior did not pay out a £20,000 business insurance claim when his aeroplane, which he used to operate his own transport company, went down in bad weather on a flight to Hamburg, West Germany, and was destroyed. His insurance had lapsed by two days due to an error in not paying the latest premium – Rex admitting that it may have been his error - which in turn ruined his business. Rex is close to being spotted at the house when Excelsior agent Stephen Maddox (Alan Bates) stops by unexpectedly to discuss details of the claim with Stella, most specifically confirmation from her that Rex's death was not suicide over his business failure. The next phase of the plan is for Rex to fly to Paris immediately. Stella is to collect the insurance money and have it deposited in a bank account in Málaga, Spain, where she will be emigrating. She is then to take out a specific ad in The Daily Telegraph, which is code in informing Rex that all has been accomplished. Three days later, she is to fly to Málaga, where he will meet her. In Málaga, Rex is able to steal the passport of a drunken Jim Jerome, an Australian sheep farmer, and doctor it to make it look as his own. Rex has now taken the identity of Jerome, complete with facial hair, dyed blond hair, and an Australian accent, for the remainder of his stay in Málaga. Stella arrives in Málaga, and meets up with Rex and his new group of international friends who only know him as sheep farmer Jim Jerome. They believe Stella is his casual widowed girlfriend, whom he met while on recent previous travels to London. At the bank, Rex and Stella convert the insurance money into a bank draft which can be cashed anywhere in the world. This process will take one week. In the meantime, they are to simulate slowly moving into a more committed relationship, which Stella does not like because Rex is staying with his international friends, which include some beautiful women. Stella also admits that she does not like \\"Jerome\\" and by association what it looks Rex has become, a man doing anything for money. Rex implies that he is in the process of another insurance scam where Jerome will die a premature death, allowing them to collect further life insurance money. A British man who Stella recognises but can't remember approaches her. He eventually divulges that he is Excelsior's agent, Stephen Maddox, who states he is in Málaga on holiday. He asks her out for dinner which she declines. Stella believes Stephen is a sweet lonely man who just wanted company with someone he had previously met, while Rex believes his arrival is too coincidental, and that he is looking for evidence as to their insurance fraud. After an argument, they agree to get away from Stephen by spending the week in a town down the coast until the bank draft is completed. Rex and Stella get settled there, when Stephen arrives. Stephen notices Rex by the car he saw Stella previously drive. Rex does not immediately recognise Stephen until Stella arrives on the scene, introducing Stephen to \\"Jim Jerome\\". Then, Rex decides to keep Stephen close so that they can find out exactly how much he knows or suspects. If and when Stephen reveals that he knows too much, they will deal with him at that time in the appropriate manner. The immediate issue is for Stella to get another room, as they aren't supposed to be that close yet. Rex believes that in simulating only a casual relationship between the two of them, Stephen might be more willing to open up to her. Rex's plan places a further wedge between himself and Stella, who just wants to be with her husband. Stella and Rex spend more time with Stephen and find that he asks a lot of questions about their lives, and secretly writes notes in a little notebook. Stephen takes a photograph of them, which Rex believes he wants as evidence for the insurance company. Believing that, Rex \\"accidentally\\" drops the camera in the water. Rex gives Stella the task of trying to get a look at Stephen's notebook. During their day together, Stella almost lets slip to Stephen that Rex and Jerome are the same person. Seeing Stephen's room door ajar and knowing he is not inside, Stella sneaks in and tries to find his notebook. Stephen catches her in his room before she can read the notebook's contents, and Stella implies that she was in his room to seduce him. They make love. After their lovemaking session, Stephen tells her among other things that he no longer works for the insurance company, and that what he writes in his notebook are musings about his travels, which he shows her. She now realises that he knows nothing about their scam and that his interest in them is purely as a man wanting a woman. She is so relieved that once again, with her guard down, she lets slip that Jerome is Rex, but is able to cover up her mistake. When Rex returns from Málaga, he first runs into Stephen, who talks as if he knows what's going on with their scam without actually saying so. Thinking that Stephen does know, Rex later tells Stella that their new plan, with no more scams, is to ditch Stephen by leaving first thing in the morning before he awakens, and crossing the border into Gibraltar. Relieved that there will be no more scams, Stella does not tell Rex what she has found out about Stephen. The next morning, Stephen, awake and alone in his bed, finds one of Stella's expensive earrings in the bed. Hearing a noise outside, he gets up and sees Rex and Stella driving off in their car. He rushes off in order to return Stella's earring. He catches up to them at a roadblock in town. Stella initially believes Stephen has come for her, but Stephen shows Stella the earring. She thinks this could get her into trouble with Rex if he finds out. Stephen is unable to return the earring before Rex returns. Rex, seeing Stephen, is angry, as he still believes Stephen is after them. Rex tells Stephen to meet him and Stella for a drink further up the mountain. With Stephen following the pair in his own car along the winding mountain road, Rex tries to run Stephen off the road and over the cliff. Rex, seeing Stephen's car go off the road, believes he has been successful. Stella is horrified. Two road workers witness the event, and are able to save Stephen, who believes Rex tried to run him off the road out of jealousy. Rex, with a hysterical Stella as his passenger, drives off toward the Gibraltar border. They are questioned at border patrol. The police, who have reached Stephen in the mountain, alert border patrol to stop Rex and Stella. When Rex figures out what is going on, he notices that Stella has run off into the crowd with the bank draft. He jumps back into the car and drives off into the crowd chasing after her. Rex eventually catches up with Stella in a crowded church. She tells Rex that Stephen had become only a paint salesman who was not onto their scam, leading Rex to the realisation that all his machinations were unnecessary. He tries to get the bank draft from her. She replies that he will never be able to cash the draft as the authorities everywhere will know he killed Stephen, thanks to Stephen's having her insured earring in his possession. Incensed, Rex tries to strangle Stella out of jealousy. He stops as he realises what he is doing. When the police arrive, Rex drives off while the police take Stella into custody. At the police station, Stella is surprised to see Stephen there, alive. Stephen refuses to press charges against either Rex or Stella, still believing Rex acted out of jealousy. Stella continues the ruse as she tells Stephen that she told \\"Jerome\\" about their tryst. Meanwhile, Rex drives to an aerodrome and steals a plane. However, he is unaware of a leak in the fuel line. The plane runs out of fuel mid-air and crashes into the sea. Rex is pulled out of the water, barely alive, and returned to the Spanish dock, where Stella and the police are waiting. As Rex dies, Stella still continues the ruse, stating to the police that he is Jim Jerome, an Australian man she barely knew. His last words express his regret that “Jim Jerome wasn’t insured.” ==Cast== * Laurence Harvey as Rex Black * Lee Remick as Stella Black * Alan Bates as Stephen Maddox * Felix Aylmer as Parson * Eleanor Summerfield as Hilda Tanner * Allan Cuthbertson as Jenkins * Noel Purcell as Miles Bleeker * Ramsay Ames as Madge Penderby * Fernando Rey as Police Official * Eddie Byrne as Sam Crewdson * Colin Gordon as Solicitor * John Meillon as Jim Jerome * Roger Delgado as Spanish Doctor ==Original novel== The Ballad of the Running Man was published in 1961.

Scheuer praised the film, writing: \\"Columbia's 'The Running Man' is my idea of an almost perfect motion picture — on-edge anxiety, unpredictable surprises, all astonishingly logical; and always a developing sense of characterization, so that — in contrast to the celebrated Mr. Hitchcock's chases — the final bitterly ironic twist leaves one actually moved with pity and a feeling of loss.\\" ==Awards== Cinematographer Robert Krasker — one of Carol Reed's favorites — was nominated for the BAFTA colour cinematography award. ==ReferencesCategory:1963 films Category:1963 crime drama films Category:British films Category:British aviation films Category:British crime drama films Category:Columbia Pictures films Category:English-language films Category:Films about identity theft Category:Films based on British novels Category:Films based on crime novels Category:Films directed by Carol Reed Category:Films scored by William Alwyn Category:Films set in Spain Category:Films set in London Category:Films shot in Gibraltar Category:Films shot in Spain Category:1963 drama films ","title":"The Running Man (1963 film)"},{"id":"20379631","text":"M.

Cunningham appeared first in the University match against Cambridge University at Fenners early in June, made 6 not out, his highest score, and took two catches and a stumping.

It is the parish church of Crawley, and is the oldest building in the town centre, dating from the 1250—although many alterations have been made since, and only one wall remains of the ancient building. In September 2017, a team from St Peter’s Brighton began a new phase in the life of St John’s Crawley. St John's offer a variety of services, traditional and informal, contemporary services. St John’s is a Holy Trinity Brompton (HTB) network church. The HTB vision is to play a part in the evangelisation of the nation, the revitalisation of the church and the transformation of society. For the church in Crawley, the vision is to Love Jesus, Love Church, Love People and Love Crawley. ==History== In the Norman era, Slaugham and Cuckfield were the most important places in the north of the county of Sussex. When Crawley first started to develop as a village in the 13th century, it was in the parish of Slaugham in the Hundred of Buttinghill (hundreds were ancient divisions of land covering several parishes). As the new village was distant from the parish church at Slaugham (St Mary's), several miles south, a stone church was built as a chapel of ease. It is known to have existed before 1267, when it was passed on in a will, and it was still the daughter church of Slaugham in 1291; but by the early 15th century it was referred to as a \\"free\\" church and a \\"permanent chantry\\". The parish of Crawley was therefore established separate from Slaugham at some point, probably by the end of the 14th century, and St John the Baptist's was regarded as its parish church by the time chantries were abolished in the 1540s. Crawley was a small, very narrow, split parish, and did not cover the whole of the village of Crawley: the boundary between it and the parish of Ifield—and between the Hundred of Buttinghill and the Hundred of Burbeach, in which Ifield lay—ran up the middle of the High Street. The detached part of Crawley parish consisted of heavily forested land and one farm near Pease Pottage. The total area of the parish was less than ; Ifield parish was six times larger, in contrast. The first additions to the structure came in the 15th century, when a tall tower was added at the western end, the windows in the nave were enlarged and a rood screen was installed between the chancel and the nave. The nave roof was also rebuilt at this time, and the earliest surviving memorial carvings and stones in the church are also 15th-century. By the 16th century, Crawley's development into a thriving market village meant that its parish was much more important than that of Slaugham, and the connection between their two churches was legally severed. At least 150 people regularly attended the church, but its income was modest and priests frequently moved on to richer parishes. The building fell into disrepair in the 17th and 18th centuries, although the four cracked bells in the tower were replaced by London bell-founder Thomas Lester in 1742. Lester cast dozens of bells for Sussex churches, and reused the metal from the old bells in his work at Crawley. Major changes took place in the 19th century. The tower partially rebuilt and heightened by 1814, although the original stone was reused. Some more work took place in 1845, but the greatest changes happened in 1879 and 1880. A new north aisle was added, a porch was built on the north side, the chancel was completely rebuilt and reordered, an organ chamber was built, and the bells were replaced by a new ring of eight bells, hung for change ringing, cast by Gillett, Bland & Company of Croydon. Nikolaus Pevsner has criticised the resulting appearance of the church, calling it \\"dully Victorian\\" and noting that its best feature is the unrestored 15th- century nave roof. The church's location just east of the High Street meant that it was very close to the boundary of Ifield parish. People who lived on or around the west side of the High Street would often attend St John the Baptist's although their parish church was St Margaret's. One such worshipper was Mark Lemon, founding editor of the satirical magazine Punch. Having adopted Crawley as his home town, he lived at Vine Cottage on the west side of the High Street, and regularly attended St John the Baptist's instead of St Margaret's. However, his substantial girth caused him problems: he had to sit in the gallery because there were no pews large enough to accommodate him in the nave. The church, graveyard and church walk are reportedly haunted a number of paranormal sightings have happened over the years. The churchyard contains the war graves of two soldiers of World War I and an airman of World War II. CWGC Cemetery report, details obtained from casualty record. ==Architecture== The church is built of Sussex limestone. The chancel roof is tiled, but the rest of the church is roofed with slabs of local stone. The south wall of the nave is original, although it has some 15th-century alterations; the nave ceiling is also from this era, and features wind bracing and tie beams. The tower, rebuilt in the 19th century, is in three stages and features mediaeval carvings. The pulpit is 17th-century; the altar rails are from that century or early in the 18th. There is some stained glass in the 19th-century north aisle and the east end of the chancel. The oldest internal fixture is the marble font, which is 13th-century. ==The parish== In October 2017, the parish size was reduced to include Crawley town centre, its northernmost point being where Kilnmead road meets the London road, and southernmost where Goffs Park road meets the Brighton Road. The previous parish covered by the church was much larger than the ancient parish of Crawley. It covered most of the town west and north of the railway line between Gatwick Airport and Crawley railway stations, and up to the boundary of the airport. The boundary was defined by the A23 London Road from its junction with the Horsham Road in Southgate to the edge of the Manor Royal industrial estate at County Oak; the southern perimeter road of Gatwick Airport—incorporating all the land and buildings in the former village of Lowfield Heath; some farmland and residential development east of the railway line at Tinsley Green; the railway line from Tinsley Green to Southgate Avenue, near Crawley railway station; and the northern part of the Southgate neighbourhood. St Michael and All Angels, still within the parish boundaries but no longer used by Anglicans There are five extant churches in the parish. St Peter's in West Green predates the New Town, having been built between 1892 and 1893 to a design by architect W. Hilton Nash. Richard Cook, owner of one of Crawley's main building firms, constructed it. It replaced a chapel of ease to St Margaret's Church, Ifield: although West Green was in the parish of Ifield at the time, it was remote from the parish church. Although the Diocese of Chichester would not pay for a separate church, it accepted St Peter's, which was built with private money, when it was offered. The church later gained its own parish, which was then absorbed by the parish of St John the Baptist. St Elizabeth's in the centre of the Northgate neighbourhood was built in 1965, and like St John the Baptist's follows a \\"Modern Catholic\\" style of worship. St Richard's is another modern church serving the Three Bridges neighbourhood. A fifth church, St Michael and All Angels, is notionally within the parish but is no longer used for Anglican worship. William Burges designed and built this yellow sandstone 13th century-style French Gothic church in 1867 to serve the village of Lowfield Heath, which was then in the parish of Charlwood in Surrey. The establishment and rapid development of Gatwick Airport next to Lowfield Heath swamped the small village, eventually destroying it: all buildings except the church, which was listed at Grade II* in 1948, were demolished to make way for warehouses and extensions to the airport boundary. (The church is approximately from the runway.) The Diocese of Chichester stopped using the church for services in 2004; in March 2008 it allowed a Seventh-day Adventist congregation to use the building as its place of worship. Horley Seventh-Day Adventist Church was formed as a church plant in May 2005 and was formally established in January 2008. ==The Church Today== In September 2017 a team led by Steve and Liz Burston from St Peter’s Brighton began a new phase in the life of St John’s. There are a variety of services, traditional and informal, contemporary services in order to seek to honour the past, navigate the present and build for the future. St John's Crawley run an Alpha course every term, providing an opportunity to freely discuss some of the bigger questions of life, faith and purpose within a Christian context. They also run social outreach programmes, such as The Bridge Café and Turning Point. As well as Sunday services, there are groups that meet throughout the week, seeking to deepen faith and grow in community. As a church St John's firmly believe in the Christian witness of churches working together across Crawley, both in social mission and prayer. As a result prayer and church unity are at the heart of their values. ==See also== *List of places of worship in Crawley *Listed buildings in Crawley ==References== Category:Grade II* listed churches in West Sussex Category:Church of England church buildings in West Sussex St John the Baptist ","title":"St John the Baptist's Church, Crawley"},{"id":"20379721","text":"is an anime television series by Tatsunoko Production.

It is one of the most important extant fortresses of the lower nobility in the Czech Republic. The first buildings, in the 13th century, were probably mostly from wood. The oldest surviving walls are from the first half of the 15th century. The castle measures , and there were 3 levels tower and one level palace first. The buildings were protected by a double protective wall, with a wooden bridge over two moats, in place until the 20th century. The main rebuildings were made by the noble Vrchlabsky family, between 1590 and the mid-16th century. Most of the architectural details from this period survive unchanged. One of the builders was Joachym Zoubek ze Zdetina (Joachym Zub ze Zdietina), who began work in the second half of the 16th century. His coat is still found in the top of one ceiling vault, with the text \\"JOACHIM ZVB ZE ZDIETINA A NA MOSSTIENICI KOMORNIK MENSSI ETC.\\" The last meaningful reconstruction was made by Vaclav Eusebius Lobkowicz, who finished the 3rd floor of the building.

The institute provides professional training in the theory and practice of psychoanalysis and psychotherapy. It was founded in 1932 by Franz Alexander, a pioneer in psychosomatic medicine at the Berlin Psychoanalytic Institute, who moved to Chicago at the invitation of Robert Maynard Hutchins, then president of the University of Chicago.Grinker, R.R., Sr (1995). \\"The History of Psychoanalysis in Chicago, 1911–1975\\". Ann. Psychoanal., 23:155-195. Notable psychoanalysts that have been associated with the institute include Karl Menninger, Karen Horney, Thomas Szasz, Therese Benedek, Hedda Bolgar, Roy Grinker, Maxwell Gitelson, Louis Shapiro, Heinz Kohut, Arnold Goldberg, Jerome Kavka, Frank Summers, and Michael Franz Basch. ==History== The Chicago Institute is the second oldest in the United States, preceded by New York five months earlier, and followed by Boston and Washington. It was incorporated on February 25, 1932, with Franz Alexander as the first Director. Alexander’s first associate was Karen Horney, who had been another student at the Berlin Institute. Alexander and Horney appointed three more to form the first staff. They were: Thomas French as Lecturer and Clinical Associate, Helen McLean and Catherine Bacon as Clinical Associates. There were also two visiting lecturers: Karl Menninger and Lionel Blitzstein. From the beginning, the Chicago Institute has nurtured innovative, and occasionally revolutionary, approaches to the psychoanalytic theory and practice originally formulated by Sigmund Freud in Vienna. Alexander wanted to experiment with frequency of sessions, length of treatment and how the analyst should optimally conduct himself. He published his ideas in several books, and became an outspoken advocate for such experimentation. Alexander left Chicago for California in 1955. He was succeeded by Gerhard Piers as the Director of the Institute. The group of analysts who became the dominant voices at the Institute had been greatly influenced by Lionel Blitzstein, who had analyzed them all. Though Blitzsten had been on the early faculty of the Institute, he and Alexander were at odds. With his ascendance the Institute reinstated practices that were considered more in line with the dominant American view of depth and intensity of psychoanalytic treatment. The intellectual leader of this group was Maxwell Gitelson. Joan Fleming became Dean of Education, and the curriculum emphasized a more thorough historical approach to teaching psychoanalysis. The 1960s witnessed one of the most vibrant creative periods in the Institute's history. Two important theoretical developments occurred. One was a collective research project that concerned parent loss. Fleming's research group observed that there seemed to be an arrest of the personality at the age of the child when the parent died, associated with an absence of mourning.(1966) International Journal of Psychoanalysis. XLIV, 1963: Activation of Mourning and Growth by Psychoanalysis. Joan Fleming and Sol Altschul. Pp. 419-431. Psychoanal Q., 35:308 From these findings, the group reasoned that intervention at the time of the loss (i.e., in childhood) would effectively prevent later psychological problems. Ten years later, in 1976, the Barr-Harris Children’s grief center opened its doors. The second major development was the groundbreaking work of Heinz Kohut, who developed his very own ideas about the central role of empathy as defining the field of psychoanalysis - a position he staked out in 1959.Kohut, H. (1959). \\"Introspection, empathy and psychoanalysis: An examination of the relationship between modes of observation and theory\\". Journal of the American Psychoanalytic Association, 7:459-483 Kohut had observed the intense reactions that would occur when patients were engaged with others who had not functioned as a needed part of themselves and hence caused injury to that most vital part of their being. But it was this being-part-of that had deep implications for the understanding of both development and treatment. Paradoxically, the understanding of the essential role of the \\"other\\" became a psychology of the \\"self\\".Terman, D. (1980). \\"Object Love and the Psychology of the Self\\". In A. Goldberg (Ed.), Advances in Self Psychology, 349-365. New York: International Universities Press. All of this offered another, additional way of looking at what the classical theory had charted in its terms. Self psychology has had (and continues too have) an enormous impact on psychoanalytic thought and practice throughout the world. In the midst of all this groundbreaking intellectual work, the Institute also launched a number of innovative programs. In 1962 it began the Child Therapy Program, the first of its kind in the country. Graduates of the Child Therapy Program have staffed and trained legions of agencies and treatment facilities of all kinds and have been the source of quality child psychotherapy over the last 45 years. A few years later, in 1965, Kay Field began the Teacher Education Program that educated teachers and school personnel about the nature of emotional development and helped them recognize and deal with problems in that development. The program reached hundreds of school personnel. In 1973, under the direction of then- director George H. Pollock, the Institute began the yearly publication of the Annual of Psychoanalysis. It remains the only Institute in the country - and the world - to sponsor, edit and produce an important academic journal. The 70’s also saw the inauguration of the most complete catalog of psychoanalytic literature assembled to that point, The Chicago Psychoanalytic Index. Begun in 1970 and continued until 1989, this was the standard reference work for most American psychoanalysts until the recent advent of centralized computer cataloging. The psychoanalytic library out of which this work arose began with the founding of the Institute and grew to be one of the three most complete psychoanalytic collections in the world. In 2013, Erika Schmidt became the first female director of the Chicago Institute for Psychoanalysis. ==Education programs== The Chicago Institute offers a variety of pathways to facilitate psychoanalytic learning. The fellowship program is open to advanced trainees and recent graduates in psychiatry, psychology, and social work who are interested in psychoanalysis as a framework with which to understand and carry out clinical work. Participants meet for a monthly seminar. Fellows also meet monthly with a mentor to discuss readings, cases and other relevant topics. The Adult Psychotherapy Program is a two year curriculum that is equally divided between clinical and didactic courses. Students learn to do diagnostic evaluations from a dynamic point of view, including dynamic formulations. They also have supervision with an analyst once a week to help with patients they currently have in treatment. The Child and Adolescent Psychotherapy Program is a 4 year program to train mental health workers who treat children and adolescents. Students complete a variety of diagnostic evaluations of children and their families with a dynamic perspective, in addition to several long- term psycho-analytically-oriented supervised cases. The core Psychoanalytic Education Program provides training in the practice of psychoanalysis. This is a 5 year curriculum, but completion of the program frequently requires additional years to finish the clinical work required for graduation. Students must undergo a personal analysis that begins before matriculation into courses. Students treat at least three people in analysis under supervision of an analyst. In collaboration with Rush University, the Institute also offers the CORST program to Ph.D.s from a variety of non-clinical academic field, who wish to become psychoanalysts. It is designed to provide such students experience in general psychiatry and psychotherapy as preparation for psychoanalytic training. CORST is a 17 month program in which the student shares many of the courses given to residents in Psychiatry at Rush Medical College. Concurrently, they see several patients in psychotherapy under the supervision of analysts on the faculty of the Institute. ==Clinical services== The Clinics of the Institute for Psychoanalysis provide psychoanalytically informed services to adults, adolescents, and children in the Chicago area at a greatly reduced fee. All therapists and analysts are highly experienced clinicians trained in psychiatry, psychology, social work, or counseling. Many have advanced training in psychoanalysis or psychotherapy. Psychoanalytic treatments are based on the belief that emotional difficulties are often the result of thoughts and feelings outside of a person's awareness. By exploring and working through these issues in the safety of a trusting relationship with a therapist, one can experience lasting changes. Present stresses and crises are also contributors to one's sense of well-being and can be an important focus for therapeutic intervention. In 1976, the Institute for Psychoanalysis established the Barr-Harris Children's Grief Center to meet the needs of children who have lost a parent or significant loved one through death, divorce, or abandonment. The Center's mission is to provide therapeutic services to bereaved children and their families; to make intervention more accessible; to heighten awareness of the potentially harmful short- and long- term effects of loss; and to provide training and consultation for teachers, clergy, mental health workers, and other involved community members. In addition to its main location at the Institute for Psychoanalysis in downtown Chicago, the Center has established programs at four Chicago area locations: Highland Park Hospital serving the north suburbs, Little Company of Mary Hospital serving the south suburbs, La Rabida Children's Hospital serving the city's south side, and Swedish Covenant Hospital serving the city's north side. More recently, the Center has opened a sixth location at the Riverdale Community Resource Center in Riverdale, IL. ==References * Chicago Institute for Psychoanalysis * Chicago Psychoanalytic Society * American Psychoanalytic Association Category:Psychology organizations based in the United States Category:Psychology institutes Category:Medical and health professional associations in Chicago Category:Psychoanalysis in the United States Category:Mental health organizations in Illinois ","title":"Chicago Institute for Psychoanalysis"},{"id":"20379775","text":"Kārte Parwān is a neighborhood in north-western Kabul, Afghanistan, and home to the Sikh Gurdwara Karte Parwan, Sheerno Junior High, Hotel Inter- Continental Kabul and the Bagh-e Bala Palace.

As of 2010-2011, Sacred Heart enrolled 187 students in grades PreK through 8, with student/teacher ratio: 11.98. The school was associated with the National Catholic Educational Association (NCEA). Most graduates have attended Holy Cross High School (Pennsylvania) or Carbondale Area High School for high-school classes. For the 2011-2012 school year, Sacred Heart was closed and integrated into the LaSalle Academy Catholic School, located in Dickson City and Jessup. ==History== The two schools which combined to make up the newly named Sacred Heart Elementary School were formed in the 1800s and were located less than a mile (1.6 km) from each other. St. Rose Elementary was formed in 1871 and was part of the St Rose of Lima Parish, which had a large Irish immigrant population. Our Lady of Mt. Carmel Elementary was formed in 1892 and was part of the Our Lady of Mt. Carmel Parish which had a large Italian immigrant population. Originally, both elementary schools enjoyed a large enrollment, and the teachers of both elementary schools were exclusively nuns. Both schools housed a convent for the nuns who taught and ran each school. In 1921, St. Rose, then the larger of the two, expanded and built a high school, as St. Rose High School. In 1954, a new high school was built on the corner of 7th Avenue and N. Church Street. In 1963, Mt. Carmel Elementary built a new school on Farview Street, which served as the final school site. ===Consolidations=== In 1997, the school system was reorganized in Carbondale. The two elementary schools, St. Rose and Mt. Carmel Elementary, combined to form one school system called Sacred Heart Elementary School, which operated out of both original school sites. St. Rose High was renamed Sacred Heart High School. Grades PreK-2 were in the St. Rose Elementary building, and grades 3–6 were in the Mt. Carmel building, with grades 7–12 in the high-school building located near St Rose Parish. In 2000, grades PreK-2 were relocated to the Mt. Carmel building, and grades 4–6 were moved to the high school and operated separately from the high school as Sacred Heart Intermediate. The St. Rose Elementary building remains vacant to this day, except for Catechism classes on Sunday. === Loss of the High School === The 2004–2005 school year was the last operating year for Sacred Heart Intermediate and Sacred Heart High. The newly instated Bishop Martino decided to close grades 9–12 due to a debt and low enrollment which always occurred in the transition from sixth grade to seventh grade, during which over 50% of the students would leave. Those students transferred to the public high school, which had a more competitive program with activities and curricular strengths, neither of which Sacred Heart's high school could compete with, only having 90–130 students during the last years. Despite a campaign run by the school which raised the entire $250,000 debt in pledges in a mere two weeks, the bishop's decision remained final, and the school closed in June 2005. The last graduation ceremony was held in the auditorium/gym and graduated 14 students. ==Closure== Sacred Heart Elementary School closed at the end of the 2010-2011 school year, with its students being incorporated into LaSalle Academy. With the elementary school's closure, over one century of formal Catholic education in Carbondale was brought to a close. The building housed the Fell Charter School for the 2012-2013, and the building has since remained vacant. == References == Category:Private elementary schools in Pennsylvania Category:Private middle schools in Pennsylvania Category:Schools in Lackawanna County, Pennsylvania Category:Carbondale, Pennsylvania ","title":"Sacred Heart Elementary (Carbondale)"},{"id":"20379842","text":"Style was a South African consumer magazine that was founded in 1981 and published by Caxton and CTP Publishers and Printers Limited.

The district encompasses a broad array of architectural styles ranging from 1738 Georgian Colonial to 1941 Georgian Revival. The collection of Victorian domestic architecture built during the 1840s to 1880s is unparalleled in the county, with no two houses the same. Some of the later cottages were designed by Philadelphia architect Brognard Okie. There are variations of the American Gothic Revival form, Italianate, Queen Anne, and Shingle-style structures. There is also a range of Colonial Revival houses, from craftsman era rustic cottages to more formal Georgian, and mass-produced Dutch Colonial models from the early 20th century. The area developed originally in the 19th century as a summer community and early commuter suburb for prominent Baltimoreans. With the opening of the Thomas Viaduct in 1836, the Patapsco Valley south of the river was easily accessible to Baltimoreans. Many of the first residents were respected lawyers and doctors active in many of the professional and cultural organizations still vital in the state today. During the 1840s, as railroad service improved, Lawyers Hill residents began commuting to Baltimore on a daily and weekly basis, establishing the community as the state's first railroad commuter suburb.

The Act is based on the principles of English Common Law. It is applicable to all the states of India. It determines the circumstances in which promises made by the parties to a contract shall be legally binding. Under Section 2(h), the Indian Contract Act defines a contract as an agreement which is enforceable by law. == Development == The Act as enacted originally had 266 Sections, it had wide scope and * General Principles of Law of Contract – Sections 01 to 75 * Contract relating to Sale of Goods – Sections 76 to 123 * Special Contracts- Indemnity, Guarantee, Bailment & Pledge and Agency – Sections 124 to 238 * Contracts relating to Partnership – Sections 239 to 266 At present the Indian Contract Act may be divided into two parts: * Part 1: deals with the General Principles of Law of Contract Sections 1 to 75 * Part 2: deals with Special kinds of Contracts such as :#Contract of Indemnity and Guarantee :#Contract of Bailment and Pledge :#Contract of Agency. 1\\\\. Offer 2(a): When one person signifies to another his willingness to do or to abstain from doing anything, with a view to obtaining the assent of that other to such act or abstinence, he is said to make a proposal. 2\\\\. Acceptance 2(b): When the person to whom the proposal is made, signifies his assent there to, the proposal is said to be accepted. 3\\\\. Promise 2(b): A Proposal when accepted becomes a promise. In simple words, when an offer is accepted it becomes promise. 4\\\\. Promisor and promisee 2(c): When the proposal is accepted, the person making the proposal is called as promisor and the person accepting the proposal is called as promisee. 5\\\\. Consideration 2(d): When at the desire of the promisor, the promisee or any other person has done or abstained from doing or does or abstains from doing or promises to do or to abstain from doing something such act or abstinence or promise is called a consideration for the promise. Price paid by one party for the promise of the other Technical word meaning QUID- PRO-QUO i.e. something in return. 6\\\\. Agreement 2(e): Every promise and set of promises forming the consideration for each other. In short, agreement = promise + consideration. 7\\\\. Contract 2(h): An agreement enforceable by Law is a contract. Therefore, there must be an agreement and it should be enforceable by law. 8\\\\. Reciprocal Promises 2(f): Promises which form the consideration or part of the consideration for each other are called 'reciprocal promises'. 9\\\\. Void agreement 2(g): An agreement not enforceable by law is void. 10\\\\. Voidable contract 2(i): An agreement is a voidable contract if it is enforceable by Law at the option of one or more of the parties there to (i.e. the aggrieved party), and it is not enforceable by Law at the option of the other or others. 11\\\\. Void contract 2(j): A contract becomes void when it ceases to be enforceable by law. == Acceptance == According to Section 2(b), \\"When the person to whom the proposal is made, signifies his assent thereto, the proposal is said to be accepted. A proposal, when accepted, becomes a promise.\\" Rules:- # Acceptance should be absolute and unqualified.. If the parties are not concurred on all matters concerning the offer and acceptance, there is no valid contract. For example, \\"A\\" says to \\"B\\" \\"I offer to sell my car for Rs.50,000/-. \\"B\\" replies \\"I will purchase it for Rs.45,000/-\\". This is not acceptance and hence it amounts to a counter offer. # It should be Communicated to the offeror. To conclude a contract between parties, the acceptance must be communicated in some prescribed form. A mere mental determination on the part of offeree to accept an offer does not amount to valid acceptance. # Acceptance must be in the mode prescribed. If the acceptance is not according to the mode prescribed or some usual and reasonable mode (where no mode is prescribed) the offeror may intimate to the offeree within a reasonable time that acceptance is not according to the mode prescribed and may insist that the offer be accepted in the prescribed mode only. If he does not inform the offeree, he is deemed to have accepted the offer. For example, \\"A\\" makes an offer to \\"B\\" says to \\"B\\" that \\"if you accept the offer, reply by voice. \\"B\\" sends reply by post. It will be a valid acceptance, unless \\"A\\" informs \\"B\\" that the acceptance is not according to the prescribed mode. # Acceptance must be given within a reasonable time before the offer lapses. If any time limit is specified, the acceptance must be given within the time, if no time limit is specified it must be given within a reasonable time. # It cannot precede an offer. If the acceptance precedes an offer it is not a valid acceptance and does not result in contract. For example, in a company shares were allotted to a person who had not applied for them. Subsequently, when he applied for shares, he was un aware of the previous allotment . The allotment of share previous to the application is not valid. # Acceptance by the way of conduct. # Mere silence is no acceptance. Silence does not per-se amounts to communication- Bank of India Ltd. Vs. Rustom Cowasjee- AIR 1955 Bom. 419 at P. 430; 57 Bom. L.R. 850- Mere silence cannot amount to any assent. It does not even amount to any representation on which any plea of estoppel may be found, unless there is a duty to make some statement or to do some act free and offerer must be consent # Acceptance must be unambiguous and definite. # Acceptance cannot be given before communication of an offer. == Lawful consideration == According to Section 2(d), Consideration is defined as: \\"When at the desire of the promisor, the promisee or any other person has done or abstained from doing, or does or abstains from doing, or promises to do or abstain from doing something, such act or abstinence or promise is called consideration for the promise\\". Consideration means 'something in return'. An agreement must be supported by a lawful consideration on both sides. Essentials of valid consideration must include:- *It must move at the desire of the promisor. An act constituting consideration must have been done at the desire or request of the promiser. If it is done at the instance of a third party or without the desire of the promisor, it will not be good consideration. For example, \\"A\\" saves \\"B\\"'s goods from fire without being ask him to do so. \\"A\\" cannot demand payment for his service. *Consideration may move from the promisee or any other person. Under Indian law, consideration may be from the promisee of any other person i.e., even a stranger. This means that as long as there is consideration for the promisee, it is immaterial who has furnished it. *Consideration must be an act, abstinence or forebearance or a returned promise. *Consideration may be past, present or future. Past consideration is not consideration according to English law. However it is a consideration as per Indian law. Example of past consideration is, \\"A\\" renders some service to \\"B\\" at latter's desire. After a month \\"B\\" promises to compensate \\"A\\" for service rendered to him earlier. When consideration is given simultaneously with promise, it is said to be present consideration .. For example, \\"A\\" receives Rs.50/- in return for which he promises to deliver certain goods to \\"B\\". The money \\"A\\" receives is the present consideration. When consideration to one party to other is to pass subsequently to the maker of the contract, is said to be future consideration. For example. \\"A\\" promises to deliver certain goods to \\"B\\" after a week. \\"B\\" promises to pay the price after a fortnight, such consideration is future. *Consideration must be real. Consideration must be real, competent and having some value in the eyes of law. For example, \\"A\\" promises to put life to \\"B\\"'s dead wife, if \\"B\\" pay him Rs.1000/-. \\"A\\"'s promise is physically impossible of performance hence there is no real consideration. *Consideration must be something which the promiser is not already bound to do. A promise to do something what one is already bound to do, either by law, is not a good consideration., since it adds nothing to the previous existing legal consideration. *Consideration need not be adequate. Consideration need not be necessarily be equal to value to something given. So long as consideration exists, the courts are not concerned as to adequacy, provided it is for some value. The consideration or object of an agreement is lawful, unless and until it is: #forbidden by law: If the object or the consideration of an agreement is for doing an act forbidden by law, such agreement are void. for example,\\"A\\" promises \\"B\\" to obtain an employment in public service and \\"B\\" promises to pay Rs one lakh to \\"A\\". The agreement is void as the procuring government job through unlawful means is prohibited. #If it involves injury to a person or property of another: For example, \\"A\\" borrowed rs.100/- from\\"B\\" and executed a bond to work for \\"B\\" without pay for a period of 2 years. In case of default, \\"A\\" owes to pay the principal sum at once and huge amount of interest. This contract was held void as it involved injury to the person. #If courts regards it as immoral:An agreement in which consideration ir object of which is immoral is void. For example, An agreement between husband and wife for future separation is void. #Is of such nature that, if permitted, it would defeat the provisions of any law: #is fraudulent, or involves or implies injury to the person or property of another, or #Is opposed to public policy. An agreement which tends to be injurious to the public or against the public good is void. For example, agreements of trading with foreign enemy, agreement to commit crime, agreements which interfere with the administration of justice, agreements which interfere with the course of justice, stifling prosecution, maintenance and champerty. #Agreements in restrained of legal proceedings: This deals with two category. One is, agreements restraining enforcement of rights and the other deals with agreements curtailing period of limitation. #Trafficking in public offices and titles: agreements for sale or transfer of public offices and title or for procurement of a public recognition like Padma Vibhushan or Padma Shri etc. for monetary consideration is unlawful, being opposed to public policy. #Agreements restricting personal liberty: agreements which unduly restricts the personal liberty of parties to it are void as being opposed by public policy. #Marriage brokerage contact:Agreements to procure marriages for rewards are void under the ground that marriage ought to proceed with free and voluntary decisions of parties. #Agreements interfering marital duties: Any agreement which interfere with performance of marital duty is void being opposed to public policy. An agreement between husband and wife that the wife will never leave her parental house. #consideration may take in any form- money, goods, services, a promise to marry, a promise to forbear etc. Contract Opposed to Public Policy can be Repudiated by the Court of law even if that contract is beneficial for all of the parties to the contract- What considerations and objects are lawful and what not-Newar Marble Industries Pvt. Ltd. Vs. Rajasthan State Electricity Board, Jaipur, 1993 Cr. L.J. 1191 at 1197, 1198 [Raj.]- Agreement of which object or consideration was opposed to public policy, unlawful and void- – What better and what more can be an admission of the fact that the consideration or object of the compounding agreement was abstention by the board from criminally prosecuting the petitioner-company from offense under Section 39 of the act and that the Board has converted the crime into a source of profit or benefit to itself. This consideration or object is clearly opposed to public policy and hence the compounding agreement is unlawful and void under Section 23 of the Act. It is unenforceable as against the Petitioner-Company. == Competent to contract == Section 11 of The Indian Contract Act specifies that every person is competent to contract provided: # He should not be a minor i.e. an individual who has not attained the age of majority i.e. 18 years in normal case and 21 years if guardian is appointed by the Court. # He should be of sound mind while making a contract. A person cannot who is usually of unsound mind, but occasionally of sound mind, can make a contract when he is of sound mind. Similarly if a person is usually of sound mind, but occasionally of unsound mind, may not make a valid contract when he is of unsound mind. # He is not disqualified from contracting by any other law to which he is subject There are other laws of the land that disqualify certain persons from contracting. They are:- -Alien enemy -Foreign sovereigns, diplomatic staff etc. -Artificial persons i.e. corporation, companies etc. -Insolvents -Convicts -Pardanashi Women == Free Consent == According to Section 13, \\" two or more persons are said to be in consent when they agree upon the same thing in the same sense (Consensus- ad-idem). According to Section 14, Consent is said to be free when it is not caused by coercion or undue influence or fraud or misrepresentation or mistake. Elements Vitiating free Consent 1\\\\. Coercion (Section 15): \\"Coercion\\" is the committing, or threatening to commit, any act forbidden by the Indian Penal Code under(45,1860), or the unlawful detaining, or threatening to detain, any property, to the prejudice of any person whatever, with the intention of causing any person to enter into an agreement. For example, \\"A\\" threatens to shoot \\"B\\"if he doesn't release him from a debt which he owes to \\"B\\". \\"B\\" releases \\"A\\" under threat. Since the release has been brought about by coercion, such release is not valid. 2\\\\. Undue influence (Section 16): \\"Where a person who is in a position to dominate the will of another enters into a contract with him and the transaction appears on the face of it, or on the evidence, to be unconscionable, the burden of proving that such contract was not induced by undue influence shall lie upon the person in the position to dominate the will of the other.\\" :(Section 16(2)) States that \\"A person is deemed to be in a position to dominate the will of another; ::*Where he holds a real or apparent authority over the other. For example, an employer may be deemed to be having authority over his employee. an income tax authority over to the assessee. ::*Where he stands in a fiduciary relationship to other, For example, the relationship of Solicitor with his client, spiritual advisor and devotee. ::*Where he makes a contract with a person whose mental capacity is temporarily or permanently affected by the reason of age, illness or mental or bodily distress\\" 3\\\\. Fraud (Section 17): \\"Fraud\\" means and includes any act or concealment of material fact or misrepresentation made knowingly by a party to a contract, or with his connivance, or by his agent, with intent to deceive another party thereto of his agent, or to induce him to enter into the contract. Mere silence is not fraud. a contracting party is not obliged to disclose each and everything to the other party. There are two exceptions where even mere silence may be fraud, one is where there is a duty to speak, then keeping silence is fraud. or when silence is in itself equivalent to speech, such silence is fraud. 4\\\\. Misrepresentation (Section 18): \\" causing, however innocently, a party to an agreement to make a mistake as to the substance of the thing which is the subject of the agreement\\". 5\\\\. Mistake of fact (Section 20): \\"Where both the parties to an agreement are under a mistake as to a matter of fact essential to the agreement, the agreement is void\\". A party cannot be allowed to get any relief on the ground that he had done some particular act in ignorance of law. Mistake may be bilateral mistake where both parties to an agreement are under mistake as to the matter of fact.The mistake must relate to a matter of fact essential to the agreement. == Agency == In law, the relationship that exists when one person or party (the principal) engages another (the agent) to act for him, e.g. to do his work, to sell his goods, to manage his business. The law of agency thus governs the legal relationship in which the agent deals with a third party on behalf of the principal. The competent agent is legally capable of acting for this principal vis-à-vis the third party. Hence, the process of concluding a contract through an agent involves a twofold relationship. On the one hand, the law of agency is concerned with the external business relations of an economic unit and with the powers of the various representatives to affect the legal position of the principal. On the other hand, it rules the internal relationship between principal and agent as well, thereby imposing certain duties on the representative (diligence, accounting, good faith, etc.) Under section 201 to 210 an agency may come to an end in a variety of ways: : (i) By the principal revoking the agency – However, principal cannot revoke an agency coupled with interest to the prejudice of such interest. Such Agency is coupled with interest. An agency is coupled with interest when the agent himself has an interest in the subject-matter of the agency, e.g., where the goods are consigned by an upcountry constituent to a commission agent for sale, with poor to recoup himself from the sale proceeds, the advances made by him to the principal against the security of the goods; in such a case, the principal cannot revoke the agent's authority till the goods are actually sold, nor is the agency terminated by death or insanity. (Illustrations to section 201) : (ii) By the agent renouncing the business of agency; : (iii) By the business of agency being completed; : (iv) By the principal being adjudicated insolvent (Section 201 of The Indian Contract Act. 1872) The principal also cannot revoke the agent's authority after it has been partly exercised, so as to bind the principal (Section 204), though he can always do so, before such authority has been so exercised (Sec 203). Further, as per section 205, if the agency is for a fixed period, the principal cannot terminate the agency before the time expired, except for sufficient cause. If he does, he is liable to compensate the agent for the loss caused to him thereby. The same rules apply where the agent, renounces an agency for a fixed period. Notice in this connection that want of skill continuous disobedience of lawful orders, and rude or insulting behavior has been held to be sufficient cause for dismissal of an agent. Further, reasonable notice has to be given by one party to the other; otherwise, damage resulting from want of such notice, will have to be paid (Section 206). As per section 207, the revocation or renunciation of an agency may be made expressly or impliedly by conduct. The termination does not take effect as regards the agent, till it becomes known to him and as regards third party, till the termination is known to them (Section 208). Sub-agent who is appointed by an agent for participate on behalf of his work. : Types of Offer * Express offer: The offer made by using words spoken or written is known as an express offer. * Implied offer: The offer which could be understood by a conduct of parties or circumstances of case. * General offer: It is an offer made to public at large with or without any time limit. * Specific offer: It is a type of offer, where an offer is made to a particular and specified person, it is a specific offer. * Cross offer: When a person to whom proposal (offer) is made signifies his assent, the proposal is said to be accepted. * Continuous offer: An offer which is made to the public at large and if it is kept open for public acceptance for a certain period of time. * Counteroffer: Upon receipt of an offer from an offeror, if the offeree instead of accepting it straightway, imposes conditions which have the effect of modifying or varying the offer When an agent's authority is terminated, it operates as a termination of subagent also.

He has served as the host of New England Legends and has appeared on Ghost Adventures. Paranormal researcher Ben Radford has called Belanger a \\"ghost storyteller\\" not a \\"ghost investigator\\". ==Education and career== Jeff Belanger graduated from Hofstra University with a B.A. in English. After college Jeff served as Editor-in-Chief of Main Street - a biweekly arts and entertainment newspaper in northern Fairfield County, Connecticut, he worked in marketing and public relations for both private and public companies, and he's currently a full-time writer living in Massachusetts with his wife, Megan, daughter, Sophie, and parakeet, Mambo. ==Paranormal investigator== Paranormal researcher Ben Radford discusses issues he has with Belanger's research skills. In Belanger's book Communicating with the Dead he states that he uses Ouija boards, tarot cards, casting runes, mirror gazing, dowsing and EVP's to investigate the paranormal, all of which have never been proven to work. Radford calls attention to Belanger mentioning the Fox sisters '\\"spirit rapping\\"' in the introduction of his book, \\"he seems unaware of the fact that the sisters admitted that they had faked these ghostly communications.

Belanger writes of the story of Sara Ann stating conflicting details. The conclusion was that an anonymous \\"very likely a self-claimed psychic\\" told the story of seeing Sara Ann to someone, who later recounted that story to Belanger. Radford asked Belanger about the contradictions, his responses was \\"'I don't offer these accounts up as proof of anything. I'm simply passing on what I've learned and heard along the way and I'm trying to do it in an entertaining way'\\". In the notes section of Radford's book, he states that he was told by Belanger that he (Radford) is the first to \\"call his attention to the contradictions and ambiguities in his account of Sarah Ann\\" calling Radford to write, \\"scientific investigation requires that information about hauntings and ghost reports be taken literally - not metaphorically, figuratively, or in any other way\\". == Bibliography == * 2014 Haunted New England Wall Calendar by Jeff Belanger with photography by Frank Grace (Tide- mark, August 2013) * Chasing Spirits: The Building of the Ghost Adventures Crew by Nick Groff with Jeff Belanger (Penguin/NAL, October 2012) * What It's Like to Climb Mount Everest, Blast Off into Space, Survive a Tornado, and Other Extraordinary Stories (Sterling, March 2011) * Picture Yourself Legend Tripping: Your Complete Guide to Finding UFOs, Monsters, Ghosts, and Urban Legends in Your Own Backyard (Course Technology PTR, June 2010) * The Mysteries of the Bermuda Triangle (Grosset and Dunlap, February 2010) * Who's Haunting the White House?

Akelaitis completed only a four-year secondary school and worked as a tutor for nobility's children at various manors in present-day Poland and Lithuania. he learned several languages and started contributing articles to the Polish press. He wrote works on the Lithuanian language, literature, folklore, mythology, history. His favorite research subject was linguistics, but as many self-taught linguists he developed unscientific etymologies and theories. Many of his works remained unfinished or unpublished. He generally supported the resurrection of the former Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth and the Polish-Lithuanian identity. He wrote texts that were meant for the common folk in Lithuanian, but his articles and studies for the intelligentsia were written in Polish as it was considered the language of culture at the time. He collaborated with Simonas Daukantas and Motiejus Valančius on plans to establish the first Lithuanian-language periodical Pakeleivingas, but failed to secure government's permits. With financial aid of several nobles, he published five Lithuanian-language booklets in 1860 at the press of . Akelaitis joined the anti-Tsarist resistance leading to the Uprising of 1863 – he organized an anti-government demonstration and wrote anti-government texts. He fled the Russian police to Paris where he worked at the Polish Library in Paris. At the outbreak of the uprising, he returned to Lithuania becoming an assistant commissioner of the Polish National Government in Augustów. When it became clear that the uprising would not succeed, Akelaitis fled to Paris for the second time where he lived until his death. Despite poverty, he continued to be active in Polish and Lithuanian cultural life. He contributed articles to various Polish and Lithuanian periodicals, including ' where he had a regular column. His largest published work, a Lithuanian grammar in Polish, was published posthumously in 1890. ==BiographyEarly life and education=== Akelaitis was born in near Marijampolė to a family of peasants. His father participated in the Uprising of 1831 and was sentenced to exile in Siberia where he died. Akelaitis' stepgrandfather fought in the Battle of Maciejowice during the Kościuszko Uprising while his grandfather's brother served in the Polish Legions in Italy and fought in the Battle of Somosierra in Spain during the Napoleonic Wars. Orphaned Akelaitis grew up with his grandparents and stories of these campaigns. His mother obtained a housekeeper's job in Marijampolė where Akelaitis took private lessons with a local priest and an organist in Sasnava. He then enrolled into a primary school in Marijampolė which he graduated at age 17. He continued studies at the four-year secondary school in Marijampolė where he was continuously ranked as one of the best students, but quit without graduating around 1850. He continued to self-study learning several languages. In addition to his native Lithuanian, he learned Polish, Russian, German, French, Latin, some Greek, Sanskrit, and Hebrew. ===Cultural and anti-government work=== Akelaitis worked as a tutor of various children of the Lithuanian nobility and frequently moved around. He briefly lived in Warsaw where he contributed articles on Lithuanian language and history to the Polish press. His first article was published in Kronice Wiadomości Krajowych i Zagranicznych in 1856. He collaborated with ethnographers Oskar Kolberg and . For example, Akelaitis translated 26 Samogitian songs published by Simonas Daukantas to Polish and sent them to Kolberg. In a letter dated 3 December 1857 to historian , he wrote: \\"We should lift up the Lithuanian language, wrest away from scorn that language which has the Sanskrit greatness, the Latin force, the Greek refinement, and the Italian melodiousness.\\" The letter, published in Teka Wileńska, was also one of the first to publicly raise the idea of publishing a Lithuanian-language newspaper. In 1858, Akelaitis moved to () in Courland to live with Petras Smuglevičius, a medical doctor and a relative of painter Franciszek Smuglewicz. There he found Simonas Daukantas who wrote the first Lithuanian- language history of Lithuania. Akelaitis treated Daukantas as a fatherly figure and they supported each other's work. Akelaitis, Daukantas, and bishop Motiejus Valančius wanted to establish Pakeleivingas, a Lithuanian-language periodical aimed at the ordinary village people, but could not get government's permission. Akelaitis began contributing to the Polish press in Vilnius and organizing publication of Lithuanian books. He managed to obtain financial support from Lithuanian nobles, including and Wilhelm Trojden Radziwiłł of Pavoloch and publish five Lithuanian booklets in 1860. Akelaitis taught Oginski's children in Rietavas and hoped to establish a Lithuanian printing press. invited him to work for Kurier Wileński but Akelaitis refused as the pay was too low. In 1860, Akelaitis was elected a member of the Vilnius Archaeological Commission. In 1861, Akelaitis joined the anti-Tsarist resistance leading to the Uprising of 1863. Together with Tadeusz Korzon, he organized a demonstration in Aleksotas, Kaunas on 12 August 1861 to commemorate the Union of Lublin. According to the diary of , Akelaitis had no money and so he donated his mother's ring and watch for the demonstration. Akelaitis wrote anti-government texts in Lithuanian: prose Gromata Wylniaus Senelio (Letter of an Old Man from Vilnius) in which he described how the Russian police killed five innocent people in Warsaw and Pasaka senelio (Fairytale of an Old Man) in verse. The two works were translated into Polish and Russian. He sent the texts to Memel (Klaipėda) to publish but the publisher instead turned the texts to the police. Akelaitis also published Giesmes nabożnos, a Lithuanian translation of two Polish patriotic hymns, Bogurodzica (Mother of God) and ' (God, Save Poland), which were likely translated by Akelaitis or by Antanas Baranauskas. Akelaitis went into hiding frequently changing his location and eventually fleeing to Paris. Akelaitis was elected to the and obtained a well paid position at the Polish Library in Paris. He was also a member of the Paris Society of Polish Youth led by Zygmunt Padlewski. ===Uprising and emigration=== When the Uprising of 1863 broke out, Akeliatis returned to Lithuania and became an assistant commissioner of the Polish National Government in Augustów. He wrote proclamations, recruited men, organized weapons, etc. He published two issues of the Lithuanian newsletter Żinia apej Lenku wajna su Maskolejs (News about the Polish War with the Muscovites) in February and March 1864. Towards the end of the uprising he escaped to East Prussia where he joined Lithuanian activities and attracted attention from the German police. He was arrested and sentenced to two years in prison, but managed to escape from the courtroom. Akelaitis again fled to Paris where he lived until his death. He married a French woman and had three children. Living in poverty he still worked for Polish and Lithuanian causes, contributing articles various periodicals, including to Polish Gazeta Warszawska, Kurjer Warszawski, and Lithuanian ' and Aušra (contributed an article on the names of the Grand Dukes of Lithuania). He had a regular column in the Polish ' where he wrote about Parisian art exhibitions, French science and culture, Exposition Universelle (1878), etc. He edited the Lithuanian section of trilingual newspaper Zmowa – Kupos susitarimas – Hromadzki zhowor which appeared in 1870 (after the first issue, its publication was interrupted by the Franco-Prussian War). He helped edit and publish a Lithuanian translation of Livre du peuple by Hugues Felicité Robert de Lamennais in 1870. In 1886, he founded and chaired until his death the Želmuo Society (literally: shoot) of Lithuanian emigrants. Initially, it was more a cultural organization to preserve Lithuanian language and culture among the émigrés. He did not abandon ideas of an armed struggle against the Russian Empire – a Russian informant reported in 1866 that Akelaitis was writing a Lithuanian-language \\"revolutionary catechism\\" that would be published in Switzerland and smuggled to Russia. He died in 1887 and was buried at the Cimetière parisien de Pantin. His short obituaries were published in Tygodnik Ilustrowany, Biblioteka Warszawska, Ateneum. ==Works== Overall, Akelaitis supported the former Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth and the Polish-Lithuanian identity – he believed that Lithuanians should join the Polish nation, but keep their language and culture. He was also a positivist. Akelaitis wrote works on Lithuanian language, literature, folklore, mythology, history. He advocated the use of the Lithuanian language, but his articles and studies for the intelligentsia were written in Polish as it was considered the language of culture at the time. Only texts addressed and meant for the common folk were written in Lithuanian. Akelaitis' Lithuanian texts were written mostly in the Western Aukštaitian dialect and attempted to use correct language, avoid various loan words, use lively descriptions from everyday speech. He tended to use etymological and not phonetic spelling. To avoid loan words, he created Lithuanian terminology. Many reference works credit him as the author of , the Lithuanian word for dictionary, but likely he borrowed the word from Jurgis Pabrėža. ===Published=== In 1858, Akelaitis published Słówko o bogach litewskich, a study on the pagan Lithuanian mythology. It was mainly a commentary and corrections of the mythology section in the nine-volume history of Lithuania by Teodor Narbutt. He attributed the Prussian trinity (Potrimpo, Peckols, and Perkūnas) to Lithuanians and analyzed their names from the linguistic point of view. It was first published as an article in ' and then as a separate booklet. The same he published a panegyric poem in Lithuanian dedicated to Tsar Alexander II of Russia and his visit to Vilnius (because it was submitted late, it was not included in the main album, but published separately). Several former students and professors of Vilnius University hoped to persuade the Tsar to reopen the university. In 1860, with the help of , Akelaitis published five works in Lithuanian (in total, 26,000 copies) as the first works of the planned folk library series. It was a Lithuanian (Western Aukštaitian dialect) primer, two prayer books, and two reworkings of short didactic stories by , Kwestorius po Lietuwą ważinedamas żmonis bemokinąsis (Quaestor, Traveling Across Lithuania, Teaches People) and Jonas Iszmisłoczius kromininkas (Shopkeeper John the Wise), which in turn was a reworking of a French story by and was already published in Lithuanian in 1823. These stories provided some educational facts from geography, history, natural sciences and promoted teetotalism. The primer, originally 59 pages long, was shortened and republished the same year in 22-page and 31-page editions. The primer was republished in 1867, 1869, 1872. After the Lithuanian press ban was enacted in 1864, the primer was frequently used in illegal village Lithuanian schools. In 1885, Akelaitis published 49-page Rzut oka na starożytność narodu litewskiego (A Glance at the Antiquity of the Lithuanian People), which he originally wrote in Lithuanian. Akelaitis was also a poet and published a few of his poems, including poems in Teka Wileńska (six volumes published in 1857–1858), poems dedicated to Nicolaus Copernicus and Lithuanian goddess Aušrinė in the Polish periodical ', Moja miłość (My Love) in Mrówka in 1869, Stracona owieczka (Lost Sheep) in a Polish calendar published by Jan Jaworski in 1877. His largest published work, the first part of a Lithuanian grammar in Polish which discussed phonetics, was published posthumously by in 1890. The manuscript of the second unpublished part is kept at the Kórnik Library. The work included Akelaitis' biography written by . Akelaitis started his work with a lengthy introduction describing the distribution of Lithuanian speakers and Lithuanian dialects (based on research of Antanas Baranauskas). The grammar which focuses on sounds and pronunciations is full of amateurish etymologies and unscientific theories. However, it is still valuable for lists of words and cited examples. ===Unpublished=== A letter written by Akelaitis in 1868 Many other works by Akelaitis remained unpublished or unfinished. His favorite research subject was linguistics and Lithuanian language. He lived at the time when the comparative linguistics emerged as a discipline, and he worked to compare Lithuanian with other Indo-European languages. His ambitious project was the compilation of three dictionaries: Lithuanian–Polish, Polish–Lithuanian, and comparative dictionary of Lithuanian, Slavic, Greek, and Sanskrit languages. ' mentioned in 1860 that the Lithuanian–Polish and the comparative dictionaries were ready, but the manuscripts have not survived. Akelaitis also studied Lithuanian phonetics, prepositions, grammatical cases, tenses, etymology, etc. However, as a self-taught amateur, he developed unscientific etymologies and theories – for example, in developing etymologies, he relied on pronunciation similarities instead of employing the comparative method. In 1862, with financial support from Valerian Kalinka, Akelaitis wrote his largest work, the Polish-language Opisanie Wielkiego Księstwa Litewskiego (Description of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania) or Litwa pod rządem Rossyjskim (Lithuania under the Russian Rule). The manuscript, preserved at the Polish Library in Paris, was first described by Paulius Galaunė in 1924 and remains unpublished. It is an unfinished 387-page study on the Lithuania, its territory, inhabitants, economy, religion, education, administration under the Russian Empire. The work mixed statistical data with emotional condemnation of the Tsarist regime and its Russification policies, discussed the abolition of serfdom in 1861 and accused the regime of economic and agricultural downturn, and idealized the policies of the former Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth (e.g. religious tolerance or the Statutes of Lithuania). The work was modeled after Kalinka's Galicya i Kraków pod panowaniem austryackiem (Galicia and Kraków under the Austrian Rule) about the Austrian Partition published in 1853. He started working on a translation of Herodotus and Karl von Rotteck to Polish, wrote a short didactic work on the history of Lithuania and a comedy in Polish (1859). His manuscript of a Polish translation of the Lithuanian epic poem The Seasons by Kristijonas Donelaitis was confiscated by the police in 1861. He wrote a Lithuanian booklet on trains and steam engines in which he had to create about a hundred Lithuanian technical terms. He also collected Lithuanian folk fairy tales – his collection was used by Jonas Basanavičius in his published collection of Lithuanian folklore. ==References== Category:1829 births Category:1887 deaths Category:Amateur linguists Category:Lithuanian writers Category:Linguists from Lithuania Category:January Uprising participants Category:People from Marijampolė Category:Lithuanian emigrants to France Category:Activists of the Great Emigration ","title":"Mikalojus Akelaitis"},{"id":"20380094","text":"Lars Toborg (born 19 August 1975) is a German former professional footballer who played as a forward. == External links == * * *Profile at www.kicker.de Category:Living people Category:1975 births Category:Sportspeople from Bremerhaven Category:Association football forwards Category:German footballers Category:2.

Moisi Arianit Golemi, lord of Debar, and one of Skanderbeg's officers, deserted to the Ottomans following the defeat at Berat in 1455. Golemi set off from Adrianople with a force of 15,000 men to capture Albania but was swiftly defeated by Skanderbeg's smaller forces. ==Background== Skanderbeg's resistance had been going on for over a decade, during which time he defeated many Turkish armies. The Ottoman Turks sent an invasion force under Isak Bey Pasha to subdue southern Albania. In this invasion, Isak captured the Albanian stronghold of Berat and crippled the Albanian resistance. Moisi of Dibra, one of Skanderbeg's most trusted officers, deserted to the Ottomans and made an attempt to defeat Skanderbeg by using the Ottoman army. He left Adrianople with 15,000 soldiers and marched towards Albania. Because of the knowledge Moisi possessed of Skanderbeg's strategies and of the Albanian terrain, Skanderbeg made all his dispositions for defense. ==Pre-battle== Since Moisi was a master in sleights and subtleties, Skanderbeg let the invader march through Oranik without any interruptions. Even when Moisi arrived, Skanderbeg was ready to deal with him by sending envoys but Moisi did not stop his march. The two armies met and the battle began with man-to-man combat between one soldier from each army. A Turk named Ahimaz stepped out and issued a challenge, which was taken up by an Albanian, Zaharia Gropa. Both men rode out on horse and both men were dismounted. The fight continued on foot until Zaharia stabbed Ahimaz in the throat and cut off his head whilst the two horses rode towards the Albanian lines, which was taken as a good omen by Skanderbeg's forces. Moisi then stepped out and challenged Skanderbeg to personal combat which caused Skanderbeg to stand in doubt. As Skanderbeg began to move towards Moisi, Moisi turned around and fled back to his own army, giving orders to begin attack the Albanians. ==The battle== The Ottoman forces were in two lines, the second consisting of picked soldiers who were to support the first in case of trouble. Behind these two lines was Moisi with his reserves of Albanians, probably his tribal supporters. Skanderbeg's force, comprising 6,000 men on horse and 4,000 on foot, were divided into three lines with the commander in charge of the middle. Both Turkish lines quickly broke under the shock of the Albanian cavalry attack and the battle turned to hand-to-hand fighting with both commanders dangerously involved. Skanderbeg was thrown off his horse, but the initial impetus gave Skanderbeg an advantage that he never lost. Moisi escaped with about one third of his army. ==Aftermath== Moisi wandered around the frontier area for some time and then returned to Adrianople, where he was regarded with contempt. He found himself in debt, and lived in an atmosphere of fear and foreboding. He suddenly decided to throw himself to Skanderbeg's mercy. He left Adrianople at night and rode to Debar, where he was well received. Skanderbeg was at a nearby garrison and Moisi went there to ask for forgiveness. Skanderbeg pardoned him and restored his lands. Bonfires were lit to celebrate his return, and people were warned that his offense should never be publicly referred to. ==References and notesSources== *Hodgkinson, Harry.

The district comprises the industrial complex of Savage Mill and the village of workers' housing to the north of the complex. The site of Savage Mill on the rapids of the Little Patuxent River had been used for mill operations since the early 18th century. The district was part of a land grant named Ridgeley's Forest, surveyed in 1685 by Colonel Henry Ridgley. In 1750, Alexander Warfield built a mill along the river which was eclipsed by a larger construction chartered in 1812 by the Williams Brothers. By 1825, the mill employed 200 people including women and children, and 120 power looms for the production of cotton duck. The complex included several additions: a grist mill, an iron foundry, and a machine shop. The company was sold to William H. Baldwin, Jr. in 1847, who owned a Baltimore dry goods firm. In the early 20th century, the company became Baldwin, Leslie and Company, and the mill was expanded. A decade later the Baldwin family erected a stone community hall for the town and constructed a large group of tenant houses. From 1923 to 1941 the Carroll Baldwin Memorial Community Hall served as a movie theatre. For a brief period, the Maryland State Police set up an barracks in 1927-1929 leased from the Savage Manufacturing Company before relocating to Waterloo. By 1941 the company employed 325 people, and during World War II, produced 400,000 pounds of cotton duck a month. In 1948 the mill closed, and in the 1950s it spent a brief period being used to manufacture Christmas ornaments before closing permanently and converted for commercial use. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1975. ==See also== *List of Howard County properties in the Maryland Historical Trust *Commodore Joshua Barney House *Savage Mill *Savage Mill Trail *Bollman Truss Railroad Bridge == Gallery == Image:Savage Mill House Dec 08.JPGThe 1859 Mansion House also went by Company House, or Proprietor House for William H.

In 2002, it became part of the Irish Tarmac Rally Championship in addition to the British Rally Championship. The most successful drivers in the history of the rally include the five-time winner Mark Higgins and the four-time winners Tony Pond and Russell Brookes.

The school was founded by Professor and Mrs. Russell C. Calhoun in 1897. Eatonville was one of the first African American towns to incorporate in the United States. It closed in 2010. Both the professor and his wife attended the Tuskegee Institute, of which the husband was a graduate. In the spring of 1898, along with the help of friends and relatives, Mr. E C. Hungerford donated to the school of land. Mr. Hungerford of Chester, CT. owned a winter home in nearby Maitland, Florida. The land was donated in memory of his late doctor son, Robert, who died due to yellow fever. Robert had cared for a sick African American boy who no one else would help, even when Robert himself became ill. The groundwork for the school was possible thanks to donors not only from Florida, but throughout the country. The first cash donation for Hungerford was given by Miss Mary Brown of Winter Park, and the second was $400 was through Booker T. Washington of Tuskegee. Later on Mr. George B. Cluett, the head manufacturer of Troy, New York, donated $8,000 towards the construction of a second building, and an additional $4,000 towards the purchase of an orange grove near campus. Although Cluett Hall was burned in 1922, it was replaced by a stone structure bearing the same name only a year and a half later. Cluett also contributed a major sum towards the dining hall, which he himself insisted be named Calhoun Hall. Additionally, he gave $500 annually towards expenses for a number of years. By 1927, the school had expanded significantly. Originally only able to support a handful of students, the school now had over 100 boarding pupils, a number of day students, and also carried night classes for adults. A private school, Hungerford required each citizen to make personal arrangements in order to attend the institution. By 1938, Orange County began making arrangements for African American High School students of Winter Park to attend Hungerford, and commuted daily to the school by bus. Hungerford was a private school, offering grades 6 through 12 with dorms for both girls and boys. The institution was equipped with a \\"dining hall, chapel, library, manual training shops, laundry, home economics laboratory, barn, farm land and facilities for teaching business subjects.\\"(Hall) It embraced both college preparatory and vocational, including subjects such as English, Latin, history, general science, biology, algebra, geometry, manual training (industrial arts), and home economics. The school also taught typing, bookkeeping, agriculture and physical education. As the 20th century progressed, classes in technical subjects such as mechanical drawing and radio were added. As for extracurricular activities, Hungerford took part in interschool sports, such as football, basketball and track. To instill responsibility, students were assigned \\"jobs and chores\\" outside of the classroom. These tasks involved helping maintain the school's dairy, chicken coops, gardens, classrooms and dormitories. To give back to the communities of Eatonville and Winter Park for their involvement, it had weekly Sunday afternoon Choral Concerts that were open to the public. In 1950, the Hungerford School became a public school administered by the Orange County School Board. The old, original campus buildings were replaced by new buildings. Today, the school still occupies a large parcel of land in Eatonville, just on the east side of the Interstate 4. The school closed its doors in 2010. ==Alumni== Deacon Jones who played football, baseball, and basketball at Hungerford High Schoolhttps://www.florida-backroads- travel.com/florida-black-football-pioneers.html ==ReferencesAdditional sources== * Clyde W.

Sulpiz Boiserée (2 August 1783 - 2 May 1854) was a German art collector and art historian. With his brother Melchior he formed a collection that ultimately formed the basis of that of the Alte Pinakothek. He played a key role in the completion of Cologne Cathedral. ==Life== Boisserée was born in Cologne on 2 August 1783, into a wealthy family having their origins in Huy, Belgium from where they migrated to Cologne in the 18th century. After his mother and father died in 1790 and 1792, Boisserée was raised by his grandmother during the Napoleonic occupation of Cologne. He was expected to continue the family business while his younger brother, Melchior, was expected to become a scientist. In 1799, at the age of 16, Boisserée attended school in Hamburg, where he discovered his interest in art. After he returned to Cologne, Boisserée, his friend Johann Baptist Bertram and his brother Melchior began to systematically collect and save medieval paintings from the secularization processes at that time, initially with a focus on paintings of German and Dutch origins. In 1803, the brothers went to Paris, where they studied the works on show at the Musée Napoleon at the Louvre, which had been greatly enriched through Napoleon’s looting of art from abroad. In Paris they became disciples of the romantic theorist Friedrich Schlegel with whom they visited Belgium and Switzerland in 1804-5. ==Collecting== In 1804, alarmed by the nationalisation of church property and its destruction through sales, the Boisserée brothers began to collect medieval art, motivated as much by the desire to save it as to possess it. Melchior concentrated on acquisition and Sulpiz on research. Boisserée developed a new theory of the history of German painting, rejecting the idea that it had evolved gradually from crude beginnings; he proposed instead that a refined medieval style, ultimately derived from Byzantine prototypes had flourished, until the art was revolutionised by Jan van Eyck. In 1810 the brothers put their collection on public display in a palace in Heidelberg, attracting enthusiastic attention from Romantic circles. Schlegel was especially enthusiastic. Goethe, who also visited the collection was, with his classical sympathies, more reserved, although he was still prepared to write a preface for Boisserée's essay Altdeutsche Baukunst (1817). The brothers closed their museum in 1819. Boisserée wrote a catalogue of the collection, commissioning Johann Nepomuk Strixner to document the works in a series of lithographs, which were published between 1821 and 1840. In 1827 Georg von Dillis, the director of the royal collection of Ludwig I of Bavaria, bought the complete collection. Bertram and the Boisserée brothers followed it to Munich, and in 1835 Boisserée was appointed general curator of sculptural monuments in Bavaria, and the museum was finally opened as the Alte Pinakothek. The Boisserée collection, still in the Alte Pinakothek, includes the \\"Columba altarpiece\\" (1455) by Rogier van der Weyden (which Boisserée believed to be by van Eyck), Cardinal Charles of Bourbon, Archbishop of Lyon by the Master of Moulins, the Seven Joys of the Virgin (1480) by Hans Memling, and the \\"Pearl of Brabant\\" (1465) by Dieric Bouts the elder. ==Cologne Cathedral== Engraving of Cologne Cathedral by Christian Friedrich Traugott Duttenhofer for Boisserée's Ansichten, Risse und einzelne Teile des Domes von Köln (1823–31) Boisserée spent much of his time campaigning for the restoration and completion of Cologne Cathedral, where construction had come to a halt during the Reformation. Soon after settling in Heidelberg in 1810 he commissioned a survey of the building, and a set of drawings which were eventually published as engravings. Following the end of the Napoleonic wars, he managed to acquire, separately, the two halves of an enormous late 13th- century drawing, showing the original design for the west end, including the unbuilt north-west tower and west gable, and whole of the south-west tower, which had been only partially constructed . This drawing is now known as \\"Plan F\\". He was able to interest Crown Prince Frederick William of Prussia (later King Frederick William IV) in the project, and in 1817 the prince commissioned a report from the architect Karl Friedrich Schinkel. Work on the cathedral was eventually resumed in 1842, and the building was completed towards the end of the 19th century. ==Last years== The brothers eventually returned to the Rhineland from Munich, settling in Bonn in 1845. Boisserée died there on 2 May 1854, Melchior having predeceased him three years earlier. ==References * Category:1783 births Category:1854 deaths Category:People from Cologne Category:German art collectors Category:18th-century art collectors Category:19th-century art collectors ","title":"Sulpiz Boisserée"},{"id":"20380665","text":"Ian Stokes was an Irish FIFA-level soccer referee from Dublin.

There are some difficulties of grammar and intelligibility between dialects, with the Kamona dialect being unintelligible to the others.

Sapir (1971) classified it as an isolate within the West Atlantic family. However, Segerer showed that this is primarily due to unrecognized sound changes, and that Bijago is in fact close to the Bak languages.

His maternal grandfather was the keeper of Antiquities at the National Museum of Denmark, Copenhagen and an expert on the Bronze Age. After moving to England aged six, Lars was educated at Wyggeston Grammar School for Boys in Leicester, England, before studying for an undergraduate degree in Archaeology and Anthropology at Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge. ==Career== In 1977, a year after graduating, Tharp began working as an auctioneer at Sotheby's, where he specialised in European and Chinese ceramics. Tharp continued to work with Sotheby's for sixteen years, becoming a director in 1983. He left to form his own company Lars Tharp Ltd in 1993. In 2008 he was appointed the Director of the Foundling Museum in London, and Visiting Professor at De Montfort University, Leicester. Today (2015) he represents the Foundling Museum as its Ambassador, and as Hogarth Curator. Tharp is also well known for his regular appearances (1986 to present) as a ceramics expert on the British antiques programme Antiques Roadshow. Tharp explained the appeal of the programme as follows: > \\"The joy of The Antiques Roadshow is its variety -as well as the possibility > that someone may bring something along used as a dog's bowl or an umbrella > stand which turns out to be worth a fortune.\\" Representing Gonville & Caius College, Cambridge, he joined fellow Caians Helen Castor, Mark Damazer (captain) and Quentin Stafford-Fraser to win the Alumni University Challenge 2013. Tharp is a noted William Hogarth enthusiast. Noting The artist's theatrical use of ceramics in his paintings and prints he wrote Hogarth's China to accompany an exhibition timed to commemorate the artist's tercentenary (1997). The exhibition was expanded and ran at Wedgwood in the following year. Tharp devised three further exhibitions for York Museum Trust under the umbrella 'Celebrating Ceramics' (2003). He was a member of YMT's steering group setting up their Centre of Ceramic Art (CoCA). Tharp has received two Honorary Doctorates: from De Montfort University (HonDArt); and from Leicester University (HonDLitt) and was elected Fellow of the Society of Antiquaries of London in 2010. He serves on the court of England's oldest recorded guild, the Worshipful Company of Weavers (est. by 1130AD). An accredited speaker for (inter alia) The Arts Society (NADFAS), Tharp lectures throughout Europe, Asia and Australasia and leads cultural tours to China, Dresden, Scandinavia and within the UK. ==Personal life== Tharp lives in Leicestershire with his wife Gillian Block, whom he married in 1983. They have two daughters. Apart from antiques, Tharp has a particular interest in music, having played the cello since the age of eight. He also lists travel among his interests, leading cultural tours in Britain, China and Scandinavia. ==Media appearancesTelevision=== All BBC unless stated: * Quizeum (2015) – panellist * University Challenge (Alumni) – panellist Gonville & Caius College, Cambridge (series winner, 2013/4) * One Man and his Pug -in search of Hogarth's 'Trump' (2013 * China in Six Easy Pieces (2013) – presenter, writer * Treasures of Chinese Porcelain (2011) – presenter, co-writer * Fragile History of Ceramics: Handmade in Britain (2011) – expert * The Antiques Roadshow (1986–present) – expert * The Real Collector's Guide (1995) – presenter (Channel One, London) * Antiques Inspectors (1997, 1999) – expert * Inside Antiques (2004) – presenter * Castle in the Country (2004–2008) – expert ===Radio=== * Hidden Treasures (1998–2002) – chairman/ co-writer * Out of the Fire (2000) – presenter * For What It's Worth (2002–2006) – presenter * Archive Hour (Radio 4): Men in Bow Ties (2007) – presenter * On the China Trail (2007) – presenter * Earth to Earth: Potted Immortality (2009) – presenter * Twenty Minutes: There's Something About the Cello (2011) – presenter * A journey around Hans Christian Andersen (2005 – co-presenter with Michael Rosen) ==Publications== * The Little, Brown Illustrated Encyclopaedia of Antiques (ed. with Paul Atterbury), 1994 * Hogarth's China: Hogarth's Paintings and Eighteenth-century Ceramics, 1997 * Reader's Digest: Treasures in Your Home (with David Battie) * How to Spot a Fake, 1999 * A-Z of 20th Century Antiques (ed.), 2000 ==References *Official website *De Montfort University Category:1954 births Category:Living people Category:Danish emigrants to England Category:People from Copenhagen Category:People educated at Wyggeston Grammar School for Boys Category:Alumni of Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge Category:English curators Category:Antiques experts Category:Fellows of the Society of Antiquaries of London Category:People from Leicestershire ","title":"Lars Tharp"},{"id":"20380793","text":"This is a list of things named after Barack Obama, the 44th President of the United States.

The Greek Revival main house was built in 1833 by James Innes Thornton. The house was placed on the National Register of Historic Places on May 10, 1984. ==History== James Innes Thornton was born October 28, 1800, at the Thornton family plantation known as Fall Hill, in Fredericksburg, Virginia. He was educated at Washington and Lee University and then emigrated to Huntsville, Alabama. He began to practice law there in 1820. He was elected as Alabama's third secretary of state in 1824 and remained in that position until 1834. After this he retired from public life and became a planter in Greene County. Thornton married Mary Amelia Glover in 1825, daughter of Allen and Sarah Norwood Glover of Demopolis. They had two children. Her brother, Williamson Allen Glover, developed the neighboring plantation known as Rosemount. Mary died after only a few years. In 1831, Thornton remarried to Anne Amelia Smith of Dumfries, Virginia. Anne died in 1864. He then remarried in 1870 for a third and final time to Mrs. Sarah Williams Gould Gowdy, daughter of William Proctor and Eliza Chotard Gould of the Hill of Howth in Boligee. Thornton died at Thornhill on September 13, 1877. Regarding the Thornton connection to George Washington, Mildred Washington Gregory, George Washington's paternal aunt and godmother, had three daughters who married three Thornton brothers. Mildred Gregory's daughter Frances (circ. 1720-1790)(first cousin of George Washington) married Col. Francis Thornton III (circ. 1711-1748) of Fall Hill. They were the great- grandparents of James Innes Thornton. Thornhill was developed by Thornton as a cotton plantation in the early 1830s and extended over . According to the diary of Josiah Gorgas, in talking with Thornton at Thornhill on Tuesday, June 6, 1865, less than two months after the end of the Civil War, Thornton \\"oppos(ed) ... the doctrine of secession and necessary deduction that we fought so valiantly (in the War) and bled so freely in a cause radically wrong.\\" ==Architecture== The plantation schoolhouse at Thornhill, built circa 1845. William Nichols is believed to be the architect of the main house at Thornhill, hired in 1832 by Thornton. Nichols was made the state architect of Alabama in 1827. He is known for designing the original campus of the University of Alabama and now-destroyed Alabama State Capitol building at Tuscaloosa and the former Mississippi State Capitol building in Jackson, Mississippi. He is also believed to be the original architect of Rosemount, neighbor to Thornhill. Thornton served as Alabama's secretary of state from 1824 to 1834 and would have been very aware of Nichols and his work. The main house at Thornhill was completed by 1833. The monumental two-story portico with six Ionic columns was added circa 1850. David Rinehart Anthony, of Eutaw, is believed to be the builder who made the portico addition and second story balcony (crisscrossed lattice railing). The house measures wide. Inside is a wide by long central hall with a fine spiral staircase at the back. There are two rooms to either side. The left front room was the parlor, with the dining room behind it. On the front right was the master bedroom with the plantation office behind it. Upstairs is a matching hall and four bedrooms. All eight rooms are square. The downstairs rooms have ceilings. The upstairs ceilings are . Originally there was a brick kitchen behind the house, it later burned. Additions were made to the original structure from circa 1890 to 1949. They were razed in 1994 and rebuilt to better match the original intent of the house. The house and grounds were extensively recorded by the Historic American Buildings Survey in 1934. The plantation schoolhouse was constructed circa 1845. The Thornton children, as well as neighboring plantation children, were taught there. Surrounding the schoolhouse are 230-year-old post oaks. ==Family Cemetery== The main staircase at the rear of the downstairs central hall. Gate to the family cemetery in September 2011, following damage from a tornado on the grounds. Buried in the family cemetery, located a few hundred feet east of the main house, are: *James Innes Thornton (October 28, 1800 - September 13, 1877) *Anne Amelia Smith Thornton (February 14, 1812 - August 2, 1864), his second wife. She had two sisters who married Virginians and came to live in Greene County.

The younger sister, Sally Innes Smith, married Colonel George Willis and spent the spring and fall at their Greene County home, \\"Ben Lomond\\", on their semi- annual journeys between their home in Virginia, and their winter home in Florida. The homes of these three sisters, \\"Thornhill\\", \\"Morven\\", and \\"Ben Lomond\\" were quite near each other. Morven was on the same ridge as Thornhill (north one mile), and Ben Lomond was on the ridge across the road from Thornhill (northwest 1/2 mile). *James Innes Thornton Jr. (December 1, 1835 - December 12, 1837), his son. *Fitzgerald Thornton (October 6, 1837 - July 6, 1939), his son. *Catherine (Kate) Marshall Thornton (September 30, 1842 - October 27, 1870), his daughter.

Rhodes, the governor of Ohio, in 1977, at the opening of the Ohio State Fair in Columbus, Ohio.Rhodes Opens Fair, gets 'creamed' by KSU Group, Associated Press, The Daily Reporter, 17 August 1977 ==Biography== Steve Conliff attended Miami University of Ohio, where he worked extensively with the National Mobilization Committee to End the War in Vietnam, known as \\"the mobe.\\" It was during his time with the mobe that he began to question the effectiveness of 'politics as usual' and at about the same time, met up with the Youth International Party (Yippies).Martin Jezer, Yippies and the Mobe, The Nation, October 3, 1988, Vol. 247 Issue 8, p 283-285 It was as a newly-converted Yippie that Conliff moved to Columbus, Ohio, in 1970, briefly attending Ohio State University. Most of his activities revolved around politics and political organizing; he was a gifted and tireless organizer. One of his first experiences passing out anti-war leaflets at a local campus burger-joint got him arrested for vagrancy; he immediately challenged the constitutionality of the vagrancy laws as discriminatory against youth and poor people. In the summer of 1970, Steve Conliff started his first Yippie publication, Purple Berries--which later morphed into the publication Sour Grapes.SOUR GRAPES cover Youth International Party, Columbus, OH, 1974 Conliff was also one of the founders of the Columbus Free Press (to which he contributed up until his passing) and the public- education-critical Subversive Scholastic (1978–84).

(Note: no relation to the present owners of the magazine of the same name). A tribal descendant, Conliff presented papers detailing Mohican Indian history on the Stockbridge-Munsee Reservation (2001) at the New York State Museum in Albany (2004).Steven E. Conliff (1949 - 2006) He also contributed American Indian ethnography to Notable Native Americans (Gale 1995)and Volume 1 of the Gale Encyclopedia of Native American Tribes (Gale 1998). Steve Conliff was an important leader of the Yippies' second wave, which included well-known activists such as Tom Forcade, Ben Masel,(obituary of Yippie Ben Masel humorously describes Conliff's appearance on Missouri talk radio to get him out of jail) A.J. Weberman, Aron Kay (another famous pie thrower), A comprehensive history of political pie- throwing; cites the Yippies at some length, mentions Conliff and interviews Kay. David Peel, and Dana Beal. He was also the transatlantic coordinator of the Rock Against Racism USA campaign of 1979, helping to organize concerts in Columbus, Dayton, Madison, Detroit, Chicago, and New York City.Alice Torbush, Daisy Deadhead, Rock Against Racism USA - Tour Dates & Concert Calender, Overthrow/Yipster Times, p. 12-14, April 1979 Illustration : Overthrow cover: ROCK AGAINST RACISM issue, April 1979 Like Neal Cassady and similar charismatic personalities of the counterculture, it is hard to quantify the nearly-metaphysical impact Steve Conliff had on activists around him; besides storytelling and history-keeping, his great gifts were to inspire, encourage and engage. ==The Pie and the Gubernatorial Campaign== Poster advertising Yippie-sponsored Smoke-In at Ohio State University, April 29, 1978. This event also served as an unofficial \\"Conliff for Governor\\" rally. Steve Conliff's decision to throw a pie at Governor Rhodes was due to Rhodes' direct role in the Kent State shootings; particularly 1) the ordering of Ohio National Guard troops onto campus, and 2) his angry speech given the day before the shootings (May 3, 1970) to assembled news media. Rhodes' infamous speech was said to inflame conservatives as well as the guardsmen occupying campus, thereby lighting the fuse of an already-incendiary situation: > We have seen here at the City of Kent especially, probably the most vicious > form of campus-oriented violence yet perpetrated by dissident groups and > their allies in the State of Ohio ... these people just move from one campus > to the other and terrorize a community. They're worse than the Brown Shirts > and the communist element and also the Night Riders and the vigilantes. > They're the worst type of people that we harbor in America. And I want to > say that they're not going to take over the campus. And the campus now is > going to be part of the County and the State of Ohio. In 1977, the Kent State University Administration decided to build a gymnasium on the exact site of the Kent State shootings, where there was already a small but respectful memorial to the four slain students erected by B'nai B'rith. As a result, all hell broke loose; there were numerous demonstrations and an infamous \\"Tent City\\" erected on the site that eventually had to be bulldozed down, its 193 inhabitants forcibly removed and arrested. It was in this carnival atmosphere that the pieing of Governor James Rhodes took place.Kent State: Remembering the Tragedy, editorial, The Michigan Daily, p. 4, 11 May 1978. After pieing Rhodes and the generally-positive reaction, Conliff decided to run for governor against Rhodes, as a Republican.Rhodes Only Major Officeholder Facing Primary Foe, editorial, Akron Beacon Journal, 26 March 1978 This campaign wasn't treated very seriously by Ohio media, but gave Conliff access to various conservative venues in which he delivered anti-war, anti-capitalist and pro-marijuana speeches to decidedly-unfriendly audiences with aplomb, which he seemed to enjoy: > Yippie Conliff says he's too young to serve as governor even if elected, but > sees no problem with the state not having a governor.Wilson, Steve, Field > Pared As Primary Deadline Passes, Cincinnati Enquirer, 24 March 1978 When his Lieutenant Governor candidate, yippie Leatrice Urbanowicz, was thrown off the GOP ballot for being a registered Democrat, that was also an occasion for more Yippie hoopla.Call, Michael, Security is Heavy as State Fair Opens, Akron Beacon Journal, 15 August, 1978 ==Zorba the Freak== One of Conliff's continuing characters throughout his work was an alter ego, \\"the Leader of the Street People\\", named Zorba the Freak. Zorba liked to dish about other Yippies (who often recognized themselves in his stories) and became locally legendary, as well as an inside joke among the Yippies. According to Columbus poet- activist Steve Abbott: > In journalism, historically, columnists have created alter egos who they > supposedly interview but who speak for them. Finley Peter Dunne did Mr. > Dooley. Mike Royko did Slats Grobnik. And William Raspberry always had the > taxicab driver in Washington. Conliff had someone called Zorba the > Freak—incredibly funny, incredibly well-written pieces that combine satire > and commentary. Ohio State Lantern reporter during his gubernatorial campaign, 1978 ==Blacklisted News== With Dana Beal and the New Yippie Book Collective, Conliff published the 733-page anthology Blacklisted News: Secret Histories from Chicago 1968 to 1984, forward by William Kunstler. Steve Conliff wrote over half of this volume, a detailed chronicle of specific Yippie actions all over the world (in the middle section titled \\"The Dreaded Yippie Curse\\") and a colorful collection of underground posters, jeremiads, essays, news clippings, comics, photos, articles, reviews and other counter-cultural history. ==Personal life== Conliff met artist Suzan Bird in 1970, while she was working in the hippie enclave of Pearl Alley, adjacent to the OSU campus: > He was selling Purple Berries, and he would come by E.G. Leather on Pearl > Alley trying to get ads. It was one of the old hippie shops. I worked there > at the time, so I would sit on the porch and talk to him, and we got to know > each other fairly well just sitting and chatting. The two married in 1973 and had three sons. Bird's art work often accompanied Conliff's written pieces, especially in Purple Berries and Sour Grapes.

It was founded in the city of Pressburg, Austrian Empire (today Bratislava, Slovakia) by Rabbi Moshe Sofer (known as the Chasam Sofer or Chatam Sofer ) and was considered the largest Yeshiva since the time of the Babylonian Talmud. ==LeadershipRabbi Moshe Sofer (Chassam Sofer)=== Some sources document its establishment in 1803 whilst others cite 1806. The Yeshiva was known as The Chassam Sofer Yeshiva, or simply as Pressburg Yeshiva. The Pressburg Yeshiva was run as an autonomous institution, without the intervention of the community.The Story of the Jewish Community in Bratislava - The Pressburg Yeshiva, Yad Vashem. Retrieved 22 December 2013. Unlike Yeshivas in Czarist Russia which were forced to operate clandestinely, the Pressburg Yeshiva was recognized by the Austro-Hungarian Empire whose emperor Franz Joseph I sympathized and respected the Jews and their leader Rabbi Sofer. The Yeshiva was licensed by the Minister of Education of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. Under the law, the school required the four upper grades to study secular studies. These secular studies were not taught in the yeshiva, but students attended and took exams at another Jewish school in Pressburg run by the orthodox Jewish community. All of the yeshiva's students were exempted from military service; most of the military rabbis who served in the Austro- Hungarian Army were graduates of the Pressburg Yeshiva, and held officers’ ranks. The Yeshiva was founded at the height of the Age of Enlightenment and surge of the Jewish Haskalah movement. As such, the Chassam Sofer stood at the forefront against any reform to traditional Judaism and trained his many students to maintain strict observance of Torah and Shulchan Aruch. This yeshiva produced hundreds of future leaders of Austro-Hungarian Jewry who made great influence on the general traditional orthodox and future Charedi Judaism.

Upon Moses Sofer's death on October 3, 1839, his son, Rabbi Avraham Shmuel Binyamin (known as the Ksav Sofer) succeeded him as Rosh Yeshiva. Like his father, Rabbi Samuel Binyamin was a man of great Talmudic knowledge and of great character. Even the Emperor Franz Joseph, was impressed by him and recognized the Yeshiva as an official theological college. This status exempted students from military service. Amongst his students were: * Rabbi Reuven Chaim Klein (1826–1873) Author of Shenos Chaim Chaim. * Rabbi Shmuel Ehrenfeld (1835–1883), (Chasan Sofer) (grandson) * Rabbi Jacob Koppel Reich (1838–1929):he:יעקב קופל רייך * Rabbi Yosef Chaim Sonnenfeld [1848–1932] * Rabbi Dr. Hillel Klein (1849–1926) (Honorary president of the Agudas Harabanim, president of Agudath Israel of America, treasurer of Ezras Torah, Nassi of Kolel Shomrei Hachomos in Jerusalem and vice-president of the Union of Orthodox Jewish Congregations of America) === Rabbi Simcha Bunim Sofer (Shevet Sofer) === Upon Rabbi Shmuel Binyamin's death on December 31, 1871, his son, Rabbi Simcha Bunim Sofer (known as the Shevet Sofer) assumed both the positions of Rav of Pressburg and rosh yeshiva of the Pressburg Yeshiva which number some 400 students at the time. The Tiferess Shabboss Society was established in 1883 by students of the Pressburg Yeshiva. The society aimed at awakening learning competition between the Yeshiva students. Every Shabbat, one of the young men was chosen to give a \\"shiur\\" on the subject being learnt in the yeshiva. In 1903 a booklet was published by the Tiferess Shabboss Society, bearing its own name. This book names some 240 students who were learning at the Pressburg Yeshiva at that time.

The First World War and the resultant breakup of the Habsburg Empire brought tumultuous times to the Yeshiva. Pressburg became Bratislava and passed to the dominion of the new country Czechoslovakia. Countries such as Hungary, Austria, Germany and Poland hampered efforts of students trying to reach the Yeshiva with difficulties attaining passports and visas. Nonetheless, the Yeshiva flourished and continued to operate. After the Czech crises of 1938 and Hitler’s invasion of the country, Rabbi Akiva fled Hungary. Upon the advice of his uncle, Rabbi Shimon Sofer of Erlau, he escaped to Switzerland and from there to Jerusalem, where he re-established the yeshiva in the Kiryat Moshe neighborhood.

It is one of several video games released as WiiWare through the Wii Shop Channel. It was released in North America on February 16, 2009 and in Japan on April 7, 2009. ==Gameplay== Gameplay in Evasive Space Evasive Space is an action game with 3D graphics procedurally generated by High Voltage Software's Quantum3 game engine. Often erroneously labeled as a classic-style shooter, players guide their ship by using the Wii Remote's infrared pointer to avoid obstacles and enemies and collect items and power-ups. The controls are simple: the player points the cursor in the direction they wish to travel and depress the throttle (B button) to move. The further the cursor is from the ship, the faster it travels. When the ship hits a wall or obstacle, it becomes stunned momentarily. Obstacles include enemy turrets, black holes, asteroids, and narrow environments which restrict the player's movement. Items include Energy Cells responsible for powering the ship, Chronospheres that rewind back 5 seconds to the mission timer, and Diodes that can unlock up to six ship upgrades, the first of which being an energy shield that protects the ship from damage. Some levels are completed by collecting a set number of items, and other require the player to guide their ship to the end of the level before a time limit expires. ===Multiplayer=== Six multiplayer modes are included in the game, which allows up to four people to compete with each other offline. The game also includes a Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection leaderboard feature for players to compare the time scores they receive after successfully completing levels. ==Plot== Evasive Space focuses on the character Konki, the Stellar Guardian, who must regain the Constellation Stones from Dr. Dark Matter and his band of space thieves. By recovering the scattered stones, Konki can restore light to the galaxy. The story plays out across 20 levels divided into four different environments. ==Reception== Evasive Space has received mixed reviews. Destructoid awarded the game an 8/10, saying that it \\"looks and feels very polished\\" and is an \\"interesting title with fun gameplay.\\" IGN gave the game a 6.9/10, citing issues with the responsiveness of the controls and sometimes frustrating level design. 1UP.com called it clever and smartly designed but potentially frustrating (a \\"rage machine\\") for some players. WiiWare World thought the game had a few good ideas but overall was marred by a \\"frustratingly obtuse\\" control scheme. ==References *High Voltage Software official website *Evasive Space official website Category:2009 video games Category:Action video games Category:WiiWare games Category:Wii-only games Category:Wii Wi-Fi games Category:Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection games Category:Wii games Category:High Voltage Software games Category:Video games developed in the United States ","title":"Evasive Space"},{"id":"20380987","text":"Abas Ermenji (12 December 1913 - 13 March 2003) was an Albanian politician, historian and nationalist fighter with social democratic views who opposed the Albanian Monarchy and Communism. ==History== Ermenji was born in the village of Ermenj, Skrapar on 12 December 1913.Abas Ermenji, Nje jete per Shqiperine He was educated in the Berat elementary and middle school.

Kojoyan's Children's Fine Arts School. After completing H.Kojoyan's school (1959 to 1964) he enrolled at the Terlemezian's Fine Arts College where he displayed an exceptional talent and interest towards the portraiture of a woman with great success. ==Art student== After graduating from the college, Carlos was accepted into Yerevan's State Institute of Theatrical and Fine Arts where he attended from 1968 to 1975. While a student at the state institute, he participated in several inter-republic exhibitions. His working years at the Yerevan's National Theatre of Opera and Ballet have been enriched with numerous new friendships with celebrities in the art world, who in turn have left a favorable influence on the development of the artist's personality. Beginning from the children's fine art school and continuing through the end of the university Carlos has gone through a vast educational growth based on scrupulous study of classical arts. However, the artist feels that he is still learning. The artist's own intense search for own style between national/oriental flat surfaces and the western classical/3-dimensional paintings ended with the victory of the latter. The transition towards the classical method and its strengthening first appeared in the landscapes full of poetry and romantism. Starting in the early 80's he had no second thoughts about his chosen path. ==State and Professional artist== From 1979 Carlos was a member of USSR Artists Union for which he had to have participated in at least 3 all-union and several inter-republic art exhibitions. His first individual show was in Romania, Bucharest where he was representing the Soviet Union. Along his landscapes, Carlos displayed different compositions and received an approval from the art critics for his excellent contributions to the field of arts. The media also welcomed him into the chain of international exhibitions. In 1990, Carlos’ individual exhibition was opened in Los Angeles with unprecedented success. ==Inspiration== The woman's image and the plasticity of her body began to allure and dominate the artist's canvases and his imagination. His style is deeply influenced by neo-classicism and from this comes his ethereal and non-saturated pallet. His main characters and the themes are expressions of the artist's inner world, his worries and new searches. Each canvas unrolls itself as a stage where the artist invites the viewer to accompany him in the performance. He is greatly helped by the unprecedented and mystical light from somewhere within the canvas. The detailed background intensifies the illusion of depth. Non-vibrant from the first glance, the paintings demand some time from the viewer to discern the meanings. Once the veil has fallen to the side and the viewer has penetrated into the depth of the painting, he is unlikely to be willing to separate and lose the momentum of unexpected mysticism. Carlos ‘individual exhibition in 1998 found its worthy place at the National Gallery of Armenia and marked a beginning of a new era in the creative life of the artist. == Exhibitions == Personal Exhibitions 2004 - Sheraton Universal Hotel, Universal City USA 1996 - “Meridien Trainon Hall” UAE 1996 - “Pnevmatiku Kentro” Greece Athens 1993 - “Krunk” Art Gallery Yerevan Armenia 1990 - “Agbu” Art Gallery Los-Angeles USA 1988 - Bienale-Bulgaria Sofia 1988 - “Caminul Arte” Gallery Bucharest Romania 1985 - Exhibition-Simposium “Ussr-Czechoslovakia” Gurzuph Crimea 2007 - \\"Gabone Gallery\\" Yerevan, Armenia 2007 - \\"Design Shop\\" Glendale, CA, USA 2008 - \\"Mural Cultural Center\\" Paris, France Group Exhibitions 1997 - “The Central House of Painters” Moscow 1997 - “Studio 22” Belgium Brussels 1993 - “Planet Earth #33 Inc” New York USA 1990 - “Nakhamkin” Gallery San-Francisco 1989 - “The Days of Armenia in Luxemburg” The Culture Center of Luxemburg 1987 - “The Days of Armenia in Sweden” The Culture Center of Sweden 1984 - “Ussr- Czechoslovakia” Moscow 1983 - “Armenian Colours-83” Los-Angeles-Toronto- Montréal 1982 - “Poland-Ussr” Poland 1981 - “Finland-Ussr” Finland 1980 - Tashkent Uzbekistan == Public Collections == * Ministry Of Culture-Armenian Picture Gallery Kirovakan * Museum Of Modern Art-Yerevan * Russian Ministry Of Culture-Exhibition Board Moscow * Regional Picture Gallery Omsk * Municipal Picture Gallery Zviozdny * Regional Picture Gallery Semipalatinsk * Art Academy Bucharest Romania * St. Lazarus Island Museum Venice Italy * Municipality of Luxemburg * Municipality of Athens Greece ==Media== Newspapers * Art (Arvest) -1988 Bucharest, Romania * Hollywood Gazette - 1990 Los Angeles, Ca, Usa * Greek Diplomatic Life-1996 Greece, Athens * Vremya - 1996 Yerevan, Armenia * Hayk - 1997 Yerevan, Armenia * Efir - 1997 Yerevan Armenia * Respublika Armenia -1998 Yerevan, Armenia * Mir I Soglasie - 2002 Yerevan, Armenia * Novaya Vremya-2003 Yerevan, Armenia * Golos Armenii (Voice Of Armenia) - 2004 Yerevan, Armenia * Noah's Ark-2004 Moscow, Russia * Haraj Paris-2008 Paris, France Magazines * Art Expressions - 1999 The Netherlands * Musa, Muse Art Magazine - 2000 Los Angeles, Ca, Usa * Art Associates Art & Concept - The Netherlands * Armenian Palette - 2007 Yerevan, Armenia ==External links== * Category:1948 births Category:Living people Category:Artists from Yerevan Category:Armenian painters ","title":"Carlos Sayadyan"},{"id":"20381218","text":"Khaled Hussain Butt (born 7 August 1976) is a Pakistani-born cricketer who has played two One Day Internationals for Hong Kong. == External links == *CricketArchive *Cricinfo Category:1976 births Category:Living people Category:Hong Kong One Day International cricketers Category:Hong Kong cricketers Category:Pakistani emigrants to Hong Kong ","title":"Hussain Butt"},{"id":"20381234","text":"Sir Francis Joseph Campbell (October 9, 1832 – June 30, 1914) was a British- American anti-slavery campaigner, teacher and also the co-founder of the Royal National College for the Blind in the United Kingdom. He was born near Winchester, Tennessee, USA, and lost his sight at the age of five following an accident. A talented musician, he taught music and at the age of 16 was appointed music master at the Tennessee School for the Blind and later went on to become musical director at the Wisconsin School for the Blind. He also taught at the Perkins Institute for the Blind in Watertown, Massachusetts. It was while he was teaching at Wisconsin that his anti-slavery views became publicly known and at one point he was given twenty four hours to renounce them or face being hanged. He refused but was spared death because of public sympathy for his blindness. He would later become a frequent traveller between the United States and the United Kingdom and Europe, and in 1871 helped Thomas Armitage to establish The Royal Normal College and Academy for the Blind near Crystal Palace in London. It was during a visit to London after studying in Berlin that he called on Dr. Armitage with a letter of introduction and was invited to dinner. Over dinner, Campbell told his host about his plans to establish a training college for the blind in the United States, but Armitage urged him to make London its home. The college was founded with two students, and Campbell was its first principal. The college continues to the present day, and is now known as the Royal National College for the Blind. Campbell was also the first blind person to climb Mont Blanc. In his later years he became a naturalised Briton and in 1909 was knighted as a Knight Bachelor by King Edward VII. He retired as principal of RNC in 1912 and was succeeded by his son, Guy Marshall Campbell. ==Legacy== The Francis Joseph Campbell Award is an annual award given by the American Library Association for any person who has made an outstanding contribution to the advancement of library services for the blind.

The founding members were: Kim Bowers (as Wikky Malone) (guitar, vocals), Liz Payne (as Rosy Glo, Lou Marvel, Belle) (guitar, vocals), Tania Bowers (as Tania May) (bass guitar, vocals), Melanie Thurgar (as Finnius) (drums). and Angela Morosin, vocals. In chemistry, the letters (spdfgh...) are used when determining the number of electrons in the shells of an atom (the letters denote the first six states of orbital angular momentum in atomic physics). TV Week magazine called it \\"the dumbest name in Australian rock\\". The band name came about this way: Liz Payne's brother Geoff and friend Paul Hillard were studying for their Higher School Certificate physics exams, and recited \\"spdfgh\\" to aid recall of this topic. Soon this became the title of a song (written by Hillard, Geoff Payne and Crowe) for Geoff's band Wilson Tuckey Goes To Hobart. Liz also wrote songs for Wilson Tuckey Goes To Hobart, as did Mel Thurgar, and both performed with WTGTH in the early to mid-'90s. Kim and Tania Bowers also featured briefly in WTGTH before all the girls decided to pursue spdfgh only. The original members got started playing together at St. Patrick's College (Campbelltown, southwest of Sydney). A very early gig was the St Patrick's School disco and featured the unreleased \\"Help! Help! It's a dance party!\\" The band and Morosin parted company soon after high school. In their early days to get noticed they would travel to Sydney, sneak into soundchecks of bands they liked and just start playing. Payne left after the group had recorded Leave Me Like This and Sally Russell (later known as New Buffalo, Sally Seltmann) briefly replaced her on guitar in mid-1995. Russell, still a member of power pop group Lustre 4, had co-written the track \\"You Made Me\\" with Tania (later known as Via Tania) for that album. Russell continued her work with Lustre 4 and was replaced in Spdfgh by Christina Hannaford by the time the album was issued. The band had songs included on the soundtracks of the films Love and Other Catastrophes and The Well. Since breaking up, the members have pursued new projects. * Kim Bowers recorded some electronic tracks under the name of 'Deep In Sound', which appeared on the soundtrack to the 1999 Australian film, Fresh Air. Most recently she has been working with her sister Candy Bowers on hip-hop group / theatrical performers Sista She. * Tania Bowers went on to Godstar, contributed songs to the Fresh Air soundtrack under the name of \\"Sunday\\", and has since released an album under of the name Via Tania—with help from her husband, sound engineer Casey Rice. * Payne went on to Rocket and Sonic Emotion Explosion, both with former Gerling guitarist Brad Herdson.

However, Dar would have less impact during the tournament proper. Against his home nation Pakistan, he had no wickets in 8 overs bowled (for 34 runs conceded) and scored 14 runs in a 155 run defeat. He then went for 55 runs in 10 bowled overs and posted 4 runs in a 256 run thrashing by India. Dar returned to form during the 2009 ICC World Cricket League Division Three. In the second game, against division powerhouse Afghanistan, he bowled a wicketless but economical spell of 32 runs conceded from his 10 overs before nearly rescuing Hong Kong's batting from a perilous 90 for eight with a quickfire 49 off 38 balls though they both fell short. In the fourth game, against Uganda, the spinner took 4 for 30 as he caused a middle-order collapse that put Hong Kong in command. As a batsman, he was powerless to stop a narrow single run defeat which sent their opponents to the World Cup Qualifier instead of them. In the 2011 Hong Kong Cricket Sixes he was instrumental in helping Hong Kong reach the knockout stage, bowling well and hitting 33 from nine balls against South Africa in a 5 wicket win. Dar was a decisive contributor in Hong Kong's run to the 2011 ACC Twenty20 Cup final, earning three man-of-the-match awards along the way. One of those came during an edgy semi-final against Oman in which his 76 not out with the bat rescued the team from a precarious position of 74-6 to win the game. Though they went on to lose the final to Afghanistan, Hong Kong still qualified for the 2012 ICC World Twenty20 Qualifier. Totalling 202 runs and 11 wickets over the tournament, the veteran was named Player of the Tournament, as his desire to win was praised by his coach Charlie Burke . ===2013 ICC World Twenty20 Qualifier=== Having missed some preceding tournaments for personal reasons, Dar returned for the 2013 ICC World Twenty20 Qualifier. He took 17 wickets at 13.05 apiece throughout the tournament (second overall), including two separate 4 for 17 hauls against respectively the USA and Canada. Most importantly, he contributed 22 with the bat before taking 3 for 26 against in the 5th place playoff semi-final against Papua New Guinea, which Hong Kong won to qualify for the World Twenty20 for the first time in their history. For his contributions, Dar made ESPNcricinfo.com 's team of the tournament selection. On a negative note, during the same 2013 Qualifier, Dar was twice reported for chucking (illegal bowling action). Though he was cleared the first time by the Hong Kong Cricket Association, the second report meant he would have to undergo further scrutiny, this time by the ICC. Their experts concluded that all of the bowler's deliveries (stock delivery, quicker one and arm ball) exceeded the 15 degrees elbow extension tolerated. He was then banned from bowling for a year starting from January 2014. ===2014 World Twenty20=== Despite his bowling ban, Dar was selected for the 2014 World Twenty20 as a specialist batsman. Having been left out of the first group game (a dismal defeat to Nepal), Dar returned for the second against Afghanistan. He failed in his Twenty20 International debut, posting only 3 runs, with Hong Kong doing no better as they slumped to another defeat that eliminated them from tournament contention. Nevertheless, he starred in the dead-rubber game against tournament hosts Bangladesh. Having bowled out Bangladesh for a meagre 108, Hong Kong then faltered and lost five wickets for 50, at which time Dar came out to the crease. Dar proceeded to give the initiative back to Hong Kong with a few boundaries, before colliding with Bangladesh captain Mushfiqur Rahim in the 15th over while scrambling to avoid a run-out. After a break to receive treatment, Dar soldiered on and – still chasing 26 runs off 24 balls – smashed 15 runs off a Farhad Reza over to edge closer to victory. Though he was bowled before reaching the target, his 27-ball 36 was instrumental in handing Hong Kong a historic first competitive win over a Test-playing nation. Though Dar couldn't really bask in the glory as he had to leave Bangladesh soon after to return to Hong Kong, he later revelled in the feat, proudly mentioning to a reporter that he had appeared in 732 stories in newspapers and web publications around the world. ==Playing style== An all-rounder, his playing style has been described as “substance-over-style” with “nothing graceful or stylish” about it. Batting with an “unorthodox front-on stance”, he privileges hard hitting over precision, at times launching “ugly swipes”. His left-arm spin is also said to “come out awkwardly” and lack deceit, with Dar preferring to dismiss the batsman rather than contain him. ==Personal== After moving to Hong Kong, Dar both played and worked (as a coach) for the Little Sai Wan Cricket Club until 2013 when the team's sponsor Diasqua - a diamond company - offered him a job. Despite playing internationally for Hong Kong, Dar does not have a Hong Kong SAR passport and maintains his Pakistani citizenship. This caused a problem prior to the 2011 ICC World Cricket League Division Two played in Dubai as it meant he had to travel 4,800 kilometres to Karachi to obtain a new electronic passport (along with five other players). ==References External links == *Profile at CricketArchive.com Retrieved 19 February 2017 *Profile at ESPNCricinfo.com Retrieved 19 February 2017 Category:1974 births Category:Living people Category:Gujranwala cricketers Category:Hong Kong cricketers Category:Hong Kong One Day International cricketers Category:Hong Kong Twenty20 International cricketers Category:Pakistani cricketers Category:Pakistani emigrants to Hong Kong Category:Cricketers from Gujranwala Category:Cricketers from Gujrat Category:Sportspeople of Pakistani descent ","title":"Munir Dar (cricketer)"},{"id":"20381510","text":"Family photo, date unknown Mayhew Beckwith (October 14, 1798 - April 7, 1871) was a merchant and political figure in Nova Scotia.

After launch Ypiranga was found to be notoriously unsteady at sea. This was remedied by installing two water tanks near the fore and after masts on the upper deck, connected by a flying bridge. The flow of water between the tanks, controlled by regulating the movement of the air in the side branches, served to steady the ship in rough water, and it gained the reputation of being particularly steady after installation. Ypiranga's sister ship Corcovada was similarly outfitted. In September 1910, Ypiranga carried the German crews from the battleships and back from the Ottoman Empire, after the ships had been sold to the Ottoman Navy.Hildebrand Röhr & Steinmetz, p. 191 The ousted Mexican dictator Porfirio Díaz, accompanied by his family, boarded Ypiranga at the docks of Veracruz, on Wednesday, May 31, 1911, bound for Europe.

In 1921 Anchor Line assumed control of the ship and renamed it Assyria, used in their Bombay run. A Portuguese company, Companhia Colonial de Navegação, purchased the ship in 1929 and renamed it Colonial for use in their Lisbon-Angola/Portuguese East Africa run.

He was raised in Belgium, where his father, Prince Franz Xaver of Hohenzollern-Hechingen (1719–1765), was an imperial officer. From his mother, Princess Anna Maria of Hoensbroech-Geulle ( 8 May 1729 - 26 September 1798), Prince Hermann inherited his Dutch holdings. His first spouse, Countess Louise of Merode-Westerloo, died after only one year of marriage. From his second wife, Princess Maximiliane of Gavre, Marquise d'Aysseau, he inherited one billion Francs. In 1779, Prince Hermann married his third wife, the Countess Maria Antonia of Waldburg-Zeil zu Wurzach. After the transfer of the left bank of the Rhein to France as part of war reparations, he tried to find money for the beautification of Hechingen and the improvement of roads. All of his activities served to increase the fortune of his House. Prince Hermann was an Imperial-Field Marshal General and a Prussian Lieutenant General. The situation of the princedom between the time of the Second Congress of Rastatt and the end of the Empire, the Prince's debut was actually quite relaxed. Soon after his ascension to power, he held peace talks with the local land holders, and came to a mutual agreement June, 1795 in Hechingen with the local land holders. He then disbanded, the daily joyful homage festivals from a couple of free movements of all subjects of bondage. The village of Bisingen missed out on this because it would not enter into the agreement. In addition the village would not pay homage (since that time the Bisingers carry the nickname \\"Nichthuldiger“ meaning those who don’t pay homage.) The prince confined his hunts to three of his lands, outside of these lands, animals could be hunted by the peasants. The lands not within set borders were parceled out or sold. The serfdom, as far as legal dependents protected by the prince was concerned, was abolished. This weighed heavily upon them, however. The monarchy was appointed five percent of the estate. The subjects obtained the right, in to appoint representatives by general election. These representatives would have the right to control taxes and the right to make to represent the common people. The prince gave Jews, upon the suggestion of his Jewish adviser, Jakob Kaulla (see also Karoline Kaulla) permission to reside in his princedom for forty years in exchange for remuneration to the high chamber. The prince succeeded in the settlement of the conflicts with his subjects within a few short weeks. Prince Hermann was not generally a man of compromise, he was a bizarre personality, his nature was suspicious and that of a micro-manager; he concerned himself with the external details of administration. He loved, according to the prevailing taste of the time, being alone in nature, particularly in his hunting lodge at Friedrichsthal. He was a businesslike, vigilant patriarch who managed to enjoy one last high point of princely absolutism. The Confederation of the Rhine Acts rescued the independent existence of the Hechinger Princes, however he was in no way given an extension of power, neither based on landowner nor on rights of sovereignty. He perceived this as an affront and as discrimination against him, the eldest line of his House. Deeply afflicted by the humiliation of Prussia and Austria, Prince Hermann Friedrich Otto died on 2 November 1810. == Marriages and issue == Prince Hermann Friedrich Otto was married three times. On 18 November 1773 he married Countess Louise of Merode-Westerloo (* 28 September 1747; † 14 November 1774), the daughter of Jean Guillaume von Merode-Westerloo (1722–1763). He had one daughter with her: * Luise Juliane Konstantine, (* 1 November 1774 in Maastricht; † 7 May 1846 in Glogau) ∞ 1806 Baron Ludwig Heer von der Burg (* 16 December 1776; † 13 October 1833) On 15 February 1775 he married Princess Maximiliane of Gavre (* 30 March 1753; † 6 August 1778), daughter of Charles I Alexandre, 1st Prince de Gavre his second marriage. The couple had one son: * Friedrich Hermann Otto, Prince of Hohenzollern-Hechingen (1776–1838) ∞ Princess Pauline Biron von Kurland, Princess of Sagan (1782–1845) His third wife became the Princess Maria Antonia of Waldburg-Zeil zu Wurzach on 26 July 1779 (* 6 June 1753; † 25 October 1814). The couple bore the following children: * Maria Antonia Philippine, (* 8 February 1781 in Dagstuhl; † 25 December 1831 The Hague) ∞ 12 July 1803 Count Friedrich Ludwig von Waldburg-Capustigall (* 25 October 1776; † 18 August 1844) * Maria Theresia Franziska, (* 11 August 1784 in Dagstuhl; † 6 September 1784 in Dagstuhl) * Franziska Theresia Karoline, (* 19 January 1786 in Dagstuhl; † 1810) * Maria Maximiliane Antonie (* 3 November 1787 in Wadern; † 30 March 1865 Baden bei Wien); : ∞ 25 February 1811 Count Eberhard von Waldburg-Wurzach (* 14 June 1778; † 18 January 1814) : ∞ 12 June 1817 Klemens Josef Gf von Lodron-Laterano (* 23 September 1789; † + 3 September 1861) * Josephine (* 14 May 1790 in Wadern; † 25 March 1856 in Vienna) : ∞ 31 August 1811 Count Ladislaus Festetics de Tolna (* 15 June 1785; † 12 May 1846) Category:House of Hohenzollern-Hechingen Category:Princes of Hohenzollern-Hechingen Category:People from Oberpullendorf District Category:German expatriates in Hungary Category:German expatriates in Belgium Category:1751 births Category:1810 deaths ","title":"Hermann, Prince of Hohenzollern-Hechingen"},{"id":"20381600","text":"Armour Boulevard, Armour, or 35th Street is a major west-east main street that runs in Kansas City, Missouri, USA, from Broadway Boulevard to The Paseo. It is named in honor of Simeon B.

The park board acquired the land in 1899. In 1900 the park board named the new boulevard for Simeon B. Armour, a member of the first official park board and the head of the Kansas City branch of the Armour Meat Packing Industry. Landscape architect George Kessler designed Armour Boulevard according to the standard 100-foot right-of-way proposed in the first Board of Park Commissioners report of 1893. Grading and paving occurred during 1900-01. In 1928 Armour Boulevard was widened and the curbside row of trees was removed; during the next year the roadway was repaved with asphaltic concrete. Simeon Armour was a powerful supporter of Kansas City's new Parks and Boulevard System and he held a position on the Park Board from 1892 to 1901. The monumental character of West Armour Boulevard was established by thirteen colonnaded apartment blocks designed by John McKecknie. ==References== * How Armour Boulevard Got Its Name *Armour Blvd. Historic Survey *Armour Boulevard Pictures Category:Streets in Kansas City, Missouri Category:Transportation in Kansas City, Missouri ","title":"Armour Boulevard"},{"id":"20381653","text":"Mónica Sánchez Mónica Mariel Sánchez (born.

It is named after John Bremner, who in 1884-1885 was the first non-native person to live in the area and who prospected for gold along the Bremner River. Located just to the north of the Bremner River, it was the scene of an important placer gold discovery in 1902, and played a key role in the history of the Copper River Basin. Only a few miners struck it rich, but the resulting demand for materials and supplies helped establish regional transportation networks, encouraged supporting industries, and hastened the exploration and settlement of the entire region. While small-scale placer mining continued for over forty years, lode development was largely confined to the period between 1934 and 1941, the district's most significant era. The Bremner Historic Mining District embodies its period of twentieth-century mining, illustrating both its mining process and its evolutionary sequence. Unusually complete, it retains virtually all of its historic components, including an important placer site, a camp, four discrete lode mines, a mill, and an associated transportation network. The Golconda Mining Company site, which contains a campsite, an elaborate ditch, and extensive piles of hand-stacked cobble, provides an example of an early placer mining system. The Goldconda complex includes two airstrips dating to the 1930s. The Yellow Band mining camp is one of the region's most complete, not only containing the typical housing and office facilities, but a sophisticated hydroelectric system. This camp is also significant for its association with Asa C. Baldwin, a distinguished regional explorer, surveyor, and mining engineer.Ghost Towns and Mines , accessed June 24, 1011. While working for the U.S. Geodetic Survey, Baldwin completed the first American marine survey of Kodiak and the Aleutian Islands in 1909. From 1910-13, he served as a field officer with the U.S.-Canadian International Boundary Survey. Over the years, Baldwin worked locally as a consulting engineer, where, among other activities, he advised the Kennecott Copper Company and the Copper River and Northwestern Railway. Baldwin began prospecting in the Bremner District in the early 1930s, and from 1936 to 1940, was president of the Yellow Band Mining Company. He acquired the Bremner Gold Mining Company holdings in 1939. Lucky Girl, Grand Prize, Sheriff, and Yellow Band Mines are examples of remote underground mining operations. With each containing a variety of buildings and structures. While Lucky Girl mill is now ruinous due to repeated avalanche strikes, its operating machinery remains intact and in most cases in situ. In addition to Baldwin, the Bremner district is associated with aviator Merle \\"Mudhole\\" Smith, who started flying supplies for the Cordova Air Service in the 1930s, and who became stuck on the upper Golconda strip. Smith operated Cordova Air Service until 1968, when it merged with Alaska Airlines. ==See also== *Kennecott, Alaska, a National Historic Landmark mining town *National Register of Historic Places listings in Wrangell–St. Elias National Park and Preserve *National Register of Historic Places listings in Valdez-Cordova Census Area, Alaska ==References== Category:National Register of Historic Places in Wrangell–St. Elias National Park and Preserve Category:Gold mining in Alaska Category:Historic districts on the National Register of Historic Places in Alaska Category:Industrial buildings and structures on the National Register of Historic Places in Alaska Category:Mines in Alaska Category:National Register of Historic Places in Valdez–Cordova Census Area, Alaska ","title":"Bremner Historic Mining District"},{"id":"20381743","text":"Adrian Ponce (born 12 March 1971) is the manager for the Higher Education outreach group and former Deputy Section Manager for the Planetary Science and Life Detection Section at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, and is also a visiting faculty member at Caltech.Caltech directory He received a BS in Chemistry from Michigan State University, and then went on to obtain a PhD in Chemistry from Caltech in 2000.Science – Planetary Science: People: Adrian Ponce == Research == The Ponce Group is an interdisciplinary team composed of members from both the California Institute of Technology and the NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory that integrates microbiology, chemistry, biophotonics, and engineering principles to develop chemical and biological detection schemes and corresponding analytical instrumentation.The Ponce Group == Publications == *Fast sterility assessment with germinable endospore biodosimetry.

French policies during the 19th century encouraged the dispossession of Muslim farmers who were pushed off their land to allow their land to be handed over to European settlers, who usually took the best land for themselves.Evans, Martin Algeria: France's Undeclared War, Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2012 pages 23-24. This led to much resentment on the part of the Algerian Muslims who complained the prosperous farms owned by the pied- noirs had once belonged to their families. Within the pied-noir community, there was always in the words of the British historian Martin Evans a \\"siege mentality\\" where the colons saw themselves as surrounded by a hostile Muslim population that was perpetually ready to massacre them at the first chance.Evans, Martin Algeria: France's Undeclared War, Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2012 pages 32-33. The Muslim population of Algeria, whether Arab or Berber, were treated as second-class citizens and despite the fact that Algeria was considered an integral part of France were not allowed to vote.Evans, Martin Algeria: France's Undeclared War, Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2012 page 20. Even after the Muslim population was given the right to vote in 1944, many Muslims complained of widespread discrimination with the electoral districts gerrymandered to ensure the Pied Noirs held the majority of the seats despite being a minority. Increasingly many Algerian Muslims started to reach the conclusion that the French would never allow them real equality, and the solution was independence for Algeria. By mid-20th century, the pied-noir families had been living in Algeria for over a century, and for them Algeria was the only home they had ever known; the place they had been born in, grew up and where they planned to spend the rest of their lives. For the colons, the possibility of Algerian independence was regarded with concern as they feared what their fate would be under Muslim rule. Relations between the pied-noirs and the Muslims were indifferent at best, and despite the harmony on the surface, both communities believed the worse about the other. ==Prelude== The Algerian War had begun on November 1, 1954 when the first major attack of the FLN was launched, consisting of \\"scores of scores of spectacular attacks\\".Aussaresses, Paul The Battle of the Casbah, New York: Enigma Books, 2006 page 1 The conflict began to escalate, as evidenced by the remarks of the Socialist Minister of the Interior, François Mitterrand: \\"I will not agree to negotiate with the enemies of the homeland. The only negotiation is war!\\"Aussaresses, Paul The Battle of the Casbah, New York: Enigma Books, 2006 page 2 The French adopted an increasingly aggressive policy in Algeria, and in early March 1955, the French government of Prime Minister Pierre Mendes-France was replaced by that of Edgar Faure. To help combat the insurgency, General Paul Aussaresses was dispatched to restart the intelligence unit from scratch, which had been disbanded during peacetime.Aussaresses, Paul The Battle of the Casbah, New York: Enigma Books, 2006 page 11 Aussaresses set up the unit and started to collect intelligence and establish a network of informants and field agents. The FLN had been hard- pressed by the relentless attacks on the French Army, and two leaders of the FLN, namely Zighoud Youcef and Lakhdar Ben Tobbal decided that a spectacularly brutal operation in Philippeville would not only relieve the pressure on the FLN forces elsewhere, but also attract worldwide attention to their cause and create a situation in Algeria where one could either be for the FLN or the French.Evans, Martin Algeria: France's Undeclared War, Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2012 page 140. Even as late as 1955, there still moderates within the Muslim community were not prepared to give up on the French, and who believed it still possible for the Muslims to become French citizens in practice as well as in theory. Youcef and Tobbal wanted to create a situation to polarize the Muslim community between those who supported the French and those supported the FLN, and to discredit the moderates who still believed that if Paris changed its policies the Muslims could become full French citizens. The Philippeville region had been chosen because tensions between the Muslims and pied-noirs were especially intense in the area which was well known in Algeria as a hotbed of ethnic and religious hatred and because many Muslims had lost family members during the Sétif and Guelma massacre of 8 May 1945 in the adjuring Constantine department.Githens-Mazer, Jonathan \\"The Blowback of Repression and the Dynamics of North African Radicalization\\" pages 1015-1029 from International Affairs, Vol. 85, No. 5, September 2009 page 1019. ==The battle== Aussaresses was surprised by a set of attacks the FLN launched on June 18, 1955, which his intelligence unit had not heard anything about beforehand. Aussaresses knew that the FLN was planning something when one of his informers, an Arab baker in Philippeville, told him that he used to sell on average a sack of flour every three days, but was now selling two tons of flour everyday, to men whom he did not know and only paid cash. From this, Aussaresses deducted that the spike in flour sales must have been because the FLN was concentrating men in the hills above Philippeville, which only mean an operation was due to start soon. After this, a more proactive policy was adopted, which resulted in the discovery of the FLN's plan to launch a massive frontal assault on August 20 at noon, with the primary objective of taking Philippeville. The FLN was not powerful enough to capture a large city, such as the capital at Algiers, but Philippeville was a mid-sized town and an important port city. In the days immediately before the attack, FLN commandos took up positions in cellars within the town, while several thousand more fellagha prepared to attack the French garrison troops in Philippeville, which numbered about 400.Aussaresses, Paul The Battle of the Casbah, New York: Enigma Books, 2006 page 35. The French quietly prepared for the anticipated attack, not even acting against the commandos who they knew were there, for fear that the FLN would realize their plan had been discovered. Fighting first broke out during an hour before the planned attack, when the deputy police commissioner in charge of public safety, Superintendent Filiberti, took four of his men outside the town to make an unrelated arrest. The small police detachment was ambushed by about 500 fellagha, but was able to escape to Philippeville. The main attack began on the town around noon, and the fellagha. attacked without any regard for their own safety. The FLN had informed the local Muslims that an Egyptian force had landed on the coast and soon the French would be expelled from Algeria. Chanting \\"jihad!\\" over and over again, thousands of local Muslim peasants armed with clubs, sticks, axes, knives and pitchforks descended upon Philippeville with the intention of killing as many of the French as possible.Evans, Martin Algeria: France's Undeclared War, Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2012 pages 140-141. The FLN attacking forces and hidden commandos came up against unexpected French defensive positions both within and around the town. One hundred and thirty- four fellagha were killed in the streets of Philippeville, and several hundred more wounded. Seventy-one French civilians were killed by the FLN as well as were 52 Muslims. The latter included prominent local politicians as well as other Muslims considered as collaborators by the FLN.Adam Shatz, “The Torture of Algiers,” NY Review of Books, volume 49, number 18, 21 November 2002. While the main assault was going on, there were also side actions in the countryside around Constantine. One was an attack on El-Halia, a sulphur-mining community where 130 Europeans had lived with about 2,000 Algerian Muslims in peace. President Gamal Abdel Nasser of Egypt was an outspoken supporter of the FLN and Radio Cairo regularly broadcast messages calling on the Arabs of Algeria to rise up against the French. Shortly before noon on 20 August four groups of fifteen to twenty FLN commandos each, accompanied by local Muslims went from house to house in the European quarter of the village. Thirty-seven European civilians were killed, including ten children.Evans, Martin Algeria: France's Undeclared War, Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2012 page 141. A further thirteen were left for dead. The men were off working in the mines when the fellagha attacked and some were dragged from their cars and killed as they returned home for their midday meal. Only six families who barricaded themselves in a single house with sporting weapons escaped unscathed. Weapons at the mine were locked up because the person in charge of the key had gone to the beach. Three hours later, French paratroops from Philippeville arrived in El-Halia supported by military aircraft. Initially ordered to take no prisoners, the paratroops subsequently gathered about 150 Muslims together and the next morning carried out a mass execution of them.Horne, Alistair A Savage War of Peace, New York, NYRB Classics, 2006 page 121Gisèle Halimi, Milk for the Orange Tree, page 114 After the French forces had crushed the FLN, a series of killing of Muslims broke out with French troops summarily executing 80 Muslim Algerians at Philippeville in public who were suspected of being involved in the killings of the pied-noirs. At the funeral of one pied-noir woman killed by the FLN, her husband gave an emotional eulogy about his love for his wife followed up by an explicit description of how she was first gang- raped, then had her vagina mutilated before being allowed to bleed to death. After the funeral ended, members of the funeral party as they left the church lynched the first seven Muslims on the street that they encountered. The lynchings were the beginning of a pogrom where the pied-noirs went about revenging the massacre committed by the FLN by killing as many Muslims as possible while the French Army stood by and watched. The massacre of hundreds of Muslims by pied-noir vigilantes in Philippville's football stadium was the highlight of the killings with many colons coming out to watch the killings.Githens-Mazer, Jonathan \\"The Blowback of Repression and the Dynamics of North African Radicalization\\" pages 1015-1029 from International Affairs, Vol. 85, No. 5, September 2009 page 1020. Hundreds of Muslims fled to the mountains to escape the massacre and many of the men joined the Armée de Libération Nationale (ALN), the armed wing of the FLN. The French Army made no attempt to stop the killings and afterwards, the French authorities made no effort to prosecute those colons who killed Muslims during the pogrom. ==Aftermath== The effect of the killings by both sides in Philippville, El- Halia and elsewhere was to destroy any hope of inter-communal reconciliation. For many in the Muslim community of Algeria, the massacre committed by the pied-noirs against the Muslims with the French Army standing by indifferently, proved the FLN's claim that the French were all irredeemably racist and that there was no hope of the French ever extending equality to the Muslims of Algeria. One prominent Algerian Muslim leader, Mohammed Bendjelloul who had long believed it was possible for the Algerian Muslims to become French citizens just like any other traveled to Paris on 3 September 1955 to tell the French Premier Edgar Faure that almost nobody within the Algerian Muslim community now believed that the French would ever treat the Algerian Muslims equally, and that thousands of young Muslim men were now joining the FLN.Evans, Martin Algeria: France's Undeclared War, Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2012 page 142. A group of 61 prominent Algerian Muslim leaders, who had were considered to be moderates who believed it was possible for Algerian Muslims to become French by adopting the French language wrote a public declaration \\"condemning the blind repression\\" in Philippeville, declared that French government's policy of integration of Algerian Muslims to be a fraud, and wrote that thanks to the massacre of Muslims in Philippeville that the vast majority of Algerians were now nationalists who believed in the \\"idée nationale algérienne\\" (\\"Algerian national ideal\\"). The colons of Philippeville produced a pamphlet about the \\"French Algeria's martyrs\\" that was sent to all of the mayors in metropolitan France. The pamphlet included gruesome photos of the pied-noirs killed in Philippville with pictures of men castrated, women disemboweled and children mutilated before being hacked to death along with the simple message that to negotiate with the FLN would be an insult to those pied-noirs butchered in Philippville. For the pied-noirs who were the most fervent believers in Algérie française, there could be no negotiations with the brutally terroristic FLN, which they wanted to see ruthlessly crushed. Already there were fears within the pied-noir community that not everyone in metropolitan France was as committed to the ideal of Algérie française as they would have liked. The French administration allowed pied-noir settlers to arm themselves and form self-defense units, measures which had been vetoed by the reformist governor-general Jacques Soustelle a few months earlier. Visiting Philippeville Soustelle recorded that now \\"the Europeans saw terrorists in every Muslim, the Muslims feared reprisals by the Europeans.\\" European vigilante groups are reported to have subsequently carried out summary killings of Muslims. A defeat in military terms, the Battle of Philippeville was politically a great victory for the FLN as the operation achieved its purpose, namely in the words of the French historian C.R Ageron it \\"provoked the desired split between Muslims and Europeans...the latter regarding all Muslims as rebels while the Muslims came to regard...the ALN as Mujahadin [The term Mujahideen or mujahadin in the Algerian dialect of Arabic means \\"warriors of Allah\\", describing those who in fight in jihad]. In 1959, in a survey of literature written about the Algerian War from 1954 to the present entitled A Survey of French North-West Africa, the British journalist Neville Barbour described a \\"moat of blood\\" created at Philippeville that made any sort of understanding between the Muslim and pied-noir communities almost impossible.Brett, Michael \\"Anglo-Saxon Attitudes: The Algerian War of Independence in Retrospect\\" pages 217-235 from The Journal of African History, Vol. 35, No. 2, 1994 page 218. ==Death toll== The French authorities stated that seventy-one Europeans and fifty-two Muslims were killed by the FLN-led mob on 20 August, while 1,273 Muslims died in what Soustelle admitted were \\"severe\\" reprisals. The FLN subsequently claimed that 12,000 Muslims were killedHorne, Alistair A Savage War of Peace, New York, NYRB Classics, 2006 page 122. ==References== Philippeville Category:Massacres of ethnic groups Category:Massacres in Algeria Category:Algerian war crimes Category:August 1955 events Category:Mass murder in 1955 ","title":"Battle of Philippeville"},{"id":"20381787","text":"Mohammad Aman Ali (born 29 September 1989) is a cricketer who has played one One Day International for the United Arab Emirates. == External links == *CricketArchive *Cricinfo Category:1989 births Category:Living people Category:Emirati Muslims Category:United Arab Emirates One Day International cricketers ","title":"Aman Ali (cricketer)"},{"id":"20381806","text":"TV Patrol Caraga (formerly TV Patrol Butuan) was the flagship local news program broadcast of the ABS-CBN Regional Network Group in Butuan City.

It features a community forum, file library, and product reviews. The website is maintained by a group of volunteers and bandwidth and equipment is paid for by donations and advertising. It is one of the world's largest flight simulation websites and provides users access to information and addons for the flight simulator series of games. On May 12, 2009 the website was attacked by a hacker which resulted in a catastrophic loss of data.BBC News - Hackers 'destroy' flight sim site AVSIM was able to fully recover from the hack with the help of IT support from around the world. ==History== The publisher of AVSIM, Tom Allensworth, operated a Bulletin Board System from 1983 until approximately the fall of 1995. Initially named CAPENET because it was located in Cape Cod (a peninsula of Massachusetts) during the early 1980s, it was renamed The Vine (The Virginia Information and Network Exchange) when moved to central Virginia in 1987. These early forays into BBS systems, combined with an early exposure to aviation through flight lessons in the early 1970s, as well as Bruce Artwick's Flight Simulator 1.0, brought about the concept of developing an aviation themed website in the closing months of 1996. The initial concept for AVSIM was the provision of articles and capture images of the flight simulation genre, collated into HTML format as a monthly magazine and packaged into a zip file. This was then made available for download among the major library servers on the Internet, including the file library system run and maintained at the Indiana University of Pennsylvania, which was becoming one of the first major file libraries for flight simulation. The first issue was uploaded to the university and elsewhere on 1 March 1997. With the growth of the flight simulation community, the magazine moved into a continuously updated website in April 1997. The site began listing news items from the flight simulation industry in 1999, and has been doing so ever since. === Reception === The website is popular within the video game genre of flight simulation. Commentators within the flight simulation and aviation community identify the site as a key website within the genre, along with the similar website Flightsim.com. The Alexa traffic website lists Avsim.com as the highest rating flight simulation website on its network, which Avsim.com claim makes them the most visited flight simulation website on the internet. ==Hacking case== On May 12, 2009, AVSIM was attacked by a hacker, resulting in a catastrophic loss of data of the website. Tom Allensworth, CEO and Publisher of AVSIM, explained that the site used two servers to back-up the site's data, but that the hacker deleted the content of both, destroying the ability to use one server to restore the data of the other. The site had not established an external backup system. After AVSIM went offline, Allensworth issued the following announcement: > “We regret to inform the flight simulation community that on Tuesday, May > 12, AVSIM was hacked and effectively destroyed. The method of the hack makes > recovery difficult, if not impossible, to recover from. Both servers, that > was the library / email and web site / forum servers were attacked. AVSIM is > totally offline at this time and we expect to be so for some time to come. > We are not able to predict when we will be back online, if we can come back > at all. We will post more news as we are able to in the coming days and > weeks….” Nevertheless, the recovery process went quicker than most expected. Sections of the site began restoration on May 26, and as of May 28, most of the site has been recovered to its original form, but the file library and some links are still being repaired. The cost of the recovery of the site is about $25,000 to pay for new servers and experts who will recover the files. Most of that cost has been funded through Avsim's donation system and advertisers. Limited service was restored after Memorial Day, 2009. The file library was then tentatively scheduled for reactivation in the first week of June, 2009 following file investigation, debugging, and recompilation. A gradual recovery of the site took place over several days. The servers were replaced, the email addresses and forums were recovered on May 26, and the front page and other elements of the site on May 28. On the 28th it was also announced on the front page that approximately 90% of the file library would be recoverable, and that all Flight Simulator X and Flight Simulator 9 files were intact. The library was brought back online, with more than 95% of the original content, as of July 26. On September 7 AVSIM filed a civil suit in Britain against the person who hacked the organization in May. The AVSIM website issued the following statement: > “Today, September 7th, 2009, AVSIM filed a criminal complaint with the > Police Constabulary of London. We will not name any names, but have > incontravertible evidence of the individual that performed the hack of AVSIM > on May 12th this year. We have protected the forensic evidence and provided > that evidence to the London police. We are committed to bringing justice to > bear on this case... [T]hough we tried to resolve this over the last three > months out of court, giving this person two opportunities to settle with us, > the individual did not avail himself of the opportunity - in fact, he has > ignored our proffers. We are now doing as we promised this person we would > do; ratcheting this up to the next, criminal, level. To the extent that > prudence allow, we will keep you informed of future developments.” As of July 2011 AVSIM have still not updated its users on the situation and it appeared that the matter had been brushed under the carpet given the last few words of the above quote; then, in a retrospective blog post in June 2012,http://www.avsim.com/blog/1/entry-50-avsims-15th-a-retrospective-part-2/ Tom Allensworth, the founder of AVSIM, explained that legal action was ultimately dropped, and that (apparently for unrelated reasons) the alleged hacker subsequently committed suicide.http://www.thenorthernecho.co.uk/news/9505178.Man_took_own_life_days_after_lover_was_busted/ ==Avsim Conference and Exhibition== The website runs a regular conference and exhibition since 1999, most recently titled FANCON, focusing on aviation simulation to showcase flight simulation technology, software, and hardware. This conference has been supported by leading manufacturers and developers in the industry, including Microsoft. Previous conferences have been held each year at a different location from 2002 through to 2007, with the 2007 event held in Bellevue, Washington from November 9 to 11. The event featured sponsorship from a number of major industry organizations, such as NaturalPoint. The website decided not to have a 2008 convention due to the decaying economy and an anticipated reluctance to travel but has announced a social meeting to take place instead. In 2009, AVSIM planned to hold the convention in Dayton, Ohio from September 4 until September 6, at the Wright- Patterson Air Force Base. ==Services== The main focus of the website is providing additional content that users can use within a Flight Simulator, such as aircraft in addition to default planes, scenery, modified airport files, additional AI (artificial intelligence) aircraft (Simulator-controlled air traffic), and programs which modify all of the above. Additionally, the website provides users with reviews of commercial content created for use with a flight simulator such as Microsoft Flight Simulator, X-Plane, and Prepar3D. Full commercial reviews are covered as news items listed on the websites main page. The website's forums are used as a focal point for discussion of reviews, news within the industry, as well as general industry topics. The website has been run completely by volunteers since its opening in 1996. Since the founder's passing, all affairs have been managed by a volunteer Board of Directors consisting of Jim Young, Chuck Jodry,http://www.avsim.com/index.php/AVSIM%20Pages/our_staff.html and Chase Kreznor. The website is monitored and maintained by over 30 volunteers. ===Downloadable content=== Screenshot of Avsim.com homepage in November 2008.

These communities tend to be historically disadvantaged and oppressed. More times than not, individuals belonging to these marginalized groups are also denied access to the schools with abundant resources. Inequality leads to major differences in the educational success or efficiency of these individuals and ultimately suppresses social and economic mobility. See Statistic sections for more information. Measuring educational efficacy varies by country and even provinces/states within the country. Generally, grades, GPA scores, test scores, dropout rates, college entrance statistics, and college completion rates are used to measure educational success. These are measures of an individual's academic performance ability. When determining what should be measured in terms of the educational success of an individual, many scholars and academics suggest that GPA, test scores and other measures of performance ability are not the only useful tools in determining efficacy. In addition to academic performance, attainment of learning objectives, acquisition of desired skills and competencies, satisfaction, persistence, and post-college performance should all be measured and accounted for when determining the educational success of individuals. Scholars argue that academic achievement is only the direct result of attaining learning objectives and acquiring desired skills and competencies. To accurately measure educational efficacy, it is imperative to separate academic achievement because it captures only a student's performance ability and not necessarily their learning or ability to effectively use what they have learned. Much of educational inequality is attributed to economic disparities that often falls along racial lines and much modern conversation about educational equity conflates the two, showing how they are inseparable from residential location and, more recently, language. Educational inequality between white students and minority students continues to perpetuate social and economic inequality.Williams, Belinda, ed. Closing the Achievement Gap: A Vision for Changing Beliefs and Practices. 2nd ed. Alexandria, VA: Association for Supervision and Curriculum Development, 2003. Throughout the world, there have been continuous attempts to reform education at all levels. With different causes that are deeply rooted in history, society, and culture, this inequality is difficult to eradicate. Although difficult, education is vital to society's movement forward. It promotes \\"citizenship, identity, equality of opportunity and social inclusion, social cohesion as well as economic growth and employment\\" and for these reasons, equality is widely promoted. The recognition of global educational inequality has led to the adoption of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goal 4 which promotes inclusive and equitable quality education for all. Unequal educational outcomes are attributed to several variables, including family of origin, gender, and social class. Achievement, earnings, health status, and political participation also contribute to educational inequality within the United States and other countries. ==Family background== In Harvard's \\"Civil Rights Project\\", Lee and Orfield identify family background as the most influential factor in student achievement. A correlation exists between the academic success of parents with the academic success of their children. Only 11% of children from the bottom fifth earn a college degree while 80% of the top fifth earn one. Linked with resources, white students tend to have more educated parents than students from minority families. This translates to a home-life that is more supportive of educational success. This often leads to them receiving more at-home help, have more books in their home, attend more libraries, and engage in more intellectually intensive conversations. Children, then, enter school at different levels. Poor students are behind in verbal memory, vocabulary, math, and reading achievement, and have more behavior problems. This leads to their placement in different level classes that tracks them. These courses almost always demand less from their students, creating a group that is conditioned to lack educational drive. These courses are generally non-college bound and are taught by less qualified teachers. Also, family background influences cultural knowledge and perceptions. Middle class knowledge of norms and customs allows students with this background to better navigate the school system. Parents from this class and above also have social networks that prove to be more beneficial than networks based in lower classes. These connections may help students gain access to the right schools, activities, etc. Additionally, children from poorer families, who are often minorities, come from families that distrust institutions. America's history of racism and discrimination has created a perceived and/or existent ceiling on opportunities for many poor and minority citizens. This ceiling muffles academic inspirations and muffles growth. The recent and drastic increase of Latino immigrants has created another major factor in educational inequality. As more and more students come from families where English is not spoken at home, they often struggle with overcoming a language barrier in addition to simply learning subjects. They more frequently lack assistance at home because it is common for the parents to not understand the work that is in English. Furthermore, research reveals the summer months as a crucial time for the educational development of children. Students from disadvantaged families experience greater losses in skills during summer vacation. Students from lower socioeconomic classes come disproportionately from single-parent homes and dangerous neighborhoods. 15% of white children are raised in single-parent homes and 10% of Asian children are. 27% of Latinos are raised in single- parent homes and 54% of African American children are. Fewer resources, less parental attention, and more stress all influence the performance of children in school. ==Gender== Throughout the world, educational achievement varies by gender. The exact relationship differs across cultural and national contexts. 250px ===Female disadvantage=== Obstacles preventing females' ability to receive a quality education include traditional attitudes towards gender roles, poverty, geographical isolation, gender-based violence, and early marriage and pregnancy. Throughout the world, there is an estimated 7 million more girls than boys out of school. This \\"girls gap\\" is concentrated in several countries including Somalia, Afghanistan, Togo, the Central African Republic and Democratic Republic of the Congo. In the Democratic Republic of the Congo, girls are outnumbered two to one. Socialized gender roles affect females' access to education. For example, in Nigeria, children are socialized into their specific gender roles as soon as their parents know their gender. Men are the preferred gender and are encouraged to engage in computer and scientific learning while women learn domestic skills. These gender roles are deep-rooted within the state, however, with the increase of westernized education within Nigeria, there has been a recent increase in women having the ability to receive an equal education. There is still much to be changed, though. Nigeria still needs policies that encourage educational attainment for men and women based on merit, rather than gender. Females are shown to be at risk of being attacked in at least 15 countries. Attacks can occur because individuals within those countries do not believe women should receive an education. Attacks include kidnappings, bombings, torture, rape, and murder. In Somalia, girls have been abducted. In Colombia, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and Libya students were reported to have been raped and harassed. In Pakistan and Afghanistan, schools and busses have been bombed and gassed. Early marriage affects females' ability to receive an education. \\"The gap separating men and women in the job market remains wide in many countries, whether in the North or the South. With marginal variables between most countries, women have a lower employment rate, are unemployed longer, are paid less, and have less secure jobs.\\" \\"Young women, particularly suffer double discrimination. First for being young, in the difficult phase of transition between training and working life, in an age group that has, on an average, twice the jobless rate or older workers and are at the mercy of employers who exploit them under the pretext of enabling them to acquire professional experience. Secondly, they are discriminated against for being women and are more likely to be offered low paying or low-status jobs.\\" \\"Discrimination is still very much in evidence and education and training policies especially targeting young women are needed to restore a balance.\\" \\"Although young women are increasingly choosing typically 'male' professions, they remain over-represented in traditionally female jobs, such as secretaries, nurses, and underrepresented in jobs with responsibility and the professions.\\" In early grades, boys and girls perform equally in mathematics and science, but boys score higher on advanced mathematics assessments such as the SAT college entrance examination. Girls are also less likely to participate in class discussions and more likely to be silent in the classroom. Some believe that females have a way of thinking and learning that is different than males. Belenky and colleagues (1986) conducted research that found that there was an inconsistency between the kind of knowledge appealing to women and the kind of knowledge being taught in most educational institutions. Another researcher, Gilligan (1982), found that the knowledge appealing to females was caring, interconnection, and sensitivity to the needs of others, while males found separation and individualism appealing. Females are more field-dependent, or group-oriented than males, which could explain why they may experience problems in schools that primarily teach using an individualistic learning environment. As Teresa Rees finds, the variance of women in mathematics and science fields can be explained by the lack of attention paid to the gender dimension in science. Regarding gender differences in academic performance, Buchmann, DiPrete, and McDaniel claim that gender-based accomplishments on standardized tests show the continuation of the “growing male advantage in mathematics scores and growing female advantage in reading scores as they move through school”. Ceci, Williams and Barnett’s research about women’s underrepresentation in science reinforces this claim by saying that women experience “stereotype threat [which] impedes working memory” and as a result receive lower grades in standardized or mathematics tests. Nontheless, Buchmann, DiPrete and McDaniel claim that the decline of traditional gender roles, alongside the positive changes in the labor market that now allow women to get “better-paid positions in occupational sectors” may be the cause for a general incline in women’s educational attainment. ===Male disadvantage=== Schoolgirls in Guinea In 51 countries, girls are enrolled at higher rates than boys. Particularly in Latin America, the difference is attributed to the prominence of gangs and violence attracting male youth. The gangs pull the males in, distracting them from school and causing them to drop out. In some countries, female high school and graduation rates are higher than for males. In the United States for example, 33% more bachelor's degrees were conferred on females than males in 2010–2011.National Center for Education Statistics, Digest of Education Statistics. Retrieved 2017-09-09 This gap is projected to increase to 37% by 2021–2022 and is over 50% for masters and associate degrees. Dropout rates for males have also increased over the years in all racial groups, especially in African Americans. They have exceeded the number of high schools and college dropout rates than any other racial ethnicity for the past 30 years. A majority of the research found that males were primarily the most \\"left behind\\" in education because of higher graduation dropout rates, lower test scores, and failing grades. They found that as males get older, primarily from ages 9 to 17, they are less likely to be labeled \\"proficient\\" in reading and mathematics than girls were. In general, males arrive in kindergarten much less ready and prepared for schooling than females. This creates a gap that continually increases over time into middle and high school. Nationally, there are 113 boys in 9th grade for every 100 girls, and among African American males, there are 123 boys for every 100 girls. States have discovered that 9th grade has become one of the biggest drops out years. Whitmire and Bailey continued their research and looked at the potential for any gender gap change when males and females were faced with the decision of potentially going to college. Females were more likely to go to college and receive bachelor's degrees than males were. From 1971 to about 1981, women were the less fortunate and had lower reported numbers of bachelor's degrees. However, since 1981, males have been at a larger disadvantage and the gap between males and females keeps increasing. Boys are more likely to be disciplined than girls, and are also more likely to be classified as learning disabled. Males of color, especially African American males, experience a high rate of disciplinary actions and suspensions. In 2012, one in five African American males received an out of school suspension. In Asia, males are expected to be the main financial contributor of the family. So many of them go to work right after they become adults physically, which means at the age of around 15 to 17. This is the age they should obtain a high school education. Males get worse grades than females do regardless of year or country examined in most subjects.Daniel Voyer and Susan D.

The male disadvantage in education is independent of inequality in social and economic participation. == Race  United States only === Race and ethnics have played a major role in the inequalities of the American education system. \\"Since its inception, public education in the United States has been beset with questions of which racial or ethnic group should be granted access to schooling.\\" During the early 18th century in most states, African-American students and Mexican American students were barred from attending schools with White Students. This was due to the post effects of the court case Plessy v. Ferguson (1896) where it was decided that educational facilities were allowed to segregate white students from students of color as long as the educational facilities were considered equal. Educational facilities did not follow the federal mandate, in a study taken from 1890 to 1950 of the Southern States per-pupil expenditures (1950s dollars) on instruction varied from Whites to Blacks. On average White students received 17–70 percent more educational expenditures than their Black counterparts. The first Federal legal challenge of these unequal segregated educational systems would occur in California Mendez v. Westminster in 1947 followed by Brown v. Board of Education in 1954. The decision of Brown v. Board of Education would lead to the desegregation of schools by federal law, but the years of lower education, segregation of household salaries between whites and people of color, and racial wealth gaps would leave people of color at a disadvantage to seek proper equal education for generations to come. Differences of academic skills in children of the different race start at an early age, according to National Assessment of Educational Progress there is a remaining gap showing Black and Latino children being able to demonstrate cognitive proficiency compared to their White counterparts. In the data, 89 percent of White children presented the ability to understand written and spoken words while only 79 and 78 percent of Black and Latino children were able to comprehend written and spoken words the trend would continue into ages 4–6. Experts believe that the racial differences in academic achievement fall under three major categories: genetic, cultural, and structural. For example, in the 1980s minorities experienced a cultural phenomenon called \\"fear of acting White\\", minorities would shun and ridicule those in their social groups who had shown a higher intelligence than others. Shown in a graph comparing popularity to grade point average among Blacks, Latinos, and Whites built based on data from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health popularity of White students increased as their grades increased, for Black and Latino student's popularity would drop as grades would rise. Race and ethnics will continue to play a major role in the disbursement of education through the American public school system, through diversity placement programs such as SEO and MLT, grants and social and cultural changes the education gap has slowly been closing between Whites and minorities in more recent years. ==Immigration statusIn the United States=== The Immigrant paradox states that immigrants, who are disadvantaged by inequality, may use their disadvantages as a source of motivation. A study from New York showed that children of immigrant descent outperformed their native student counterparts. The paradox explains that the gratefulness of immigrant children allows them to enjoy academic advantages that may not have been accessible at one time. This in turn allows for more effort and better outcomes from these students. This was also evident in the National Education Longitudinal Study which showed that immigrant children many times outperformed on math and science tests. Grace Keo reported that “evidence of the immigrant advantage was stronger from Asian immigrant families than for youth from Latin American”, which may cause some inequality in itself. This may vary depending on differences between pre and post-migration conditions. In 2010, researchers from Brown University published research on immigrants. Some of their conclusions were that first-generation immigrant children show lower levels of delinquency and bad behaviors than second or third-generation children and that first-generation immigrant children often start behind American-born children in school, but they catch up quickly and have high rates of learning growth. ==Latino students and college preparednessessLatino migration=== In the United States, Latinos are the largest growing population. As of July 1, 2016, Latinos make up 17.8 percent of the U.S. population, making them the largest minority.U.S. Census Bureau. 2017. Annual Estimates of the Resident Population by Sex, Age, Race, and Hispanic Origin for the United States and States: April 1, 2010, to July 1, 2016 People from Latin America migrate to the United States due to their inability to obtain stability, whether it is financial stability or refugee. Their homeland is either dealing with an economic crisis or is involved in a war. The United States capitalizes on the migration of Latin American migrants. With the disadvantage of their legal status, American businesses employ them and pay them an extremely low wage.Gonzalez, J. (2011). Harvest of Empire: A History of Latinos in America. New York, New York: Penguin Books. As of 2013, 87% of undocumented men and 57% undocumented women were a part of the U.S. economy.Capps, R., Bachmeier, J. D., Fix, M., & Van Hook, J. (2013). A demographic, socioeconomic, and health coverage profile of unauthorized immigrants in the United States. Washington, DC: Migration Policy Institute. Diaspora plays a role in Latinos migrating to the United States. Diaspora is the dispersion of any group from their original homeland.Quayson, A. and Daswani, G. (2013) Introduction – Diaspora and Transnationalism, in A Companion to Diaspora and Transnationalism (eds A. Quayson and G. Daswani), Blackwell Publishing Ltd, Oxford, UK. DOI: 10.1002/9781118320792.ch1 New York City holds a substantial quota of the Latino population. More than 2.4 million Latinos inhabit New York City,NYC Planning. 2017. Population Facts. Retrieved from https://www1.nyc.gov/site/planning/data-maps/nyc-population/population- facts.page its largest Latino population being Puerto Ricans followed by Dominicans. A large number of Latinos contributes to the statistic of at least four million of the United States born children having one immigrant parent. Children of immigrant origin are the fastest growing population in the United States. One in every four children come from immigrant families.Hernandez, D.J, Denton, N.A., Macartney, S.E. (2008). Children in Immigrant Families: Looking to America's Future. Social Policy Report. Many Latino communities are constructed around immigrant origins in which play a big part in society. The growth in children of immigrant parents does not go unaware, in a way society and the government accepts it. For example, many undocumented/immigrants can file taxes, children who attend college can provide parents information to obtain financial aid, parent(s) may be eligible for government help through the child, etc. Yet, the lack of knowledge regarding post-secondary education financial help increases the gap of Latino children to restrain from obtaining higher education. ===Education=== In New York City, Mayor De Balsio has implemented 3-K for All, which every child can attend pre-school at the age of three, free of charge.Taylor, K. (2017, April 24) New York City Will Offer Free Preschool for All 3-Year-Olds. New York Times. Retrieved from https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/24/nyregion/de-blasio-pre-k-expansion.html Although children's education is free from K-12 grade, many children with immigrant parents do not take advantage of all the primary education benefits. Children who come from a household that contains at least one immigrant parent, are less likely to attend childhood or preschool programs. ===College preparation=== The preparation of college access to children born in America from immigrant parents pertaining to Latino communities is a complex process. The beginning of the junior year through senior year in high school consists of preparation for college research and application process. For government help towards college tuition such as Financial Aid and Taps, parents or guardian's personal information is needed, this is where doubt and anticipation unravels. The majority of immigrant parents/guardians do not have most of the qualifications required for the application. The focus is to portray the way immigrants and their American born children work around the education system to attain a college education. Due to the influx of the Latino population, there amount of Latino high school students graduates has increased as well.Snyder, T. D., & Dillow, S. A. (2012). Digest of education statistics 2011 (NCES 2012-001). Washington, DC: U.S. Department of Education. Latino students are mainly represented in two-year rather than four-year institutions. This can occur for two reasons: the cost reduction of attending a two-year institution or its close proximity to home. Young teens with a desire to obtain a higher education clash with some limitations due to parent's/guardian's personal information. Many children lack public assistance due to lack of English proficiency of parents which is difficult to fill out forms or applications or simply due to the parent's fear of giving personal information that could identify their status, the same concept applies to Federal Student Aid. Federal Student Aid comes from the federal government in which helps a student pay for educational expenses of college in three possible formats, grant, work-study, and loan. One step of the Federal Aid application requires one or both parent/guardian personal information as well as financial information. This may limit the continuance of the application due to the fear of providing personal information. The chances of young teens entering college reduce when personal information from parents are not given. Many young teens with immigrant parents are part of the minority group in which income is not sufficient to pay college tuition or repay loans with interest. The concept of college as highly expensive makes Latino students less likely to attend a four-year institution or even attend postsecondary education. Approximately 50% of Latinos received financial aid in 2003–2004, but they are still the minority who received the lowest average of the federal awards.Excelencia in Education. (2005). How Latino students pay for college. Retrieved from https://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/ED506050.pdf In addition, loans are not typically granted to them. ===Standardized tests=== In addition to finance scarcity, standardized tests are required when applying to a four- year post educational institution. In the United States, the two examinations that are normally taken are the SATs and ACTs. Latino students do generally take the exam, but from 2011 to 2015, there has been a 50% increase in the number of Latino students taking the ACTs.ACT. (2015). The Condition of College & Career Readiness 2015: Hispanic Students. Retrieved from http://www.act.org/content/dam/act/unsecured/documents/06-24-16-Subcon- Hispanic-Report.pdf As for the SATs, in 2017, 24% of the test takers were identified with Latino/Hispanic. Out of that percentage, only 31 percent met the college-readiness benchmark for both portions of the test (ERW and Math).College Board. (2017). 2017 SAT Suite Annual Report Total Group. Retrieved from https://reports.collegeboard.org/pdf/2017-total-group-sat- suite-assessments-annual-report.pdf ==Rural and inner-city education== Inequalities in rural and inner-city education are large scales systemic inequalities between differing spatial education systems. The study of these differences, especially within rural areas, is relatively new and distinct from the study of educational inequality which focuses on individuals within an educational system. Rural and inner-city students in the United States are under-performing academically compared to their suburban peers. Factors that influence this under-performance include funding, classroom environment, and the lessons taught. Low achievement rates can also be attributed, in part, to the schools themselves. Inner-city and rural students are more likely to live in low-income households and attend schools with fewer resources compared to suburban students. They have also shown to have a less favorable view of education which stems from the values held in their communities and families regarding school, work, and success. When compared to suburban students, rural and inner-city students face similar achievement issues. Teacher-student interactions, the lessons taught, and knowledge about the surrounding community have shown to be important factors in helping offset the deficits faced in inner-city and urban schools. However, drop-out rates are still high within both communities, as a more substantial number of minority students, who often live in these areas, drop-out of high school. A study on inner-city, high school students showed that academic competency during freshman year has a positive impact on graduation rates, meaning that a students' early high school performance can be an indicator of how successful they will be in high school and if they will graduate. With the correct knowledge and understanding of the issues faced by these students, the deficits they face can be overcome. === Standardized tests === Achievement in the United States is often measured using standardized tests. Studies have shown that low performance on standardized tests can have a negative effect on the funding the school receives from the government, and low-income students have been shown to underperform on standardized tests at higher rates than their peers. A study looking at how low test performance affected schools, found that schools that perform below average and are in low income areas can face repercussions that affect school funding and resources. The study also found that the material taught to students is affected by test performance, as schools that have low test scores will often change their curriculum to teach to the test. ===Spatial inequalities=== When looking at spatial inequalities, it is important to look from multiple points of view. Some factors that are commonly included are demographics, community atmosphere, school and family resources, dropout rates, spending per student, and family traits such as parental education. Currently, these, and other dimensions, are broadly grouped into two categories, \\"available resources\\" and \\"investment decisions\\". They each have their own effects, but also may cause and reinforce each other's existence.  School resources  In the same way, some regions of the world have so-called \\"brain drain\\", or the loss of wealthy, skilled, and educated individuals and their families to other countries through immigration, rural and inner-city regions of the United States experience brain drain to sub-urban regions. It has been shown that people become more likely to leave rural areas as their education level increases and less likely as they increase in age. Urban inner-city areas have been decentralizing since the 1950s, losing their human capital. This flight of human capital leaves only the poor and disadvantaged behind to contribute to school funding resulting in school systems that have very limited resources and financial difficulty. The American public school system is one in which the amount of wealth in a school district shapes the quality of the school because schools are primarily funded by local property taxes. As the school system's funding decreases, they are forced to do more with less. This frequently results in decreased student faculty ratios and increased class sizes. Many schools are also forced to cut funding for the arts and enrichment programs which may be vital to academic success. Additionally, with decreased budgets, access to specialty and advanced classes for students who show high potential frequently decreases. A less obvious consequence of financial difficulty is difficulty in attracting new teachers and staff, especially those who are experienced.  Family resources  It has been shown that the socioeconomic status of the family has a large correlation with both the academic achievement and attainment of the student. \\"The income defecates for inner-city students is approximately $14,000 per year and $10,000 per year for the families of those living in the respective areas compared to the average income of families in suburban areas.\\" Though, even within rural areas, there are differences in education and job choisis respective to demographics. More well off sub-urban families can afford to spend money on their children's education in forms such as private schools, private tutoring, home lessons, and increased access to educational materials such as computers, books, educational toys, shows, and literature. Sub-urban families are also frequently able to provide larger amounts of social capital to their kids, such as increased use of \\"proper English\\", exposure to plays and museums, and familiarity with music, dance, and other such programs. Even more, inner-city students are more likely to come from single-parent homes and rural students are more likely to have siblings than their suburban peers decreasing the amount of investment per child their families are able to afford. This notion is called resource dilution which posits that families have finite levels of resources, such as time, energy, and money. When sibship (amount of siblings) increases, resources for each child become diluted.  Investment decisions  Even if families and schools have the same resources available to them, that doesn't mean they will use them in the same way, or to the same extent. Often, people need proof that there is a connection between investing resources and academic success before they do it. Investment decisions are a function of both resources available and political processes, in regard to the distribution of public funds. = To the family = The investment a family puts into their child's education is largely reflective of the value the parent puts on education. The value placed on education is largely a combination of the parent's education level and the visual returns on education in the community the family lives in. Sub-urban families tend to have parents with a much larger amount of education than families in rural and inner-city locations. This allows sub-urban parents to have personal experience with returns on education as well as familiarity with educational systems and processes. In addition, parents can invest and transmit their own cultural capital to their children by taking them to museums, enrolling them in extra-curriculars, or even having educational items in the house. In contrast, parents from rural and urban areas tend to have less education and little personal experience with their returns. The areas they live in also put very little value on education and reduce the incentive to gain it. This leads to families that could afford to invest greater resources in their children's education not to. = To the school = In the same way that a region or community that places little value on education may decrease a parent's willingness to invest in the education of their children, that community can reduce a school's willingness to allocate funding to provide advanced and in- depth educational opportunities for its students. School boards tend to invest resources in response to the demands of the community, and their communities' values have been changed due to the \\"brain drain\\" mentioned previously. ==Gifted and talented education== There is a disproportionate percentage of middle and upper-class White students labeled as gifted and talented compared to lower-class, minority students. Similarly, Asian American students have been over-represented in gifted education programs. In 1992, African Americans were underrepresented in gifted education by 41%, Hispanic American students by 42%, and American Indians by 50%. Conversely, White students were over- represented in gifted education programs by 17% and Asian American minority students being labeled as gifted and talented, but research shows that there is a growing achievement gap between white students and students of color. There is also a growing gap between gifted students from low-income backgrounds and higher-income backgrounds. The reasons for the under- representation of African American, Hispanic American, and American Indian students in gifted and talented programs can be explained by (a) recruitment issues/screening and identifying; and (b) personnel issues. In regards to screening and identifying gifted and talented students, most states use a standardized achievement and aptitude test, which minority students have a history of performing poorly on. Arguments against standardized tests claim that they are culturally biased, favoring White students, require a certain mastery of the English language, and can lack cultural sensitivity in terms of format and presentation. In regards to personnel issues, forty-six states use teacher nominations, but many teachers are not trained in identifying or teaching gifted students. Teachers also tend to have lower expectations of minority students, even if they are identified as gifted. 45 states allow for parental nominations, but the nomination form is not sensitive to cultural differences and minority parents can have difficulty understanding the form. Forty-two states allow self-nomination, but minority students tend not to self nominate because of social-emotional variables like peer pressure or feeling isolated or rejected by peers. Additionally, some students are identified as gifted and talented simply because they have parents with the knowledge, political skills, and power to require schools to classify their child as gifted and talented. Therefore, providing their child with special instruction and enrichment. Schools should make sure that students from all social-class, cultural, language, and ethnic groups have an equal opportunity to participate in gifted and talented programs. ===Recommendations=== There are many recommendations for recruiting and retaining minority students in gifted and talented education programs. It is important that the instruments used to screen students are valid, reliable, and sensitive to students from diverse cultural backgrounds. There should also be multiple types (quantitative, qualitative, objective, subjective) and sources (teachers, parents, students) of information used in the screening process. Minority students who come from less rigorous schools and classrooms should be provided with support services and educational opportunities to help them be successful. An example would be classes that focus on study skills or time management skills. Teachers should attend professional development opportunities and be trained in teaching and working with minority students. More specifically, teachers should attend professional development that addresses the characteristics and behaviors of underrepresented gifted populations, awareness of cultural differences, children with multiple exceptionalities, developing positive peer culture in the classroom and school, and equitable and unbiased assessments. There should also be an increase in family involvement in the classroom and school, along with family involvement in the screening process. It is important to implement programs to keep students in school as they come of age and need to work so they can provide for their family. These programs should help students stay in school and provide a path to a career instead of having to go to work when they are old enough, which is major barrier students of low-income families face. ==Special education== In addition to the unbalanced scale of gender disproportionality in formal education, students with \\"special needs\\" comprise yet another facet of educational inequality. Prior to the 1975 passing of the Education for All Handicapped Children Act (currently known as the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA)) approximately 2 million children with special needs were not receiving sufficient public education. Of those that were within the academic system, many were reduced to lower standards of teaching, isolated conditions, or even removal from school buildings altogether and relocated out of peer circulation. The passing of this bill effectively changed the lives of millions of special needs students, ensuring that they have free access to quality public education facilities and services. And while there are those that benefit from the turning of this academic tide, there are still many students (most of which are minorities with disabilities) that find themselves in times of learning hardship due to the unbalanced distribution of special education funding. In 1998 1.5 million minority children were identified with special learning needs in the US, out of that 876,000 were African American or Native American. African American students were three times as likely to be labeled as special needs than that of Caucasians. Students who both are special education students and of a minority face unequal chances for quality education to meet their personal needs. Special education referrals are, in most cases in the hands of the general education teacher, this is subjective and because of differences, disabilities can be overlooked or unrecognized. Poorly trained teachers at minority schools, poor school relationships, and poor parent-to-teacher relationships play a role in this inequality. With these factors, minority students are at a disadvantage because they are not given the appropriate resources that would in turn benefit their educational needs. US Department of Education data shows that in 2000–2001 at least 13 states exhibited more than 2.75% of African American students enrolled in public schools with the label of \\"mental retardation\\". At that time national averages of Caucasians labeled with the same moniker came in at 0.75%. During this period no Individual state rose over 2.32% of Caucasian students with special needs. According to Tom Parrish, a senior research analyst with the American Institutes for Research, African American children are 2.88 times more likely to be labeled as \\"mentally retarded\\", and 1.92 times more likely to be labeled as emotionally disturbed than Caucasian children. This information was calculated by data gathered from the US Department of Education. It illustrates how even within a system that has progressed so much over the years, specifically due to industry recognition and public attention in forms such as government and private funding, aspects as archaic as race discrimination are still prevalent within these institutional walls. Researchers Edward Fierros and James Conroy, in their study of district-level data regarding the issue of minority over- representation, have suggested that many states may be mistaken with their current projections and that disturbing minority-based trends may be hidden within the numbers. According to the Individuals with Disabilities Act students with special needs are entitled to facilities and support that cater to their individual needs, they should not be automatically isolated from their peers or from the benefits of general education. However, according to Fierros and Conroy, once minority children such as African Americans and Latinos are labeled as students with special needs they are far less likely than Caucasians to be placed in settings of inclusive learning and often receive less desirable treatment overall. This problem of racial segregation amongst minority students with special needs is an ongoing battle in need of resolution. While historically there has been no ironclad solution to righting the wrongs of racial prejudices, there are ways in which we can all individually begin the process of equality within our educational institutions. Organizations such as the US Department of Education provide resources that we as teachers, students, parents, and concerned individuals can utilize in order to better educate ourselves on the current issues and services regarding special needs education. One such resource is the Office of Special Education and Rehabilitative Services (OSERS) which provides links to currently debated topics, programs, initiatives, reports, and resources as well support services. == History of educational oppression United States=== The historical relationships in the United States between privileged and marginalized communities play a major role in the administering of unequal and inadequate education to these socially excluded communities. The belief that certain communities in the United States were inferior in comparison to others has allowed these disadvantages to foster into the great magnitude of educational inequality that we see apparent today. For African Americans, deliberate systematic education oppression dates back to enslavement, more specifically in 1740. In 1740, North Carolina passed legislation that prohibited slave education. While the original legislature prohibited African Americans from being taught how to write, as other States adopted their own versions of the law, southern anti-literacy legislatures banned far more than just writing. Varying Southern laws prohibited African Americans from learning how to read, write, and assembling without the presence of slave owners. Many states as far as requiring free African Americans to leave in fear of them educating their enslaved brethren. By 1836, the public education of all African-Americans was strictly prohibited. The enslavement of African Americans removed the access to education for generations. Once the legal abolishment of slavery was enacted, racial stigma remained. Social, economic, and political barriers held blacks in a position of subordination. Although legally African Americans had the ability to be learning how to read and write, they were often prohibited from attending schools with White students. This form of segregation is often referred to as de jure segregation. The schools that allowed African American students to attend often lacked financial support, thus providing inadequate educational skills for their students. Freedmen's schools existed but they focused on maintaining African Americans in servitude, not enriching academic prosperity. The United States then experienced legal separation in schools between Whites and Blacks. Schools were supposed to receive equal resources but there was an undoubted inequality. It was not until 1968 that Black students in the South had universal secondary education. Research reveals that there was a shrinking of inequality between racial groups from 1970–1988, but since then the gap has grown again. Latinos and American Indians experienced similar educational repression in the past, which effects are evident now. Latinos have been systematically shut out of educational opportunities at all levels. Evidence suggests that Latinos have experienced this educational repression in the United States as far back as 1848. Despite the fact that it is illegal to not accept students based on their race, religion, or ethnicity, in the Southwest of the United States Latinos were often segregated through the deliberate practice of school and public officials. This form of segregation is referred to as de facto segregation. American Indians experienced the enforcement of missionary schools that emphasized the assimilation into white culture and society. Even after \\"successful\\" assimilation, those American Indians experienced discrimination in white society and often rejected by their tribe. It created a group that could not truly benefit even if they gained an equal education. American universities are separated into various classes, with a few institutions, such as the Ivy League schools, much more exclusive than the others. Among these exclusive institutions, educational inequality is extreme, with only 6% and 3% of their students coming from the bottom two income quintiles.Lawrence Mishel, Jared Bernstein, and Heidi Shierholz, The State of Working America 2008/ 2009 (Ithaca, NY: ILR Press)cited in Stiglitz, Joseph E. (2012-06-04). The Price of Inequality: How Today's Divided Society Endangers Our Future (p. 308). Norton. Kindle Edition. === Resources === Access to resources plays an important role in educational inequality. In addition to the resources from the family mentioned earlier, access to proper nutrition and health care influences the cognitive development of children. Children who come from poor families experience this inequality, which puts them at a disadvantage from the start. Not only important are resources students may or may not receive from family, but schools themselves vary greatly in the resources they give their students. On December 2, 2011, the U.S. Department of Education released that school districts are unevenly distributing funds, which are disproportionately underfunding low-income students. This is holding back money from the schools that are in great need. High poverty schools have less-qualified teachers with a much higher turnover rate. In every subject area, students in high poverty schools are more likely than other students to be taught by teachers without even a minor in their subject matter. Better resources allows for the reduction of classroom size, which research has proven improves test scores. It also increases the number of after school and summer programs—these are very beneficial to poor children because it not only combats the increased loss of skill over the summer but keeps them out of unsafe neighborhoods and combats the drop-out rate. There is also a difference in the classes offered to students, specifically advanced mathematics and science courses. In 2012, Algebra II was offered to 82% of the schools (in diverse districts) serving the fewest Hispanic and African American students, while only 65% of the schools serving the most African American and Hispanic students offered students the same course. Physics was offered to 66% of the schools serving the fewest Hispanic and African American students, compared to 40% serving the most. Calculus was offered to 55% of the schools serving the fewest Hispanic and African American students, compared to 29% serving the most. This lack of resources is directly linked to ethnicity and race. Black and Latino's students are three times more likely than whites to be in high poverty schools and twelve times as likely to be in schools that are predominantly poor. Also, in schools that are composed of 90% or above of minorities, only one-half of the teachers are certified in the subjects they teach. As the number of white students increases in a school, funding tends to increase as well. Teachers in elementary schools serving the most Hispanic and African-American students are paid on average $2250 less per year than their colleagues in the same district working at schools serving the fewest Hispanic and African American Students. From the family resources side, 10% of white children are raised in poverty, while 37% of Latino children are and 42% of African American children are. Research indicates that when resources are equal, Black students are more likely to continue their education into college than their white counterparts. ===State conflicts=== Within fragile states, children may be subject to inadequate education. The poor educational quality within these states is believed to be a result of four main challenges. These challenges include coordination gaps between the governmental actors, the policy maker's low priority on educational policy, limited financing, and lack of educational quality. ==Measurement== In the last decade, tests have been administered throughout the world to gather information about students, the schools they attend, and their educational achievements. These tests include the Organization for Economic and Co-Operational Development's Program of International Student Assessment and the International Association for the Evaluation of Educational Achievement's Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study. To calculate the different test parameters in each country and calculate a standard score, the scores of these tests are put through Item Response Theory models. Once standardized, analysts can begin looking at education through the lens of achievement rather than looking at attainment. Through looking at achievement, the analysts can objectively examine educational inequality throughout the globe. == Effects  Social mobility === Social mobility refers to the movement in class status from one generation to another. It is related to the \\"rags to riches\\" notion that anyone, with hard work and determination, has the ability to move upward no matter what background they come from. Contrary to that notion, however, sociologists and economists have concluded that, although exceptions are heard of, social mobility has remained stagnant and even decreased over the past thirty years.Leonhardt, D. & Scott, J. (2005). Class matters: Shadowy lines that still divide. New York Times. https://www.nytimes.com/2005/05/15/national/class/OVERVIEW-FINAL.html From 1979 through 2007 the wage income for lower and middle-class citizens has risen by less than 17 percent while the one percent has grown by approximately 156 percent sharply contrasting the \\"postwar period up through the 1970s when income growth was broadly shared\\". Some of the decreases in social mobility may be explained by the stratified educational system. Research has shown that since 1973, men and women with at least a college degree have seen an increase in hourly wages, while the wages for those with less than a college degree have remained stagnant or have decreased during the same period of time. Since the educational system forces low-income families to place their children into less-than-ideal school systems, those children are typically not presented with the same opportunities and educational motivation as are students from well-off families, resulting in patterns of repeated intergenerational educational choices for parent and child, also known as decreased or stagnant social mobility. == Remedies == There are a variety of efforts by countries to assist in increasing the availability of quality education for all children. ===Assessment=== Based on input from more than 1,700 individuals in 118 countries, UNESCO and the Center for Universal Education at the Brookings Institution have co-convened the Learning Metrics Task Force. The task force aims to shift the focus from access to access plus learning. They discovered through assessment, the learning and progress of students in individual countries can be measured. Through the testing, governments can assess the quality of their education programs, refine the areas that need improvement, and ultimately increase their student's success. ===Education for All Act=== The Education For All act or EFA is a global commitment to provide quality basic education for all children, youth, and adults. In 2000, 164 governments pledged to achieve education for all at the World Education Forum. There are six decided-upon goals designed to reach the goal of Education for All by 2015. The entities working together to achieve these goals include governments, multilateral and development agencies, civil society, and the private sector. UNESCO is responsible for coordinating the partnerships. Although progress has been made, some countries are providing more support than others. Also, there is a need to strengthen overall political commitment as well as strengthening the needed resources. ===Global Partnership for Education=== Global Partnership for Education or GPE functions to create a global effort to reduce educational inequality with a focus on the poorest countries. GPE is the only international effort with its particular focus on supporting countries' efforts to educate their youth from primary through secondary education. The main goals of the partnership include providing educational access to each child, ensuring each child masters basic numeracy and literacy skills, increasing the ability for governments to provide quality education for all, and providing a safe space for all children to learn in. They are a partnership of donor and developing countries but the developing countries shape their own educational strategy based upon their personal priorities. When constructing these priorities, GPE serves to support and facilitate access to financial and technical resources. Successes of GPE include helping nearly 22 million children get to school, equipping 52,600 classrooms, and training 300,000 teachers. ===Multicultural education=== Global Partnership for Education or GPE functions to create a global effort to reduce educational inequality with a focus on the poorest countries. GPE is the only international effort with its particular focus on supporting countries' efforts to educate their youth from primary through secondary education. The main goals of the partnership include providing educational access to each child, ensuring each child masters basic numeracy and literacy skills, increasing the ability for governments to provide quality education for all, and providing a safe space for all children to learn in. They are a partnership of donor and developing countries but the developing countries shape their own educational strategy based upon their personal priorities. When constructing these priorities, GPE serves to support and facilitate access to financial and technical resources. Successes of GPE include helping nearly 22 million children get to school, equipping 52,600 classrooms, and training 300,000 teachers. ===Massive online classes=== There is a growing shift away from traditional higher education institutions to massive open online courses (MOOC). These classes are run through content sharing, videos, online forums, and exams. The MOOCs are free which allows for many more students to take part in the classes, however, the programs are created by global north countries, therefore inhibiting individuals in the global south from creating their own innovations. == Policy implications == With the knowledge that early educational intervention programs, such as extended childcare during preschool years, can significantly prepare low-income students for educational and life successes, comes a certain degree of responsibility. One policy change that seems necessary to make is that quality child care is available to every child in the United States at an affordable rate. This has been scientifically proven to push students into college, and thus increase social mobility. The ultimate end result of such a reality would be that the widely stratified educational system that exists in the U.S. today would begin to equalize so that every child born, regardless of socioeconomic status, would have the same opportunity to succeed. Many European countries are already exercising such successful educational systems. == Global evidence == School children in Rhbat, Nagar, Pakistan === Albania === Household income in Albania is very low. Many families are unable to provide a college education for their kids, with the money they make. Albania is one of the poorest countries in Europe with a large population of people under the age of 25. This population of students needs a path to higher education. Nothing is being done for all the young adults who are smart enough to go to college but cannot afford to. ===Bangladesh=== The Bangladesh education system includes more than 100,000 schools run by public, private, NGO, and religious providers. The schools are overseen by a national ministry. Their system is centralized and overseen by the sub-districts also known as Upazilas. During the past two decades, the system expanded through new national policies and pro-poor spending. The gross enrollment rate in the poorest quintile of upazilas is 101 percent. Also, the poorest quintile spending per child was 30 percent higher than the wealthiest quintile. Educational inequalities continue despite the increased spending. They do not have consistent learning outcomes across the upazilas. In almost 2/3 of upazilas, the dropout rate is over 30 percent. They have difficulty acquiring quality teachers and 97 percent of preprimary and primary students are in overcrowded classrooms. ===South Africa===  Inequality in higher education  Africa, in general, has suffered from decreased spending on higher education programs. As a result, they are unable to obtain moderate to high enrollment and there is minimal research output. Within South Africa, there are numerous factors that affect the quality of tertiary education. The country inherited class, race, and gender inequality in the social, political, and economic spheres during the Apartheid. The 1994 constitution emphasizes higher education as useful for human resource development and of great importance to any economic and social transitions. However, they are still fighting to overcome the colonialism and racism in intellectual spaces. Funding from the government has a major stake in the educational quality received. As a result of declining government support, the average class size in South Africa is growing. The increased class size limits student-teacher interactions, therefore further hindering students with low problem solving and critical thinking skills. In an article by Meenal Shrivastava and Sanjiv Shrivastava, the argument is made that in large class sizes \\"have ramifications for developing countries where higher education where higher education is a core element in the economic and societal development\\". These ramifications are shown to include lower student performance and information retention. === United Kingdom === Evidence from the British birth cohort studies has illustrated the powerful influence of family socioeconomic background on children's educational attainment. These differences emerge early in childhood,Sullivan, A., Ketende, S., & Joshi, H. (2013). Social Class and Inequalities in Early Cognitive Scores. Sociology.. and continue to grow throughout the school years.Feinstein, L. (2003). Inequality in the early cognitive development of British children in the 1970 cohort. Economica, 70(277), 73–97. === Sudan Republic === The earliest educational system of Sudan was established by the British during the first half of the 20th century. The government of Sudan recognizes education as a right for every citizen and guarantees access to free basic education, The educational structure of the Republic of Sudan consists of the pre-primary, primary, secondary, and higher education, The Sudanese education system includes more than 3.646 schools run by public, private, and religious providers, the schools are overseen by the High Ministry of Education. However, Sudan's simmering wars and a lack of awareness about the importance of education and chronic under-development all contribute to the poor schooling of girls in Sudan. In addition, cultural pressures and the traditional views of the role of women mean fewer girls attend and remain in school. The inability to pay fees even though school is free according to government policy is a major reason; some poor families can't afford the stationery and clothes. The government can't provide for all the students' needs because of the economic situation and poverty. However the government has raised their awareness of educating females, and they have created universities only for girls,. The first and most popular one is Al Ahfad University for Women, located in Omdurman, created in 1907 by Sheikh Babikr Bedri. Now the percentage of educated females is increasing; the last survey estimates that 60.8% of females in Sudan can read and write. === United States === See selected issues and criticisms under Higher education in the United States. Children in a classroom in the United States Property tax dilemma In the United States, schools are funded by local property taxes. Because of this, the more affluent a neighborhood, the higher the funding for that school district. Although this situation seems favorable, the problem emerges when the equation is reversed. In neighborhoods inhabited by predominantly working and lower-class families, properties are less expensive, and so property taxes are much lower than those in affluent neighborhoods. Consequently, funding for the school districts to which working and lower- class children are assigned is also significantly lower than the funding for the school districts to which children of affluent families are assigned. Thus, students in working and lower class schools do not receive the same quality of education and access to resources as do students from affluent families. The reality of the situation is that the distribution of resources for schools is based on the socioeconomic status of the parents of the students. As a result, the U.S. educational system significantly aids in widening the gap between the rich and the poor. This gap has increased, rather than decreased, over the past few decades due in part to a lack of social mobility.Leonhardt, D. (2005). Class matters: The college dropout boom. New York Times. https://www.nytimes.com/2005/05/24/national/class/EDUCATION- FINAL.html?_r=1 === International comparisons === Compared to other nations, the United States is among some of the highest spenders on education per student behind only Switzerland and Norway.Spellings, Margaret. \\"10 Facts About K-12 Education Funding\\". ED.gov. June 2005. U.S. Department of Education. 28 Nov 2011 http://www2.ed.gov/about/overview/fed/10facts/index.html. The per-pupil spending has even increased in recent years but the academic achievement of students has remained stagnant. The Swedish educational system is one such system that attempts to equalize students and make sure every child has an equal chance to learn. One way that Sweden is accomplishing these goals is by making sure every child can go to daycare affordably. Of the total cost of childcare, parents pay no more than 18% for their child; the remaining 82% is paid for by various government agencies and municipalities. In 2002, a \\"maximum-fee\\" system was introduced in Sweden that states that costs for childcare may be no greater than 3% of one's income for the first child, 2% for the second child, 1% for the third child, and free of charge for the fourth child in pre-school. 97.5% of children age 1–5 attend these public daycare centers. Also, a new law was recently introduced that states that all four- and five-year-old children can attend daycare for free.Bjornberg, U. & Dahlgren, L. Policy: The case of Sweden. University of York, United Kingdom. http://www.york.ac.uk/inst/spru/research/nordic/swedenpoli.pdf Since practically all students, no matter what their socioeconomic background, attend the same daycare centers, equalization alongside educational development begins early and in the public sphere. Furthermore, parental leave consists of 12 months paid leave (80% of wage) whereas one month is awarded solely to the father in the form of \\"use it or lose it\\". This results in the privilege and affordability of staying home and bonding with one's child for the first year of life. Due to this affordability, less than 200 children in the entire country of Sweden under the age of 1 are placed in child care.Clawson, D. & Gerstel, N. (2007). Caring for our young: Childcare in Europe and the United States. Ed. Ferguson, S.J. Shifting the center: Understanding contemporary families. 3rd Ed. McGraw Hill: Boston, MA Stratification in the educational system is further diminished by providing all Swedish citizens and legal residents with the option of choosing which school they want their children to be placed in, regardless of what neighborhood they reside in or what property taxes they pay. Additionally, the Swedish government not only provides its citizens with a free college education but also with an actual monthly allowance for attending school and college. Together, these privileges allow for all Swedish children to have access to the same resources. A similar system can be found in France, where free, full-day child care centers known as \\"écoles maternelles\\" enroll close to 100% of French children ages 3–5 years old.

The growing popularity of the magazine resulted in the publication of a book written by Moran and Sceurman, Weird NJ: Your Travel Guide to New Jersey's Local Legends and Best Kept Secrets. After the book was released, Moran and Sceurman began receiving letters from individuals across the United States, detailing oddities from their home states, which prompted Moran and Sceurman to create Weird US. The Weird US book series spawned a television series of the same name that aired on the History Channel from 2004 to 2005. As of July 2011, all but seventeen states (Alabama, Alaska, Arkansas, Delaware, Hawaii, Idaho, Iowa, Kansas, Mississippi, Montana, Nebraska, New Mexico, North Dakota, South Dakota, Utah, West Virginia and Wyoming) have been covered within individual books. There are also two books about hauntings and one book about unusual features of England. ==Titles in seriesGeneral U.S.=== * Weird U.S.: Your Travel Guide to America's Local Legends and Best Kept Secrets.

He is an allrounder who bats with right-hand and bowls right-arm medium. He is one of the few cricketers for UAE who had played Asia Cup. Amjad Javed's grandfather moved to Dubai from Lahore, Pakistan 50 years ago, when his father was only 2 years old. Amjad Javed is of Pakistani descent but born and raised in UAE. He also worked for EMIRATES airlines as a baggage handler. Amjad took retirement from all forms of cricket on 22 December 2018. ==Playing career== He made his One Day International debut for the United Arab Emirates against Bangladesh at Gaddafi Stadium in 2008 Asia Cup. He scored 10 runs in which he hit a four and six and then bowled two overs without any success. In World Cup Qualifier, Javed hit a blistering 164 from 117 balls, laced with 17 fours and eight sixes at Senwes Park in Potchefstroom as the UAE completed a 112-run win over Denmark. In 2010, in a List-A match against Bermuda, Javed hit blitzed 89 off 59 balls which included seven fours and five sixes as UAE extended their domination over Bermuda with a thumping 134-run win at the National Stadium. In 2012, Javed finished with the best figures 4 for 49 against Netherlands in the Intercontinental Cup played at Deventer. In the 2015 ICC World Cup Qualifier, Javed blasted a 31-ball 63 to lift the team to 246 for 8 as United Arab Emirates held their nerve to secure a narrow 13-run win against Kenya at Hagley Oval in Christchurch, putting an end to Kenya's hopes of extending their streak of five consecutive World Cup appearances. In the 2015 ICC Cricket World Cup clash v Ireland, he along with Shaiman Anwar set the highest ever World Cup record partnership of 107 runs for the 7th wicket. In fact, this pair of batsmen became the first pair to have had a 100+ runstand for the 7th wicket in World Cup history. Just after a month later, in the 2015 ICC Cricket World Cup, Amjad Javed along with Nasir Aziz put on a 107 run stand against West Indies for the 7th wicket and created history for the joint highest ever World Cup 7th wicket partnership. Javed is the only player in the world to involve in more than one 100+ stand for the 7th wicket in Cricket World Cup history. He holds the record for facing the most number of balls in a T20I innings when batting at number seven position(46) ==References External links == *CricketArchive, retrieved 29 Feb 2016 *Cricinfo, retrieved 29 Feb 2016 Category:1980 births Category:Living people Category:United Arab Emirates One Day International cricketers Category:United Arab Emirates Twenty20 International cricketers Category:Emirati cricketers Category:Cricketers at the 2015 Cricket World Cup Category:Sportspeople of Pakistani descent Category:Emirati cricket captains ","title":"Amjad Javed"},{"id":"20381944","text":"St. John's-In-The-Prairie, now known as St. John's Episcopal Church, is a historic Episcopal church in Forkland, Alabama. ==History== The congregation was organized in 1834 by Caleb Ives, a pioneer missionary, and was admitted to parish status in 1838. The first rector was the Rev. John Avery. The wooden Gothic Revival structure was built in 1859 on a Southern plantation to the designs of Richard Upjohn. It was a Methodist church, built on a Southern plantation south of Greensboro in the Antebellum South.John Archibald, See what's inside the mystery church in Alabama's Black Belt, The Birmingham News, July 15, 2015 After the American Civil War of 1861–1865, the Methodist planter had lost most of his assets. He ran afoul of the Methodist Episcopal Church, South after he built a saloon from the ruins of his plantation house. As a result, he decided to convert the congregation to an Episcopal church and move the building across the Black Warrior River to its present location in 1878. Others suggest he had sold alcohol to the Union Army and moved to flee veterans of the Confederate States Army. As of 2017, the church still has congregants. ==Heritage significance== It was added to the National Register of Historic Places on November 20, 1975. ==References * Category:National Register of Historic Places in Greene County, Alabama Category:Churches on the National Register of Historic Places in Alabama Category:Churches completed in 1859 Category:19th-century Episcopal church buildings Category:Episcopal church buildings in Alabama Category:Carpenter Gothic church buildings in Alabama Category:Buildings and structures in Greene County, Alabama Category:Historic American Buildings Survey in Alabama Category:1859 establishments in Alabama ","title":"St. John's-In-The-Prairie"},{"id":"20381977","text":"Vikrant Shetty (born 17 October 1983) is a UAE cricketer who has played one One Day International for the United Arab Emirates.

Hunt was also the Charles W. Eliot Professor of Education at Harvard University, President of the American Association of School Administrators, and chairman of the American Council on Education. He served on the National Board of the Boy Scouts of America, and was awarded the Silver Buffalo in 1963 for his contributions to scouting. ==Education== Hunt was born in Holland, Michigan and earned a Bachelor of Arts from the University of Michigan in 1923. While in college, he wrote for The Michigan Daily. He earned his M.A. degree from Teachers College, Columbia University. ==Career== He taught in the Michigan public schools from 1923–1927. He became principal of the St. Johns, Michigan high school for four years. In 1931 he became superintendent of that district, and in 1934 superintendent of the Kalamazoo, Michigan school system. In 1937, at age 32, he became head of the New Rochelle, New York School system. He was Superintendent of the Kansas City, Missouri school system and President of the American Association of School Administrators from 1947 to 1948. While in Kansas City, he was known to fill in for vacationing Episcopalian ministers at the pulpit. In 1947, he was sought as Superintendent for the New York, San Francisco, and Chicago school systems. Chicago hired him as their first General Superintendent in charge of both operations and education in 1947. While in Chicago, he was credited with cleaning up a system rife with corruption. During the tenure of his predecessor, Superintendent William Johnson, the district was blacklisted by the North Central Association of Colleges and Secondary Schools. Three days after the board unanimously confirmed Hunt as its new superintendent, the organization removed Chicago from its blacklist. In Chicago, he doubled the school district's budget to $146 million, updated facilities with a $50 million building program, raised faculty salaries almost 50%, and relieved them from kickbacks to ward captains and ringing door bells in every election. Hunt was offered a salary of US$25,000 a year—US$9,000 more than it has ever paid a superintendent before, and US$7,000 more than it paid its mayor at the time. He was second vice- president of National Congress of Parents and Teachers from 1948 to 1951, chair of the American Council on Education from 1948 to 1949, and chair of the Board of Trustees of the Educational Testing Service from 1949 to 1950. In 1953 he accepted James B. Conant's offer to become the Charles W. Eliot professor of Education at the Harvard Graduate School of Education. There, he became the first Chairman of the Administrative Careers Program, which later led to programs in Administration, Planning and Social Policy. From 1955 to 1957, he served as Undersecretary of Health, Education and Welfare during the administration of President Dwight D. Eisenhower. After he retired from his position as in the Department of Health, Education and Welfare, he returned to Harvard University. In 1958, he was selected as a recipient of the American Education Award. He served as a consultant to the Ford Foundation's program on the use of television in the schools, was a UNESCO delegate to New Delhi, a member of a delegation that visited Russian schools, and served on the board of the National Council of the Boy Scouts of America. During his time on the board, he served on a task force invited to take a look at the White Stag Leadership Development Program. He was instrumental in persuading the National Council President Ellsworth H. Augustus to conduct research into the program's potential contributions to adult and youth leadership development. He was cited for his contributions to Scouting and received the highest award given volunteers, the Silver Buffalo, in 1963. He retired from Harvard in 1970. == Personal life == Hunt died on October 17, 1976 in Lexington, Massachusetts.

It was first published in Communication Monographs, Volume 59, December 1992; Witte subsequently published an initial test of the model in a later article published in Communication Monographs Volume 61, June 1994. EPPM is based on Leventhal's danger control/ fear control framework and on Roger's protection motivation theory.https://www.msu.edu/~wittek/fearback.htm It is commonly used in health communication campaigns when a message is attempting to persuade audience members to adopt a healthy behavior. In order for fear-based campaigns to be effective, they must induce a moderately-high level of fear and a higher level of self-efficacy and response efficacy. When the audience feels that there is a higher level of fear than efficacy, the message is ineffective. ==Inputs== Illustration of the Extended Parallel Process Model. The EPPM model defines four key factors to predict the likely outcome of communications which involve a fear appeal: * Self-Efficacy – The perception the individual has that they are competent to perform the tasks needed to control the risk. * Response Efficacy – The perception the individual has that the action, if carried out, will successfully control the risk. * Susceptibility – The perception the individual has of how likely the threat is to impact them. * Severity – The perception the individual has of the magnitude of the threat. ==Outputs== Based on the inputs above, the EPPM model predicts three possible outcomes. Danger control – When an individual perceives that the severity and susceptibility are high and also perceives that they are competent to take mitigating action then they are likely to act to control the danger. Fear control – The model predicts that if an individual perceives their ability to control a risk as low, even if the severity and susceptibility is perceived as high, then they are likely to take steps to control their fear instead. This is maladaptive change, or counter-productive behaviour. Fear controlling behaviour may involve the use of cognitive defence mechanisms such as \\"It will happen to me sooner or later\\" in order to manage the state of anxiety. No Response – The severity or susceptibility of the danger was perceived as low. ==See also== * Behavioural change theories * Theory of planned behavior ==Original articles== *Witte, K. (1992).

Its single purpose was to push through a Constitutional Amendment to prohibit war. ==History== Christine Ross Barker a Nova Scotian suffragist and Women's International League for Peace and Freedom (WILPF) member, proposed a conference to be held in 1921 with American and Canadian women to discuss outlawing war. The conference, held between August 19 and 21, at Niagara, Ontario spurred the creation of the Women's Peace Union of the Western Hemisphere. The organization called for the immediate disarmament of all nations, and encouraged cooperation of women in Canada, Mexico and the United States to work towards that goal. Barker was the temporary chair, Margaret Long Thomas of New York City was appointed secretary, and Gertrude Franchot Tone of Niagara Falls, New York was the treasurer. Though founded by Canadian women, the organization was based in New York and strove to introduce an Amendment to the Constitution of the United States banning participation in war—the solitary mission of the organization. Caroline Lexow Babcock and Elinor Byrns coordinated the efforts to draft the amendment and to work within the United States political system to outlaw war. WPU campaigned steadily and single-mindedly from 1923 to 1939, along with Senator Lynn Joseph Frazier of North Dakota, for a constitutional amendment that would outlaw war and the preparation for war in the United States and all its territories.Amy Swerdlow. Women Strike for Peace: Traditional Motherhood and Radical Politics in the 1960s. Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1993. WPU refused to negotiate when it came to partial disarmament methods as they completely condemned all acts of violence.http://web.ebscohost.com/ehost/pdf?vid=3&hid;=104&sid;=826de658-9282-4421-a6f5-7afbb3f1a68a%40sessionmgr107 From 1926, Rose Henderson, a Canadian social reformer, had become a supporter of the WPU. Although the group's ideas and strives were extreme, they were still very reflective of the attitudes of masses during that time period. A great accomplishment for the group came in the form of the Kellogg-Briand Pact of 1928 in which sixty-two nations agreed to renounce war as a way to advance national designs and as a solution to international squabbles. They were able to make their advances through their philosophy of non-violence and their push for suffrage. Their nonviolent tactics included lobbying, letter-writing campaigns and public meetings. They also adopted the principle of praising women and criticizing men. Their feminist philosophy led them to adopt the idea that it would be women who would save the United States and end all wars. Their destruction came from a narrow focus, which was mostly centered on passing the amendment against war. And they were not particularly welcoming of peace organizations that included men or encompassed popular thoughts of men which caused the WPU to be extremely isolated.

The band was a side project of Dead Milkmen singer and keyboardist Rodney Linderman. ==History== The band formed in 1994, around the time the Dead Milkmen announced their plans to disband the following year after a final tour and album. Taking their name from the 1962 horror film of the same name, Burn Witch Burn was composed of Linderman, his wife Vienna and a cast of additional instrumentalists. They crafted a distinct sound drawing from several forms of folk music (including Irish and Americana styles) and a \\"Pogues- esque\\"http://www.dailyvault.com/toc.php5?review=1403 punk rock sensibility, with a dark element sufficient to frequently earn them \\"goth\\" and \\"gypsy\\" tags.http://www.disclaimerband.com/b.html This dark edge, reflected in songs of murder, misery, alcoholism, pestilence and the occult, was a sharp left turn from the Dead Milkmen's comedic lyrical motifs, although Burn Witch Burn lyrics were not without their own sense of black humor (notable in such songs as \\"Treetop Flotilla\\", which includes an anecdote about an abusive, Led Zeppelin-listening \\"fake biker\\".) The band also utilized an array of unique instrumentation, including the tin whistle, violin, mandolin, banjolin, bouzouki, melodeon, and hurdy-gurdy, in addition to the standard guitar, bass and drums. The band's first release was a six song demo tape in 1995. 1997 saw a seven-song self-released CD-EP, The Burning Times, which included a cover of The Velvet Underground's \\"All Tomorrow's Parties\\". In 2000, Burn Witch Burn recorded a full-length, self-titled album, released on the Philadelphia-based Razler Records imprint (which was also the home to Butterfly Joe, a group featuring half of the Dead Milkmen). The album included re-recordings of much of the band's first two minor releases, some new original material, and a Rolling Stones cover, \\"Citadel\\". The group disbanded in 2001. Fergusson and Rodney Linderman later formed the group 25 Cromwell Street, playing in the style of Burn Witch Burn and incorporating several of the latter group's songs into its set. ==Discography== * demo tape (1995, self-released cassette) * The Burning Times (1997, self-released CD-EP) * Burn Witch Burn (2000, Razler Records CD) ==Compilations== * Put Your Tongue To The Rail: The Philly Comp For Catholic Children (Songs of the Jim Carroll Band).

It is a type of stew consisting of parboiled whole chicken in a cream or milk based broth, butter and seasoned with salt, pepper and other ingredients. Traditionally, the stew is served in the late fall and winter months. In northern Georgia, this part of the year is often referred to as \\"mull season\\".Charles C. Doyle, Mulling over Mull: A North Georgia Foodways Localism, Midwestern Folklore 29 (2003): 5-11 Often the term \\"chicken stew\\" or \\"chicken mull\\" refers to an event or gathering where the dish is served. ==Preparation== Recipes for chicken mull vary slightly from person to person, but it is usually made by first cooking a whole chicken by boiling or parboiling, allowing a rich broth to form. The chicken is then removed from the pot and the meat is pulled from the bones or cut off with a knife. The skin, bones and fat are removed as well. Sometimes boneless, skinless chicken breasts are used instead of a whole chicken. A thickening of milk or cream is made (and sometimes evaporated milk is added as well) and added to the broth. Several sleeves of saltine crackers can be crumbled into broth and chicken mixture as it is the more common method of thickening the mull. The chicken is usually ground up in a meat grinder, although sometimes it is cut into small pieces. The chicken is then added back into the liquid along with salt, pepper and butter or margarine. Various other ingredients may be added to the stew according to local tradition, (such as diced potatoes or onions); a more common addition is varying amounts of hot sauce.Southern Chicken Stew basic recipe The stew varies in color from white to pale yellow, depending on the amount of butter or margarine used. It can vary in thickness from very thin and soup-like to thick and creamy. Saltine crackers are commonly served with chicken mull, either on the side or crumbled into the bowl. Other, nearly identical variations of a \\"mull\\" can be made using either catfish, oysters or canned salmon, instead of chicken. ==Cultural traditions== Because of its low cost of preparation and reputation as a local comfort food, chicken mull is often served at large social gatherings such as church fellowships, family reunions and community fundraisers. It is a tradition at these gatherings to prepare the mull in a large cast iron or stainless steel pot, often outdoors over an open fire. Bowls of mull are sometimes complemented with coleslaw, rice or grilled cheese sandwiches. In North Carolina and Georgia, \\"chicken mulls\\" or \\"chicken stews\\" are social events usually held during the colder seasons, with most events occurring September through December. ==See also== * List of chicken dishes * List of stews * Supreme (cookery) ==References== Category:North Carolina culture Category:Cuisine of the Southern United States Category:American stews Category:American chicken dishes Category:Georgia (U.S. state) culture ","title":"Chicken mull"},{"id":"20382501","text":"Jonathan Syverson (born August 21, 1980, in Wrentham, Massachusetts) is an American musician and songwriter, best known as the drummer of the rock band Daughters since 2002.

In other words, lab lit novels are mainstream or literary stories about the practice of science as a profession. They may or may not center exclusively on the science or the workplaces of scientists, but all tend to feature scientists as central characters. According to an article in the New York Times, :\\"Lab lit is not science fiction, and in my opinion it’s not historical fiction about actual scientists (though some fictionalized biographies do appear on the list). Instead, in the Web site’s words, it “depicts realistic scientists as central characters and portrays fairly realistic scientific practice or concepts, typically taking place in a realistic — as opposed to speculative or future — world.'\\" Prominent examples of lab lit include Flight Behavior by Barbara Kingsolver, Intuition by Allegra Goodman and Mendel's Dwarf by Simon Mawer, and Richard Powers' The Echo Maker and Generosity. Novels set in the past featuring fictionalized explorations of real-life scientists can also be considered lab lit; examples include Kepler by John Banville, The Signature of All Things by Elizabeth Gilbert, Remarkable Creatures by Tracy Chevelier and Enigma by Robert Harris. == History and origins == Fiction that incorporates real science into works of fiction that are not science fiction has also been referred to as \\"science in fiction.\\"Djerassi, Carl. \\"Science in Fiction ist nicht Science Fiction: Ist sie Autobiographie?\\" Fiction in Science – Science in Fiction, Ed.

An example from the 1950s is Isaac Asimov's A Whiff of Death, and examples from the beginning of the current upsurge include Cantor's Dilemma by Carl Djerassi and Carbon Dreams by Susan M. Gaines.

An upturn in the publication of lab-lit novels occurred in the 1990s, with five to ten new titles appearing annually in the early two thousands. The reasons for this increase are unclear, but may include factors such as an increased interest in and familiarity with science on the part of the general public, publishers, and established authors. ==See alsoReferences *List of Lab lit novels at LabLit.com Category:Literary genres Category:Science in fiction ","title":"Lab lit"},{"id":"20382637","text":"Neural network refers to interconnected populations of neurons or neuron simulations that form the structure and architecture of nervous systems, in animals, humans, and computing systems: *Artificial neural network, a computing system inspired by the biological neural networks found in animal brains *Biological neural network or neural circuit, a collection of physically interconnected neurons that carry out a specific function together *Large scale brain networks, biological neural networks on a larger scale *Convolutional neural network, a class of deep neural networks, most commonly applied to analyzing visual imagery *Deep neural network, an artificial neural network with multiple layers between the input and output layers Neural networks may also refer to: *Neural Networks (journal), peer-reviewed scientific journal ==See also== *Neutral network (evolution) ","title":"Neural network (disambiguation)"},{"id":"20382647","text":"Helma is a feminine German or Dutch given name, and a Czech surname.

This ray is found in the eastern Atlantic Ocean, from Murmansk, Russia through Norway, southern Iceland, the Faroe Islands, the Celtic Sea, the northern North Sea and Skagerrak, to northern Morocco, including (infrequently) the western Mediterranean Sea and the Madeira Islands. It is absent from the shallow waters off England and Wales. Shagreen is a form of roughened untanned leather, typically dyed green and commonly made of the skins of sharks and rays. The common name \\"fuller's ray\\" comes from an instrument used by fullers to smooth cloth, referring to its rough and spiny back. The pectoral fin disc of the shagreen ray is somewhat wider than it is long. The forward margin concave and undulated, and about one-third longer than the rear margin. The snout is cone-shaped and pointed. The tail is shorter than the disc, with two small, equally sized dorsal fins and a rudimentary caudal fin. The eyes and mouth are large; the teeth are pointed and number about 64 in the upper jaw and 56 in the lower. The upper surface is rough in texture, with patches of large spines on the snout, around the eyes, and on the shoulder. There are two rows of about 50 spines each running from the center of the back to the first dorsal fin, and no interdorsal spine. The underside is smooth except for the front edge of the disc, base of the tail, and tail. The coloration is a uniform gray or brown with smaller darker dots above, and white below. The maximum size is to 120 cm long. This species occurs in relatively cold water on the upper continental slopes at a depth of 30–550 m. It is most common at depths of 200 m, but is found deeper in southern areas. It favors sandy and possibly also rocky habitats. The shagreen ray feeds on a variety of benthic animals, mainly fishes but also crustaceans. Like other skates reproduction is oviparous; the egg capsules are amber in color and oblong-shaped, with long, stiff horns at each corner. One pair of horns are longer than the capsule. The capsules measure 7.5-9.9 cm long and 4.5-4.7 cm wide. Historically this ray was considered of \\"inferior\\" quality for consumption. It is caught commercially by longlines and trawls. ==References== shagreen ray Category:Fish of the North Sea Category:Marine fish of Europe shagreen ray shagreen ray ","title":"Shagreen ray"},{"id":"20382697","text":"The 1924 Ohio State Buckeyes football team represented Ohio State University in the 1924 Big Ten Conference football season.

Alvensleben was the commander of Wehrmacht troops stationed in April 1945 at Bozen, whence he led his troops to liberate the prisoners being held by the SS at Tyrol. __TOC__ ==Early life== Alvensleben was born on May 19, 1902, in Wittenmoor (now part of Stendal) to Ludolf Udo von Alvensleben (1852–1923) and Ida, née von Glasenapp (1866–1924). He was taught in various convent schools at Magdeburg in Brandenburg an der Havel and passed his Abitur in 1921 at the Klosterschule Roßleben. After four years of practical training he commenced studies in agriculture, forestry, and law in Eberswalde and Munich. In 1927, Alvensleben married Cora von Erxleben and started to work at his wife's country estates at Tankow-Seegenfelde in the district of Friedeberg and at Dertzow in the district of Soldin, New March, in 1929. In 1936, he bought the forested estate of Viarthlum, in the district of Rummelsburg (now Miastko), Farther Pomerania. Alvensleben by now had two daughters, born in 1934 and 1936, and was a Knight of Justice of the Order of Saint John as well as a deeply religious Christian. ==Military service== In 1939, Alvensleben became an Officer of the German Wehrmacht, earning the rank of Captain, and served in Poland, France, Russia, Africa, and Italy. He was wounded in 1941 in Russia and received various decorations, including the Wound Badge, the Infantry Assault Badge, and the Iron Cross 1st Class. His wife committed suicide at the arrival of the Soviet Red Army in Tankow-Seegenfelde on 29 January 1945. In late April 1945, a group of 140 high-status prisoners were transferred to Tyrol, guarded by SS troops. A delegation from the prisoners contacted senior German army officers, made known the identity of the high-status prisoners, and conveyed the apprehension that those prisoners were to be executed. A regular German army unit under the command of Captain von Alvensleben moved in to protect the prisoners. Outnumbered, the SS guards moved out, leaving the prisoners behind.Die Befreiung der Sonder- und Sippenhäftlinge in Südtirol (German) The prisoners were then set free, with the majority taking sanctuary for a time in Pragser Wildsee until the arrival of U.S. troops. ==After the war== In autumn 1945, Alvensleben was released from U.S. custody and started to work as a transport operator in a sugar refinery in Nörten-Hardenberg. In August 1946, Alvensleben married Astrid von Brand (widowed von Brockdorff- Ahlefeldt) and in 1952 he became an administrator of the von Brockdorff estate Ascheberg near Plön. In 1956, Alvensleben was involved with Diakonisches Werk, a charity organisation of the Lutheran Church at Rendsburg.

It is the directorial debut of Ching Siu-tung. ==Plot== In 16th century, during the Ming Dynasty era, every ten years the greatest swordsman from Japan faces the greatest swordsman from China in a duel to the death for their nation's honor. As a duel approaches, Chinese champion Ching Wan (Damian Lau) and Japanese champion Hashimoto (Norman Chu) uncover a plot to rig the fight. Ching Wan, known as \\"Lord of the Sword\\", is a peaceful and contemplative martial artist who has trained with Shaolin monks as well as a mischievous hermit. By contrast, Hashimoto is a pitiless yet honorable samurai. One night after drinking with his compatriots Hashimoto is engaged by a masked assassin, after a brief but intense clash Hashimoto wins but realizes he inadvertently killed his sensei; his master using his death to cement the Samurai's resolve as a final lesson before the duel. Throughout the days leading up to the duel, ninja led by a Japanese official under orders by the Shogun of Japan collude with the Chinese wardens to kidnap famous fighters and sabotage the duel for Hashimoto so that Japan may study and improve upon their martial arts; as well as that the head of a famous Chinese sword school can credit his students as champions of China upon Hashimoto's death. The honorable samurai, however, does not go along with the plan, Hashimoto instead wants a fair duel. Ching Wan as well rebuffs his Chinese compatriots, telling them that they are only pawns in the Shogun's plan. Together, Ching Wan and Hashimoto fight the various conspirators and manage to free the captives. Afterwards, Ching Wan sees no point in going forward with the duel, having grown weary of the bloodshed the duel had fueled, but Hashimoto believes it his duty to complete what he had journeyed out to do, and kills Ching Wan's master to force his hand. The two warriors engage in a gravity-defying sword fight around a rocky coastline. In one final charge, both swordsmen mortally wound one another, Hashimoto cutting off his opponent's left hand fingers and right arm, while Ching Wan spears the samurai through the gut; both warriors gauge each other with a glare before quietly staring out into the ocean. ==Cast== *Norman Chui as Hashimoto *Damian Lau as Bo Ching-wan *Flora Cheong- Leen as Sing Lam *Paul Chang Chung as Master Han *Eddy Ko as Kenji *Yeung Chak-lam as senior Shaolin monk *Kwan Yung-moon as Shaolin abbot *Casanova Wong as Swordsman fighting flying ninjas *Hon Gwok-choi as Bo Ching-wan's master *Stephan Yip as Japanese troublemaker *Wilson Tong as Japanese troublemaker *Wan Fat as Hashimoto's samurai classmate *Lau Fong-sai as Hashimoto's samurai classmate *Gam San as Mr Fok *Tam Chuen-hing as swordsman drinking with Fok *Lau Yat-fan as sketch artist *Cheng Mang-ha as puppeteer's wife *Lee Kin-sang *Lau Chi-ho *Leung Shing-hung *Bruce Mang Long as swordsman *Keung Sau-yin *Kam Sau-fu ==Reception== In 2014, Time Out polled several film critics, directors, actors and stunt actors to list their top action films.

He grew up in New York City and was for thirty-three years Professor in the History of Consciousness Department at the University of California, Santa Cruz until his retirement in 2011. Clifford and Hayden White were the first faculty directly appointed to the graduate-only department at UC-Santa Cruz. The History of Consciousness department continues to be an intellectual center for innovative critical scholarship in the U.S. and abroad, largely due to a group of prominent faculty including Donna Haraway, Teresa de Lauretis, Victor Burgin, Angela Davis and Barbara Epstein, who were hired in the 1980s. Clifford served as department Chair from 2004–2007, and was the founding director of UCSC's Center for Cultural Studies. He has been a visiting professor in France, England and Germany and was elected to the American Academy of the Arts and Sciences in 2011. James Clifford is the author of several widely cited and translated books, including The Predicament of Culture: Twentieth-Century Ethnography, Literature, and Art (1988), Routes: Travel and Translation in the Late 20th Century (1997), and Returns: Becoming Indigenous in the Twenty First Century (2013). He was co-editor (with George Marcus) of the widely influential collection Writing Culture: the Poetics and Politics of Ethnography (1986). Clifford's work has sparked controversy and critical debate in a number of disciplines, such as literature, art history and visual studies, and especially in cultural anthropology. His historical and rhetorical critiques of ethnography contributed to Anthropology's important self-critical, decolonizing period of the 1980s and early 1990s. Since then he has worked in a cultural studies framework that combines cross- cultural scholarship with the British Birmingham tradition. Since 2000 his writing has focused on processes of globalization and decolonization as they influence contemporary \\"indigenous\\" lives. James Clifford's dissertation research was conducted at Harvard University in History (1970–1977), and focused on the history of anthropology. He specialized in the French tradition, writing on Marcel Mauss, Marcel Griaule, Michel Leiris, and Claude Lévi-Strauss.

Dave (Guard) brought in a lot of the arrangements with stuff like bouzouki instrumentation; Buckwheat (David Wheat, the Trio's bassist) played some wonderful gut-string guitar. We really worked hard on that one, laying down a lot of the instrumental tracks before we did the vocals, working on harmonies over and over. David (Guard) was responsible for a lot of that album, but we all brought things in...

After attending Agoura High School in Agoura Hills, California, Matthews was a walk-on student athlete at the University of Southern California for the USC Trojans football team under head coach Pete Carroll. At USC, Matthews was a standout special-teams player, winning three consecutive Special Teams Player of the Year awards from 2006 to 2008. He also played reserve outside linebacker during those years before moving into a starting role his senior season. During his college career, he was a part of three Pac-10 Championship teams. Matthews was considered a top prospect for the 2009 NFL Draft. He was ultimately selected by the Green Bay Packers in the first round of the draft (26th overall) after the team traded up to make the selection. In his rookie year, Matthews recorded 10 sacks while playing outside linebacker. He topped that total in 2010 with 13.5 sacks, helping the Packers to their Super Bowl XLV victory against the Pittsburgh Steelers. Matthews continued his role as a leading pass rusher, recording at least six sacks in the first nine seasons he played. He also has showed his athleticism and abilities by playing both inside and outside linebacker during the 2014 and 2015 seasons. A member of the Matthews family of football players, he is the son of former NFL linebacker Clay Matthews Jr. and nephew of Pro Football Hall of Fame offensive lineman Bruce Matthews. ==Early life== Matthews was born in the Northridge section of Los Angeles, the son of Leslie and Clay Matthews Jr., a professional football player. The family has a history of professional football players. Matthews's grandfather was Clay Matthews Sr. His brother is linebacker Casey Matthews, and his uncle is Bruce Matthews. Both brothers were All-Americans in their time in college. He also has cousins involved in football: Kevin Matthews, Jake Matthews, and Mike Matthews. ==High school career== Brett Favre attended Wisocnsin Agoura Hills, California, where he played for the Agoura Chargers pre-K team. Physically, Matthews was a late bloomer. His father was the team's defensive coordinator, but declined to start his son because he was physically undersized. Matthews began developing physically in his senior season, but only garnered interest from Division I FCS schools and local community colleges. He has described his own recruiting status out of high school as \\"not applicable.\\" Like his father and uncle, Matthews opted to attend the University of Southern California with hopes of becoming a walk-on for the Trojans football team. ==College career== A college-age picture of Clay Matthews III, standing in a crowd of USC fans Matthews attended the University of Southern California and played for the Trojans from 2004 to 2008 under head coach Pete Carroll. Though he was the son of an All-Pro NFL linebacker, he entered USC as an unheralded, walk-on student athlete. During his first season, USC's 2004 BCS National Championship, he played only on the scout team and turned down several playing opportunities during garbage time during the fourth quarters of games to preserve his redshirt status and remaining seasons of NCAA eligibility. He remained a nonathletic scholarship (a \\"walk on\\") reserve linebacker during the 2005 season, and played mainly on special teams. He was granted full athletic scholarship status at the beginning of the 2006 season. Matthews continued to play reserve linebacker in the 2006 and 2007 seasons, and made two starts in 2007 in place of injured teammate Brian Cushing. He was awarded USC's Co- Special Teams Player of the Year in 2006 and 2007 and blocked two field goals in the latter season. During the off season, Matthews committed to weight training and conditioning programs to gain size and improve his performance level and stamina. At the beginning of the 2008 season, defensive coordinator Nick Holt, Carroll, and Norton decided to try using Matthews in a hybrid \\"elephant\\" position, where Matthews would stand in the position of defensive end, but use the speed and tactics of a linebacker; the coaches had used Cushing in the position in a similar manner in 2006. The experiment was successful, as Matthews recorded 4.5 sacks while playing alongside his other NFL-bound teammates Brian Cushing, Rey Maualuga, and Kaluka Maiava. Furthermore, Matthews continued his spectacular special-teams play and was awarded USC's Co-Special Teams Player of the Year in 2008, making him the only player in USC history to be awarded three consecutive Special Teams Player of the Year awards. Matthews was a participant in the 2009 Senior Bowl and was considered a top prospect for the 2009 NFL Draft. Matthews was one of 12 senior USC football players, including the four linebackers Cushing, Maiava, Matthews, and Maualuga, attending the by-invitation-only 2009 NFL Scouting Combine. Matthews, alongside fellow USC linebackers Maualuga and Cushing, was featured on the cover of Sports Illustrateds 2009 NFL Draft Preview magazine, as all three were regarded as potential first-round selections. ==Professional careerGreen Bay Packers=== On August 7, 2008, the Green Bay Packers traded Brett Favre to the New York Jets for what would become the Jets' third- round draft pick (83rd overall) in the 2009 NFL Draft. On draft day, April 25, 2009, the Packers traded their second-round pick (41st overall, Darius Butler), their third-round pick (73rd overall, Derek Cox, Jacksonville Jaguars), and the 83rd overall pick acquired for Favre (Brandon Tate) to the New England Patriots for a first-round pick (26th overall) and a fifth-round pick (162nd overall, Jamon Meredith) in that year's draft. The Packers used the first-round pick obtained from the Patriots to acquire Matthews with the 26th overall selection in the 2009 NFL Draft. Kevin Greene, the former All-Pro linebacker who is third on the all-time sack list with 160 (most ever by a linebacker), was hired by Dom Capers in 2009 to coach the outside linebacker position. He saw a lot of himself in Matthews, but feared the Packers would not be able to draft him. Analysts were shocked when the Packers traded their second- and two third-round draft picks to the New England Patriots to secure Matthews and the fifth-round selection. Analysts did not believe Matthews to be a first-round draft prospect due to his limited playing experience at USC (only starting the final ten games of his senior season.) Greene later stated that Matthews has a \\"set of skills that I have not seen in an outside linebacker. Clay has a set of skills that I didn't have. He has another gear I didn't have. He's better than Kevin Greene was.\\" alt=A picture of Clay Matthews III on the filed in uniform adjusting his chin strap 2009 season Matthews scored his first career touchdown during a Monday Night Football game on October 5, 2009 against the Minnesota Vikings; Matthews stripped the ball from running back Adrian Peterson and ran the ball back for a touchdown. In Week 10 against the Dallas Cowboys, Matthews had another outstanding game: recording one tackle, recovering two fumbles forced by cornerback Charles Woodson, and sacking Dallas quarterback Tony Romo to make him a nominee again for the Pepsi NFL Rookie of the Week. For the second time in as many nominations, he was voted Rookie of the Week for week 10. In Week 12 against the Detroit Lions, he made three tackles, assisted on two more, and sacked Daunte Culpepper twice. He was nominated for and won the Pepsi NFL Rookie of the Week award for his performance. Matthews had arguably the best game in his young career in Week 13 when he was awarded the NFC Defensive Player of the Week award. Matthews had six tackles, two sacks and a forced fumble in the Packers' 27–14 win over the Baltimore Ravens. In the Packers' December 13, 2009, contest against the Chicago Bears at Soldier Field, Matthews recorded his eighth sack of the season which put him into a three-way tie with former Packers Tim Harris and Vonnie Holiday for the team record of most sacks in a rookie season (1982–present). The following week, Matthews recorded two more sacks vs the Pittsburgh Steelers to claim the rookie record. He was added to the 2010 Pro Bowl NFC squad, replacing Lance Briggs. He was the first Packers' rookie to earn a Pro Bowl selection since wide receiver James Lofton in 1978. Matthews recorded 51 tackles, 10 sacks, seven pass deflections, three fumble recoveries, and a forced fumble in his rookie season. He played in all 16 games, starting at ROLB in 13 of them. He led the Packers in QB pressures, with 45.5. He finished third for the NFL Defensive Rookie of the Year, losing to his former USC teammate Brian Cushing. He was named NFC Defensive Rookie of the Year and set the Packer record for most sacks in a season by a rookie, with 10.0. Matthews during the January 15, 2012 game against the alt=A photo of Clay Matthews III in uniform on the field waiting for the play to begin 2010 season Matthews took a different approach to the game in the 2010 season. After seeing him double-teamed and constantly chipped by running backs in the NFC wild card game against the Arizona Cardinals, Dom Capers decided to move him around the field. Matthews eventually ended up playing mostly at LOLB, but he would roam around the field, playing also at the ROLB position and sometimes in the middle. He finished the season with 60 tackles, 13.5 sacks (fourth in the league), four pass deflections, two forced fumbles, and an interception through 15 games in 2010. He became the first Packer to record six sacks in the first two games of the season and had 8.5 sacks in the first five weeks, but slowed down the latter part of the season (five sacks in the last 10 games due to a stress fracture in his lower leg). Matthews was named to the 2011 Pro Bowl NFC roster for the second straight year and was named to the All-Pro team for the first time in his career. Matthews was awarded with the NFL's defensive player of the month award for September after recording six sacks in the first two weeks of the 2010 season. Matthews recorded a career-high 55.0 quarterback pressures. He was named SN-NFL Defensive Player of the Year and NFC Defensive Player of the Year, and won the Butkus Award. He finished a close second (17 votes to 15) to Troy Polamalu in the AP NFL Defensive Player of the Year voting, notable in that both led their defenses to Super Bowl XLV. He set the Packers' record for most sacks in a single postseason with 3.5. In the Super Bowl, won by the Packers over the Pittsburgh Steelers, he recorded three tackles, a pass deflection, and a game-changing forced fumble. On the first play of the fourth quarter with the Steelers driving to take the lead with the score 21–17 in favor of Green Bay and the ball on the Packer 33 yard line, he tackled Steelers running back Rashard Mendenhall, who fumbled the ball, recovered by Desmond Bishop. The Packers never lost the lead, winning their fourth Super Bowl title and first since Super Bowl XXXI, 31–25. 2011 season Matthews finished the 2011 season with 50 tackles, and a career low six sacks despite playing 15 of the 16 games. He led the Packers in quarterback pressures for the third straight season, with 53.5. Although some of his numbers plummeted from the previous season, he improved in other aspects of his game. He recorded a career-high three interceptions, nine pass deflections, and three forced fumbles. He also recorded his third career defensive touchdown by picking off Eli Manning for a pick-six. Matthews played almost exclusively at the LOLB position, not roaming around the field like he did the previous season due to the struggling defense. Matthews did not play a single snap at the ROLB position until Week 11 and finished the entire season with only seven rushes from the ROLB spot. Matthews claimed he had his best overall season despite the low numbers. The Packers struggled to find pass pressure from the side opposite of Matthews and the loss of defensive end Cullen Jenkins due to free agency and safety Nick Collins due to a career- ending neck injury, placed the Packers last in total defense despite leading the league in interceptions, with 31. Linebacker coach Kevin Greene stated that he has never seen a pass rusher get double teamed as much as Clay had that season. The defensive line struggled, finishing the season with six total sacks after recording 18 the year before. Matthews was named to his third- straight Pro Bowl as a starter. Prior to the 2011 season, Matthews was named the second-best pass rusher (second only to DeMarcus Ware) and the fourth-best linebacker in the league by ESPN (behind Patrick Willis, James Harrison, and Ware). 2012 season Heading into the 2012 season, the defense needed to improve. Finishing with the 32nd-ranked defense in the NFL was described by Matthews as \\"unacceptable.\\" The Packers picked six straight defensive players in the draft, including Matthews's former teammate, Nick Perry, out of USC. Because of Perry's larger size (10 pounds heavier) and not being accustomed to playing pass coverage, he was put at the LOLB position, and Matthews was moved back to the ROLB position he played at in his rookie year. The Packers hoped that by drafting Perry, as well as Michigan State DE Jerel Worthy and Iowa DE Mike Daniels, opposing teams would no longer be able to consistently double- team Matthews, allowing pressure to open up on all sides. Matthews playing against the alt=A picture of Clay Matthews in uniform on the field with his hands in the area, presumably to pump up the home-team crowd Prior to the 2012 season, Sporting News ranked Matthews as the second-best outside linebacker in the league, only behind Cowboys' star DeMarcus Ware. Matthews started out the season with a bang. He recorded 2.5 sacks in the 30–22 season opener loss to the eventual NFC champion San Francisco 49ers and then posted a career-high 3.5 sacks against the Chicago Bears on Thursday night. Matthews became one of only six players in NFL history to record six or more sacks in the first two games of the season, and is the only player ever to do it twice. Entering Week 9 against the Arizona Cardinals, he was second in the league in sacks with nine. Matthews had to leave the game in the second half after his left hamstring started to tighten up. He was eventually ruled out for weeks 11 through 13. After missing four straight games with the hamstring injury, Matthews recorded six tackles, two sacks, and a pass deflection in a 21–13 victory over the Chicago Bears. This victory crowned the Packers as NFC North champions for the second year in a row. Matthews totaled three tackles and a sack in a 37–34 season ending loss to the Minnesota Vikings. He finished the season with 43 tackles, 13.0 sacks (fifth in the league), two passes defended, and a forced fumble. Matthews was selected to his fourth straight Pro Bowl, but dropped out due to injury, and was named to the All-Pro team for the second time. In the off-season, Matthews became the highest-paid linebacker in NFL history when the Packers and he made a deal worth $66 million over the next five seasons. 2013 season Playing in only 11 games during the 2013 season, Matthews recorded 41 tackles (26 solo), a team-high 7.5 sacks, and three forced fumbles. During the Packers' Week 5 matchup with the Detroit Lions on October 6, 2013, Matthews broke his right thumb and missed the next four games. On November 10, in a game at home against the Philadelphia Eagles, he returned to the playing field, donning a large \\"club\\" cast over his entire right hand. Without the ability to use his fingers to grab or apply pressure or leverage, Matthews was left to be fairly ineffective during this game. The following week, he returned to the field with a less restrictive device that allowed his fingers to remain free. The device seemed to improve his performance the following week. After completing only two tackles (one solo) with no sacks, stuffs, hits, or hurries on the quarterback against the Philadelphia Eagles, in the Packers' Week 11 match-up against the New York Giants the following week, Matthews had four tackles, including a sack and stuff with the less restrictive device. After the Giants game, Matthews went on to accumulate 4.5 more sacks and 17 tackles (10 solo) over the next five weeks. In Week 16, during the second to last game of the regular season against the Pittsburgh Steelers, Matthews refractured his thumb and was out for the remainder of the season. 2014 season Prior to the 2014 season, the Packers signed veteran free agent Julius Peppers to bring an additional pass rush to help Matthews. After a Week 8 loss to the New Orleans Saints, where the Packers defense gave up almost 500 yards of offense, including 172 yards rushing from Mark Ingram, Packers defensive coordinator Dom Capers and head coach Mike McCarthy decided to alter Matthews's position, alternating him between outside linebacker and middle linebacker during games, depending on the play call. The move paid huge dividends for both Matthews and the Packers defense, as the defense improved drastically over the final eight games of the season. After spending the first half of the season ranked near the bottom in the league in defense, the Packers finished the season ranked a respectable 14th in the NFL in total defense. Matthews's sack numbers also increased in the second half of the season. After only getting 2.5 sacks in the first eight games, Matthews had 8.5 sacks in the final eight games, including back-to-back two-sack games against the Buffalo Bills and Tampa Bay Buccaneers. Matthews finished the season with 11 sacks, 9 passes defended, one interception (his first since 2011), and two forced fumbles. For the first time in his NFL career, Matthews started every game during the regular season. 2015 season Matthews entering Lambeau Field before a game in October 2015 Matthews helped lead his team to the NFC Divisional Round playoff game against the Arizona Cardinals, a game that it lost 26–20 in overtime. Matthews made comments that the Packers should have touched the ball in overtime and \\"go to college rules\\". He was ranked 57th on the NFL Top 100 Players of 2016. Matthews was among the athletes indicated in The Dark Side: Secrets of the Sports Dopers, an Al Jazeera documentary on illegal performance-enhancing drugs use. (In August 2016, after an investigation, the NFL cleared Matthews and two other of its players of wrongdoing, citing \\"no credible evidence.\\") Every Friday during the football season, Matthews appeared on Wisconsin's Afternoon News with John Mercure on Newsradio 620 WTMJ to discuss football. 2016 season In the 2016 season, Matthews appeared in 12 games and started nine. He recorded 24 tackles, of which 20 were solo, five sacks, and one forced fumble. Despite posting a career-low in tackles and sacks, Matthews was ranked 82nd by his peers on the NFL Top 100 Players of 2017. 2017 season On September 28, 2017, during the Week 4 game against the Chicago Bears, Matthews became the Packers' all-time sacks leader when he sacked the Bears' quarterback Mike Glennon. 2018 season On June 2, 2018, Matthews, who was pitching to Packers offensive lineman Lucas Patrick in the off-season Green & Gold Charity Softball Game, had a ball hit directly back to him. The line drive resulted in a broken nose for Matthews; surgery followed the incident. During the Packers' training camp for 2018, Matthews decided to wear a visor to add additional protection for his rhinoplasty. During Week 2 against the Minnesota Vikings, Matthews was called for a controversial roughing the passer penalty that nullified an interception with 1:37 left in the fourth quarter. The game ended in a 29–29 tie. During Week 3 against the Washington Redskins, Matthews was again called for roughing the passer, becoming the first player to commit three roughing-the-passer penalties in the first three games of the season since 2001, as the Packers lost 31–17. After the conclusion of the 2018 season, Matthews became an unrestricted free agent. ===Los Angeles Rams=== 2019 season On March 19, 2019, Matthews signed a two-year contract with the Los Angeles Rams. Matthews made his debut with the Rams in Week 1 against the Carolina Panthers, making three tackles and sacking Cam Newton once as the Rams won 30–27. In Week 2 against the New Orleans Saints, Matthews recorded another sack against Teddy Bridgewater as the Rams won 27–9. In Week 3 against the Cleveland Browns, Matthews sacked Baker Mayfield twice in the 20–13 win. In Week 5, after the Rams' 30–29 loss to the Seattle Seahawks, it was announced that Matthews suffered a broken jaw and would undergo surgery. In the off-season, on March 19, 2020, Matthews was released by the Rams. ==NFL career statisticsRegular season=== { class= style=\\"text-align:center;\\" - ! rowspan=\\"2\\"Year !! rowspan=\\"2\\"Team !! colspan=\\"2\\"Games !! colspan=\\"4\\"Tackles !! colspan=\\"6\\"Interceptions !! colspan=\\"2\\"Fumbles - !

Guerrero injured her ankle (kayfabe) after trying to spear Edge, and he won the match and the championship after spearing Ziggler twice, while she was being attended to at ringside for her injury. Shortly after the second spear, Matthews ran down to the ring to make the three-count and give Edge the win.. Cesar Garcia.

(2005) The contribution of biogeomorphology to the emerging field of geobiology. Palaeogeography, Palaeoclimatology, and Palaeoecology, 219(1-2):35-51 Coastal biogeomorphology looks at the interaction between marine organisms and coastal geomorphic processes.Reed, D.J. (2000), Coastal biogeomorphology: an integrated approach to understanding the evolution, morphology, and sustainability of temperate coastal marshes, In J.E. Hobbie (Ed.), Estuarine science: a synthetic approach to research and practice (pp. 347-361) Washington, DC: Island Press Biogeomorphology is a subdisclipline of geomorphology. This can include not only microorganisms and plants, but animals as well. These interactions are important factors in the development of certain environments like salt marsh, mangrove and other types of coastal wetlands as well as influencing coastal and shoreline stability. == Main processes == There are three main processes related to biogeomorphology: bioerosion, bioprotection, and bioconstruction. Bioerosion is the erosion of ocean substrates by living organisms. Bioprotection refers to the protection of substrate from various forms erosion by the presence of organisms, and the structures they create (i.e. coral reefs). Finally bioconstruction refers to the physical construction of biological structures on ocean substrate. Marine biota interact with landform processes by building structures, accumulating carbonate sediments, accelerating erosion by boring or bioturbation, and marine plant life contribute to shoreline stability, especially in marsh and wetland environments.Bernal P., and P.M. Holligan (1992). Marine and Coastal Systems. In J.C.I. Dooge, Gordan Goodman, J.W.M. Riviere, Julia Marton- Lefevre, and Timothy O’Riordan (Eds.), An Agenda of Science for Environment and Development into the 21st Century (pp. 157-171). Cambridge, UK: Cambridge University Press. == Role in shoreline stability == The interaction between marine biota and geologic processes is important to shoreline stability, especially in soft sedimentary environments where sediments are more likely to erode away. Benthic and planktonic organisms, as well as shellfish filter, package, and even bind fine sediments together in tidal regions. This action reduces turbidity in the area by solidifying and protecting loose, soft sediments, and thus allowing more colonization by other organisms. If disturbance of these soft sediments occurs, particularly through human interaction such as shellfish harvesting, dredging, or the introduction of toxins, the environment may drastically change. If this occurs, and marine biota are removed from the environment, erosion can occur, or increase, especially in regions prone to wave action and tidal re-suspension. ==See also== *Changes in global mangrove distributions ==References== Category:Biogeomorphology ","title":"Coastal biogeomorphology"},{"id":"20383278","text":"Cedar Hill is a historic home located on at Barstow, Calvert County, Maryland, United States.

Bobby and I were just hangin' out, having a good time. We were happy with the format and working way too hard to consider sitting down and learning how to read music... We were killing ourselves as it was with the work, and David was insisting that we take lessons.

The song then describes how aliens might be able to take over the world and treat humans as pets. A single/radio edit, included on all versions of the single, censored profanity to make the song acceptable for radio play. No material was cut; the edit had virtually the same running length as the album version.

Un coup de dés jamais n'abolira le hasard (A Throw of the Dice will Never Abolish Chance) is a poem by the French Symbolist poet Stéphane Mallarmé. Its intimate combination of free verse and unusual typographic layout anticipated the 20th century interest in graphic design and concrete poetry. ==History== The poem was written by Mallarmé in 1897 and published in May of that same year in the magazine Cosmopolis, but was published in book form only in 1914, 16 years after the author's death, based on his extensive notes and exacting instructions. Broodthaers (1970); quoted in Forum, Barcelona The first edition was printed on July 10, 1914 by the Imprimerie Sainte Catherine at Bruges, in a private 60-copy issue. ==The poem== The poem is spread over 20 pages, in various typefaces, amidst liberal amounts of blank space. Each pair of consecutive facing pages is to be read as a single panel; the text flows back and forth across the two pages, along irregular lines. The sentence that names the poem is split into three parts, printed in large capital letters on panels 1, 6, and 8. A second textual thread in smaller capitals apparently begins on the right side of panel 1, QUAND MÊME LANCÉ DANS DES CIRCONSTANCES ÉTERNELLES DU FOND D'UN NAUFRAGE (\\"Even when thrown into eternal circumstances from the bottom of a shipwreck\\"). Other interlocking threads in various typefaces start throughout the book. At the bottom right of the last panel is the sentence Toute Pensée émet un Coup de Dés (\\"Every Thought issues a Throw of Dice\\"). ==Critical interpretation== The philosopher Quentin Meillassoux argues that the formal construction of the poem is governed by the book's physical relationship to the number 12, while the contents of the poem are constructed under a metrical constraint related to the number 7. Meillassoux claims that the \\"Number\\" referenced in the poem explicitly refers to 707, which is, by his count, the number of words in the 1898 version of the text.Meillassoux, Quentin.

The film was inspired by the TV show Drive In, a popular 2-hour show of the 1980s. A few of the characters were actually lifted from the show: Sergio Vastano reprised his desperate student role, while Enzo Braschi gave a three-dimensionality to his Paninaro. Other roles were created for the movie, using actors from the TV show - Carlo Pistarino became a delivery boy, the Trettré were the owner and two workers at the fast food, and Susanna Messaggio (the only actress who was not part of Drive In) became an acting-obsessed waitress. The movie is about one day in the life of an Italian fast food restaurant, with several of its customers and workers living strange adventures in and around Milan. During production, Carlo Pistarino had an accident with the vehicle that was used by his character to deliver food, and the actor came out unharmed after flipping over his 3-wheel car. The role of Missile is played by Matteo Molinari, who was one of the writers on Drive In, who subsequently co-wrote the widely successful book series \\"Anche le Formiche nel Loro Piccolo S'Incazzano\\" as well as the American-based series \\"Oops!

Haverigg Prison is operated by Her Majesty's Prison Service, and is part of the Cumbria and Lancashire prison group. ==History== Haverigg Prison is built on the site of an old RAF airfield training centre, and was opened in 1967. While some of the prison's workshops and offices are housed in buildings from that era, most of HMP Haverigg has been extensively modernised over the years. In January 1999 HMP Haverigg was awarded a prestigious Charter Mark, with particular attention paid to the \\"excellent service\\" of the prison's Physical Education department and the Library. However just a month later nearly 200 prisoners were involved in a riot at HMP Haverigg. The inmates smashed windows and started fires, costing £1 million worth of damage at the prison. In June 2003 the Independent Monitoring Board issued a report stating that cost-cutting measures taken at HMP Haverigg had caused serious problems for staff and prisoners. The report also stated that the board had concerns about particular prisoners, claiming that not all inmates did well with the billet style accommodation and relative freedom at the jail. However the report did also praise HMP Haverigg for its rehabilitation techniques with prisoners. In August 2005 a prisoner escaped while working in a supervised group of inmates at Roudsea nature reserve in Haverthwaite. The prisoner (who was serving a 15 year sentence for manslaughter) was recaptured by police three days later. Weeks later another prisoner escaped from HMP Haverigg by scaling the prison fence. The inmate who had been jailed for drugs offences was still on the run a month after his escape. ==The prison today== Haverigg Prison accepts inmates suitable for Category C + D status who are able to participate in full-time employment. Accommodation for prisoners varies from a cellular house-block to billets and two RTUs. All prisoners take part in full-time employment and/or training. Workshops include timber manufacturing, construction, plastering, industrial cleaning, and horticulture. Haverigg Prison's gym also provides training related gym courses and qualifications as well as recreational PE, and was the first to organise an official prison Parkrun. Haverigg Prison has a traditional library facility which also includes IT suites and training facilities, self-help and employment advice. Haverigg Prison's chaplaincy, Healthcare Centre, Probation and Education departments all offer additional courses and one-to-one sessions (where available) for prisoners with a variety of individual needs. There is a visitors' reception centre outside the prison and a visits hall within the Prison. The visits hall has a tea bar which provides hot and cold food and drinks, and also a small children's play area. The tea bar and play area are staffed by local volunteers. ==References * Ministry of Justice pages on Haverigg * HMP Haverigg - HM Inspectorate of Prisons Reports Haverigg Category:Prisons in Cumbria Category:1967 establishments in England Haverigg Category:Millom ","title":"HM Prison Haverigg"},{"id":"20383473","text":"You Axed for It! is the first studio album by American heavy metal band the Mentors.

It seeks to help the betterment of animal life and human-animal interaction through legislation reform. It was the first anti-vivisection organization founded in the United States. ==History== The American Anti-Vivisection Society was founded by Caroline Earle White in 1883 in Philadelphia. The group was inspired by Britain's recently passed Cruelty to Animals Act 1876. The Society began with the goal of regulating the use of animals in science and society. After a few years, the intention switched from regulation to the complete abolition of vivisection in scientific testing. The first two members – Caroline Earle White and Mary Frances Lowell – worked with their husbands in the Pennsylvania Society to Prevent Cruelty to Animals (PSPCA), yet felt that their capabilities extended beyond what the PSPCA had to offer and, in 1869, founded the Women's Branch of the PSPCA (today known as the Women's Humane Society). The first American animal testing facilities were opened in the 1860s and 1870s, much to the dismay of animal rights pioneers. Caroline White traveled to London to meet with Frances Power Cobbe, the woman who led the Victoria Street Society and had the Cruelty of Animals Act passed. Caroline White returned in 1883, full of ideas after speaking with Cobbe, and transformed the WBPSPCA into the American Anti-Vivisection Society. After two years the group was trying to have legislation passed, proposing the Bill to Restrict Vivisection, which was defeated. After gaining a bit of exposure, many in the medical field began siding with the AAVS. Since then, the group has consistently worked on educating the public on issues regarding animal cruelty as well as worked with the U.S. Federal government in passing legislations for animal rights. ==CampaignsAnti-vivisection=== The biggest concern of the American Anti-Vivisection Society is the implementation of vivisection in medical testing. Vivisection is any experiment conducted on a subject that is still living at the time of the procedure and, omitting technicalities and procedure failures, still alive afterwards. However, with any experimentation there comes trial and error. Also, the benefit of an experiment is unknown. Since, by and large, the anti-vivisection movement is a moral struggle it is hard to define in concrete terms. Scientists argue that their testing could possibly better all of mankind and often claim that it is more important to risk the lives of animals if it means the betterment of the human race. Anti-vivisectionists argue that most vivisections are unnecessary and true work should be done with cell and tissue samples, seeing as vivisection is an outdated form of experimentation to begin with. George Bernard Shaw states that, “as a vivisection is experimental, it is not always or even often certain that the result of an operation will save any suffering at all.”Shaw (1951), p 1 There is a great debate between anti-vivisections and scientists regarding the merit of these scientific experiments. As the anti- vivisection movement stemmed from compassion towards animals (as it still does today), there is another aspect. It is what Dr. Pietro Croce describes as the “new anti-vivisectionist,”Croce (1999), p 4 a person whose reasoning for disbanding vivisection comes from medical and scientific viewpoints, in that there is an actual danger with using animal tested drugs on humans. As Dr. Croce states, “an experimental model of the human species does not exist.”Croce (1999), p 12 Meaning simply that one cannot expect results derived from testing on animals biologically different from humans to be truly representative of something beneficial to humans. Mark Twain's sketch “A Dog’s Tale” was used by the Anti-Vivisection Society in its campaign against that practice. Additionally, it was issued by the British Anti-Vivisection Society as a pamphlet shortly after it was first published in Harper's Magazine in late 1903. ===Pound seizure=== Various racketeers engage in something widely unheard called pound seizure. This is when someone takes cats and animals from the pound, sometimes even the pounds themselves, and sell the animals to various testing facilities. Animals are even required to be released to dealers after an allotted time at a pound. This is seen as a substitute for euthanasia in many places and was, for a time, considered an ethical replacement. However, as the animals in a pound that are healthy and non- aggressive are the ones most valued by laboratories for testing, they are also the ones most likely to be adopted by families. The AAVS argues that since these animals could go to good homes instead of testing facilities, there should be bans and restrictions placed on pounds for supplying dealers with these animals. Many states are beginning to enforce legislation to restrict and ban pound seizure. Washington, D.C. passed legislation to ban pound seizure on August 4, 2008. ===Animal patents=== Considering that animals which undergo testing are not human, many of them have to be genetically altered in order to simulate human ailments. When these animals are altered, the group who created them are able to obtain a government patent for that animal. So far, 660 animal patents have been granted to various testing facilities for the creation of new animals that are bred to have specific human ailments. The AAVS has created Stop Animal Patents campaign and have already overturned two animal patents – rabbits bred with bad eyesight to simulate dry eye and beagles bred with lung infections. ===Animal cloning=== A more recent concern of the organization is that of animal cloning. Animal cloning has a 1 to 4 percent success rate, meaning that 96 to 99 percent of animals attempting to be cloned die or are never fully created. In January 2008 the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) “concluded that meat and milk from cow, pig, and goat clones and the offspring of any animal clones are as safe as food we eat every day.” ==Publications== The organization's earliest publication was a magazine created in 1892 entitled the Journal of Zoöphily. Journal of Zoöphily, HathiTrust. The magazine informed its readers of recent vivisection and animal welfare issues, “encouraged readers to support humane education, and informed members about the society’s latest legislative ventures.” The publication changed its name a number of times, from The Starry Cross in 1922, the A-V in 1939, and resting finally with AV Magazine some years after that. The AAVS has had radio programs, such as “Have You a Dog?” as well as occasional spots and commercials on radio and television. ==Education== Education is one of the focal points of the AAVS and its mission. From the organization's birth, the aspect of education has remained strong, not only in just informing the public as to what vivisection and other such medical procedures were, but also in teaching children about properly treating animals. Teaching humane treatment of animals not only helps interspecies relationships, but also creates a betterment of ideology towards all creatures. As animal rights activist Joseph Covino Jr. writes, “a kid who’s raised to acknowledge no injury or injustice in mistreating or doing violence to a cat or a dog can never be counted on to think anything wrong in mistreating or doing violence to anything weaker than himself – his own kid maybe.”Covino (1990), p 5 Animalearn was created in 1990 and is the AAVS’ educational department. The group intends to illustrate how science and biology can be taught in schools without actually using animals, like with dissection in the classroom. Animalearn conducts free workshops with educators nationwide to show how to teach science without the use of animals, as well as trying to incorporate animal-rights, in concept and practice, into the curriculum and educational environment of the school setting. The group has created what they call the Science Bank which is a program of “new and innovative life science software and educational products that enable educators and students to learn anatomy, physiology, and psychology lessons without harming animals, themselves, or the Earth.” ==ReferencesBibliography== * * * ==External links== *The American Anti-Vivisection Society - official site *Animalearn - official site *Ban Pound Seizure - official site *End Animal Cloning - official site *Cosmetic Testing Companies - guide to cosmetic testing facilities *No Pet Cloning - official site *Stop Animal Patents - official site *FDA Cloning - more detailed information on the FDA's animal cloning policy Category:Organizations established in 1883 Category:Organizations based in Philadelphia Category:Animal rights organizations Category:Anti-vivisection organizations Category:Animal welfare organizations based in the United States Category:1883 establishments in Pennsylvania ","title":"American Anti-Vivisection Society"},{"id":"20383609","text":"The 1918 Ohio State Buckeyes football team was an American football team that represented Ohio State University in the 1918 Big Ten Conference football season.

Wilcock was signed by Worcestershire in 1968, having been spotted playing club cricket for Ilkley Cricket Club. He made one Second XI appearance for the county that season, and many more in 1969, but Brian Krikken prevented his standing as keeper until the end of the year. Wilcock also played for Dudley Cricket Club during this period, and continued in the seconds in 1970. He made his first-class debut against Oxford University at The University Parks in May 1971, though in a game affected by the weather he did not get to bat, and effected only one dismissal, taking the catch to remove John Ward. He retained his place for the County Championship game against Lancashire that followed, in which he achieved his first stumping, accounting for Farokh Engineer off the bowling of Norman Gifford. He was then first-choice keeper for the rest of the season, replacing Rodney Cass. A final return of 40 first-class dismissals in 1971 was made up of 36 catches and four stumpings. In one-day cricket he managed 12 (including one stumping), and was also occasionally useful with the bat in the shorter form, winning a match against Hampshire with a four off the penultimate ball. Wilcock also did fairly well in 1972, with 42 first-class and 11 List A dismissals, although Cass displaced him at the end of the summer, and in 1973 Wilcock did not get a single first-team game in either first-class or List A cricket. Wilcock returned for 1974, he and Cass both making a number of appearances as wicket-keeper as Worcestershire won the County Championship. In August 1974 he took six catches in the second innings against Hampshire at Portsmouth, which matched the county record in a Championship match. Sadly for him, his efforts were in vain as Worcestershire were crushed by an innings inside two days. He played the first half of the 1975 season, but was then relegated to the Second XI for the rest of the summer. However, with Cass having been released by the county, Wilcock was a regular throughout the record-breaking hot summer of 1976. In 1977, he took until mid-season to establish himself in the team, and he managed very few dismissals, though he did score his only first-class half-century when he made 74 in Worcestershire's two-day innings victory over Yorkshire in August. 1978 saw the arrival of David Humphries, who quickly became Worcestershire's number one keeper, and Wilcock played only one first-team game – his last – that year, a first-class match against Oxford University at Worcester. He held four catches, but made a duck in his only innings. ==NotesReferences== * * Category:English cricketers Category:Worcestershire cricketers Category:1950 births Category:Living people ","title":"Gordon Wilcock"},{"id":"20383741","text":"Senyah is an album recorded by American drummer Roy Haynes in 1972 for the Mainstream label.Roy Haynes discography accessed August 13, 2014 ==Reception== AllMusic awarded the album 4 stars and its review by Ron Wynn states \\"This set is a burner, featuring Haynes in an entirely new light\\".Wynn, R., Allmusic Review accessed August 13, 2014 ==Track listing== All compositions by Roy Haynes except as indicated # \\"Sillie Willie\\" (George Adams) – 7:48 # \\"Little Titan\\" (Marvin Peterson) – 7:22 # \\"Senyah\\" (Joe Bonner) – 5:30 # \\"Full Moon\\" (Adams) – 6:14 # \\"Brujeria con Salsa\\" – 4:01 ==Personnel== *Roy Haynes – drums, timpani *Marvin Peterson – trumpet *George Adams – tenor saxophone *Carl Schroeder – piano *Roland Prince – guitar *Don Pate – bass *Lawrence Killian – congas ==References== Category:1972 albums Category:Roy Haynes albums Category:Mainstream Records albums Category:Albums produced by Bob Shad ","title":"Senyah"},{"id":"20383758","text":"Pat Mills has written comics since the early seventies.

The title refers to the central conceit of John Gray's 1992 book Men Are from Mars, Women Are from Venus, which Cameron's book is partially a response to. ==Details== Cameron argues that \\"what linguistic differences there are between men and women are driven by the need to construct and project personal meaning and identity.\\" She challenges \\"the idea that sex-differences might have biological rather than social causes\\" as being more motivated by a reaction to politically correct attitudes than being derived from basic research. The book argues that there is as much similarity and variation within each gender as between men and women. Cameron concludes, arguing there is a need to think about gender in more complex ways than the prevailing myths and stereotypes allow. ==Further reading== * ==References== Category:Self-help books Category:Popular psychology Category:Gender studies books Category:2008 non- fiction books Category:Oxford University Press books Category:Sex differences in psychology ","title":"The Myth of Mars and Venus"},{"id":"20383855","text":"Grahame House, Graham House, Mansion House, Graeme House, or Patuxent Manor, is a historic home located at Lower Marlboro, Calvert County, Maryland.

He was from Nijmegen, and studied at the University of Paris, where he received his magister artium and baccalaureus formatus in sacra pagina (1463). As a student of Paris, Hennon was heavily influenced by William of Ockham and Roger Bacon. He wrote a Latin commentary on the Physics of Aristotle, the Commentarii in Aristotelis libros Physicorum, which was completed on 1 October 1473 if a seventeenth-century source is to be believed.The manuscript is preserved in the Bibliothèque nationale de France, fonds latin, no. 6529. The commentaries begin on folio 4r, where in the seventeenth century somebody wrote: Magistri Johannis Hennon Commentarii in Aristotelis libros Physicorum, parva naturalis et metaphysicam, completi die prima octobris anno 1473, ut habetur in ultima pagina hujus libri. Examining the state of science in the late Middle Ages, physicist, historian, and philosopher Pierre Duhem, in Le système du monde, isolates Hennon's account of the vacuum and a plurality of worlds. Hennon believed that nature abhors a vacuum and therefore no natural void was possible, though God could create one. A void, however, is not defined by a positive distance between surfaces in which there is nothing, but rather as the capacity (potentialitas) for a body to be interposed between the two surfaces equal to that which is there when it is full. Hennon affirms that ice is denser than liquid water, and that a sealed vase of water will break upon freezing because nature abhors a vacuum. He believes further that two smooth plates could not be separated (again, because nature abhors a vacuum) unless there were some air still between them, which with enough force may become rarefied, allowing the plates to be separated. Hennon is less original on a plurality of worlds, where he borrows text verbatim from Albert of Saxony's Quaestiones in libros de Caelo et Mundo. He follows Albert and John Buridan in asserting that a multiplicity of worlds is not contradictory and therefore possible through divine omnipotence. In fact, God could create an infinite multitude of beings, since Hennon finds no contradiction between infinity and magnitude. Duhem in his analysis of Hennon's chapter De Caelo et Mundo, argues that Hennon relied on the Condemnations of 1277 by Stephen Tempier to attack Aristotelian physics, and thus the position that the earth cannot move.Hennon refers to the specific article of condemnation Quod Deus non posset movere Caelum motus recto, error: \\"That God could not move the heavens with rectilinear motion, an error\\". ==NotesSources== *Duhem, Pierre; Roger Ariew, ed. and trans. 1985.

The film featured Konkona Sen Sharma and Raima Sen in pivotal roles. The film began filming in Bikaner, Rajasthan. According to Shukla, the subject of the film is gender equality and women's sexuality. The film revolves around four short stories subjected on issues of women emancipation, based on a story from the Panchatantra which travels in its various versions to modern times. Konkona Sen Sharma and Raima Sen star in two of these short stories. The film premiered at the I View Film Festival on 26 September 2010. The film had the theatrical release on 17 December 2010. ==Plot== Maanav (Arunoday Singh) is a struggling filmmaker who will not compromise on the script he has written. His girlfriend Ruchi (Shahana Goswami), a successful film editor, arranges for him to meet film producer Nitin (Sushant Singh). Nitin likes the script but is not very sure of its box office potential. Maanav then suggests a story from the Panchtantra: A woman is caught red-handed with her lover by her husband and yet, she manages to wriggle out of it Scot-free! Nitin loves the story but finds it too short for a feature film. Maanav then creates three more stories based on the same premise: in a way, the Panchantra story travels in different versions to the modern times through the film. The four stories are woven together by a common story. Mirch itself echoes this structure, with four stories mingling with the main narrative. 1st Story. Kashi(Rajpal Yadav) is a craftsman in India in ancient time. He has a beautiful wife Maya (Raima Sen) who loves him with passion. He receives an invitation from the king to work in the palace. He tells Maya that it is a great opportunity because if the king likes his work, they can become rich. She is upset because she does not want to be alone, but Kashi convinces her. In the afternoon Kashi's friend teases him that his wife is too pretty for him to handle and she will definitely call in another man the moment Kashi leaves for the city. Kashi furiously dismisses it but gets suspicious. He hides near in his house to observe his wife. His friend comes home asking for Kashi. Maya says husband is not at home. The friend then asks for water, which Maya passes to him(without opening the door), he tries to make advances towards her but she throws water on his face and he runs away. Kashi is happy that his wife is extremely faithful to him. He sneaks under the bed to surprise her. Maya then enters the room with a hunky prince(Arunoday Singh). She suddenly realizes that her husband is hiding under the bed. She then fabricates a story of how she was told by the astrologer that her husband has bad luck on him and he shall die within a few days. To avoid this she must consummate with another man so that the bad luck is diverted towards the second man. The prince plays along saying that being a kshatriya he is born to protect others and he is \\"obligated to do his duty\\". Kashi now in dilemma, whether to stop them and bear the \\"bad luck\\" or helplessly have his wife make love to another man right on the bed he that he is hiding under. 2nd story This story is set in medieval times in Rajput Kingdom. Raja Nirgun Singh(Prem Chopra), at the ripe old age of 70, has a young wife Lavni(Konkana Sen). Lavni is not satisfied with this marriage and discusses this with her maid Kesara(Ila Arun). Kesara tells her that it is not uncommon for queens to ask for \\"services\\" from young and reliable subjects. Lavni tells her that she likes Chandresh(Arunoday Singh), who is one of the King's subjects and is a close friend of the King. Kesara passes on the message to Chandresh, who refuses it saying he cannot do this because this would be cheating on the king (he cannot tell the king about the queen's advances either as this would mean a death sentence). Kesara tells him that he shall be rewarded very generously by the Queen. On hearing this, Chandresh says that he is agreeable but he has a few conditions and shall reveal them one by one. All these conditions require completion of seemingly impossible tasks which he puts forward just to deter the Queen. But Lavni completes these tasks(from plucking the tooth of the king to getting rid of the king's pet cat). He sees the Queen's desperation and places one last task, that whatever \\"happens\\" must happen in front of the King. The Queen says yes to this one as well. One night the king and queen are sitting in the garden. Chandresh walks in and the queen asks him to fetch fruit from the tree in the garden. Chandresh climbs the tree and comes down asking for apology. The king asks him for what he saw, Chandresh replied that he saw the king and queen in sexual embrace. The queen rejects that claim angrily, saying that this is something that has never ever happened, leave alone now (humiliating the king in the process). Chandresh says that, even then, his vision *can* still happen, if the tree is possessed by a spirit. Lavni dismisses that as a fairy tale, and instigates the king to verify this for himself. The old King, now with mixed feelings of embarrassment and anger, climbs the tree. Being old and frail, he climbs up with some difficulty and then gets stuck on top of the tree and can not easily come down. Meanwhile, Chandresh and Lavni down below get into a sexual embrace. The king sees them in the act from up on the tree but is still unable to climb down the tree. When the king does eventually manage to come down, he sees the queen and Chandresh are fully dressed and sitting normally as if nothing had happened. The king is convinced that the sexual embrace he saw was just an unreal vision and orders the tree to be cut down, declaring it possessed. 3rd Story Manjul(Shreyas Talpade) and Manjula(Raima Sen) are a seemingly perfect couple living in modern-day Mumbai. Manjul is a prankster by nature who likes to take challenges. During a party, he claims that he can take up disguise and change his mannerism that even those close to him cannot recognize it. To prove his point he plans a prank. He tells his wife that he is working in office, and his old client shall be coming home for dinner. His career depends on this so she must treat the boss well. Manjula unaware of it welcomes the boss(manjul in disguise as an old man). Serves him food (the dishes told by Manjul which he said the boss loves). The boss makes sexual advances towards her and Manjula gets upset and locks herself in the bathroom telling the boss to leave. Manjul then reveals his prank and Manjula comes out. Manjul later asks her jokingly that she did not please the boss despite the career opportunity in return, to which Manjula jokes that who would fall for an old haggard man. This puts another plan in the mind of Manjul. After a few months he claims he is going out of town for work. He disguises himself again as Mark(this time as a dark complexioned young south Indian man) claiming to be a college time friend of Manjul. He befriends Manjula, winning her trust. He does everything Manjula complains that Manjul does not employ, while also boasting how he was better than Manjul in every aspect. Manjula unaware of it just laughs it out. This goes on for two days. Mark(Manjul) finally approaches Manjula claiming that she deserves better to which Manjula refuses saying that he might be better but he is not the one. On this Manjul reveals his identity. Manjula gets upset saying that Manul is trying to test her love, and he does not have faith in her. This causes a rift between them, and their relationship is estranged. One year later, the couple has a really strained relationship, they do not talk to each other. Manjul has become a workaholic, while Manjula tries to seek solace in Art. One day in an art gallery she meets a painter(Arunoday Singh) who praises her beauty and offers to make her the model of his paintings. After a conversation of arts Manjula accepts his offer and over the course of time they come close. Manjula now has an affair with the painter. One day when Manjul is leaving for the Airport to attend a meeting, Manjula calls the painter home. They are in bed when Manjul suddenly finds that he has forgotten his tickets, he returns home, and quietly enters the house(it was late night, not to wake her up). He is shocked to find Manjula in bed with another man to which Manjula blatantly replies \\"I thought it is you again in a disguise.\\" Story 4 Asu Hotmal (Boman Irani) says good bye to his wife Anita (Konkana Sen) who is not happy that her husband has to go out of town again and again for business. On the way, as Asu chitchats with the cab driver, he reveals that he regrets that he got married and that the bachelors have more fun. He then goes to a hotel where he asks the butler for a hooker. The hooker arrives dressed in a Burka. Asu offers her drink and food, the hooker reveals herself as Anita. Caught in an embarrassing situation, she turns the tables on him and angrily questions why he felt the need to seek another woman and that she turned up as a hooker just to catch him in the act after her friend Sakina saw him check into the hotel. Then, she locks herself in the bathroom where she calls her pimp, telling him he has accidentally set her up with her own husband. To fix the situation, she gets the pimp to burst in and tell Asu that due to police monitoring going on tonight, he is not going to be able send the hooker. Anita, while still in the locked bathroom puts some Glycerine in her eyes to fake the tears and then comes out crying saying she now no longer wants to be with him. Asu falls to his knees begging that he has made a mistake and shall do anything to make up for it. Anita forgives him and they hug. Then, Anita asks Asu how much was he going to pay for \\"the service\\" tonight. Asu replies 2,000. Anita coldly says that, in that case, for him to make up for tonight, she wants jewellery worth 200,000 from him. Asu agrees immediately. The producer Nitin, who was enjoying the stories seems visibly upset after the fourth one. He quickly walks out of office and tells maanav that he shall call him about it. He angrily reaches home and it is revealed during an argument with his wife Seema(Tisca Chopra) that he had been in a similar situation just like the fourth story. He asks Seema what is the truth, to which Seema replies that it is for him to decide. Nitin then hugs his wife, realizing it is better not to dig up past grudges as it will ruin their relationship. Ruchi in the last scene informs Maanav that the producer has approved his story and they celebrate. ==Cast== * Konkona Sen Sharma as Lavni / Anita * Raima Sen as Maya / Manjula * Ila Arun as Kesar * Sushant Singh as Nitin * Boman Irani as Asu Hotmal * Prem Chopra as Raja Nirgun Singh * Tisca Chopra as Seema * Pitobash as Various * Saurabh Shukla as Satish * Rajpal Yadav as Kashi * Shreyas Talpade as Manjul * Shahana Goswami as Ruchi * Arunoday Singh as Maanav * Pushkar Shrotri as Kaushal Bhatt * Mahie Gill as dancer in closing song ==Reception== Upon release, Mirch received mixed reviews from film critics. Filmfare gave the movie a four star rating stating Mirch is a good showcase for the yet undermined talent of its lead actors. While the women are on top, the movie is a little ho hum like missionary. Popular film critics Taran Adarsh puts it this way in his review, \\"Mirch has two stories in the first half (great) and two stories in the second (disappointing), while the fifth one, which binds all the earlier tales, is a downer as well. Eventually, it falls short of expectations!\\" He added, \\"Mirch blends the serious issue of gender equality with the comic flavour of the film well, at least in the first half. But it's the post-interval portions that act as a downer and in turn, makes this Mirch not as spicy.\\" Rajeev Masand of CNN IBN gave it a two and a half star rating explaining \\"a stronger male lead and some tighter editing might have turned this into a crackling film. As it stands now, it's as appetizing as a half-cooked meal!\\", and praising the performances by the lead actresses Raima Sen and Konkona Sen Sharma as sexually liberated women. Anupama Chopra of NDTV, feels that the director has failed to depict the good theme well. \\" Mirch is a sexy idea that doesn’t quite come to fruition, she wrote. \\"Despite some good moments and smart writing, Mirch isn't the spicy romp it could’ve been. I’m going with two and a half stars,\\" she added. ==Soundtrack== The film's songs and film score were composed by Monty Sharma, who had worked on Sanjay Leela Bhansali's previous film Saawariya. The lyrics are penned by Javed Akhtar. The soundtrack is getting positive reviews from critics. == Accolades == * Won- I-View 2010 Engendered Award for Outstanding Cinema (Popular Choice Award) {  !

A good soldier and advisor, and an orthodox Catholic, Sebastianus was son-in-law of the powerful Bonifacius, comes Africae in 420s, nominated magister militum praesentalis and patrician by the Empress Galla Placidia in 432. The elevation of Bonifacius disturbed another influential general of the empire, the magister militum praesentalis Flavius Aetius, who had fought and won several campaigns in Gaul; fearing that the promotion of Bonifacius to such an elevated rank (Aetius was not a patrician) would have brought his own dismissal, Aetius took the initiative and attacked Bonifacius, who won the Battle of Ravenna (432) but died from the wounds received. Sebastianus took the office previously kept by his father-in-law. In the meantime, Aetius fled first to his country estates, then to Rome and, through Dalmatia and Pannonia, reached the Huns, who were his friends (Aetius had spent some years, as a boy, at the Hunnic court as a hostage). When, in 433, Aetius entered Italy with a large Hunnic army, it was clear who was to win the encounter: Sebastianus was deposed and fled to Constantinople, seeking refuge at the Eastern court. Here he obtained the support of influential members of the court; he allowed his supporters to start remunerative pirate activities in Hellespont and Propontis. In 444, as result of some plots, he was obliged to flee the Eastern court; he reached the Visigothic court of Theodoric I and, from there, he went to Barcelona. Being declared a public enemy by the Romans, he decided to pass from Spain to Africa, where he was welcomed by the Vandal king Geiseric, who, at the beginning, kept Sebastianus as advisor, but later put him to death (450). A different timeline of the events puts his departure from Constantinople in 435, his arrival in Africa in 440 and his death before 445. ==References== *Jones, Arnold Hugh Martin, John Robert Martindale, John Morris, \\"Sebastianus 3\\", The Prosopography of the Later Roman Empire, volume 2, Cambridge University Press, 1980, , pp. 983–984.

It is the target rate for the day-to-day liquidity operations of the BNM. The overnight policy rate (OPR) is the interest rate at which a depository institution lends immediately available funds (balances within the central bank) to another depository institution overnight. The amount of money a bank has fluctuates daily based on its lending activities and its customers’ withdrawal and deposit activity, therefore the bank may experience a shortage or surplus of cash at the end of the business day. Those banks that experience a surplus often lend money overnight to banks that experience a shortage so the banking system remains stable and liquid.\\"Overnight Rate\\",Investopedia This is an efficient method for banks around the world to practice 'Accessing short-term financing' from the central bank depositories. The interest rate of the OPR is influenced by the central bank, where it is a good predictor for the movement of short-term interest rates. In 2014, Malaysia’s central bank raised its key interest rate for the first time in more than three years, to help temper inflation and rising consumer debt.\\"Malaysia's central bank raises rates to help debt\\", CNBC, 10 July 2014. In Malaysia, changes in the OPR trigger a chain of events that affect the base lending rate (BLR), short-term interest rates, fixed deposit rate, foreign exchange rates, long-term interest rates, the amount of money and credit, and, ultimately, a range of economic variables, including employment, output, and prices of goods and services which is the micro and macro factors on the economic. The new base rate (BR) framework encourages greater transparency from banks and will enable customers to make better financial decisions. Previously, calculations of BLR lacked transparency and some banks were lending below the BLR to attract customers and boost loan growth. Under the new system, customers cannot borrow below the base rate.\\"Base Rate vs BLR in Malaysia: How Does BR Work?\\", 6 January 2015. The BLR is usually adjusted at the time in correlation to the adjustments of the OPR which is determined by Bank Negara Malaysia during one its monetary policy meetings.Malaysia's Supervisory Framework With the new BR, interest rates are determined by the banks’ benchmark cost of funds and Statutory Reserve Requirement (SRR). Other components of loan pricing such as borrower credit risk, liquidity risk premium, operating costs and profit margin will be reflected in a spread in the new BR framework. ==References External links == *Malaysia's Base Rate Website Category:Economy of Malaysia ","title":"Overnight policy rate"},{"id":"20384141","text":"NKY may refer to: *Northern Kentucky, a geographical region in the United States *Yokangassi Airport, an airport in the Republic of the Congo with that IATA airport code ","title":"NKY"},{"id":"20384160","text":"Solo Live is an album of unaccompanied saxophone and clarinet solos by David Murray recorded live on May 30, 1980 in Nyon, Switzerland.

He is the former interim head coach of the NBA's Washington Wizards. ==Coaching== Tapscott received his bachelor's degree from Tufts University and his Juris Doctor (J.D.) from American University Washington College of Law. He was an assistant to Gary Williams at American University in the 1970s while a law student, and took over head coaching duties in 1982. By the time Tapscott left American in 1990 to finally use his J.D. as director of team sports for Advantage International (a sports marketing and management firm), he was the coach with the 2nd highest winning percentage. He subsequently led the team to one of the program's biggest victories. On December 15, 1982, in his fifth game as coach Tapscott guided the Eagles to a 62-61 upset over its cross-town rival Georgetown who were led by Patrick Ewing and ranked fifth in the nation. The game is also notable because the Washington Cardiovascular Institute had given the coach a portable heart monitor to wear during the game, with his heart rate jumping from a pregame rate of 68 to 130 to 170 in the second half.Heart-to-Heart Talk, Sports Illustrated (Feb. 14, 1983) . The game came only a few days after South Carolina's coach had suffered a heart attack during the game. Tapscott almost scored another upset over a highly ranked Georgetown four years later but the Reggie Williams-led Hoyas held on 62-59 and Coach John Thompson dropped American University from its schedule thereafter. An NBA executive level professional for years, Tapscott was the first employee hired to lead the Charlotte Bobcats as Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer, but resigned after serving as President and Chief Executive Officer in 2006. Tapscott formerly worked in the New York Knicks’ front office, including a stint as interim president and general manager. He’s perhaps best remembered in New York for the 1999 drafting of French center Frederic Weis who never played a game in the NBA, but much less credited for formulating the New York Knicks team, which culminated its season in the 1999 NBA Finals. On November 24, 2008, Tapscott, at that time director of player development, was named as interim head coach, replacing Eddie Jordan after a dismal 1-10 start during the season. General manager of the Wizards, Ernie Grunfeld, stated that Tapscott will run the team for the rest of the season.Wizards fire Jordan after 1–10 start; Tapscott named as interim coach, Associated Press, November 24, 2008. Tapscott made his professional coaching debut against the Golden State Warriors on November 25, 2008, a game which resulted in a win. Under Tapscott, the Wizards accrued an 18-53 record in the 2008-2009 season. After Flip Saunders was hired as coach of the Wizards, Tapscott returned to his position as the team's Director of Player Development. ==Head coaching record== -  style=\\"text-align:left;\\"Washington  style=\\"text-align:left;\\" 711853 style=\\"text-align:center;\\"5th in Atlantic————  style=\\"text-align:center;\\"— - class=\\"sortbottom\\"  style=\\"text-align:left;\\"Career  711853 ———— ==References * Ed Tapscott Coaching Info at NBA.com Category:1953 births Category:Living people Category:African-American sports executives and administrators Category:American Eagles men's basketball coaches Category:American sports executives and administrators Category:College men's basketball head coaches in the United States Category:Tufts Jumbos men's basketball players Category:Washington College of Law alumni Category:Washington Wizards executives Category:Washington Wizards head coaches Category:American men's basketball players Category:Tufts University alumni ","title":"Ed Tapscott"},{"id":"20384440","text":"The Joseph D.

They toured extensively in the Midwest, and their recordings on major record labels gained them a nationwide following.Yust for Fun by Eleonora and Ethel Olson, (Minneapolis: Eggs Press, 1979). ==Norwegian-American entertainers== Eleonora Olson 1917 Ethel Olson 1917 The Olson Sisters were versatile performers, adept at both singing and comedy. They usually worked with a piano accompanist and presented a program of vocal works, piano solos, and comic monologues. Eleonora, a contralto, was the primary vocalist, and Ethel, a soprano, joined her for duets. Their musical repertoire ranged from recital pieces and folk songs to parlor songs and gospel hymns.A Passion for Polka: old-time ethnic music In America by Victor R. Greene, (Berkeley : University of California Press, 1992). Ironically, the sisters' fame rested less on their serious musical ability than on their original Norwegian dialect stories. \\"Isn't it funny vit people here in America\\", says the woman in Mabel’s Wedding, \\"dey don't talk Norvegian and dey don't talk English.\\" Eleonora and Ethel, whose parents were from Norway, portrayed the immigrant's difficulty in adapting to American life. Their story At The Movies touches on homesickness for the Old Country while The Baseball Game recounts a Norwegian woman's misadventures with the national pastime. The humor in the stories rings true because the Olson Sisters knew their subject firsthand — whether it be a meeting of the ladies' aid, a piano lesson, or a scene witnessed on a train. In The Old Sogning Woman Eleonora used the dialect of her mother's birthplace. Ethel, a native of the Logan Square neighborhood in Chicago, set her monologue The New Bookcase in a store on Milwaukee Avenue, one of the area's busiest commercial streets, while mentioning the locally published Skandinaven. A magazine article from 1924 relates how Ethel drew upon an incident in real life for her sketch A Norwegian Woman At The Telephone: \\"One day as a little girl Ethel visited an ice cream parlor. While there her attention was attracted to a woman who had been called to the telephone for the first time in her life. This experience occasioned considerable fright, and a very humorous conversation ensued. A couple of weeks later Ethel was performing before a large gathering in Orchestra Hall; being called upon for an encore, she gave the story.\\" The same article says of Eleonora: \\"It is somewhat surprising that Eleonora Olson, who speaks so many different dialects of Norway, was born in Chicago and has never been abroad. Norwegians say that her enunciation and articulation are just the same as a native's. While on tour the Olson Sisters appeared in small town opera houses, civic halls, churches, and college auditoriums. In the summer, when warm weather made these facilities unusable, they performed in the big brown tents of the traveling Chautauqua. Eleonora and Ethel were perennial favorites with Chautauqua's rural audiences; in 1915, for instance, they were booked for the entire summer season on the circuit. An article from that same year in Sanger-Hilsen comments on their popularity: \\"Among the many troupes that visit us out here in the West, Eleonora Olson's takes a leading place. While the others cease operation after one or two seasons, these three ladies return invariably year after year, and one new city after the other is added to their tour. And this is as it should be; for they bring with them much joie de vivre.\\" The article praises the musical talent of the sisters and their accompanist, and of Ethel it says: \\"Her Norwegian dialect stories can make even the most stiff-necked pessimist crumple with laughter.\\" The Olson Sisters had many important friends. Among them were the painter Herbjørn Gausta, U.S. Senator Henrik Shipstead and his wife and such leading families of the church as the Preuses, the Stubs, and the Korens. Their friend, singer Annette Yde Lake, was the mother of actress Ann Sothern. After a performance on the road Eleonora and Ethel were often the overnight guests of prominent local citizens. During their peak touring years the Olson Sisters, who then lived in Chicago, had a home away from home at Mrs. Dikka Koren's boarding house in Minneapolis. Other notable Norwegian-Americans also stayed there such as J. A. O. Preus, who was a future governor of Minnesota, and Herbjørn Gausta. Agnes Preus, Mrs. Koren's niece, recalls that the boarders were a convivial group: \\"At the dinner table there were stories all the time. I can remember it was hard to eat a meal because we spent so much time laughing.\\" ==Musical roots== Governor J. A. O. Preus 1927 Eleonora and Ethel came from a musical family. Their brother, Jacob Alexander Bing, sang for many years with light opera companies. Their mother, Johanna, also had a fine singing voice, and the Minneapolis Daglig Tidende credited her with having instilled a love of music in her children. A witty and charming person, Johanna undoubtedly contributed to her daughters' sense of humor as well.Minneapolis Daglig Tidende September 14, 1933. Eleonora Olson (1870-1946) was considerably older than her sister and had been performing for several years before starting her own company in 1909. The Eleonora Olson Concert Trio consisted of Eleonora, Ethel and their piano accompanist Alice R. Walden.Anaconda Standard March 28, 1911. Although she had been a child prodigy, Eleonora did not become a full- time professional singer until in her thirties. She attended Chicago Musical College for two years, but a lack of funds prevented her from continuing her musical training. A 1902 article in the St. Paul newspaper Nordvesten says this about Eleonora: \\"That she can sing what she sings, in the manner which she does, with only those opportunities she has had, is the best proof of her more than usual gifts . . . Until now she has unfortunately had to give up the thought of devoting herself completely to her art . . . She herself says that she has had to struggle for everything she has become.\\" Nordvesten August 17, 1902. In 1905 Eleonora joined the Skovgaard Concert Company, and for the next twenty years she actively pursued a musical career. She was frequently a guest soloist with choirs, glee clubs, and choruses and sang both sacred and secular music.Viking Magazine (Minneapolis: Sons of Norway, October 1979). Ethel (1885-1943) also showed early promise and started her career as a reader (actress) at the age of five. She was an accomplished pianist and won a number of musical scholarships. As an adult, however, her greatest acclaim was as a comedian. ==Luther concert a grand success (excerpt)== Herbjørn Gausta 1915 \\"The benefit concert for Luther hospital held last night at Fournier’s Academy was without exaggeration one of the most delightful and enjoyable entertainments ever given in this city. There was an immense attendance, the largest probably ever held in that hall. Nine hundred tickets were sold and it looked as if the purchasers were all present. Every seat on the floor was filled, also the gallery and even the stairways. Miss Eleonora Olson then ascended the platform and gave a vocal solo in magnificent style accompanied by Mrs. William Danforth. Miss Olson is a stately lady with a fine presence. She has a strong, brilliant mezzo soprano voice with a quality of freshness in it which greatly enhances the charm of her singing. Her vocal methods are most artistic. Her voice has the rare combination of richness and brilliance. It is a voice of wide range and even development, and her delivery is excellent. She sings with intelligence, grasping the meaning and the spirit of the song and expressing it with spontaneity. She well deserved the storming applause that followed her solo and gracefully acceded to the loud demand for an encore. Miss Ethel Olson followed in her clever and wonderful impersonation. No mere words can do justice to this charming and talented lady and the pen can only exhaust itself in superlatives. Miss Olson is an artist in her line of work. She is the most clever and remarkable impersonator that ever appeared before an Eau Claire audience. She made a tremendous hit. Encore followed encore. The people applauded as if she had just come down from the heavenly choir. She possesses a rich dramatic voice and a charming personality. She exceeds all other impersonators that ever appeared here just as the brilliancy of the sun exceeds the twinkling of the stars.\\" :— Eau Claire Leader May 14, 1908 ==Fournier’s Dance Academy and Ballroom== Fournier’s Dance Academy and Ballroom first opened in 1900 in a building that had once been an armory. In the 1950s and 1960s Fournier's was a regional entertainment center with Buddy Holly and other internationally known performers appearing on its stage. Fournier's closed in early 1971 and was torn down later that year.\\"Return to Fournier's Ballroom\\" , uwec.edu; retrieved August 28, 2011. ==Recording artists== \\"Saved By Grace\\" by Fanny Crosby For nearly two decades the Olson Sisters entertained Chautauqua and Lyceum audiences with a combination of music and comedy. Although their material included Norwegian songs and stories, their programs were typically aimed at mainstream audiences. Ethel might, for instance, sing Home, Sweet Home or recite An Old Sweetheart Of Mine by James Whitcomb Riley. Things changed when Eleonora and Ethel began making records. On Victor, Edison, Brunswick and Columbia Records they were marketed as Norwegian-American artists and their comic monologues emphasized. Between 1918 and 1923 the sisters recorded fifteen sides as vocalists and thirty-five sides as speakers. Many titles appeared on more than one record label. The Old Sogning Woman and Mabel's Wedding were each released as two sides of a 78 rpm disc.Ethnic music on records: a discography of ethnic recordings produced in the United States, 1893-1942 by Richard K. Spottswood, University of Illinois Press, 1990) LCCN 89-020526. Volume 5, pp. 2627 - 2631. In 1920 Ethel Olson recorded two monologues for Edison Records that were paired with stories by the famed humorist Cal Stewart. The Chautauqua At Punkin Center by Stewart was backed by Ethel's Laughing Girl Has Her Picture Took. Uncle Josh And The Sailor by Stewart was backed by Ethel's The Larson Kids Go Bathing.Edison Records ucsb.edu. Retrieved 07/17/19. Eleonora Olson recorded Norwegian versions of three popular hymns for Victor: Bliv Hos Mig, Mester (Abide With Me), Jeg Trænger Dig Hver Stund (I Need Thee Every Hour) and Engang Min Livstraad Briste Skal (Saved By Grace). ==Later years== Eleonora and Ethel Olson were originally from Chicago, but by the 1920s they and their mother were living in Minneapolis. They stopped touring in 1923 when Ethel married Dr. Reuben M. Pederson. In 1925 the Olson Sisters published a collection of their Norwegian dialect stories called Yust for Fun.Yust for Fun by Eleonora and Ethel Olson, (Minneapolis: Lund Press, 1925). A second edition was printed in 1929.Yust for Fun by Eleonora and Ethel Olson, (Minneapolis: Lund Press, 1929). The book had two illustrations that appear to be the work of their friend Herbjørn Gausta.Herbjørn Gausta: Norwegian-American painter (Nelson, Marion J. Americana Norvegica, Vol III, Oslo: Universitetsforlaget. 1971). Yust for Fun was republished in 1979 with a new introduction, photographs and biographical information. Papers including news clippings and published items, programs, recording agreements and photographs of Eleonora and Ethel Olson are available for research at The Minnesota Historical Society.Olson Sisters Papers. mnhs.org. Retrieved: July 26, 2011. The MHS Library has the 1925, 1929 and 1979 editions of Yust for Fun as well as nine 78 rpm discs recorded by the Olson Sisters. A review of the 1979 edition of Yust for Fun appeared in the Spring 1980 issue of Minnesota History magazine. ==The Snoose Boulevard Festival== The Snoose Boulevard Festival was held in the Cedar-Riverside neighborhood of Minneapolis from 1972 through 1977. In the late 19th century Cedar Avenue became known as \\"Snoose Boulevard\\", a nickname often given to the main street in Scandinavian communities. The term derived from the residents’ fondness for snus (snuff), an inexpensive form of tobacco. The event, which celebrated the area’s Scandinavian past, featured the music, food, and arts of the immigrants who had once lived there. It also highlighted the careers of Olle i Skratthult (Hjalmar Peterson), Slim Jim and the Vagabond Kid (Ernest and Clarence Iverson) and the Olson Sisters (Eleonora and Ethel Olson). The headline performer was the Swedish-born singer Anne-Charlotte Harvey. In conjunction with the festival she recorded three albums of folk tunes, emigrant ballads, hymns, waltzes and comic songs. The annual celebration and the recordings were sponsored by the non-profit Olle i Skratthult Project, whose director was the renowned ethnomusicologist Maury Bernstein.Seward Profile April 2005. Although Harvey didn't record anything from the Olson Sisters' repertoire, she did perform Mabel’s Wedding in concert. ==See also== *Scandinavian dialect humor ==Gallery== File:ChautauquaStamp.jpgChautauqua movement 1874 File:Skandinaven newspaper.jpgSkandinaven headquarters 1890 File:Cal Stewart with paper.jpgCal Stewart 1900 File:Fire engine on Cedar Avenue.jpgCedar Avenue 1907 ==References*A Passion for Polka at the University of California Press. *The Olson Sisters at the Norwegian American Folk Music Portal. ;Historic American Newspapers *The Olson Sisters advertisements and articles ;Photos *Eleonora Olson 1900 *Ethel Olson 1910 *Ethel and Eleonora with J.A.O.

The family name is derived from the Greek words gigas, meaning \\"big\\", and aktis, meaning \\"ray\\". They are distinguished by the presence of a remarkably long lure (the illicium), which may be longer than the body of the fish. ==Description== Whipnose angler females are easily recognizable because they have an elongated shape and a small head. Their illicium length is an average of one to four times the size of their standard length. The family includes 22 species in two genera. Like the other ceratioid groups, little is known about their ecology, but this species lives a benthic lifestyle while possibly swimming upside down while it is foraging. They tend to drift motionless to lure in their prey. ==Location== Whipnose anglers can be found in all three major oceans. The northernmost location of the females has been recorded near southern Greenland, while the southernmost location was recorded at 50°S in the Atlantic sector of the Southern Ocean. The species may possibly be one of the deepest-living ceratoids at maximum depths exceeding 1000 m. ==References== Category:Deep sea fish Category:Bioluminescent fish Category:Lophiiformes Category:Gigantactinidae ","title":"Whipnose angler"},{"id":"20384553","text":"William Frederick Kirk (April 29, 1877 – March 25, 1927) was an American baseball writer, columnist, humorist, poet and songwriter. ==Biography== Born in Mankato, Minnesota, Kirk spent most of his childhood in Chippewa Falls, Wisconsin. He graduated from high school there and began his career in journalism on a local paper. His humor column, \\"Fleeting Fancies\\", was a popular feature in the Chippewa Falls Herald and later in the Milwaukee Sentinel. It brought him to the attention of metropolitan dailies and was the name of his first book, published in 1904. Kirk's lyrics drew comparisons with those of other poets, whose work he sometimes parodied: Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, Eugene Field, and James Whitcomb Riley.The Syracuse Post-Standard June 17, 1905. A longtime newspaperman, Kirk got his start at press outlets in Chippewa Falls and Milwaukee. In 1905 he signed a contract with the Hearst organization and moved to New York, where he was employed at two of William Randolph Hearst's papers: the New York American and the New York Evening Journal.Johnny Kling: A Baseball Biography by Gil Bogen, (Jefferson, N.C.: McFarland, 2006) pp. 249 - 250. After returning to Chippewa Falls in 1918, he continued working as a nationally syndicated columnist.Ironwood Daily Globe March 25, 1927. For eighteen years Kirk was distributed by the International Features Syndicate and reached a national audience as he wrote on subjects as diverse as baseball, temperance, women's suffrage and divorce. His pieces were seen in everything from \\"The Smart Set\\" to trade union publications. He was widely known for the features \\"Little Bobbie's Pa\\" and \\"The Manicure Lady\\".The San Francisco Call September 1, 1913. Recent works on baseball's deadball era have had numerous examples of Kirk's sports writing. One can, for instance, read his account of Fred Merkle's infamous blunder The Complete Armchair Book of Baseball edited by John Thorn, (New York: Galahad Books, 1997) p. 497. or his rhyming tribute to the Flying Dutchman, Honus Wagner.Honus Wagner: The Life of Baseball's Flying Dutchman by Arthur D. Hittner, (Jefferson, N.C.: McFarland, 1996). The Unforgettable Season by Gordon H. Fleming recounts the 1908 National League pennant race through contemporary press coverage by Kirk and others.The Unforgettable Season by Gordon H. Fleming, (New York: Holt, Rinehart and Winston, 1981). In 1911 Kirk published a collection of baseball ballads called Right Off The Bat.Right off the Bat by William F. Kirk, (New York: G.W. Dillingham, 1911). In 1918 Kirk moved back to Chippewa Falls, desiring to live among old friends and familiar surroundings. He belonged to several fraternal organizations and was a prominent figure in the town. Failing health caused his early retirement, and after an illness of many months he died of cancer in 1927.Wisconsin Rapids Daily Tribune April 05, 1927. ==The Norsk Nightingale== The Norsk Nightingale 1905 William F. Kirk is especially remembered for his Scandinavian dialect poetry, written for a daily column and later published in book form. His byline, \\"The Norsk Nightingale\\", was a familiar sight in newspapers across the country. His first collection of dialect verse, The Norsk Nightingale, presented a Norwegian lumberjack from the Upper Midwest. It was his most popular book with sixteen editions printed over a period of thirty-five years.The Norsk Nightingale by William F. Kirk, (New York: Dodd, Mead & Company, 1905). At the time of its publication one reviewer wrote: \\"Novelty and freshness, and no little ingenuity as a parodist, salute us in this volume of dialect verse hailing from the haunts of the lumberjack or, more locally, northern Wisconsin and Minnesota, where dwell so many neo-Americans of Scandinavian birth.\\" The Critic and Literary World (New York: G.P. Putnam’s Sons, 1905) p. 384. His second volume of dialect verse, Songs of Sergeant Swanson, reflected the experiences of a Swedish doughboy in World War I. A book of more limited appeal, it only had one edition.Songs of Sergeant Swanson by William F. Kirk, (Boston: Small, Maynard & Company, 1918). ==Scandinavian dialect humor== Kirk's ethnic poetry put forth the notion that Scandinavian-Americans were good-natured but a little slow. This humorous stereotype had been employed in the 1890s by the playwright Gus Heege in such theatrical works as \\"Ole Olson\\" and \\"Yon Yonson\\".History Studies edited by Rhona Justice-Malloy, (Tuscaloosa, Alabama: University of Alabama Press, 2008). Volume 28, pp. 71 - 82. Scandinavian dialect humor took other forms: vaudeville sketches, joke books, movies, records and sheet music. In quick succession Tin Pan Alley published \\"Hello Wisconsin\\", \\"Holy Yumpin Yiminy\\" and \\"Scandinavia\\" (Sing Dose Song And Make Dose Music).Approaches to the American Musical by Robert Lawson-Peebles, (Exeter: University of Exeter Press, 1996.) pp. 55 - 71. The popular recording artists Eleonora and Ethel Olson were known for their warm depictions of immigrant life in such stories as \\"The Old Sogning Woman\\" and \\"A Norwegian Woman Using the Telephone\\".Yust for Fun by Eleonora and Ethel Olson, (Minneapolis: Eggs Press, 1979). El Brendel, Yogi Yorgesson, Stan Boreson and countless others have followed in Kirk's footsteps, and there is still a receptive audience — especially among Scandinavian-Americans — for tales of lumberjacks and sergeants with more heart than brain.So Ole says to Lena: Folk Humor of the Upper Midwest by James P.

It was also recognized as the deadliest season in the Philippines for decades. The first half of the season was very quiet whereas the second half of the season was extremely active. The season's first named storm, Kujira, developed on May 3 while the season's last named storm, Nida, dissipated on December 3. During August, Typhoon Morakot, devastated Taiwan killing nearly 800 people and was known for the deadliest typhoon to impact the country. Typhoons Ketsana and Parma both affected the Philippines bringing extreme flooding which killed more than 600 people with damages over US$300 million from both storms. Typhoon Nida during late November reached 1-minute winds of 285 km/h (180 mph), which is the most intense in the basin since Typhoon Paka in 1997. The scope of this article is limited to the Pacific Ocean to the north of the equator between 100°E and 180th meridian. Within the northwestern Pacific Ocean, there are two separate agencies that assign names to tropical cyclones which can often result in a cyclone having two names. The Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) will name a tropical cyclone should it be judged to have 10-minute sustained wind speeds of at least 65 km/h (40 mph) anywhere in the basin, whilst the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration (PAGASA) assigns names to tropical cyclones which move into or form as a tropical depression in their area of responsibility located between 135°E and 115°E and between 5°N–25°N regardless of whether or not a tropical cyclone has already been given a name by the JMA. Tropical depressions that are monitored by the United States' Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) are given a number with a \\"W\\" suffix. __TOC__ ==Seasonal forecasts== {  style=\\"float:right\\" - !

These agencies include the Tropical Storm Risk (TSR) Consortium of the University College London, Guy Carpenter Asia-Pacific Climate Impact Centre of the City University of Hong Kong (GCACIC) and Taiwan's Central Weather Bureau. On January 4, PAGASA reported that they were expecting 19 or less tropical cyclones to affect the Philippines during 2009. During March, the TSR Consortium released their first forecast of the season and predicted that activity within the basin would be about 20% below normal with 25.6 tropical storms, 16 typhoons and 6.7 intense typhoons and an ACE index of around 247. Later that month the Hong Kong Observatory, predicted that the typhoon season in Hong Kong would be near normal with five to six tropical cyclones passing within of the territory compared to an average of 6. During April, the GCACIC issued its first seasonal forecast for the year and predicted that the season would see activity near its average with 31 tropical cyclones, 27 tropical storms, and 18 typhoons occurring during the season. The GCACIC also predicted that 4 tropical cyclones would make landfall on Southern China between April and August compared to an average of 3, they also predicted that no tropical cyclones would make landfall between August and December. On May 7, TSR increased its forecast to 27.5 tropical storms, 17.6 typhoons, 9.1 \\"intense\\" typhoons and an ACE index of about 311 units, after La Nina conditions weakened and confidence grew that La Nina conditions would not return during 2009. Later that month the Vietnamese National Center for Hydro Meteorological forecasts predicted that six or more tropical cyclones would affect Vietnam during 2009. During June, the GCACIC reported that the total number of tropical cyclones had decreased from 31 to 30, and that the total number of typhoons had increased to 19, while there was no change to the number of tropical storms predicted to occur during the season. They also predicted that 3 tropical cyclones would make landfall on Southern China between July and December compared to an average of 4. On June 30, the Taiwan Central Weather Bureau predicted that the season would see activity near its average of 26.6, and predicted that between 24 - 27 tropical storms would occur over the Western Pacific. The Central Weather Bureau also predicted that of the 24-27 tropical storms forecast 3-5 of them would affect Taiwan. In their July and August forecasts TSR upped their prediction for the amount of intense typhoons by one to ten and eleven respectively, whilst predicting the same amount of tropical storms and typhoons. In July and August they also predicted that the season would now see activity about 20% above normal. After their initial prediction was surpassed by Tropical Depression Tino forming, PAGASA announced that they expecting two or three more cyclones to affect the Philippines, before the end of the year. ==Season summary== ImageSize = width:1030 height:250 PlotArea = top:10 bottom:80 right:20 left:20 Legend = columns:3 left:30 top:58 columnwidth:270 AlignBars = early DateFormat = dd/mm/yyyy Period = from:01/01/2009 till:31/12/2009 TimeAxis = orientation:horizontal ScaleMinor = grid:black unit:month increment:1 start:01/01/2009 Colors = id:canvas value:gray(0.88) id:GP value:red id:TD value:rgb(0.38,0.73,1) legend:Tropical_Depression_=_<62_km/h_(<39_mph) id:TS value:rgb(0,0.98,0.96) legend:Tropical_Storm_=_63-88_km/h_(39-54_mph) id:ST value:rgb(0.80,1,1) legend:Severe_Tropical_Storm_=_89-117_km/h_(55-73_mph) id:TY value:rgb(0.99,0.69,0.6) legend:Typhoon_=_>118_km/h_(>74_mph) Backgroundcolors = canvas:canvas BarData = barset:Hurricane bar:month PlotData= barset:Hurricane width:10 align:left fontsize:S shift:(4,-4) anchor:till from:03/01/2009 till:06/01/2009 color:TD text:\\"Auring\\" from:12/02/2009 till:13/02/2009 color:TD text:\\"Bising\\" from:30/04/2009 till:01/05/2009 color:TD text:\\"Crising\\" from:01/05/2009 till:07/05/2009 color:TY text:\\"Kujira\\" from:01/05/2009 till:04/05/2009 color:TD text:\\"TD\\" from:02/05/2009 till:09/05/2009 color:TY text:\\"Chan-hom\\" from:14/06/2009 till:22/06/2009 color:ST text:\\"Linfa\\" from:22/06/2009 till:27/06/2009 color:TS text:\\"Nangka\\" from:09/07/2009 till:13/07/2009 color:TS text:\\"Soudelor\\" from:11/07/2009 till:14/07/2009 color:TD text:\\"Huaning\\" from:15/07/2009 till:19/07/2009 color:TY text:\\"Molave\\" barset:break from:30/07/2009 till:09/08/2009 color:TS text:\\"Goni\\" from:02/08/2009 till:10/08/2009 color:TY text:\\"Morakot\\" from:08/08/2009 till:14/08/2009 color:TS text:\\"Etau\\" from:13/08/2009 till:17/08/2009 color:TD text:\\"Maka\\" from:16/08/2009 till:26/08/2009 color:TY text:\\"Vamco\\" from:20/08/2009 till:21/08/2009 color:TD text:\\"TD\\" from:25/08/2009 till:27/08/2009 color:TD text:\\"TD\\" from:28/08/2009 till:01/09/2009 color:ST text:\\"Krovanh\\" from:30/08/2009 till:01/09/2009 color:TD text:\\"02C\\" from:01/09/2009 till:10/09/2009 color:ST text:\\"Dujuan\\" from:03/09/2009 till:09/09/2009 color:TD text:\\"TD\\" barset:break from:08/09/2009 till:11/09/2009 color:TS text:\\"Mujigae\\" from:12/09/2009 till:16/09/2009 color:TY text:\\"Koppu\\" from:12/09/2009 till:20/09/2009 color:TY text:\\"Choi-wan\\" from:23/09/2009 till:26/09/2009 color:TD text:\\"TD\\" from:25/09/2009 till:30/09/2009 color:TY text:\\"Ketsana\\" from:26/09/2009 till:30/09/2009 color:TD text:\\"18W\\" from:27/09/2009 till:14/10/2009 color:TY text:\\"Parma\\" from:29/09/2009 till:08/10/2009 color:TY text:\\"Melor\\" from:08/10/2009 till:14/10/2009 color:TS text:\\"Nepartak\\" from:14/10/2009 till:27/10/2009 color:TY text:\\"Lupit\\" from:16/10/2009 till:20/10/2009 color:TD text:\\"TD\\" barset:break from:25/10/2009 till:03/11/2009 color:TY text:\\"Mirinae\\" from:01/11/2009 till:02/11/2009 color:TD text:\\"Tino\\" from:07/11/2009 till:10/11/2009 color:TD text:\\"25W\\" from:21/11/2009 till:24/11/2009 color:TD text:\\"Urduja\\" from:21/11/2009 till:03/12/2009 color:TY text:\\"Nida\\" from:24/11/2009 till:25/11/2009 color:TD text:\\"TD\\" from:03/12/2009 till:05/12/2009 color:TD text:\\"28W\\" from:07/12/2009 till:08/12/2009 color:TD text:\\"TD\\" bar:Month width:5 align:center fontsize:S shift:(0,-20) anchor:middle color:canvas from:01/01/2009 till:01/02/2009 text:January from:01/02/2009 till:01/03/2009 text:February from:01/03/2009 till:01/04/2009 text:March from:01/04/2009 till:01/05/2009 text:April from:01/05/2009 till:01/06/2009 text:May from:01/06/2009 till:01/07/2009 text:June from:01/07/2009 till:01/08/2009 text:July from:01/08/2009 till:01/09/2009 text:August from:01/09/2009 till:01/10/2009 text:September from:01/10/2009 till:01/11/2009 text:October from:01/11/2009 till:01/12/2009 text:November from:01/12/2009 till:31/12/2009 text:December The season started with Tropical Depression Auring east of the Philippines, which was then followed by Tropical Depression Bising a month later. After 2 months of inactivity, Tropical Depression Crising and Typhoon Kujira forms, and Kujira becoming the first major typhoon of the season, and was followed by the development of Typhoon Chan-hom in the South China Sea, and hit Pangasinan and crossed the Philippines. In mid-June, Severe Tropical Storm Linfa and Tropical Storm Nangka form and hit the Philippines. It was followed 1 month later by Tropical Storm Soudelor, which passed through the Batanes Strait and headed for China, and followed by Tropical Depression Huaning which hit Taiwan. Typhoon Molave and Tropical Storm Goni head for China, while Typhoon Morakot becomes the most-costliest storm in Taiwanese history. Tropical Storm Etau briefly forms, and followed by Tropical Depression Maka from the Central Pacific basin, while Typhoon Vamco develops into a Category 4 but barely affects any major landmass. Krovanh peaks as a severe tropical storm, while Dujuan heads northeastward, and not affecting any landmass. Tropical Storm Mujigae forms in the South China Sea, which is followed by Typhoon Koppu, which crossed Northern Luzon. Typhoon Ketsana drops record rainfall in the Philippines, and is followed by Typhoon Parma which drops more rainfall to the already saturated Philippines. Typhoon Melor becomes a Category 5 while Nepartak briefly forms as a tropical storm, and Lupit becomes another Category 5 and nearly hits the Philippines before heading northeast. Typhoon Mirinae hits Central Luzon, causing more damages and misery to the Philippines. Tropical Depression Tino and Urduja briefly form, and Typhoon Nida (Vinta) becomes the strongest and final named storm of the season, which is then followed by a weak tropical depression in late December 2009. Due to many typhoons hitting the Philippines, the 2009 Pacific typhoon season was the costliest season for the Philippines on record. ==SystemsTropical Depression Auring=== Tropical Depression Auring formed as a tropical disturbance late on December 30, 2008, to the southeast of Manila in the Philippines. Over the next few days the disturbance gradually developed before early on January 3, both PAGASA and the JMA, reported that the disturbance had intensified into the first tropical depression of the season with PAGASA assigning the name Auring to the depression. As the depression was moving into a high level of vertical wind shear, it did not develop any further and late on January 5 as the baroclinic zone approached Auring, it was downgraded to a low-pressure area by PAGASA before the JMA followed suit the next day as it was declared as dissipated by the JTWC. Heavy rain from Auring produced severe flooding in the eastern Philippines. Two people were killed and nine others were left missing. A total of 305 homes were destroyed and another 610 were damaged. In addition, an estimated 53 hectares (130.9 acres) of rice and 3.5 hectares (8.6 acres) of corn were damaged. About 43,851 people were affected by the depression and damages were estimated at PHP ( USD). ===Tropical Depression Bising=== Early on February 12, PAGASA reported that a low-pressure area located about to the east of Surigao City in the Philippines had intensified into a tropical depression. During that day the depression gradually moved towards the west with its peak windspeeds estimated at 45 km/h (30 mph). Early the next morning after the depression had made landfall on Dinagat Island, PAGASA released its final advisory as the depression had weakened into an area of low pressure. An estimated 473 passengers and several vehicles were stranded in Liloan and Ormoc due to ferry cancellations. In Cebu, an estimated 1,600 passengers were also stranded due to the depression. Late on February 13, the remnants of Bising brought scattered rainshowers across Southern Luzon, Bicol Region, and Visayas, then dissipated. The rainfall led to mudslides on Cebu Island which blocked the Cebu Transcentral Highway. ===Tropical Depression Crising=== On April 29, the JTWC reported that an area of deep convection had persisted near the center of an elongated low-level circulation center, in area of low vertical windshear, about , to the west of Manila in the Philippines. Deep convective banding was curving into an eastern southern edges of the disturbance. During the day the disturbance gradually consolidated further under the influence of an anticyclone, as a result of this the JTWC issued a tropical cyclone formation alert on the system. Early the next morning PAGASA upgraded the disturbance to a tropical depression and named it as Crising as it reached its 10-minute peak windspeeds of 55 km/h (35 mph). Later that day the JTWC reported that Crising's low-level circulation center has weakened and was now poorly organized as it underwent a Fujiwhara effect with what was to become Typhoon Kujira (Dante). PAGASA kept issuing advisories on Crising until it weakened into a low-pressure area early on May 1. Heavy rains produced by the outer bands of Crising caused flooding in western areas of the Philippines, affecting an estimated 2,500 people. The worst flooding occurred in Lucena City where ten villages were isolated. Areas along the Bucon and Inalmasinan Rivers were inundated and sustained significant crop losses. Several animals reportedly drowned in the region. Several roads were impassable due to landslides or were washed out by floodwaters. One bridge was destroyed in the town of Mercedes. ===Typhoon Kujira (Dante)=== Early on April 26, an area of disturbed weather formed near the coastline of Baler, capital of the Philippine's Aurora province. It was formerly a tail end of cold front that passed by Northern Luzon. JTWC assessed that the area of a disturbed weather potential of becoming developing into a significant Tropical Cyclone within 24 hours as \\"fair\\". However, on April 28, JTWC downgraded the disturbance as dissipating because of interaction with nearby middle Tropical Depression Crising and JMA Tropical Depression 03. A few days later, the disturbance moved south-westward, and late on April 30, the disturbance made landfall at Albay. On May 1, JTWC again upgraded the disturbance into having a potential to form into a significant Tropical Cyclone within 24 hours to \\"fair\\". And later that day, PAGASA classified the disturbance as a tropical depression, naming it \\"Dante\\" and issued public storm warning signal number one in the provinces of Camarines Norte, Camarines Sur, Albay, Sorsogon, Catanduanes, Masbate, Burias Island, and Southern Quezon. PAGASA also reported that Dante made landfall in the vicinity of Sorsogon within the Bicol region of the Philippines. Early on May 2, JTWC issued a TCFA as the depression was in an almost stationary position. Later that day, JMA classified Dante as a full depression. Early the next morning it became a tropical storm and was named Kujira. Kujira continued to strengthen and was upgraded to a severe tropical storm that afternoon. When it was over the Philippines it killed 27 people while 9 others are missing. The JMA upgraded the system to a typhoon early on May 4. Kujira intensified quickly, doubling in strength from a Category 2 typhoon to a Category 4-equivalent typhoon within 24 hours. On May 6, The JTWC reported that Kujira was in its beginning stages of becoming extratropical, with the low-level circulation center almost fully exposed in association with increasing vertical wind shear and lower sea surface temperatures in the region. Late that, JMA downgraded Kujira to a Severe Tropical Storm as strong wind shear weakens the system. Then early on May 7, JTWC issued its last advisory on Kujira, already reporting it as an extratropical system. JMA continued to issue warnings on the system while at the same time it was downgraded to a tropical storm. Later on May 7, Kujira weakened further, becoming a fully extratropical cyclone . While in the Philippine area of responsibility, Kujira caused some 625,709,464 worth of damage to crops and livestock in Albay, Camarines Norte, Masbate and Sorsogon. It also caused some 102 million pesos worth of damage to communal irrigation systems in the region. The NDCC update as of 6AM PST May 12 declared 28 dead, one missing and 5 injured. Further, 383,457 persons in 609 barangays of 60 municipalities and 4 cities in 5 provinces of Region V were affected by the storm. Damages are worth PhP 1,228,422,344 million or PhP1.228 billion of which PhP 625,709,464 are agricultural losses and PhP 529.525 million in infrastructural. Houses destroyed were at 2387, of which 138 were total and 2249 partial. ===Typhoon Chan-hom (Emong)=== On May 1, an area of convectional cloudiness associated with an area of disturbed weather formed southeast of Nha Trang, Vietnam and associated with a remnant of Tropical depression Crising to form a new stronger area of disturbed weather system. JTWC monitored the disturbance as \\"Fair\\" for developing due to low vertical wind shear and an upper-level anticyclone to the east of the system. Later on the JMA designated the low pressure as a minor tropical depression reporting the outlook track as southwestward. The JTWC issued a TCFA on the system once the convection increased and became better organized although with an exposed LLC east of its convection. Early morning of May 3, the JMA begun issuing tropical cyclone advisories on the system forecasting it to become a tropical storm later in the afternoon as it tracked eastwards. On May 3, the JTWC designated the disturbance as Tropical Depression 02W, and the JMA named the storm Chan- hom. Later on May 4, Chan-hom strengthened into a severe tropical storm. On May 6, the system moved into the Philippine Area of Responsibility from the west and was named as Emong. Later that day the JMA upgraded the severe tropical storm to a typhoon. On May 7, PAGASA reported that Chan-hom had made landfall at the northern tip of Bani, Pangasinan. After traversing Pangasinan it lashed La Union, Ilocos Sur, Benguet, Nueva Vizcaya, Ifugao, Mt. Province, Kalinga and Isabela. Pangasinan (which recorded 150mm of rain from Emong) and La Union were the worst hit. The provinces in Central Luzon, Ilocos, Cordillera Administrative Region and Cagayan Valley, together with Metro Manila and parts of Southern Luzon, generally experienced more than 100 mm in the 24‑hour period on May 7. Rains, however, lasted from May 6–8. NDCC updates on 6:00AM on May 13 put dead at 50, injured at 47 and missing at 13 and damage worth 690 million pesos in agriculture, infrastructure and private property. It further left 204,000 persons affected, damaged 23280 houses of which 6080 are totally damaged and 17200 partially damaged in Pangasinan and induced 11 landslide occurrences in Zambales and Cagayan PAGASA expected the typhoon to weaken quickly, which it did. On May 8, Chan-hom was downgraded to a Tropical Storm and later, to a Tropical Depression. JMA issued its last warning early on May 9, followed by the JTWC. PAGASA held on to Emong (Chan-hom) until much later that day, when it was declared an area of low pressure. JTWC then re- issued advisories on the restrengthening depression on May 10. Later on May 11, Chan-hom became a subtropical depression, therefore, JMA and PAGASA designated it a tropical depression while JTWC declared it dissipated, PAGASA reported Tropical Depression Chan-hom degenerated into Subtropical Disturbance ex-Chan-hom and issued the final advisory for the system because it had almost completely dissipated. However, JMA did not issue the final advisory for the tropical depression until early on May 13, when the storm's low-level circulation dissipated and began accelerate northeastward, as it was caught up in the jet stream, at which time it was forecast to become extratropical or be absorbed by a cold front. ===Severe Tropical Storm Linfa=== On June 10, the JTWC began monitoring an area of disturbed weather that was situated about southeast of Palau. The disturbance had an elongated low-level circulation, with deep convection centered along the southwestern portion of the system. Over the next couple of days, the disturbance gradually developed with the JMA declaring the system as a tropical depression early on June 14 whilst the JTWC issued a TCFA. However the TCFA was cancelled later that day due to the convection dissipating, whilst the JMA downgraded the depression to an area of low pressure. Over the next two days, the system moved across Luzon and began to regenerate. Early on June 17, a second TCFA was released by the JTWC whilst the JMA reported that the system had re-intensified into a tropical depression. Later that day, the JTWC designated the system as Tropical Depression 03W whilst the storm was situated about south-southwest of Kaohsiung, Taiwan. Following further development of the depression, the JTWC upgraded it to a tropical storm late on June 17. The JMA then followed suit early the next morning assigning the name Linfa to the storm. Throughout the rest of the day limited poleward outflow prevented linfa from intensifying. During June 19, Linfa intensified further and became a severe tropical storm with an eye feature starting to appear on microwave imagery. After interacting with a nearby upper-level low, outflow significantly improved later that day, fueling further strengthening, before the next day the JTWC upgraded Linfa to a typhoon as it reached its peak windspeeds of 140 km/h (85 mph) 110 km/h (70 mph 10-minute winds). Later that day convection near the center of the circulation to decrease with the eye no longer visible. Upper-level wind shear rapidly increased, preventing re-intensification of the cyclone. Linfa then began to interact with land and was downgraded to a tropical storm by the JTWC on June 21 and then during that afternoon the storm made landfall on the southern Chinese provence of Fujian. Deep convection then rapidly dissipated with both the JMA and the JTWC downgrading Linfa to a Tropical depression by early on June 22, as the storm moved away from the Chinese coastline. The system later dissipated just offshore with a circulation was no longer evident on satellite imagery. A total of seven people were killed by Linfa, whilst $ (2009 USD) worth of damage was done by Linfa, as it affected China, Taiwan, Hong Kong and the Philippines. A 498-tonne oil tanker was run aground in southern Taiwan by large swells of up to 5.6 m (18 ft). In Taiwan two people were hit by fallen trees, whilst power cuts were reported in Chiangchun as well as other parts of China and Taiwan. A total loss of NT$, ( 2009 USD) was suffered by the agricultural sector in Taiwan whilst in mainland China, Linfa produced torrential rainfall which led to severe flooding. Following a landslide, one person was killed. Flood waters destroyed 100 homes and inundated 10,000 others as well as an estimated 32,000 hectares of farmland in Fujian Province. In Meizhou, Guongdong Province, flash flooding resulted in five additional fatalities after 413.7 mm 19.22 in of rain fell within a nine- hour span. A total of 362 homes were destroyed in the town and infrastructure was severely damaged. Additionally, an estimated 20 million people were affected by the storm. ===Tropical Storm Nangka (Feria)=== On June 16, an area of disturbed weather formed about to the northeast of Palau Island. In the next few days, the disturbance showed improvement but, its LLCC was undefined. Early on June 20, the disturbance suddenly strengthened and its LLCC began to consolidate as well as significant banding all over the system. The disturbance was also located under low vertical wind shear. Early on June 22, JTWC issued an advisory that the potential of the formation of a significant tropical cyclone within 24 hours was upgraded to \\"Fair\\" because of its well- defined LLCC and was located in a favorable area. Around 0600 UTC that same day, the JMA classified the disturbance as a minor Tropical Depression, while the JTWC released a TCFA on the disturbance. This was because convection had begun to organize and upper-level analysis showed a cyclonic center on the east, just west of Guam and a cyclonic flow around its consolidating low-level circulation Centre. After 4 hours, JTWC issued its first warning and named it as Tropical Depression 04W. Early on June 23, PAGASA issued its first warning on the Tropical Depression and assigned its local named \\"Feria\\". In the afternoon, Nangka made its first landfall over Hernani, Eastern Samar at 5:00 pm PST (0900 UTC). and made its second landfall in Masbate around 10:00PM PST ( 1400 UTC). On June 24, Nangka rapidly slowed down while moving over Mindoro. The storm then made its third landfall at Calapan City, Mindoro at 12 am PST/ 0430 UTC. After crossing Mindoro for 8 hours, PAGASA downgraded Nangka into a Tropical Depression, while both the JMA and JTWC still classified Nangka as a tropical storm on that day. Early on June 25, Nangka move into the South China Sea, with PAGASA issuing their final warning. In the evening of that same day, both JMA and JTWC downgraded Nangka into a tropical depression due to its low- level circulation center is started to deteriorate. By midday of June 26, it made its fourth landfall in Guangdong province in China, passing through the northern part of Hong Kong. In the afternoon of that day, both JMA and JTWC issued their final warning on Nangka. Its remnants completely dissipated by June 27. In Eastern Samar, more than 800 people were stranded after ferry service was canceled. High winds downed a large tree, destroying the roof of one home and damaging three cars. Unusually strong severe thunderstorms developed over parts of the Philippines along the outer bands of Nangka. In San Pascual, Bauan and Batangas City, large hail fell during a strong storm. Residents reported that they have never seen hail before. In Barangay, 4 in Bauan town, a rare tornado struck, downing several trees, damaging homes and signs. Heavy rains produced by the storm also flooded numerous regions, some reporting waist-deep water. Later reports confirmed the tornado destroyed 23 homes. In Cebu, one person was killed and seven were left missing. At least 500 people were also left homeless due to the storm. In Cavite, 7000 was stranded on the port due to Nangka's winds and heavy rains. about is the water wave in Cavite. In Albay, more than 300 ship passengers were also stranded at the Albay port, Tabaco, Albay. In Navotas and Malabon, the Navotas — Malabon river produced a high tide in the area. As of 24 June, Nangka (Feria) has caused 6 deaths and left 11 people missing. Property damage from the storm is estimated at PHP 2.8 million (US$54,000). ===Tropical Storm Soudelor (Gorio)=== Late on July 7, the JTWC reported that an area of disturbed weather had formed about to the northwest of Yap. Deep convection was embedded in a broad, weak, poorly defined circulation that was starting to be enhanced by a Tropical Upper Tropospheric Trough (TUTT) cell to the east of the system. Over the next couple of days, gradual development took place before a TCFA was released by the JTWC early on July 9 as PAGASA designated the system as Tropical Depression Gorio. Later that day both the JMA and the JTWC reported that the depression had formed and started to issue warnings on the depression, with the JTWC designating it as 05W. On July 10, PAGASA issued their final advisory on Tropical Depression Gorio as it moved out of their area of responsibility. Hampered by an unfavorable upper-level environment, the depression barely intensified into a tropical storm early on July 11. Upon becoming a tropical storm, the JMA named the system Soudelor reporting peak winds of 65 km/h, (40 mph). Later that day the JTWC reported that Soudelor had weakened into a depression; however they re-upgraded it to a tropical storm as it moved closer to Hainan Province. Shortly before landfall in Leizhou Peninsula, China, the JTWC downgraded the storm to a tropical depression, then as Soudelor moved back over water and into the Gulf of Tonkin, the JTWC issued their final advisory on the depression, however the JMA continued to monitor the storm until it had made landfall near Fangchenggang, China several hours later. As a tropical depression, Soudelor brushed northern Luzon in the Philippines, producing upwards of 330 mm (13 in) of rainfall which resulted in flash flooding and landslides in at least ten villages. In China torrential rains in Hainan caused significant flooding that killed 15 hikers and left several others missing. Numerous roads were also cut off or destroyed by landslides and 30 villages were inundated with flood waters. The remnants of Soudelor produced widespread torrential rains in Northern Vietnam on July 13\\\\. Rainfall totals peaked at in the region. Heavy rainfall, amounting to , was also recorded in Hanoi. The capital city experienced flash flooding, inundating numerous streets and buildings. Two men were killed by lightning strikes associated with the storm. Officials reported that at least 13 large trees had been downed by high winds. Flood waters in the hardest-hit areas reached a depth of . One person was killed after being swept away. A tornado also touched down during the storm, destroying the roofs of three homes. Thousands of hectares of croplands were inundated by flood waters. Following the storm, 1,000 tonnes of rice was allocated for victims of the floods. ===Tropical Depression 06W (Huaning) === On July 10, the JTWC reported that an area of disturbed weather had persisted about to the east of Manila. The convection was consolidating with a good mid-level circulation and was located under an anticyclone and had started to show some outflow into a trough to the northeast of the system. Early the next day the JMA reported that the disturbance had become a minor tropical depression. The depression then gradually developed during the rest of July 11, with PAGASA naming the depression as Huaning early on July 12 whilst the JTWC issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert on the depression. Early the next day PAGASA upgraded Huaning into a tropical storm whilst the JTWC designated the depression as Tropical Depression 06W. Later that morning Huaning made its first landfall over Taitung City, Taiwan. On the next day, both JMA and JTWC issued their final warning on Huaning. ===Typhoon Molave (Isang)=== Late on July 10, an area of disturbed weather persisted about , to the southeast of Yap. Convection was wrapping into a poorly organized and drawn out low-level circulation center and was under minimal wind shear. It gradually developed further throughout the next day with convection continuing to consolidate over a low-level circulation center. However early on July 12, the JTWC reported that the disturbance had dissipated, as outflow was being hampered by the outflow of Huaning. However late on July 13, the JTWC reported that the disturbance had rapidly redeveloped and released a TCFA on the disturbance. Early the next day both PAGASA and the JMA designated the disturbance as a Tropical Depression with PAGASA assigning the local name of Isang to the depression. The Depression continued to develop and was designated as Tropical Depression 07W by the JTWC early on July 15, whilst PAGASA upgraded Isang to a Tropical storm later that day. On July 17, JMA upgraded Molave as a Severe Tropical Storm and Typhoon by PAGASA. On morning of July 18, HKO upgraded Molave as a Typhoon. Later that day, Molave quickly moved into the South China Sea. On July 19, at 1700 UTC or 1am HKT, Molave made its first landfall. On the afternoon, as Molave move through China, both JMA and JTWC issued their final warning as Molave weakened into a Tropical depression. Molave killed at least four people. ===Tropical Storm Goni (Jolina)=== Late on July 25, the JTWC reported that an area of convection had formed in a monsoon trough about to the northeast of Guam. Deep convection was flaring around the low-level circulation center. An upper-level anticyclone and a tropical upper tropospheric trough was providing outflow. Over the next few days the disturbance gradually developed before the disturbance was declared as dissipated early on July 28 as the low-level circulation center was not well defined and higher vertical wind shear affecting the system. However the disturbance regenerated early on July 30 whilst located about , the disturbance's low-level circulation center was elongated with indications of multiple circulation centers. Later that day PAGASA reported that the disturbance had developed into a tropical depression and assigned its local name of Jolina. Jolina then intensified further early the next day and was reported to have become a tropical storm by PAGASA, with the JMA designating it as a depression later that day. Early on August 1 the JTWC issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert as deep convection had increased and was starting to consolidate around a circulation center. However, later that morning Jolina made a landfall near to Casiguran, in the Philippine province of Aurora before emerging out into the South China sea later that day. Early the next day the JTWC reissued their TCFA whilst PAGASA issued their final warning on Jolina as it moved out of their area of responsibility heading towards a landfall on China. The JTWC then designated the depression as 08W later that day as infrared imagery had shown deep convection was wrapping into the low-level circulation center. During August 3, the JMA reported that the tropical depression had intensified into a tropical storm and assigned the Goni to the cyclone. At 1700 UTC of August 4, Goni made its second landfall over Macau. Early on the next day, JTWC issued their final warning on Goni. On August 7, The Joint Typhoon Warning noted that remnant of Goni re-entered into the Gulf of Tonkin and had a poor chance of regenerating. Later in the day, Joint Typhoon Warning Center reissued advisories on the system upgrading it to a tropical storm near Hainan Island. In the Philippines Goni (Jolina) death toll is 8 with 5 more missing. Goni (Jolina) affected 38,589 families or 160,038 people in 119 villages in 25 towns and five cities in Ilocos Sur, Batangas, Cagayan, Nueva Ecija, Rizal, Mindoro Occidental, Palawan, Iloilo, Negros Occidental, Lanao del Sur, and Sultan Kudarat town in Maguindanao. Five people died in China when Goni passed through. In Hainan province about 92,000 people had been evacuated by the authorities. 575 houses got destroyed and 2,311 damaged. The storm also inundated than 68,000 hectares cropland. ===Typhoon Morakot (Kiko)=== The season's deadliest tropical cyclone formed early on August 2, within a monsoon trough about east of the Philippines. The depression remained weak, however, and later that day the JMA downgraded it to an area of convection. Still later that day, the JMA reported that the tropical depression had regenerated and that deep convection was flaring on the western side of a partially exposed low-level circulation center. On August 3, PAGASA named the depression Kiko as it moved through their area of responsibility, after which (the same day) the JMA named the storm Morakot, upgrading it to a Tropical Storm. The JTWC followed suit, designating Morakot as 09W. The next day Morakot recurved, reentering PAGASA's area of responsibility. In the Philippines, ten villages (Paudpod, San Juan, Batonloc, Carael, Tampo, Paco, San Miguel, Bining, Bangan, and Capayawan) have been submerged in floods after the Pinatubo Dike overflowed. Joint military and police rescue teams rescued 3 Koreans and 9 Canadian nationals. About 30,000 families were affected by Morakot; eleven people are confirmed dead. Three French tourists and two Filipino guides were killed in a flashflood caused by a landslide. Thousands are trapped on rooftops or in trees awaiting helicopter rescue attempts and thousands have lost their homes. At least two have died from flooding. Landslides have claimed the lives of two children and five miners are still missing after a landslide destroyed their huts. Schools have suspended their classes in the hardest hit area, and highways have been closed due to landslides. In Taiwan, where schools were closed ahead of the typhoon, Morakot caused landslides, severe floods, blew down trees and billboards, and stripped roofs from buildings. In a positive impact, Morakot brought much- needed rain to Taiwan, ending a months-long drought, and replenished reservoirs enough to warrant an end to water rationing. In Taiwan, 461 people were killed with 192 missing. Almost the entire southern Taiwan (Chiayi, Tainan, Kaohsuing, and Pingtung) are flooded by record-breaking heavy rain. It is estimated that rainfall in Pingtung county may reach as much as 2,500 millimeters, breaking all rainfall records of any single place in Taiwan induced by a single typhoon. South east China has evacuated 20,000 residents. A fishing boat has capsized and search and rescue efforts have begun for nine missing fishermen. A total of 34000 watercraft sought refuge ahead of the storm. ===Tropical Storm Etau=== On August 6, an area of convectional cloudiness associated with monsoon through was located about (620 miles) 1000 km southwest of Iwo To, Japan. Satellite imagery shows an TUTT was located to the northeast of the system. and the system is also located under high vertical wind shear and favorable environment. Late of August 7, JTWC upgraded the system and issued a TCFA because LLCC is partially exposed. while JMA also upgraded the system as a minor tropical depression. On the next day, both JMA and JTWC classifies the minor tropical depression as a full depression. On August 8, JMA upgraded the system as a tropical storm and assigned the name Etau. In post-storm analysis, the JMA downgraded Etau to a tropical storm, with peak winds of 75 km/h (45 mph).https://www.webcitation.org/5kELGYqwT?url=http://weather.noaa.gov/pub/data/raw/ax/axpq20.rjtd..txt ===Tropical Depression Maka=== On August 13, the remnants of Tropical Storm Maka crossed the international dateline and moved into the Western Pacific; where it was immediately designated as a tropical depression by the JMA. Later that day the JTWC reported that the depression was located about to the southeast of Wake Island, with deep convection developing over the northern quadrant of a stretched out, low-level circulation center which was in an area of low to moderate vertical wind shear and had a good outflow into an upper- level trough. During the next day, the JTWC issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert on the depression as the low-level circulation center had developed further. Later that day, the JTWC re-upgraded the disturbance to Tropical Depression 01C (Maka). Late the next day the JTWC upgraded the depression to a tropical storm however, the JMA still classified the storm as a depression. ===Typhoon Vamco=== On August 13, the JTWC reported that an area of deep convection had persisted in an area of low vertical wind shear about , to the north of Kwajalein Atoll. A low-level circulation center was developing with the deep convection starting to wrap into it whilst a tropical upper tropospheric trough was providing a good outflow for the center. Over the next couple of days the convection started to consolidate before early on August 16 a TCFA was issued by the JTWC as convective bands had started to wrap into the low-level circulation center. It was then declared as a Tropical depression later that day by the JMA however the JTWC did not follow suit until early the next day when they designated the depression as 11W with convective bands wrapping into a well-defined low-level circulation center. Both the JTWC and the JMA upgraded it to a tropical storm later that day, with the JMA assigning the name Vamco to the storm. During August 18, the JMA reported that Vamco had intensified into a severe tropical storm and was moving towards the northwest slowly before early the next day along with the JTWC reporting that it had intensified into a weak typhoon. During that day Vamco kept intensifying due to being in favorable conditions with the JMA reporting that the typhoon had reached its peak wind speeds early on August 20 of 165 km/h, (105 mph) 10-min Sustained, however the JTWC reported that it had continued to intensify during August 20, and reached its 1-minute peak wind speeds of 215 km/h, (130 mph) early on August 21 which made it a category four typhoon on the Saffir–Simpson Hurricane Scale. Vamco stayed at its peak wind speeds until early on August 22 when both the JMA and the JTWC reported that it had started to weaken, however due to the typhoon being in favorable conditions, Vamco was able to maintain its typhoon status until early on August 25, when the JTWC downgraded Vamco to an extra tropical low, and issued their final advisory. The JMA continued to monitor it as a severe tropical storm until early the next day when they downgraded it to an extratropical low as it approached the international dateline. Vamco then crossed the International Dateline and was monitored as an extratropical low until late on August 28 when it dissipated to the south of Alaska. ===Severe Tropical Storm Krovanh=== On August 27, JMA reported that an area of convectional cloudiness associated with monsoon through formed about , to the southeast of Iwo To, Japan. Satellite imagery shows that convective bands is starting to wrap into the Low-Level Circulation Centre (LLCC) and the system is located in moderate vertical windshear and favorable area. Early of August 28, the system is showing a good development LLCC then the JMA upgraded the system into a minor tropical depression. While JTWC issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert (TCFA) on the system then after several hours, they upgraded it into a tropical depression. In the evening of that day, the depression rapidly intensified into a tropical storm due to hot water temperatures and associated with Tropical Upper Tropospheric Trough (TUTT) that located in the northeast of the tropical storm, whilst JMA assigned the name Krovanh. While JTWC also upgraded the depression into a tropical storm. Early of August 30, JMA upgraded Krovanh into a severe tropical storm. On the next day, Krovanh weakened into a tropical storm due to its interaction with the frontal system and the eye was quickly become visible. On September 1, both JMA and JTWC issued their final warning on Krovanh. The remnants of the storm was absorbed by a frontal system and dissipated later that day. ===Tropical Depression 02C=== Late on August 29, the JMA started to issue warnings on Tropical Depression 02C as it was expected to cross the International Dateline and move into the Western Pacific within 24 hours and intensify into a Tropical Storm. Early the next day the depression crossed the dateline into an area of strong vertical windshear. Thus the tropical depression began to weaken with the low-level circulation center becoming fully exposed and sheared as a result the JTWC issued their final advisory later that day. However the JMA continued to issue advisories on the depression until early on September 2, they downgraded the depression to an area of low pressure and issued their final advisory. ===Severe Tropical Storm Dujuan (Labuyo)=== On August 28, an area of convectional cloudiness associated with a monsoon trough formed about southwest of Okinawa, Japan. Satellite imagery revealed that a partial low-level circulation centre (LLCC) was exposed with an anticyclone providing good outflow that located to the northwest of the system. Early on September 1, the system showed a more defined LLCC moving through warm waters, whilst JMA upgraded the system to a tropical depression. On September 2, the depression entered the Philippine area of responsibility and PAGASA assigned it a local name Labuyo. On the next day, PAGASA upgraded Labuyo into a tropical storm while JTWC issued a TCFA. Later that day, JTWC designated it as tropical depression 13W. Early the next day, JMA upgraded the depression intensified into a tropical storm and assigned it an international name Dujuan, while JTWC then also upgraded Dujuan as a tropical storm. On September 5, JMA upgraded Dujuan into a severe tropical storm. Later that day, PAGASA issued their final warning on Labuyo as the storm moved out of their area of responsibility. Early of September 8, JTWC downgraded Dujuan into a tropical depression. After several hours of that same day, JTWC amended an issue that Dujuan was intensified again into a tropical storm. ===JMA Tropical Depression 20=== Early on September 1, the JTWC reported that an area of convectional cloudiness had persisted in an area of low pressure vertical windshear about to the northwest of Manila in the Philippines. The system had a fully exposed low-level circulation center with small pockets of convection confined to the western edge of the cyclone. During the next couple of days the disturbance developed further with deep convection consolidating near the low-level circulation center before being designated as a tropical depression by the JMA and had a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert issued by the JTWC early on September 3. Later the next day, it made a direct hit on Đà Nẵng, Quảng Nam and Quảng Ngãi, Vietnam and after several hours. Later that day, JTWC had cancelled TCFA. It had re-emerged back into the South China Sea and remained nearly stationary. At least six people have been killed and five others were injured by the depression throughout Vietnam. Rainfall from the storm exceeded , triggering widespread flash flooding. Sixty-one tons of fish were swept away during the floods and 8,700 hectares of rice were destroyed. ===Tropical Storm Mujigae (Maring)=== On September 6, an area of convection cloudiness associated with the monsoon through was formed about to the northwest of Manila, Philippines. Satellite imagery shows that a mid-level convection consolidating in over a developing Low-Level Circulation Centre (LLCC). In additionally, there is a westerly wind burst that located three to five degrees of the system and located in moderate vertical wind shear. Late of September 8, the system is moving northwest and also in hot water temperatures, whilst the JMA upgraded the system into a tropical depression. Also, on the evening, PAGASA declared the system as a tropical depression and assigned its local name, Maring. While JTWC issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert (TCFA). Early of the next day, JTWC upgraded the system into a tropical depression due to its LLCC is partially exposed. In the evening, as the tropical depression moved northwestward, PAGASA issued its final advisory as Maring moved out of their area of responsibility., ===Typhoon Choi-wan=== Typhoon Choi-wan formed as weak tropical disturbance early on September 11, 2009, about to the east of Guam. During that day the disturbance rapidly developed and was designated as a tropical depression early the next day by both the JMA and the JTWC before intensifying further and being named as Tropical Storm Choi-wan on September 12. During September 13, Choi-wan's rapid intensification slowed down barely intensifying into a severe tropical storm, before early the next day it was upgraded to a typhoon and rapidly intensified during the day to become a Category 4-equivalent typhoon. Choi-wan then intensified further during September 15, as it moved through the Northern Marina Islands with the Japan Meteorological Agency reporting peak 10 minute sustained wind speeds of 195 km/h (120 mph), whilst the Joint Typhoon Warning Center reported 1-minute peak wind speeds of 260 km/h (160 mph) which made it a category 5-equivalent typhoon. With the help of excellent poleward outflow and high ocean heat content, Choi-wan remained at its peak intensity until early on September 17 when deep convection started to erode in the northwestern quadrant as the tropical upper tropospheric trough cell to the northwest was no longer providing good outflow. Choi-wan was then downgraded to a typhoon by the JTWC as it started to undergo an eyewall replacement cycle, with the JTWC reporting a secondary peak intensity of 150 km/h, (90 mph), during the next day. During September 19, Choi-wan rapidly weakened, as it moved into an unfavorable environment with higher amounts of vertical wind shear, causing the storm's deep convection to erode. As a result of this and dry latitude air wrapping into the low-level circulation center, the JTWC decided to downgrade Choi-wan to an extratropical system and issued their final advisory early the next day on September 20, before the JMA followed suit later that day. The JMA then reported that the extratropical low had dissipated completely, early on September 21. Despite the intensity of Choi-wan when it passed over the Northern Marina Islands, there was no casualties reported. It was determined afterwards by the US Navy that the whole island of Alamagan was uninhabitable, with all but one of the structures, a facility for laboratory and research, completely destroyed and most of the islands' trees downed. As a result, it was determined that all of the residents of Alamagan and Agrihan needed to be completely evacuated to Saipan. ===Typhoon Koppu (Nando)=== On September 9, an area of convectional cloudiness associated with the monsoon trough formed to the northwest of Palau. Satellite imagery showed that a consolidating Low Level Circulation Centre (LLCC) with convection had started to develop and was wrapping toward the center. On September 11, the LLCC started to show improvement and was under moderate vertical shear with good westward outflow, but the JMA still upgraded the system to a minor tropical depression. Early of September 12, PAGASA upgraded the system in their responsibility and assigned its local name, Nando. At 1500 UTC, PAGASA reported that the depression made its landfall over northern Palanan, Isabela of the Philippines. However both JMA and JTWC reported that the depression did not make landfall but only crossed the Luzon strait. Early of the next day, JTWC upgraded the system into a tropical depression. Early of September 13, both JMA and JTWC upgraded the system as a tropical storm and assigned its international name, Koppu. In the afternoon, JMA reported that Koppu intensified into a severe tropical storm. On the 14th, the JMA reported that Koppu had intensified to a minimal typhoon, but the JTWC still kept Koppu as a tropical storm for the next few hours but later acknowledging the intensification and upgraded Koppu to a minimal typhoon. But the JTWC issued their final advisory early on September 15, as Koppu was moving over land, and was expected to dissipate quickly. In Luzon, a 48-hour rainfall was experienced. In Visayas and Mindanao, a 24-hour rainfall was also experienced due to Nando's enhancing southwest monsoon. About 10 provinces were raised in signal warning no.1 from September 12 – September 13. Nando had triggered landslides resulting road closures and evacuations of some residents in Kalinga province. The storm then caused major flood in Luoding, People's Republic of China.TimesofIndia.com. \\"TimesofIndia.com.\\" Seven die as Typhoon Koppu hits China. Retrieved on 2009-10-09. ===Typhoon Ketsana (Ondoy)=== On September 22, an area of convection associated with the monsoon trough had formed about , to the east of Manila, Philippines. Satellite imagery showed deep convection starting to consolidate about an LLCC. In the afternoon of the next day, the system started showing good outflow in LLCC and was moving through moderate vertical shear whilst the JMA upgraded the system to a tropical depression. On the evening of the same day, the JMA reported that the depression weakened into an area of low pressure. In the afternoon of September 24, the JMA reported that the system was organizing again and was upgraded to a tropical depression again, while the PAGASA also upgraded the system to a tropical depression and assigned it the local name Ondoy. On the same day, the JTWC also issued a TCFA on the system. Early the next day, the JTWC upgraded the system to a tropical depression again. In the evening, the PAGASA reported that Ondoy intensified into a tropical storm. Early on September 26, the JTWC upgraded the depression to a tropical storm as well. At the same time, JMA also upgraded it as a tropical storm and assigned it the international designated name Ketsana. In the Philippines, the whole archipelago experienced a torrential rain starting on September 23. more than 30 areas in Luzon, including Metro Manila, were placed under storm alerts as tropical storm \\"Ondoy\\" accelerated further and moved closer to Central Luzon. On Bicol region, ferry passengers were suspended during September 25 through the next day due to high waves and heavy rains that were brought by Ketsana into the region affecting about 2000 people. In the Manila International Airport, 13 flights were canceled due to Ketsana making landfall. Some universities in Manila suspended their classes due to severe flooding in some areas and heavy rainfall. In addition, the PAGASA also advised residents living in low-lying areas and near mountain slopes in areas affected by the Southwest Monsoon and those under signals #1 and #2 (see below) are alerted against possible flashfloods and landslides. Also, PAGASA has alerted the National Disaster Coordinating Council (NDCC) for possible flashfloods and landslides in the affected areas, particularly in Laguna, Quezon, Zambales, Pampanga and Bataan provinces. Philippine Coast Guard commandant Admiral Wilfredo Tamayo also reminded owners of seacraft of a guideline barring travel for seacraft weighing 1,000 tons or less. In Quezon City at the PAGASA Science Garden in NCR or Manila, torrential rains and 24‑hour Rainfall amounted to 455 mm the highest rainfall ever recorded in Metro Manila and belongs to the top 20 most rainiest typhoons to strike the Philippines. The amount of rainfall was 341.3 mm in just 6 hours from 8AM to 2PM on the 26th of September and an additional 83 mm fell for another 3 hours amounting to 424 mm in about 9 hours and the remaining 31 mm was light rain showers during the night before the epic flood and the evening of the 26th of September and 111 mm fell on 25 September. Bulacan also experienced an unusually high rainfall amount leading to the widespread and massive flooding in the province and overflowing of the Angat dam and opening of the floodgates at about 10:45 am. A total of 25 provinces and Metro Manila were placed under state of calamity, with Metro Manila experiencing a record amount of rainfall in 42 years, with rain falling between 8:00 a.m. and 2:00 p.m. of September 26 pegged at 341 mm, over the record established in June 1967 at 334 mm. ===Tropical Depression 18W=== The JTWC reported on September 24 that an area of convection had persisted about to the northeast of Pohnpei. Deep convection had started to consolidate and wrap around the low-level circulation centre. By September 26, the system had developed strong outflow and was intensifying with the JMA reporting later that day that it had become a tropical depression however the JTWC did not follow suit until early the next day when they assigned the designation of 18W to the depression. During the next couple of days very little intensification took place as convection barely deepened around the low-level circulation center and in fact weakened due to the precursor system to Typhoon Parma was developing to the southeast of 18W. During September 29, both the JMA and the JTWC reported peak windspeeds of 55 km/h (35 mph). As 18W approached Guam, the system became severely disrupted after interaction with what were to become Typhoons Melor and Parma. As it passed near the island, the storm rapidly dissipated, first weakening to a depression and then as it lost its low-level circulation centre it was no longer considered a tropical cyclone and thus the final warnings from the JTWC and the JMA were issued. Despite a state of emergency being declared by the Governor of Guam before the depression affected Guam on September 29, it had very little impact on Guam. With only increased winds and moderate rainfall reported. All flights in and out of Guam were cancelled until the storm had passed. Five ships and a submarine from the United States Navy moved out to sea to avoid the storm; however, one submarine was unable to leave and remained at port during the storm. ===Typhoon Parma (Pepeng)=== Early on September 25, an area of convectional cloudiness associated with the monsoon through formed to the southeast of Palau. Satellite imagery showed a consolidating Low Level Circulation Centre. On September 27, the system began improving and showing a partial LLCC due to favorable conditions and was also located under moderate vertical wind shear, whilst the JMA upgraded the system into a tropical depression. On the evening of that day, the JTWC issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert. On the next day, JMA reported that the depression had intensified into a tropical storm, submitting its international designated name, Parma. Also, on September 28, JTWC upgraded it to a tropical depression. On the next day, JTWC again upgraded the depression into a tropical storm. And, by early September 30, due to the storm moving through warm water temperatures, the JTWC and JMA upgraded it to a Category 1 typhoon. Satellite imagery also began showing that an eye wall structure had formed. Intensification continued into the morning of the next day, reaching Category 3 status. Then, after four hours, Parma rapidly strengthened to a Category 4 super typhoon, reaching its peak strength. Different weather bureaus forecasted that Parma would intensify into a Category 5 super typhoon, however, it weakened in the afternoon of October 1 as the eye of Parma began to degrade due to its movement into unfavorable conditions. Parma continued to slightly weaken while moving through the area of Cagayan, then by midday of October 3, it was downgraded into a Category 3-equivalent typhoon. Before it made landfall over northern Cagayan at 3:00 pm PST (07:00 UTC), it weakened into a Category 2 typhoon. Parma crossed northern Luzon over 12 hours, during which the typhoon weakened into a category 1 equivalent typhoon. PAGASA reported that the typhoon was moving almost stationary in their area of responsibility due to interaction with Typhoon Melor and a ridge of high-pressure area over mainland China. At the same time, JTWC downgraded Parma into a tropical storm while the JMA downgraded it into a severe tropical storm. Early the next day, satellite imagery revealed that Parma had an eye center but no convectional cloudiness due to high pressure. Intensification was unlikely because of unfavorable environment conditions and interaction with Typhoon Melor. On October 6, at 11:00 pm PST (15:00 UTC), Parma made its second landfall over Ilocos Norte as it moved to the southeast. In the afternoon of the next day, PAGASA reported that Parma weakened into a tropical depression near the Isabela area, while both JMA and JTWC still classified Parma as a tropical storm. In the morning of October 8, it emerged back into waters near Isabela. After four hours, Parma made its third landfall in Cagayan. The next day, Parma crossed Northern Luzon for the third time. Then by the afternoon of that day, Parma exited La Union and emerged back into the South China Sea. As it moved out into the Philippine area of responsibility, then PAGASA issued their final warning on Parma. On October 10, both JMA and JTWC reported that Parma reintensified into a tropical storm while it was over the South China sea. Intensification was almost difficult due to moderate vertical wind shear. Then by late of October 12, it made its fourth landfall over Hainan Island in China. Early on October 14, Parma was downgraded by JMA to a tropical depression because there was a lack of convection. Then by the afternoon of that day, it made its fifth landfall over the coastline of Vietnam. In the evening, JMA reported that Parma weakened into an area of low pressure, becoming the agency issues their final advisory. However, JTWC still considered Parma as a tropical storm. The names Parma and Pepeng were retired at the end of the season. At least 500 people were killed by Parma. ===Typhoon Melor (Quedan)=== On September 28, an area of convectional cloudiness formed to the northeast of Pohnpei. Satellite imagery showed a Low Level Circulation Centre had begun to form. On the evening of September 28, due to a TUTT that was providing good outflow for the system and low-level vertical wind shear with a favorable environment, the JTWC issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert. Early on September 29, both JMA and JTWC upgraded the system into a tropical depression. Early on September 30, JMA reported that the depression had intensified into a tropical storm and assigned its international designated name, Melor. At the same time JTWC also classified the depression as a tropical storm. Early on October 1, Melor intensified further from a severe tropical storm into a typhoon. Intensification continued, and by the afternoon of the same day the JTWC reported that Melor had intensified into a Category 1-equivalent typhoon. In just four hours, it intensified rapidly to a Category 3-equivalent typhoon, and continued to track towards northeast Luzon. Early on October 2, it strengthened to a Category 4-equivalent typhoon. After levelling out in intensity, it strengthened again on October 3. Early October 4, JTWC reported that Melor had intensified to a Category-5 equivalent super typhoon, with JMA reporting a central pressure of 910 hPa and winds of 205 km/h. On October 5, PAGASA allocated the name Quedan to the typhoon as the storm moved into Philippine's area of responsibility. It interacted with Typhoon Parma in Parma's second landfall in the Philippines. By the midday of October 8, Melor made landfall on Japan. After landfall, JMA downgraded Melor into a severe tropical storm, while the JTWC downgraded it into an extratropical storm. Late on October 11, the extratropical remnants of Melor were completely absorbed by a newly formed extratropical storm to the north, near Alaska. The new extratropical storm then strengthened into a powerful storm, which then began to impact the west coast of the United States, late on October 11, near midnight. ===Tropical Storm Nepartak=== On October 6, an area of convectional cloudiness associated with the monsoon trough formed to the southwest of Saipan. Satellite imagery showed a consolidating Low Level Circulation Center with formative convective banding and deep convection over the northern semicircle. During the morning of October 8, the system started to move northwest and its LLCC rapidly became well defined due to favorable conditions. The JMA then upgraded it to a tropical depression, and the JTWC issued a TCFA on the system, as it had started to become better defined. Then in the evening of that day, it was upgraded into a tropical depression by the JTWC. On October 9, the JMA upgraded it to a tropical storm and assigned its international name Nepartak. After the JMA upgraded it to a tropical storm, it slowly intensified to a peak intensity of 50 mph (85 km/h), but dissipated on October 14, because the polar jet stream had torn apart the storm. ===Typhoon Lupit (Ramil)=== Early on October 13, the JTWC reported that an area of disorganized deep convection had persisted about to the southeast of Hagåtña, Guam. The convection had a broad circulation center that was beginning to consolidate in an area of low vertical windshear and favorable sea surface temperatures. Later that day, as the low-level circulation center had consolidated further, the JTWC released a tropical cyclone formation alert before early the next day both the JMA and the JTWC initiated advisories on the system as it had intensified into Tropical Depression 22W. During that day the depressions low-level circulation center continued to organize with deep convective bands starting to wrap into the center. Early on October 13, the JTWC reported that an area of convection had persisted about to the northwest of Kwajalein. The convection was disorganised but was starting to consolidate around a broad low-level circulation center within a favourable environment to develop further with good vertical windshear and favourable sea surface temperatures. The disturbance rapidly developed throughout that day with a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert issued later that day by the JTWC before advisories were initiated early the next day by the JMA and the JTWC who designated it as Tropical Depression 22W before the JTWC reported that the depression had intensified into a weak tropical storm. On October 15, JMA upgraded it to a Tropical Storm with the name Lupit. On the afternoon of next day, JTWC reported that Lupit strengthened into a Category 1 typhoon. That evening, PAGASA started issuing warnings on Lupit as it entered into their area of responsibility and assigned its local name, Ramil. At the same time JMA also upgraded Lupit into a typhoon. Intensification continued due to favorable conditions and hot water conditions, then by October 17, it rapidly intensified into a Category 3-equivalent typhoon. In the morning of the next day, it strengthened into a Category 4 typhoon, then strengthened further to Super Typhoon classification. On October 20, Lupit weakened to a minimal typhoon. By the 24th, dry air entrainment and an unfavorable environment had weakened Lupit further to a strong tropical storm, and caused the storm to change track from its westward drift to accelerate northeastward. Later that day, JTWC and PAGASA issued their final warning as Lupit was beginning extratropical transition. However, the JMA continued to issue warnings on Lupit until early on October 27. ===Typhoon Mirinae (Santi)=== JMA upgraded a Tropical Depression to Tropical Storm Mirinae on October 27, and it rapidly strengthened to a Typhoon, to a peak of 105-110 mph. It did not strengthen much further, due to wind shear and its fast movement. PAGASA allocated the name Santi to the system the next day, as the storm had entered their area of responsibility. Then Mirinae crossed the Philippines, causing it to rapidly deorganize and was downgraded from a Category 2 Typhoon, to a tropical storm in one advisory. It then crossed into the South China Sea, and slowly, but steadily strengthened until it was very close to Vietnam. Where it intensified to a Typhoon again. It made landfall and rapidly weakened. Mirinae's main effect in the Philippines is the strong winds it brings. From the night of October 30 until the next day, Southern Luzon, including Metro Manila, experienced lashing winds from the typhoon, where in Manila, minimal tropical storm force winds were at 39 m/h with gusts of 56 m/h at 6 a.m. local time, thus downing trees and made significant damage to several infrastructures. During Mirinae's passage in the Philippines, rainfall amounts from the typhoon were less than six inches recorded. Casualties from Mirinae both in the Philippines and Vietnam reached 162, with cost of damage amounting to $295 million (2009 USD). ===Tropical Depression 24W (Tino)=== Late on October 31, the JTWC reported that a tropical disturbance had formed within an area of moderate vertical windshear about 1400 km, (870 mi), to the east of Manila, Philippines. Deep convection had started to form over a low-level circulation center. The JMA then reported early the next day that the disturbance had intensified into a weak tropical depression. However at this time the JTWC did not upgrade the disturbance to a tropical depression, instead issuing a tropical cyclone formation alert later that day as the depressions poleward outflow improved. Early on November 2, PAGASA named the depression as Tino as it was now located about , to the northeast of Manila. Later that day the JTWC designated the depression as 24W, despite the system now encountering unfavorable levels of vertical windshear which made the low-level circulation center become fully exposed with no deep convection existing near the center. As a result of this early on November 3, the JMA, the JTWC and PAGASA all issued their final advisories. ===Tropical Depression 25W=== An area of low- pressure formed near the International Dateline on November 1. Early on November 3, the JTWC reported that an area of convection had persisted in a monsoon trough about to the southeast of Pohnpei. The convection was poorly organized and was located in a monsoon trough amidst a weak and elongated circulation with weak mid-level turning. However environmental conditions were not favourable for the disturbance to develop as it was located in an area of moderate vertical windshear. Over the next few days the disturbances gradually developed a low-level circulation center and as a result was designated as a tropical depression early on November 7 by both the JMA and the JTWC. ===Tropical Depression 27W (Urduja)=== On November 23, PAGASA announced that a low-pressure area east of Mindanao had developed into a Tropical Depression and had been named \\"Urduja\\". The same day JTWC designated the tropical depression as 27W. Early Of November 25, the depression has weakened into an area of low pressure. The remnants of Urduja were absorbed into Typhoon Nida during November 25 and 26. In Eastern Visayas, 1, 519 passengers were stranded, 719 in Western Visayas, 399 in Bicol and 185 in Southern Luzon due to Urduja. In all, four people were killed by Urduja, three due to a landslide and one from electrocution. ===Typhoon Nida (Vinta)=== Early on November 21 the JTWC reported that an area of convection had persisted within a monsoon trough about 880 km, (545 mi) to the southeast of Guam. At this time the system was moving around the subtropical ridge of pressure, with an anticyclone over the cyclone helping the convection to consolidate over a broad and elongated low-level circulation center which was located in an area of minimal vertical wind shear. Later that morning a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert was released as deep convection increased in organization with multiple bands of convection starting to wrap into the developing low-level circulation center. The system was then declared as a tropical depression by the JMA later that day before the JTWC followed suit early the next day, who assigned the designation of 26W to the depression. On November 23, the JTWC upgraded the system to a tropical storm, and JMA followed suit allocating the name Nida. Later the next day, JTWC reported that Nida rapidly intensified into the equivalent of a category 1 typhoon. The next day JMA upgraded Nida to a Severe Tropical Storm Intensification was anticipated until in the afternoon of November 25, then JTWC reported that Nida intensified from category 2 to a category 4 super typhoon equivalent. While JMA also upgraded it to typhoon status. At the same time an eye wall structure had formed. During the evening of November 25, Nida further intensified into an extremely intense Category 5 equivalent super typhoon, according to the JTWC, attaining winds of 285 km/h (180 mph) as it moved north west past Guam. Nida became the first storm of this intensity in the basin in terms of 10-minute winds (JMA) since Typhoon Jangmi in 2008. Additionally, the JMA reported that the barometric pressure had decreased to 905 mbar, ranking Nida as the strongest storm to form during 2009 worldwide, only slightly eclipsing Hurricane Rick's intensity. Later, Nida was downgraded to a category 4 equivalent, due to an eyewall replacement cycle, but shortly regained strength, and on November 28, Nida re-intensified to a Category 5 typhoon. It later stalled and remained quasi-stationary for some time while briefly expanding tremendously in size, then gradually weakening and shrinking into a Category 1 typhoon by November 30. While the typhoon weakened, it created a large gap in the Subtropical Ridge and sent moisture into the subtropical jet, where intense storms formed in the North Pacific. On December 1, Nida weakened to a JMA Severe Tropical storm, with top winds weakening to as Nida remained nearly stationary. By December 2, Nida began to move northward slowly, while weakening further to JMA Tropical Storm status. On December 3, Nida weakened into a PAGASA tropical depression and on the same day JTWC issued a Final Warning. However, on December 4, part of its remnants were absorbed into the Jet Stream, and the other part of the main convection remained in position to merge with Tropical Depression 28W. And thus, the remnants of Nida dissipated completely on December 4. Nida was one of the most intense cyclones ever to develop in the month of November. ===Tropical Depression 28W=== On November 29 the JTWC reported that an area of unorganized deep convection had persisted about to the north of Honiara, in the Solomon Islands. Deep convection was slowly consolidating around a poorly defined low-level circulation centre, in an area of moderate to high vertical wind shear. Over the next couple of days the moderate to high vertical wind shear prevented the disturbance's low-level circulation centre from consolidating further. On December 2, the JTWC issued a TCFA as the disturbance moved close to the upper-level ridge axis which was providing an area of low vertical wind shear and gave the system a good chance of development within 12–24 hours. During the next day, the JMA reported that the disturbance had intensified into a tropical depression before the JTWC cancelled the TCFA and downgraded the depression's chance of becoming a significant tropical cyclone within 24 hours to poor, as the low-level circulation center had become elongated and exposed whilst deep convection had become poorly organized and displaced. As a consequence of the depression moving into an area of higher vertical wind shear, deep convection had become sheared to the north and northwest of the centre. Throughout December 4, the JTWC assessed the depression's chances of becoming a significant tropical cyclone within 24 hours as poor. However early the next day the JTWC issued their first advisory on the depression, as they reported it had become a significant tropical cyclone and designated it as Tropical Storm 28W as deep convection had been sustained near the low-level circulation center, despite vertical wind shear in excess of 30 knots (55 km/h, 35 mph). The JTWC also issued their final warning at the same time as the depression was beginning to go through an extra tropical transition with dry air entering the cyclone and breaking down the storms warm core as it moved over an area of unfavourable vertical wind shear and sea surface temperatures of less than 26 °C (80 °F). The JMA then downgraded the tropical depression to an extratropical low, later that day. ===Other systems=== During May 1, a tropical depression had developed about 648 km (403 mi) north of Yap.https://www.webcitation.org/5gRSKyOQr?url=http://weather.noaa.gov/pub/data/raw/ab/abpw10.pgtw..txthttps://www.webcitation.org/5gS4q4nie?url=http://weather.noaa.gov/pub/data/raw/ww/wwjp25.rjtd..txt The JTWC briefly issued a TCFA on the system during the next day.https://www.webcitation.org/5gSnx6W0m?url=http://metocph.nmci.navy.mil/jtwc/warnings/wp9509web.txt The tropical depression meandered northward until it was last noted on May 4 when it became an extratropical low. Another tropical depression had developed about 1,000 km (620 mi) southeast of Okinawa on August 25. However the JMA discontinued tracking on the system by the next day. On September 23, a tropical depression had developed about 1,145 km (711 mi) southeast of Tokyo. As it moved northward the system started to weaken after its convection remained weak, therefore, the system dissipated on September 26. During October 16, a tropical depression formed over in favorable environments about 780 km (480 mi) to the southeast of Hue, Vietnam. By October 17, the JTWC issued a TCFA, although it was canceled few hours later. As the system’s center became exposed and as it entered unfavorable environments, the system dissipated on October 20. On November 24, the JMA started to monitor a weak tropical depression to the northeast of Borneo. Although the system did not organize further and weakened to a low-pressure during the next day. On December 7, a weak tropical depression had formed to the east of Mindanao, Philippines until it fully dissipated during December 8. ==Storm names== Within the North-western Pacific Ocean, both the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) and the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration assign names to tropical cyclones that develop in the Western Pacific, which can result in a tropical cyclone having two names. The Japan Meteorological Agency's RSMC Tokyo — Typhoon Center assigns international names to tropical cyclones on behalf of the World Meteorological Organization's Typhoon Committee, should they be judged to have 10-minute sustained wind speeds of . While the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration assigns names to tropical cyclones which move into or form as a tropical depression in their area of responsibility located between 135°E and 115°E and between 5°N-25°N even if the cyclone has had an international name assigned to it. The names of significant tropical cyclones are retired, by both PAGASA and the Typhoon Committee. ===International names=== During the season 22 named tropical cyclones developed in the Western Pacific and were named by the Japan Meteorological Agency, when it was determined that they had become tropical storms. These names were contributed to a list of a 140 names submitted by the fourteen members nations and territories of the ESCAP/WMO Typhoon Committee. The names Molave, Mujigae and Mirinae were used for the first time as it was replaced from Imbudo, Maemi and Sudal from the 2003 and 2004 seasons respectively. {  -  Kujira  Chan-hom  Linfa  Nangka  Soudelor  Molave  Goni  Morakot  Etau  Vamco  Krovanh - Dujuan Mujigae  Choi-wan  Koppu  Ketsana  Parma  Melor  Nepartak  Lupit  Mirinae Nida } ===Philippines=== {  align=right -  Auring  Bising  Crising  Dante  Emong -  Feria  Gorio  Huaning  Isang  Jolina -  Kiko  Labuyo  Maring  Nando  Ondoy -  Pepeng  Quedan  Ramil  Santi  Tino -  Urduja  Vinta    - ! colspan=5Auxiliary list -      -      } The Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration uses its own naming scheme for tropical cyclones in their area of responsibility. PAGASA assigns names to tropical depressions that form within their area of responsibility and any tropical cyclone that might move into their area of responsibility. Should the list of names for a given year prove to be insufficient, names are taken from an auxiliary list, the first 10 of which are published each year before the season starts. The names not retired from this list were used again in the 2013 season. This is the same list used in the 2005 season, except for Urduja which replaced Undang, because the name Undang had been retired in the 1984 season. Names that were not assigned are marked in . The names Ramil, Santi, Tino, Urduja and Vinta were used for the first time this year. ===Retirement=== The names Morakot, Ketsana, and Parma were retired by the ESCAP/WMO Typhoon Committee. The names Atsani, Champi, and In-fa were chosen to replace Morakot, Ketsana and Parma respectively. The Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration (PAGASA) announced that Typhoons Feria Ondoy and Pepeng had their names retired after they both caused over 300 deaths and 1 billion PHP worth of damage in the Philippines. On June 2012 the names Fabian, Odette and Paolo were chosen by PAGASA to replace Feria, Ondoy and Pepeng respectively. ==Season effects== This table will list all the storms that developed in the northwestern Pacific Ocean west of the International Date Line and north of the equator during 2009. It will include their intensity, duration, name, areas affected, deaths, and damage totals. Classification and intensity values will be based on estimations conducted by the JMA. All damage figures will be in 2009 USD. Damages and deaths from a storm will include when the storm was a precursor wave or an extra tropical low. -  Auring   bgcolor=#  bgcolor=#  bgcolor=#  Philippines    -  Bising   bgcolor=#  bgcolor=#  bgcolor=#  Philippines  None  None  -  Crising   bgcolor=#  bgcolor=#  bgcolor=#  Philippines  None  None  -  Kujira (Dante)   bgcolor=#  bgcolor=#  bgcolor=#  Philippines, Russian Far East    -  TD   bgcolor=#  bgcolor=#  bgcolor=#  None  None  None  -  Chan-hom (Emong)   bgcolor=#  bgcolor=#  bgcolor=#  Vietnam, Philippines, Ryukyu Islands    -  Linfa   bgcolor=#  bgcolor=#  bgcolor=#  Philippines, Taiwan, China    -  Nangka (Feria)   bgcolor=#  bgcolor=#  bgcolor=#  Philippines, China    -  Soudelor (Gorio)   bgcolor=#  bgcolor=#  bgcolor=#  Philippines, China, Vietnam    -  06W (Huaning)   bgcolor=#  bgcolor=#  bgcolor=#  Taiwan, China  None  None  -  Molave (Isang)   bgcolor=#  bgcolor=#  bgcolor=#  Philippines, Taiwan, China  Moderate   -  Goni (Jolina)   bgcolor=#  bgcolor=#  bgcolor=#  Philippines, China, Vietnam  Minor   -  Morakot (Kiko)   bgcolor=#  bgcolor=#  bgcolor=#  Philippines, Japan, Taiwan, China, Korea    -  Etau   bgcolor=#  bgcolor=#  bgcolor=#  Japan    -  Maka   bgcolor=#  bgcolor=#  bgcolor=#  None  None  None  -  Vamco   bgcolor=#  bgcolor=#  bgcolor=#  None  None  None  -  TD   bgcolor=#  bgcolor=#  bgcolor=#  Japan  None  None  -  TD   bgcolor=#  bgcolor=#  bgcolor=#  None  None  None  -  Krovanh   bgcolor=#  bgcolor=#  bgcolor=#  Japan  None  None  -  02C   bgcolor=#  bgcolor=#  bgcolor=#  None  None  None  -  Dujuan (Labuyo)   bgcolor=#  bgcolor=#  bgcolor=#  Mariana Islands  None  None  -  TD   bgcolor=#  bgcolor=#  bgcolor=#  Vietnam    -  Mujigae (Maring)   bgcolor=#  bgcolor=#  bgcolor=#  Philippines, China, Vietnam    -  Koppu (Nando)   bgcolor=#  bgcolor=#  bgcolor=#  Philippines, China  Moderate  None  -  Choi-wan   bgcolor=#  bgcolor=#  bgcolor=#  Mariana Islands  Minor  None  -  TD   bgcolor=#  bgcolor=#  bgcolor=#  Mariana Islands  Minor  None  -  Ketsana (Ondoy)   bgcolor=#  bgcolor=#  bgcolor=#  Philippines, Vietnam, Laos, Cambodia, Thailand    -  18W   bgcolor=#  bgcolor=#  bgcolor=#  Mariana Islands, Caroline Islands  None  None  -  Parma (Pepeng)   bgcolor=#  bgcolor=#  bgcolor=#  Caroline Islands, Philippines, Taiwan, China, Vietnam    -  Melor (Quedan)   bgcolor=#  bgcolor=#  bgcolor=#  Caroline Islands, Mariana Islands, Japan    -  Nepartak   bgcolor=#  bgcolor=#  bgcolor=#  Mariana Islands  None  None  -  Lupit (Ramil)   bgcolor=#  bgcolor=#  bgcolor=#  Caroline Islands, Philippines, Japan  Minor  None  -  TD   bgcolor=#  bgcolor=#  bgcolor=#  Vietnam, China  None  None  -  Mirinae (Santi)   bgcolor=#  bgcolor=#  bgcolor=#  Caroline Islands, Mariana Islands, Philippines, Vietnam, Cambodia, Laos, Thailand    -  24W (Tino)   bgcolor=#  bgcolor=#  bgcolor=#  Philippines  None  None  -  25W   bgcolor=#  bgcolor=#  bgcolor=#  None  None  None  -  27W (Urduja)   bgcolor=#  bgcolor=#  bgcolor=#  Philippines  Minor   -  Nida (Vinta)   bgcolor=#  bgcolor=#  bgcolor=#  Caroline Islands, Mariana Islands  Minor  None  -  TD   bgcolor=#  bgcolor=#  bgcolor=#  Malaysia, Indonesia, Thailand  None  None  -  28W   bgcolor=#  bgcolor=#  bgcolor=#  None  None  None  -  TD   bgcolor=#  bgcolor=#  bgcolor=#  Philippines  None  None  - ==See also== *List of Pacific typhoon seasons *2009 Pacific hurricane season *2009 Atlantic hurricane season *2009 North Indian Ocean cyclone season *South-West Indian Ocean cyclone seasons: 2008–09, 2009–10 *Australian region cyclone seasons: 2008–09, 2009–10 *South Pacific cyclone seasons: 2008–09, 2009–10 *Effects of the 2009 Pacific typhoon season in the Philippines ==NotesReferences *Satellite movie of 2009 Pacific typhoon season 2009 Category:Articles which contain graphical timelines 2009 WPac ","title":"2009 Pacific typhoon season"},{"id":"20384597","text":"The Wenatchee Valley Venom were a professional indoor football team based in Wenatchee, Washington. The team was most recently a member of the Pacific Division of the Intense Conference of the Indoor Football League (IFL). The Venom were founded in 2009 as an expansion member of the American Indoor Football Association (AIFA). The Venom played their home games at Town Toyota Center. ==History== On June 15, 2009, co-owner and general manager Mark Helm announced that the Wenatchee Valley Venom would become an expansion team of the American Indoor Football Association (AIFA) for the 2010 season. The ownership named Keith Evans the franchise's first head coach and assistant general manager. In January, 2010, the Venom adding Kyle Skalisky to the ownership group and named him team president. After a 2–5 start, the team fired Keith Evans and named defensive coordinator Brian Smith as the team's interim head coach. On May 28, 2010, ownership removed the interim tag from Smith and he took over as the full-time head coach. Smith guided the Venom to a 6–1 record during the remainder of the season, but the team missed the playoffs. The ownership group announced that the team would be returning for the 2011 season, but were unsure what league the franchise would play in. On September 11, 2010, the Venom joined the Indoor Football League (IFL) for the 2011 season. The Venom won their IFL debut 45–37 over the Fairbanks Grizzlies. The Venom started 2–0, but followed with a seven-game losing streak. Recently added rookie quarterback Charles Dowdell ended the Venom's losing streak by leading them to a 41–36 victory over the Wyoming Cavalry. The Venom then lost the final four games of the season. On June 21, 2011 The Venom announced they had ceased operations citing low ticket sales since their debut season in 2010 despite the 8–6 season. Though they moved to the more financially stable IFL for the 2011 season, the team posted a 3–11 record and continued to have issues drawing fans. ==Season-by-season results== {  style=\\"margin:center; font-size:75%;\\" -  style=\\"text-align:center; background:#fcc;\\"League champions  style=\\"text-align:center; background:#Conference champions  style=\\"text-align:center; background:#d0e7ff;\\"Division champions  style=\\"text-align:center; background:#96cdcd;\\"Playoff berth  style=\\"text-align:center; background:#c8a2c8;\\"League leader } {  style=\\"font-size: 95%; text-align:center\\" - !rowspan=\\"2\\"  Season !rowspan=\\"2\\"  League !rowspan=\\"2\\"  Conference !rowspan=\\"2\\"  Division !colspan=\\"4\\"  Regular season !rowspan=\\"2\\"  Postseason results - !Finish !!Wins !!Losses !!Ties - ! 2010  AIFA   Western  3rd  8  6  0 align=leftDid not qualify - ! 2011  IFL  Intense  Pacific  4th  3  11  0 align=leftDid not qualify - !colspan=\\"5\\"Totals ! 11 !! 17 !! 0 !! } ==PersonnelFinal roster=== { class=\\"toccolours\\" style=\\"text-align: left;\\" - ! colspan=\\"7\\" style=\\"text-align:center; background-color:#000000; color:#CACACA; border:2px solid #D01913;\\"  Wenatchee Valley Venom roster -  style=\\"font- size: 95%;vertical-align:top;\\"  Quarterbacks Running Backs Wide Receivers  style=\\"width: 25px;\\"   style=\\"font-size: 95%;vertical-align:top;\\"  Offensive Linemen Defensive Linemen  style=\\"width: 25px;\\"   style=\\"font- size: 95%;vertical-align:top;\\"  Linebackers Defensive Backs Kickers  style=\\"width: 25px;\\"   style=\\"font-size: 95%;vertical-align:top;\\"  Injured Reserve *vacant Exempt List *vacant Practice Squad *vacant → More rosters - } ===All-IFL players=== The following Venom players have been named to All- IFL Teams: * WR Timothy Simmons (1) ===Head coaches=== {   - ! rowspan=\\"2\\" style=\\"width:140px;\\"Name ! rowspan=\\"2\\"  Term ! colspan=\\"4\\"  Regular season ! colspan=\\"2\\"  Playoffs ! rowspan=\\"2\\"  Awards - !

Through lectures, demonstrations, writings, teaching, workshops, and exhibitions of her work, she has endeavored to foster appreciation of an art form often stigmatized as \\"women's work\\" and to challenge the notion of textiles as \\"minor arts\\". Chung received an honorary doctorate degree from Sookmyung University, Seoul, South Korea in 2001 and she was awarded a Distinguished Alumna Achievement Award by New York University's Steinhardt School of Culture, Education, and Human Development at the 2013 Doctoral Convocation.New York University Alumna Achievement Award Chung has dedicated her life to the textile arts, not only as an embroiderer and teacher of this art form but also as a historian of traditional East Asian textiles and a collector of outstanding examples. Her embroideries are included in the collections of numerous museums in the world including the Smithsonian Institution and the presidential palaces. Her legacy includes a body of groundbreaking publications such as The Art of Oriental Embroidery (1979) and Silken Threads: A History of Embroidery in China, Korea, Japan, and Vietnam (2005), as well as the Chung Young Yang Embroidery Museum (C.E.M.), an exhibition, educational, and research facility she inaugurated in May 2004 at Sookmyung Women's University in Seoul. Chung was the curator of The Chung Young Yang Embroidery Museum's inaugural exhibition, which traces the origins of silk embroidery in China and its dissemination throughout East Asia, and she will remain at the Museum as a director and curator, in addition to being a professor of graduate school of arts and designs. ==The Dawn of Embroidery Art== In her book Painting with a Needle (2003), she wrote: \\"Small needles and homespun threads proved to be powerful, life-changing tools that provided me and other Korean women with a viable vocation as well as an expressive and rewarding creative outlet... needlework carried me from a small Korean village of 30 families along a fascinating pathway across time and geographic region.\\" Chung is a teacher of embroidery, and during the economically difficult period of South Korea's post-war reconstruction, She was able to harness this art form to positively impact many South Korean women's lives. In 1965 she founded her own institute, the International Embroidery School, and produced a new generation of Korean embroidery artists. In 1967, under the auspices of the Ministry of Social Work, she established South Korea's first vocational embroidery center, The Women's Center. This school provided opportunities for numerous young women who needed gainful work. In the same year, she was invited by the Japan Handicraft Association to present an exhibition of her and her students' embroidery at the prestigious Ikenobo Women's Finishing School in Japan. When Chung announced that entrance fee proceeds would be donated to provide embroidery supplies for schools teaching handicapped children in Tokyo, this was seen as remarkable gesture for a Korean woman, and the exhibition was extended with the financial support of a local hotel. Recognition such as this opened a valuable route to marketing the works created by her students, which in turn enabled the school to support itself financially. Her mission to promote Korean embroidery led to her to Iran in 1968, where she exhibited her work in conjunction with the Tehran World's Fair. The exhibition of her embroidery in Cairo, Egypt, supported by the Korea Trade Association, also served to elevate South Korea's national prestige in this area of the world. In the late 1960s, Chung was featured in a documentary produced by the South Korean television station KBS on young women of achievement. This publicity eventually led to more invitations to exhibit her embroidery abroad, from the U.S. to Japan and Europe, which garnered her international fame. ==Scholastic Achievement in the Art of Embroidery== In the U.S., she devoted considerable time and effort to the study of Western and Eastern embroideries in the Textile Study Room at the Metropolitan Museum of Art. The affirmation of East Asian identity and history remained one of the main objectives in Young Yang Chung's embroidery as well as her scholarly activities. She completed her Masters and Ph.D. in Art Education at New York University. Her Ph.D. dissertation, entitled The Origins and Historical Development of Embroidery in China, Japan, and Korea was the first in-depth academic study of this topic, providing the foundation for embroidery as an academic field. As a rare reference on this little-studied subject, her doctoral dissertation was published in 1978 in book form by UMI Dissertation Services. Through her work activities and academic research, Chung has established the distinctiveness and history of East Asian embroidery. For example, through her screen depicting ancient musical instruments, she not only produced an accurate visual representation of the subject, but also evoked deeply felt cultural ideals, as these traditional musical instruments fully capture the spirit of the Korean people, who value tradition highly. In the 1970s, Chung was called in as a consultant for an exhibition of Chinese dragon robes at the Metropolitan Museum, and had the opportunity to study the response of the visitors. This inspired Chung to set forth on a campaign - through lectures, demonstrations, writings, teaching, workshops, and exhibitions of her work - to elevate the public conception and knowledge of embroidery. Her first book, The Art of Oriental Embroidery (published in 1979), became a standard reference in the field, and in it she emphasized embroidery's antiquity, and challenged the notion that textiles are \\"minor arts.\\" She explained that embroidery vividly records the technological and socio-economic milieu in which it was produced, and provides evidence of cultural exchange, regional aesthetics, and the maker's individual creativity. These pioneering efforts introduced East Asian embroidery to Western audiences, and fostered an ever-increasing appreciation of and interest in the art of silk embroidery. Western enthusiasm for Asian embroidery eventually led, for example, to the establishment of the Japanese Embroidery Center in Atlanta, which teaches traditional Asian techniques to American students. Chung's works have been acquired by museums such as the Smithsonian Institution. Silken Threads, published in 2005 in the United States, summarizes the history of the embroiderers' art; it is the result of her lifetime of study, and can be viewed as the only comprehensive academic textbook on embroidery. ==The Future of Embroidery Art== C.E.M. opened in May 2004 through the combined efforts of Chung, an active figure in the international arena, and Sookmyung Women's University, which maintains a forward-thinking cultural vision. The museum's collection includes hundreds of historical examples, ranging from a 4th to 3rd century BCE bronze mirror with an embroidered silk cover, right up to the present day. Also included are forms such as embroidered Chinese votive textiles, ecclesiastical robes, military uniforms, folding screens, wedding garments, chair and table coverings, Chinese court costumes, and rank insignia, as well as Japanese embroidery. The wide scope of the collection illuminates the cross-cultural dialogues in technique and style that have enriched textile arts worldwide. Housed in a newly constructed building that includes exhibition galleries, a library, conservations studios (including the C.E.M. Textile Study Center), classrooms, and a 300-seat auditorium equipped with earphones for simultaneous translation, the museum aims to become a leading center for scholarship in embroidery and other textile arts. The Chung Young Yang Embroidery Museum aims to become both a cultural and academic center where the legacy of Chung and her global collection can be appreciated by a wide audience. ==Works== Her numerous publications remain standard references in this field, and include: * The Origins and Historical Development of Embroidery in China, Japan, and Korea, 1976 * The Art Of Oriental Embroidery, 1979 * Painting with a Needle: Learning The Art Of Silk Embroidery With Young Yang Chung, 2003 * Silken Threads-Embroidered Court Costume, And Rank Insignia Of China, Japan Korea, And Vietnam, 2004 ==References== Category:Living people Category:South Korean academics Category:Embroidery designers Category:Year of birth missing (living people) ","title":"Young Yang Chung"},{"id":"20384631","text":"Lykissa is a small village on the mountain of Mount Lykodimo in Messenia, Greece.

Roger Hooker Leavitt (1805-1885) Col. Roger Hooker Leavitt (July 21, 1805 - July 17, 1885) was a prominent landowner, early industrialistLeavitt was one of the original incorporators of the Troy & Greenfield Railroad, as well as one of the earliest promoters of the Hoosac Tunnel. and Massachusetts politician who with other family members was an ardent abolitionist, using his home in Charlemont, Massachusetts as an Underground Railroad station for slaves escaped from the South. The escaped slave Basil Dorsey lived in Leavitt's home for nearly six years until eventually settling in Florence, Massachusetts.Roger Hooker and Keziah Leavitt House, Charlemont, National Underground Railroad Network to Freedom, National Park Service, nps.gov Leavitt was born in Heath, Massachusetts, the son of wealthy landowner Roger Leavitt and his wife Chloe (Maxwell) Leavitt.Roger Hooker Leavitt was the grandson of Rev. Jonathan Leavitt, a Congregationalist minister who moved from Walpole, New Hampshire to minister at the church in Charlemont in 1767. Leavitt's apparent Loyalist sentiments did not endear him to his congregation, and he was subsequently dismissed, although he continued to preach in the nearby schoolhouse for nearly a decade afterward. Leavitt's father served in the state's legislature, was an active businessman, and later an ardent abolitionist. The elder Roger's brother was Judge and State Senator Jonathan Leavitt of nearby Greenfield. Roger's son Roger Hooker Leavitt, a graduate of Hopkins Academy in nearby Hadley, and briefly a student at Dartmouth CollegeHistory of Greenfield: Shire Town of Franklin County, Massachusetts, Vol. II, Francis McGee Thompson, Press of T. Morey & Son, Greenfield, Mass., 1904 also served in the Massachusetts Senate.History of the Hopkins Fund, Grammar School and Academy, in Hadley, Mass., 1657-1890, The Amherst Record Press, Amherst, Mass., 1890 Col. Leavitt apparently came naturally to the abolitionist cause. His father had worked against slavery and his brother Joshua had, after graduating from Yale Law School and Yale Divinity School, become a social reformer, leading campaigns for temperance and against slavery. Joshua later became the editor of the abolitionist newspaper The Emancipator, was a prime force behind the defense of the crew of the Amistad, a slave ship that had sustained a mutiny aboard, and in 1833 founded the New York Anti-Slavery Society. In October 1835, Col. Roger Hooker Leavitt joined his brothers Joshua and Hart in attending the Utica, New York, state convention of the Utica Anti-Slavery Society. Violence by pro-slavery factions marred the gathering, but the fracas enabled the three brothers to fully convert their parents to the abolitionist cause.Underground Railroad in Florence, The David Ruggles Center By the following year, Col. Leavitt was president of the Franklin County Anti-Slavery Society as well as vice- president of the Massachusetts Anti-Slavery Society in 1838-39\\\\. In that year, Col. Leavitt's father moved from his home in Heath to Charlemont, where his sons lived, and agreed to run for Lieutenant Governor of Massachusetts on the Liberty Party ticket, a political party which his son Joshua had helped found.The elder Roger Leavitt died the day after announcing his candidacy for the Massachusetts Lieutenant-Governorship as Liberty Party candidate. Col. Leavitt was best known for his sheltering of the fugitive slave Basil Dorsey, who escaped from Frederick County, Maryland unassisted in 1836. By that time, apparently, Col. Hooker's home had become known to anti-slavery zealots as a safe place to shelter escaped slaves. \\"It was always understood that a resting place was at Mr. [Hosea] Blake's and Mr. Leavitt's,\\" a resident recounted years later of the men operating the local Underground Railroad. \\"This was carried on with the greatest secrecy, because of the personal danger, not only to the slave but to those who harbored them.\\" In 1836, shortly after Dorsey's successful escape, Rev. Joshua Leavitt, living in New York City, helped Dorsey and his wife find refuge in Massachusetts - at the home of Joshua's brother Roger Hooker Leavitt. Charlemont records subsequently reflect the birth of Dorsey's son Charles Robert Dorsey in 1838 at Charlemont, as well as the presence in town of two of Dorsey's children born earlier in Maryland. Census records for 1840 show no persons of color living in the households of any of the Leavitt family - at the homes of father Roger, brother Hart nor at Col. Roger Hooker's - but records of the Massachusetts Anti-Slavery Society clearly show that 'B. Dorsey' of Charlemont contributed 50 cents to the cause in 1839. Shortly after his arrival in Charlemont, Dorsey's first wife died, in the same year as Roger Hooker's first wife Kezeah Osgood Hunt Leavitt.The Descendants of Rev. Thomas Hooker, Hartford, Connecticut, 1586-1908, Edward Hooker, Rochester, N.Y. 1909 On learning the news of the death of Dorsey's wife, Joshua Leavitt wrote his brother Roger Hooker: \\"I feel for Mr. Dorsey in his bereavement and trust that you will do all that Christian benevolence requires in his care.\\" It was probably open knowledge in some parts of the community that the Leavitts were harboring fugitive slaves, but it seems that many like- minded citizens cooperated with the Leavitts and others who were sheltering the fugitives. As late as 1895, nearly thirty years after the Civil War, a Franklin County woman called Leavitt \\"a whole souled Abolitionist & [someone who] did all he could to help the slaves to freedom.\\" At the same time, she averred that she could not furnish any specific details. By 1844, Basil Dorsey moved on to other housing, likely in Florence, Massachusetts. He had spent over five years under the roof of the Leavitt family, either at Col. Roger Hooker's home, the adjoining farm of his brother Hart, or at the home of the patriarch Roger - and probably at all three places. Contemporary accounts show that the family was aiding other escaped slaves during this period. Col. Leavitt died in Waterloo, Iowa, where he was visiting his son John Hooker Leavitt. In its obituary, The New York Times noted Leavitt's abolitionist activities and called him \\"one of the prominent and leading citizens of Franklin County.\\"Roger Hooker Leavitt obituary, July 19, 1885, The New York Times Leavitt is interred at the Leavitt Cemetery in Charlemont.Grave of Roger Hooker Leavitt, Leavitt Cemetery, Charlemont, Massachusetts, Find-A-Grave The correspondence of Joshua Leavitt, his brothers Col.

The nursing experience she received during her early life inspired her to reform many aspects of the nursing practice, and her experience as a factory inspector led her to instigate other social reforms. == Early life == Elizabeth Grace Neill was born 26 May 1846 in Edinburgh, Scotland. She was the oldest daughter of nine children born to James Archibald Campbell and Maria Grace of Barcaldine. Neill's father was a retired colonel of Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders, and he was also a deputy lieutenant of the county of Argyllshire and colonel of the militia in that area. Maria Grace was Campbell's second wife. In Campbell's household, discipline and intelligence were valued highly. Tall and red-headed, Elizabeth Neill was a very intelligent child and received a strong education. She was schooled partly at home and partly at a private school in Rugby. Her desire was to study medicine, which she undoubtedly would have done well at, but her father completely disapproved of her doing that. Instead she became a paying probationer nurse in St. John's House Sisterhood in London. This institution supplied nursing staff to both King's College Hospital and Charing Cross Hospitals. Elizabeth Neill easily completed her training in general nursing and midwifery. She then became the lady superintendent at the Pendlebury Hospital for Children near Manchester. She stayed there for two years until she met Dr. Channing Neill, whom she eventually married much to her father's dismay. He believed Dr. Neill was well below his daughter's social class. Neill had her mind made up, however, and married Dr. Neill anyway which resulted in her father casting her out of the family. The couple moved to Ryde, in the Isle of Wight, where they had their first and only son, James Oliver Campbell Neill. == Career == Neill's husband moved to Queensland and set up a medical practice; in 1886, when Neill was thirty years old, she and their four-year-old son joined him there. Two years later, her husband died, and Neill turned to journalism to make a living. She was a sub-editor of the Boomerang and a freelance journalist for the Brisbane Daily Telegraph and the Courier. A year later she was appointed by the Queensland Government to a Royal Commission on working conditions for shop and factory workers. Combined with her work as a journalist, her knowledge of the problems associated with giving charitable aid led to her appointment in 1893 as the first female factory inspector in New Zealand. She was then also given a job as assistant inspector in the department in charge of hospitals, asylums and charitable aid. As only the third person working in that department, Neill had a huge workload and a lot of stress. However, it provided the opportunity for her to greatly influence that area of health care practice. Once another doctor, Frank Hay, was able to take over that position, however, Neill devoted herself to a project that would provide suitable nursing service for all of New Zealand. == Contributions == Neill came up with the idea to require nurses to be registered to be able to practice. She knew this would protect the public and also the profession from unqualified people mal-practicing. She helped Dr. McGregor to draft a bill for a Nurse's Registration Act, and in 1901 it was finally passed by Parliament and was the first bill of its kind. The bill required nurses to have three years of training, a state examination, and a state register. While this fixed the problems with general practising nurses, it still did not require anything from midwives. It was imperative that something be established to train midwives in New Zealand. However, since there were only a few schools in New Zealand that trained for midwifery, this was a more challenging bill to pass. It was then put on Neill to create not only a curriculum for the midwifery training, but to also establish state maternity hospitals in which the training could occur. Her goal was to have hospitals that were for mothers, managed by women, and doctored by women. The hospitals were created for only a certain class of women, however. Only the respectable wives of working men could go there. Neill had no pity for the destitute woman, because Neill herself was a widow raising a child. Also, allowing destitute women into the hospitals would undermine the status of them, so they were excluded. Neill faced much opposition from doctors who thought that these hospitals would threaten their own incomes and control of the system. Finally, the Midwives Registration Act was introduced to Parliament by Richard Seddon in 1904. Seddon then initiated a set-up for the first state maternity hospital which would serve as a lying-in hospital for wives of the working class and as a training school for midwives. It was up to Neill to find a way to equip a suitable house within three weeks to set up this hospital. She was able to do so, and the first hospital opened on Rintoul Street, Wellington in June 1905. It was named St Helens Hospital in honour of Seddon, whose birthplace was in Lancashire, England. After this significant event in New Zealand's history, maternity hospitals began opening all over the country such as St Helens Hospitals in Dunedin (1905), Auckland (1906), and Christchurch (1907). These founding hospitals have played an important role in developing good care for maternity patients. == Later life == Neill did not confine herself to New Zealand. In 1889 she was the principal speaker in the nursing section during the Congress of the International Council of Women in London. Due to her impact at this congress, she was made an honorary member of the Matron's Council of Great Britain. After that she served on a committee that drafted the constitution and bylaws for the International Council of Nurses. In 1901 she once again used her knowledge of social conditions to investigate the administration of charitable aid in Sydney for the government of New South Wales. Neill retired from her position with the New Zealand government and joined her son who had moved to the United States. However, her health continued to decline, so both she and her son moved back to New Zealand in 1909. There she resided until World War I, where she served as sister in charge of the children's ward at Wellington Hospital. After a long period of illness, she died on 18 August 1926, crippled and blind. The Grace Neill Memorial Library was established at the nursing postgraduate school in Wellington in memory of Neill's contributions to New Zealand and nursing.

The most pervasive is the naturally produced bromomethane. One prominent application of synthetic organobromine compounds is the use of polybrominated diphenyl ethers as fire-retardants, and in fact fire-retardant manufacture is currently the major industrial use of the element bromine. A variety of minor organobromine compounds are found in nature, but none are biosynthesized or required by mammals. Organobromine compounds have fallen under increased scrutiny for their environmental impact. ==General properties== Most organobromine compounds, like most organohalide compounds, are relatively nonpolar. Bromine is more electronegative than carbon (2.9 vs 2.5). Consequently, the carbon in a carbon–bromine bond is electrophilic, i.e. alkyl bromides are alkylating agents. Carbon–halogen bond strengths, or bond dissociation energies are of 115, 83.7, 72.1, and 57.6 kcal/mol for bonded to fluorine, chlorine, bromine, or iodine, respectively. The reactivity of organobromine compounds resembles but is intermediate between the reactivity of organochlorine and organoiodine compounds. For many applications, organobromides represent a compromise of reactivity and cost. The principal reactions for organobromides include dehydrobromination, Grignard reactions, reductive coupling, and nucleophilic substitution. ==Synthetic methodsFrom bromine=== Alkenes reliably add bromine without catalysis to give the vicinal dibromides: :RCH=CH2 \\\\+ Br2 → RCHBrCH2Br Aromatic compounds undergo bromination simultaneously with evolution of hydrogen bromide. Catalysts such as AlBr3 or FeBr3 are needed for the reaction to happen on aromatic rings. Chlorine-based catalysts (FeCl3, AlCl3) could be used, but yield would drop slightly as dihalogens(BrCl) could form. The reaction details following the usual patterns of electrophilic aromatic substitution: :RC6H5 \\\\+ Br2 → RC6H4Br + HBr A prominent application of this reaction is the production of tetrabromobisphenol-A from bisphenol-A. Free- radical substitution with bromine is commonly used to prepare organobromine compounds. Carbonyl-containing, benzylic, allylic substrates are especially prone to this reactions. For example, the commercially significant bromoacetic acid is generated directly from acetic acid and bromine in the presence of phosphorus tribromide catalyst: :CH3CO2H + Br2 → BrCH2CO2H + HBr Bromine also converts fluoroform to bromotrifluoromethane. ===From hydrogen bromide=== Hydrogen bromide adds across double bonds to give alkyl bromides, following the Markovnikov rule: :RCH=CH2 \\\\+ HBr → RCHBrCH3 Under free radical conditions, the direction of the addition can be reversed. Free-radical addition is used commercially for the synthesis of 1-bromoalkanes, precursors to tertiary amines and quaternary ammonium salts. 2-Phenethyl bromide (C6H5CH2CH2Br) is produced via this route from styrene. Hydrogen bromide can also be used to convert alcohols to alkyl bromides. This reaction, that must be done under low temperature conditions, is employed in the industrial synthesis of allyl bromide: :HOCH2CH=CH2 \\\\+ HBr → BrCH2CH=CH2 \\\\+ H2O Methyl bromide, another fumigant, is generated from methanol and hydrogen bromide. ===From bromide salts=== Bromide ions, as provided by salts like sodium bromide, function as a nucleophiles in the formation of organobromine compounds by displacement.James S. Nowick, Guido Lutterbach, “Sodium Bromide” in Encyclopedia of Reagents for Organic Synthesis John Wiley & Sons, 2001. An example of this salt mediated bromide displacement is the use of Copper(II) bromide on ketones: R-CO-CH2-R' + CuBr2 → R-CO-CHBr-R' + CuBr ==Applications== :Structure of three industrially significant organobromine compounds. From left: ethylene bromide, bromoacetic acid, and tetrabromobisphenol-A. ===Fire- retardants=== Organobromine compounds are widely used as fire-retardants.David Ioffe, Arieh Kampf “Bromine, Organic Compounds” in Kirk-Othmer Encyclopedia of Chemical Technology 2002 by John Wiley & Sons. . The most prominent member is tetrabromobisphenol-A (4,4'-(1-methylethylidene)bis-(2,6-di-bromophenol), see figure). It and tetrabromophthalic anhydride are precursors to polymers wherein the backbone features covalent carbon-bromine bonds. Other fire retardants, such as hexabromocyclododecane and the bromodiphenyl ethers, are additives and are not chemically attached to the material they protect. The use of organobromine fire-retardants is growing but is also controversial because they are persistent pollutants. ===Fumigants and biocides=== Ethylene bromide, obtained by addition of bromine to ethylene, was once of commercial significance as a component of leaded gasoline. It was also a popular fumigant in agriculture, displacing 1,2-dibromo-3-chloropropane (\\"DBCP\\"). Both applications are declining owing to environmental and health considerations. Methyl bromide is also an effective fumigant, but its production and use are controlled by the Montreal Protocol. Growing in use are organobromine biocides used in water treatment. Representative agents include bromoform and dibromodimethylhydantoin (“DBDMH”). Some herbicides, such as bromoxynil, contain also bromine moieties. Like other halogenated pesticides, bromoxynil is subject to reductive dehalogenation under anaerobic conditions, and can be debrominated by organisms originally isolated for their ability to reductively dechlorinate phenolic compounds.Cupples, A. M., R. A. Sanford, and G. K. Sims. 2005. Dehalogenation of Bromoxynil (3,5-Dibromo-4-Hydroxybenzonitrile) and Ioxynil (3,5-Diiodino-4-Hydroxybenzonitrile) by Desulfitobacterium chlororespirans. Appl. Env. Micro. 71(7):3741-3746. ===Dyes=== Many dyes contain carbon-bromine bonds. The naturally occurring Tyrian purple (6,6’-dibromoindigo) was a valued dye before the development of the synthetic dye industry in the late 19th century. Several brominated anthroquinone derivatives are used commercially. Bromothymol blue is a popular indicator in analytical chemistry. ===Pharmaceuticals=== Commercially available organobromine pharmaceuticals include the vasodilator nicergoline, the sedative brotizolam, the anticancer agent pipobroman, and the antiseptic merbromin. Otherwise, organobromine compounds are rarely pharmaceutically useful, in contrast to the situation for organofluorine compounds. Several drugs are produced as the bromide (or equivalents, hydrobromide) salts, but in such cases bromide serves as an innocuous counterion of no biological significance. ===Designer drugs=== Organobromine compounds such as 4-bromomethcathinone have appeared on the designer drug market alongside other halogenated amphetamines and cathinones in an attempt to circumvent existing drug laws. ==In nature== Organobromine compounds are the most common organohalides in nature. Even though the concentration of bromide is only 0.3% of that for chloride in sea water, organobromine compounds are more prevalent in marine organisms than organochlorine derivatives. Their abundance reflects the easy oxidation of bromide to the equivalent of Br+, a potent electrophile. The enzyme vanadium bromoperoxidase, one of a larger family of bromoperoxidases, catalyzes this reaction in the marine environment.Jayme N. Carter-Franklin, Alison Butler \\"Vanadium Bromoperoxidase-Catalyzed Biosynthesis of Halogenated Marine Natural Products\\" Journal of the American Chemical Society 2004, volume 126, 15060-15066. The oceans are estimated to release 1–2 million tons of bromoform and 56,000 tons of bromomethane annually.Gordon W. Gribble \\"The diversity of naturally occurring organobromine compounds\\" Chemical Society Reviews, 1999, volume 28, pages 335 – 346. Red algae, such as the edible Asparagopsis taxiformis, eaten in Hawaii as \\"limu kohu\\", concentrate organobromine and organoiodine compounds in \\"vesicle cells\\"; 95% of the essential volatile oil of Asparagopsis, prepared by drying the seaweed in a vacuum and condensing using dry ice, is organohalogen compounds, of which bromoform comprises 80% by weight.Rhoda A. Marshall, John T.G. Hamilton , M.J. Dring, D.B. Harper. Do vesicle cells of the red alga Asparagopsis (Falkenbergia stage) play a role in bromocarbon production? Chemosphere 52 (2003) 471–475. Bromoform, produced by several algae, is a known toxin, though the small amounts present in edible algae do not appear to pose human harm.Agency for Toxic substances and Disease Registry. Bromoform and Dibromochloromethane. Aug 2005. URL: http://www.atsdr.cdc.gov/phs/phs.asp?id=711&tid;=128 Some of these organobromine compounds are employed in a form of interspecies \\"chemical warfare\\". In mammals, eosinophil peroxidase, important for defense against multicellular parasites, uses bromide ion in preference to chloride ion. 5-Bromouracil and 3-Bromo-tyrosine have been identified in human white blood cells as products of myeloperoxidase-induced halogenation on invading pathogens. :Structure of some naturally-occurring organobromine compounds. From left: bromoform, a brominated bisphenol, dibromoindigo (Tyrian purple), and the antifeedant tambjamine B. In addition to conventional brominated natural products, a variety of organobromine compounds result from the biodegradation of fire-retardants. Metabolites include methoxylated and hydroxylated aryl bromides as well as brominated dioxin derivatives. Such compounds are considered persistent organic pollutants and have been found in mammals. ==Safety== Alkyl bromine compounds are often alkylating agents and the brominated aromatic derivatives are implicated as hormone disruptors. Of the commonly produced compounds, ethylene dibromide is of greatest concern as it is both highly toxic and highly carcinogenic. ==See also== *Organofluorine compounds *Organochlorine compounds *Organoiodine compounds ==References== ","title":"Organobromine compound"},{"id":"20384998","text":"High Down may refer to: * High Down (HM Prison), prison in Surrey, England * High Down (Isle of Wight), area of downland on Isle of Wight, England * High Down Rocket Test Site preserved site, Isle of Wight, England ==See also== * Highdown (disambiguation) ","title":"High Down"},{"id":"20385005","text":"Highdown may refer to: * Highdown Gardens, a garden in Worthing, England * Highdown Hill, a prominent hill in the South Downs, England * Highdown New Mill, Angmering, a tower mill in Sussex, England * Highdown School, an academy in Reading, Berkshire ==See also== * High Down (disambiguation) ","title":"Highdown"},{"id":"20385006","text":"John Sherlock ( – 25 July 1794) was a Spanish brigadier general in the Ultonia Regiment.

John was the son of Peter Sherlock, who had been made a baronet and knight by titular king, James III, the Old Pretender, in 1716. However, during the Irish Rebellion of 1641, the Sherlock family lost its extensive land holdings in County Waterford. Like many Catholic Irish, John emigrated to Spain with hopes of returning to Ireland once a Catholic was king of England again. And like his father and grandfather he served in the Ultonia Regiment (i.e. Ulster Regiment), part of the Irish Brigade of the Spanish Army. John Sherlock fought in the Anglo-Spanish War of 1727–1729, a failed Spanish attempt to retake Gibraltar. He was made commander in chief of Melilla by Charles III of Spain. From 9 December 1774 to 19 March 1775, John Sherlock defended Melilla against troops of the sultan of Morocco, Mohammed ben Abdallah.

Alabama: Southern Publishing Co. ==Tuskegee Women's Club== Under the leadership of Margaret Murray Washington the Tuskegee Women's Club was formed by female faculty and the wives of male faculty members of the Tuskegee Institute. Thirteen women took part at the first meeting of the club in 1895, which was designed to enlighten the members morally, spiritually and intellectually. Meetings were held twice a month and new teachers were encouraged to join. Since the members were part of the academic arena, the services were related to learning and education. The Tuskegee Women's Club also helped to form new communities and construct social services. One of its pioneer actions was to provide educational and social services to the poor inhabitants of a plantation settlement. ===Tuskegee Mothers' Club=== One of the most successful projects of the Tuskegee Woman's Club was the sponsoring of the mothers' meeting or mothers' club.Rouse, J. A. (1996). \\"Out of the shadow of Tuskegee: Margaret Murray Washington, social activism, and race vindication.\\" The Journal of Negro History, 81, 31- 46. The idea of this project came up when Margaret Washington was attending the first Tuskegee Negro Conference in 1892. At the conference, her husband Booker T. Washington discussed the problems that the black male faced and gave possible solutions. This reminded Margaret Washington of the neglect of women at the time. She believed the women themselves did not realize how unimportant they were considered by their husbands and sons, and so decided to work with the women in Tuskegee and the surrounding areas by forming the Mothers' Club. There, the club worked to improve the education and grooming of local mothers. Many of them did not know their age, and they were helped to recall some incident which took place around the time of their birth in order to figure out their age. Many mothers also lacked childcare options and brought their children along. Thus the children were provided with educational support and were taught simple lessons, and they received lessons demonstrating good behavior. According to Margaret Washington the black women had the proper training to look after their homes, but they were occupied working for white families and looking after white children and their families. As a result, their own children were deprived of proper care and were very much neglected. ==Alabama Federation of Colored Women's Club== Margaret Murray Washington was the organizer and the first president of the Alabama Federation of Colored Women's Club, which was established on December 29, 1899. During the preliminary meeting of the club there were discussions of how to address the mounting reform problem; one of the pressing needs was to establish a reformatory for African American youths. The most extensive work of the club was in prison reform. The Federation was successful in getting young black prisoners released into the custody of its boys' school built at Mt. Meigs. Young lives were saved from prison by the supervision of Margaret Washington. This corrective school got less support from the state, as opposed to the white boys' reform school. The club members also supported the older prisoners with personal care and religious services. The state eventually assumed the responsibility for the boys' reformatory school and the club women started to raise funds to build homes for young girls at Mt. Meigs. Prison reform being a national issue, the national office of the NACW eventually joined the program. ==References== Category:African-American women's organizations Category:Women's clubs in the United States Category:History of women in Alabama Category:Women's organizations based in the United States ","title":"Alabama's Colored Women's Club"},{"id":"20385045","text":"The Republic of the Future: or, Socialism a Reality is a novella by the American writer Anna Bowman Dodd, first published in 1887.Anna Bowman Dodd, The Republic of the Future, or Socialism a Reality, New York, Cassell & Co., 1887. The book is a dystopia written in response to the utopian literature that was a dramatic and noteworthy feature of the second half of the nineteenth century.Jean Pfaelzer, The Utopian Novel in America 1886-1896: The Politics of Form, Pittsburgh, University of Pittsburgh Press, 1984.Kenneth Roemer, The Obsolete Necessity, 1888-1900, Kent, OH, Kent State University Press, 1976. ==Dystopias== The utopian literature of Dodd's generation consisted both of famous works and others now largely forgotten, like Laurence Gronlund's popular The Cooperative Commonwealth (1884). Dodd's book was one element in a conservative reaction to this literature.Pfaelzer, pp. 78-81, 86-94, 170-3. Other examples of this reactive dystopian response are William Harben's The Land of the Changing Sun (1894) and Charles J. Bayne's The Fall of Utopia (1900). Coincidentally, Dodd's book was published a year before the appearance of Edward Bellamy's famous Looking Backward (1888), the great best- seller in its genre (which in turn provoked a spate of dystopian responses). ==Story and significance== Dodd casts her fiction in the form of an epistolary novel: Wolfgang, a Swedish aristocrat, writes letters home to his friend Hannevig while visiting New York Socialist City in the year 2050. In Dodd's fiction, Sweden retains a capitalist economy, so that Wolfgang can contrast the new utopian socialist regime in New York with the more familiar forms at home. Dodd takes satirical aim at various liberal developments of her era, including the first stirrings of the animal rights movement (the ASPCA had been founded in New York in 1866). Dodd has her hero journey from Sweden to New York via a sub-oceanic transport system (operated by the Pneumatic Tube Electric Company).Dodd, p. 8. As he goes, Wolfgang notes that aquatic life has resisted Dodd, p. 11. Dodd's primary targets, however, are the innovations that utopians of her age most strongly advocated, socialism, feminism, and technological progress.Pfaelzer, pp. 82-5. Dodd paints a picture of a future New York as a dreary conformist society, in which the inhabitants live in identical homes and men and women dress alike. Though people work only two hours per day, they live tedious, vacuous lives. Travel is forbidden, and mediocrity is enforced by law: \\"All scholars, authors, artists and scientists who were found on examination to be more gifted than the average, were exiled.\\"Dodd, p. 66. Children are raised in day care centers; romantic love has died out. Dodd's New Yorkers of 2050 \\"have the look of people who have come to the end of things and who have failed to find it amusing.\\"Dodd, p. 23. Since she is an anti-utopian writer, Dodd does not concentrate on the technological wonders anticipated and predicted by many utopian authors; but she does give her future New Yorkers automatic elevators and bedmaking devices and similar conveniences. Technology can make things worse instead of better: traditional food has been replaced by nutrition pills. In Dodd's vision of the future, a socialist revolution occurred around 1900; the center of the city was destroyed with explosives, and rebuilt to socialist standards. Thinker and writer Henry George is enshrined in a Temple of Liberators. ==Author== Anna Bowman Dodd, née Blake (1855-1929), was a native of New York City, the daughter of a merchant. She wrote a number of other works in her career, including a biography of Tallyrand and books on travel. Most pro-feminist books were written by women, and anti-feminist tracts by men -- though there were exceptions. Like Dodd, some women wrote in defense of traditional values, economic arrangements, and gender roles; and conversely, a few men, like Linn Boyd Porter (Speaking of Ellen, 1890) and William H. Bishop (The Garden of Eden, USA, 1895) were receptive to the feminist standpoint. ==See also== * Arqtiq * Caesar's Column * Mizora * New Amazonia * The Scarlet Empire * Unveiling a Parallel ==References * Category:Dystopian novels Category:1887 American novels Category:1887 science fiction novels Category:Cassell (publisher) books Category:Novels set in New York City Category:Novels set in the 21st century ","title":"The Republic of the Future"},{"id":"20385070","text":"The was a class of four DC electric locomotives operated by the private railway operator Seibu Railway in Japan between 1969 and 1996.

It is owned and operated by Station Casinos. Texas native Frank Fertitta Jr., the hotel-casino's original owner, chose the Texas theme to appeal to customers from his home state. Fertitta sold the hotel-casino for $95 million to Station Casinos, his former company, prior to its opening on July 12, 1995. It was the largest hotel-casino in North Las Vegas at the time of its opening, with a casino and a 200-room hotel. Texas Station has been expanded several times, including a $55 million expansion that began in 1998. The expansion added a food court, a child-care facility, and a parking garage, as well as additional movie theater screens and casino space. A $65 million expansion took place during 2000, and included the addition of a convention hall, a bowling alley, new restaurants, and two wedding chapels. ==History== The Texas Station, located on , was designed and built by Marnell Corrao Associates at a cost of $62.8 million. The hotel included 200 rooms in a six-story building. The resort was located at 2101 Texas Star Lane, near the intersection of North Rancho Drive and West Lake Mead Boulevard. Station Casinos' founder and former owner, Frank Fertitta Jr., owned the hotel-casino during construction but sold it to his former company for $95 million in June 1995, prior to the resort's opening. Although Station Casinos purchased the resort, Fertitta kept ownership of the land, which he purchased in June 1994. Fertitta had wanted the resort to appeal to customers from his home state of Texas, and he included various subtle references to Texas-Mexican history in the project's design. The resort's exterior was designed to resemble an 1890s government architectural style common in Texas, while the interior was designed to replicate the San Antonio River Walk. Texas Station opened on July 12, 1995, with a fireworks show and the presence of the Dallas Cowboys Cheerleaders. It was the largest hotel-casino to open in North Las Vegas. The casino included 1,600 slot machines, 35 table games, a race and sportsbook, and six bars. The resort also had six restaurants, including Laredo Cantina and Café, Stockyard Steak & Seafood House, Galveston Bay Seafood Co., and the 24-hour Yellow Rose Café. The resort also had the Italian restaurant San Lorenzo, and the Rio Grande Buffet, which included barbecue cuisine. The resort also included a movie theater, operated by Act III Theatres. In November 1995, the resort began a expansion, which was completed in February 1996. A parking garage was also completed in 1996. The Texas Station had initially been a poor financial performer for Station Casinos because of limited customers and casino play. However, revenues later increased following an extensive marketing campaign and the addition of the 600-space parking garage. In 1996, Texas Station adopted C.P. Squires Elementary, one of Clark's County oldest elementary schools, as its community partner. Texas Station set up many fund raising events for at-risk students including a \\"wishing well sweep\\" that takes all the coins from its fountains. The initial sweep netted $1,000 in coins and Texas Station committed to donating all future proceeds to the school to help fund a computer lab. Future boxer Floyd Mayweather Jr. fought his first fight at the Texas Station on October 11, 1996. A nightclub, Texas Late Nite, opened that month, between the casino's bingo hall and poker room. In January 1997, the Las Vegas Advisor ranked the Texas Station's buffet among the top buffets in Las Vegas. ===1998 expansion=== A potential $40 million expansion was under consideration in December 1997, and was contingent on Station Casinos' success in transforming its corporate structure into a real estate investment trust. At the time, the casino consisted of . In May 1998, plans were announced for a $51 million expansion that would include the addition of in casino space, for a new total of . Other additions would include six movie screens to the 12-screen movie theater; a Kids Quest child-care facility; a food court and expanded video game arcade; a bar and lounge; and a 2,000-space parking garage. The expansion was planned to help the resort better compete against the Fiesta hotel-casino across the street, as well as the nearby Santa Fe hotel-casino. The expansion project began in July 1998, and it ultimately cost $55 million. The Texas Station remained open during the expansion, which nearly doubled the resort's size with the addition of nearly , for a new total of . Tri Star Team Builders was contracted for $38 million to handle the new construction work. As a joint venture, Tri Star Team Builders and PCL Construction worked together on the expansion. The movie theater, then operated by Regal Cinemas, closed temporarily in January 1999 because of the expansion. Construction operated on a continuous 24-hour schedule in the days leading up to the expansion's planned opening. The new areas opened on February 9, 1999, along with the reopening of the movie theater, while the six new movie screens were scheduled to open later in the month. The expansion added of casino space and 850 new slot, video poker and keno machines. The race and sportsbook was also redesigned. Also added was the Martini Ranch, a 24-hour southwestern-themed cocktail lounge located in the center of the casino, with seating for 70 people. The expansion also featured an food court with seven eateries that included Krispy Kreme. Also built was the Kids Quest child-care facility. A parking garage with 2,900 spaces was built on the property's north side, at the southeast corner of West Lake Mead Boulevard and North Rancho Drive. The garage was added to deal with common customer complaints about inadequate parking, and the garage's location was chosen because of its proximity to a busy intersection. In 1999, resort officials planned to plant a time capsule on the property, at a cost of more than $10,000. The capsule included items from North Las Vegas mayor Mike Montandon, Las Vegas mayor Jan Jones, and Nevada governor Kenny Guinn. The capsule was expected to be planted in January 2000, to mark the new millennium, with the intention to have it unburied in the year 3000. ===2000 expansion=== In November 1999, the North Las Vegas Planning Commission approved plans for another expansion that would add to the resort, including an additional of casino space. At the time, the casino had 2,800 slot machines and 40 table games. Other additions included a 60-lane bowling alley, as well as meeting and ballroom space, and a 600-space employee parking garage. In January 2000, Station Casinos announced that the expansion would cost $55 million, with construction expected to begin by March and conclude in early 2001. The expansion was expected to include 350 additional slot machines. The expansion plans had been undergoing refinements for a year up to the time of the announcement. In March 2000, plans were announced for the addition of two wedding chapels to the resort, making the Texas Station the first Las Vegas locals hotel to include a chapel. Up to that time, the resort had received between 40 and 60 wedding requests each day from interested people. Each chapel would be , and they were to be built beside each other, with the option to combine the two for large weddings containing up to 220 guests. Between 80 and 120 weddings were expected to take place each month. The chapels were announced as part of the resort's ongoing expansion. On April 27, 2000, The Venetian and Texas Station were the first casinos to announce child-care centers specifically aimed at employees of Las Vegas casinos. The Texas Station's child-care center was expected to open in June 2000. The resort's makeshift outdoor concert stage, known as South Padre, was removed to make room for the expansion. The South Padre had the capacity for 3,000 people, but it impacted the comfort of some hotel guests because of its proximity to the hotel building. Added to the resort was the Dallas Events Center, a convention hall which also included seating for up to 1,800 people for concerts and boxing matches. The resort's expansion project ultimately cost $65 million, and was completed in late 2000. The expansion included two new restaurants. Austins Steakhouse opened at the resort in November 2000, replacing the Stockyard restaurant. Austins included a modern Italian design, and each element of the restaurant was inspired by artists including Henri Matisse and Frank Lloyd Wright. The Las Vegas Review-Journal gave Austins an \\"A\\" rating. Adjacent to Austins was the 26-seat A Bar lounge, and the resort also featured the Texas Star Oyster Bar. The resort's bowling alley opened in December 2000, and accounted for $15 million to $18 million of the $65 million expansion. The resort also introduced its Club Rev concept, in which the bowling alley was turned into a bowling disco two nights a week, with a disc jockey, a light show, and go-go dancers. The wedding chapel also opened in December 2000, and the Texas Station invited more than 250 married couples to renew their vows there to celebrate the opening. ===Incidents=== Shootings In 1996, two men shot at security guards in the casino parking lot; there were no injuries. In 1998, near the valet parking lot, a man was injured when another man opened fire on him and three other people. In December 1999, a man was robbed and shot in the parking garage, and he subsequently sued the resort and Station Casinos for alleged inadequate security. In 2001, a murder suspect was shot at by a SWAT officer while fleeing the parking garage. Another shooting, believed to be gang-related, occurred at the Texas Station in January 2005, and it led to an increased police presence at the resort for the following weekend, as well as additional security guards and ushers at the resort's movie theater. In 2010, a woman suffered a non-life-threatening gunshot wound during an attempted armed robbery in the resort's northwest parking lot. ===Later years=== In 2004, the Texas Station's sign on North Rancho Drive was replaced with an energy efficient version of equal size. As of 2015, the Texas Station donates the coins from its wishing well to financially troubled schools in the Clark County School District. As of 2017, the casino is . That year, Station Casinos purchased the Texas Station land as a long-term cost-saving measure. In March 2018, a renovation of the Regal Cinemas movie theater began, with completion scheduled for early May. The renovation would add larger seating, and a new bar and concession area on the second floor of the theater. The renovation was expected to cost at least $1.7 million. ==Gallery== File:EM TEXAS STATION (2761407159).jpgTexas Station in 2008 File:Texas Station sign.jpgTexas Station sign on North Rancho Drive (2010) ==References * Category:1995 establishments in Nevada Category:Casinos completed in 1995 Category:Buildings and structures in North Las Vegas, Nevada Category:Casino hotels Category:Casinos in the Las Vegas Valley Category:Hotel buildings completed in 1995 Category:Hotels established in 1995 Category:Resorts in the Las Vegas Valley Category:Skyscraper hotels in the Las Vegas Valley Category:Station Casinos ","title":"Texas Station"},{"id":"20385180","text":"Yannick Kergoat is a film editor.

In Indiana, it is a state road that enters the state at the Ohio state line between Willshire, Ohio, and Pleasant Mills, Indiana. The of US 33 that lie within Indiana serve as a major conduit. All of the highway is listed on the National Highway System. Various sections are rural two-lane highway, urbanized four-lane divided expressway and the Lincoln Highway. The northernmost community along the highway is Elkhart. The highway ends at an interchange in southern Elkhart after serving the northeastern region of Indiana. US 33 passes through farm fields and urban areas. US 33 was first designated as a U.S. Highway in 1937. A section of the highway originally served as part of the Lincoln Highway, a connection between Fort Wayne and South Bend. US 41 replaced some the original State Road 2 (SR 2) designation of the highway which dated back to the formation of the Indiana State Road system. SR 2 ran from Illinois state line through South Bend to Elkhart and ended at the Ohio state line. Realignments and construction projects have expanded the highway to four lanes. ==Route description== US 33 enters Indiana from Ohio heading northwest towards Decatur, as a rural two-lane highway, passing through farmland with a few houses. Along the way passing through a short concurrency with State Road 101 (SR 101), in Pleasant Mills. The highway enters Decatur by curving due west. The road begins a concurrency with US 27, heading due north as a four-lane highway with a center turn lane. The concurrency passes through mostly commercial before heading into downtown Decatur. In downtown Decatur the two routes have an intersection with US 224, this is the southern end of the US 224 concurrency. The three routes head north having an intersection at the northern end of the US 224 concurrency, US 224 turns due west. After the concurrency with US 224, US 27 and US 33 head north and then northwest towards Fort Wayne and the road becomes a four-lane divided highway. On the south side of Fort Wayne is a diamond interchange with Interstate 469 (I-469), this interchange is the north end of the concurrency with US 27. US 33 heads west on I-469, which is concurrent with US 24\\\\. All three routes have an interchange with the northern terminus of the southern section of SR 1; this interchange has access to the Fort Wayne International Airport. After the interchange at SR 1, the interstate passes south of the airport. West of the airport is the terminus of I-469, both US 24 and US 33 turns north onto I-69, passing through rural areas with farmland as a four- lane interstate. Then, the interstate has an interchange with Airport Expressway/Lower Huntington Road. North of the Airport Expressway interchange, the roadway becomes a six-lane interstate, passing through urban areas with a mix of commercial and industrial properties. The highway enters the southwest side of Fort Wayne and US 24 leaves the concurrency, heading southwest. After the interchange with US 24, the interstate has an interchange with the eastern terminus SR 14, on the west side of Fort Wayne. After the interchange with SR 14, the highway turn northeast curving around Fort Wayne. On the northwest side of Fort Wayne, US 33 leaves I-69 heading northwest concurrent with US 30\\\\. The concurrency is a six-lane expressway, passing through woodlands with some commercial properties. Shortly after the concurrency with US 30 begins, it ends, with US 33 heading north and US 30 heading west. The highway becomes a four-lane highway with a center turn lane as it begins to leave Fort Wayne, passing through a mix of commercial and residential areas. US 33 South of SR 9 The roadway leaves Fort Wayne heading northwest as a two-lane mainly rural highway, passing through farmland with some woods. In Churubusco, the route has a traffic light with SR 205\\\\. Then the road heads towards Ligonier, passing through a four-stop intersection with SR 9 in Merriam. Then in Wolf Lake the road has an intersection with SR 109 at the main intersection in town. Then south of Ligonier the road passes through Kimmell and the route begins a concurrency with SR 5\\\\. The concurrency with SR 5 ends at the intersection with US 6 in Ligonier. Both US 6 and US 33 head west away from Ligonier as a two-lane highway passing through farmland with some houses, for . Then US 33 turns north, now concurrent with SR 13, the concurrency with SR 13 last for , with SR 13 turning east and US 33 turning northwest. Now the road heads towards Goshen passing through Benton on the way. The road enters Goshen on the southeast side of the city as a two-lane highway with a center turn lane, passing commercial properties. As the road gets closer to downtown Goshen the road narrows to a two-lane street without turn lanes and passes Goshen High School. After the high school the road has a traffic light with the old alignment of US 33, before curving northwest and parallel to the Norfolk Southern Chicago Line. While parallel to the rail tracks US 33 is a limited access roadway and passes over another rail track. The road and rail tacks separate as they enter downtown Goshen. US 33 enters downtown Goshen on Pike Street as a four-lane city street and has a traffic light at SR 15. The route leaves downtown Goshen as a four-lane undivided highway, passing through a commercial district and residential area. After crossing the Elkhart River the highway widens to a four-lane highway with a center turn lane. The route heads towards Elkhart, paralleling the Norfolk Southern railroad and passing through Midway and Dunlap. On the south side of Elkhart, US 33 has an interchange with US 20; this interchange is the northern terminus for US 33. The entire length of US 33 in Indiana is included as a part of the National Highway System (NHS). The NHS is a network of highways that are identified as being most important for the economy, mobility and defense of the nation. The highway is maintained by the Indiana Department of Transportation (INDOT) like all other U.S. Highways in the state. The department tracks the traffic volumes along all state highways as a part of its maintenance responsibilities using a metric called average annual daily traffic (AADT). This measurement is a calculation of the traffic level along a segment of roadway for any average day of the year. In 2010, INDOT figured that lowest traffic levels were 3,290 vehicles and 650 commercial vehicles used the highway daily at the Noble- Whitley County area. The peak traffic volumes were 79,520 vehicles and 11,060 commercial vehicles AADT along the section of US 33 at is concurrent with I-69, between the SR 14 and US 30 exits in Fort Wayne. ==History== The Old Lincoln Highway (also old US 33) on the south side of Ligonier The Lincoln Highway was planned from Illinois state line to South Bend to Fort Wayne and the Ohio state line in 1913. In 1915, the highway opened and passed through downtown Fort Wayne on its route through Indiana. In 1917, Main Market route number 2 was the given number to the Lincoln Highway in Indiana. In the early 1920s, the Lincoln Highway was moved farther south between Valparaiso and Fort Wayne, to what is now known mostly as Old US 30, passing through Plymouth and Warsaw. The route became SR 2 from Ohio state line to South Bend, SR 1 from South Bend to Michigan state line. Then in 1924, the sections of the road that was part of the original Lincoln Highway was paved. The next few years the rest of the route was paved across Indiana, then in 1937 US 33 was created. In 1998, INDOT rerouted most of its maintained routes onto interstate highways around Fort Wayne, so US 33 was routed onto I-469 and I-69 around the south side of the city. In the same year, INDOT removed US 33 north of US 20 and the St. Joseph County portion became SR 933. In 2004, INDOT tried to return SR 933 to the local communities but they did not accept. In 2018 a new alignment of US 33 bypassing downtown Goshen to the northeast opened. ==Major intersectionsSee also== * ==References *Indiana Highway Ends: US 33 33 Category:Transportation in Fort Wayne, Indiana Category:Transportation in Elkhart, Indiana Category:Transportation in Adams County, Indiana Category:Transportation in Allen County, Indiana Category:Transportation in Whitley County, Indiana Category:Transportation in Noble County, Indiana Category:Transportation in Elkhart County, Indiana U.S. Route 033 in Indiana ","title":"U.S. Route 33 in Indiana"},{"id":"20385212","text":"Woodblock diptych by Hirosada II of kabuki actors Jitsukawa Enzaburô I (left) and Mimasu Daigorô IV (right), 1853 Hirosada II, also known as Sadahiro II, was a designer of ukiyo-e Japanese woodblock prints in Osaka.

Frank. It describes changes in purchasing and consumption behaviour which ripple through the levels of income in response to changes in income inequality. ==Example== During the late 1900s and early 2000s, income inequality in the United States rose dramatically, and expenditure cascades occurred. During the 1980s, the income-tax structure was altered to favor top earners in regards to after-tax purchasing power. ==Positional externalities== Expenditure cascades employ positional externalities, which may be inter-related differently from other types of externalities. When a new purchase changes the context within which an existing positional good is evaluated, a positional externality occurs. In situations where a good is upgraded and becomes a popular item to own, that good becomes a positional externality. It has changed the context within which that good exists. Positional Externalities also have an effect on an individual’s happiness. When a person focuses on the haves and have-nots of those around him, he realizes the items that he does not own relative to the others in his class system. This realization leads to increased unhappiness about his position in life in terms of items owned. Robert H. Frank cites an experiment that shows people choose a world in which they own a larger home than everyone else, over having larger homes for everyone yet a smaller home than his neighbors. Frank concludes that people will give up absolute consumption in order to obtain a better relative position. Expenditure cascades are triggered by consumption, especially conspicuous consumption, which are known as \\"consumption cascades\\". The consumption by the wealthy triggers increased spending in the class directly below them, and the chain continues down to the bottom of the income ladder. This is a dangerous reaction for those at the bottom who have little disposable income originally, and even less after they attempt to keep up with others' spending habits. This is an example of the social phenomenon \\"keeping up with the Joneses\\". ==Possible solutions to the problem of positional externalities== Frank suggests that a progressive income tax or a progressive consumption tax could remedy the dilemma posed by positional externalities. By increasing the progressivity of the current tax structure, the wealthy would pay a larger share of taxes. Simultaneously, the poor and middle class would pay taxes that would be more equitable to their income. A result would be an equal playing field for all the classes. Frank uses the housing market as an example. He states that people at the top should save their earnings and spend less on housing. In turn, their savings would alter the context that influences housing expenditures of people directly below top earners. This would result in a reverse expenditure cascade that would encourage higher savings. The fact that Americans had a negative savings rate in 2005, further proves the need for incentives to save money rather than increasing relative spending. The key to creating a genuine impact on spending and saving habits is the collective effort of everyone invested in the economy to cut back on spending. Should a deficit continue, the poor and middle classes will suffer disproportionately to the top earners. ==References== Category:Income distribution Category:Economic inequality Category:Expenditure ","title":"Expenditure cascades"},{"id":"20385260","text":"The Class E31 is a class of DC Bo-Bo wheel arrangement electric locomotives formerly operated by the private railway operator Seibu Railway in Japan until March 2010 and subsequently by the Ōigawa Railway.

The Link Union had provided its services in numerous locations around the university but 1980–82 Union House (Building 8) was built. It was opened in 1982 by Victorian Premier John Cain and the President of the RMIT Student Union. Later Union House was given extra floors and academic departments were added into the building and RMIT Union moved some services in to the neighbouring Building 28. RMIT Union eventually expanded into the Bundoora and Brunswick Campuses delivering services equal to those on the City Campus. Following Voluntary Student Unionism legislation that took effect in July 2006 significant funding was lost by RMIT Link causing staffwide redundancies.

When Daffy jeers at the bull, the horned beast removes the clothes from the human matador and puts them on Daffy as a challenge to the duck to fight the bull in the ring. Daffy foils the bull with a proposed wager on a hat trick, betting the bull to guess which of three sombreros Daffy is hiding under. Daffy sees to it that the bull guesses wrong and supplies a machine gun for the impoverished bull to commit suicide. The bull realizes that he is being fooled and, firing the machine gun, chases Daffy out of the bullfight ring. Daffy scrambles to his car to leave Mexico, thinking he has escaped the belligerent bull.

Their teachings were described as a mixture of mysticism, Christianity, and the practice of Kriya Yoga. The group also incorporated Hopi symbolism into their ceremonies. The group met in a trailer in Santa Barbara to practice meditation. When they outgrew that location, they moved to an old ice cream factory. Paulsen's book, Life, Love, God: Story of a Soul Traveler, explains his concept of Self-realization, his idea that at the core of every human being is a pure Self, a consciousness of Christ, and the realization of this Self is attained through the practice of meditation. Andre, Lisa, \\"Sunburst Sanctuary: \\"The Central Coast Retreat,\\" The Lompoc Vision In 1971, Sunburst bought 150 acres north of Santa Barbara on Gibralter Road. There they began raising organic vegetables, the enterprise that would become their main source of revenue through the years. They operated a small café called Farmer and the Fisherman, a juice factory, a bakery, and a wholesale warehouse from which they shipped organic food all over the country. Spaulding, Allie Kay (October 12, 2008), \\"There's a Lot of Life in Them Thar Hills,\\" Lompoc Record Also In 1971, the group bought the Ogilvy Ranch approximately north of Santa Barbara and renamed it Lemuria. At one time, the Lemuria property grew wheat, corn, and vegetables. Sunburst members planted orchards and vineyards and used Percheron horses to pull their plows. Goats provided milk and cheese; bee hives provided honey. Lemuria even had a blacksmith and a school for members’ children. In 1974, the Los Angeles Times published a feature article about the founder and his organic farming business. The Times said the following about the community, the office, a converted ice cream factory, is headquarters for a unique brotherhood and business that includes four ranches, three organic food markets, a bakery, two restaurants, a trucking service, and a sailing vessel being restored at San Pedro.

For a period of time, the newspaper's reporters were banned from attending school board and fiscal court meetings. Their efforts to ensure that they could attend and keep those meetings available to the public and press led to passage of Kentucky's open meeting and open records legislation. An August 1974 firebombing destroyed $17,000 worth of the newspaper's equipment, doing only light structural damage to its facility, yet the local police department placed a condemnation order on the building.King, Wayne. \\"An Eagle That Just Won't Stop Screaming; A Graceful Balance\\", The New York Times, August 25, 1974.

Gish said that he had discovered that a coal company had funded the money to pay for the arson. The paper was published the next week, this time with the motto \\"It Still Screams\\". After several years of publishing under the masthead of \\"It Still Screams\\", the Mountain Eagle returned to its motto of \\"It Screams\\", which still remains in use. The Mountain Eagle has a long and distinguished history of speaking out for coal mine safety and protecting the land and people of eastern Kentucky from the ravages of strip mining. ==Honors== The Kentucky -based Institute for Rural Journalism and Community Issues created the Tom and Pat Gish Award in 2005 to recognize rural journalists who \\"demonstrate courage, tenacity and integrity.\\" The Gishes were honored by the Society of Professional Journalists with the Helen Thomas Lifetime Achievement Award in 2002.

A ram provides the force; it may be square or round. The ram is usually driven by a rack and pinion setup, to improve the mechanical advantage. Higher force arbor presses have another gear reduction.

She was an early supporter of many radical feminist issues, primarily sex education in schools, women's suffrage, and divorce. She was one of the first feminists to state that Catholicism in Mexico was thwarting feminist efforts, and was the first woman to run for elected office in Mexico. ==Early life== Hermila Galindo Acosta was born in Villa Lerdo, Durango, on 2 June 1886 to Rosario Galindo and Hermila Acosta. She began her education in Villa Lerdo and then attended an Industrial School in Chihuahua learning accounting, shorthand, telegraphy, typing, as well as English and Spanish. At the age of 13, she returned home and gave private lessons in shorthand and typing to children. In 1911, she moved to Mexico City. ==Biography== Arriving in Mexico City, Galindo joined a liberal club and became a public supporter of Venustiano Carranza, lobbying against Porfirio Díaz. She was discovered by Venustiano Carranza while giving a speech to welcome him upon his return to the capital. He then offered her the opportunity to work with him in Veracruz. She became his private secretary and continued rallying support for the rights of Mexican women and liberal ideologies. Carranza supported her efforts, permitting her to distribute feminist propaganda in the southern Mexican states of Tabasco, Campeche, and Yucatán, and in the traditionally liberal state of Veracruz, as well as Carranza's home state of Coahuila, and San Luis Potosí and Nuevo León.Ward M. Morton, Woman Suffrage in Mexico. Gainesville: University of Florida Press 1962, p. 3. Carranza also appointed her as his representative in Cuba and Colombia, to publicize his policies in surrounding Latin America. Hermila Galindo, undated photo In 1915, she created a magazine called La Mujer Moderna (\\"The Modern Woman\\"). Along with essays discussing feminist ideas, it served as propaganda to support Carranza. Almost all of her works helped the political campaign of Carranza in some way. The magazine also featured articles which expressed her disapproval of the Catholic Church and its methods of control. She was one of the first feminists to speak out about the church and its view of women. Galindo collaborated with many other journalists and feminists, with the majority of these women being from Spain who were fighting for the same issues as Galindo. The most famous women that stand out from her magazine and articles are María Luisa de la Torre de Otero, Clarisa P. de Torres, Julia D. Febles Cantón Vda. de Palomeque, Micaela Rosado de P., Bolivia M. de Rivas, Rosario Rivas Hernández, María Pacheco, Artemisa N. Sanz Royo, and Luz Calva. Although this was a feminist magazine, she still included male journalists in her works. She eventually wrote Carranza's biography in addition to at least five other books. One of her books, Un presidenciable: el general Don Pablo Gonzalez, was written about the general Pablo González Garza who was a general during the Mexican Revolution under President Carranza. Her support for Carranza was incredibly obvious because out of all her works were related to him; even the feminist magazine. At the time her views of sex education and women's sexuality were considered to be extremely radical. Her approach seeking equality and women's rights were seen as controversial. During the Feminist Congress of 1916, which Galindo did not attend, César González, an education administrator for Carranza, read a statement in which Galindo attacked the male double standard in Mexico. After these statements were read, conservative women's groups went on the defensive and came back with a statement which supported the traditional role of women and opposed women's education. Carranza allowed Galindo to submit a proposal for women's equality to the Constituent Congress of 1917, but the item was stricken from the final agenda. Her strong support for Carranza was evident in her writings, which expressed her faith in him and his potential to create a social revolution. Through him she believed that women could get the vote and that there was hope for social reform. In the end, Carranza failed to create the change he promised. Instead, because of corruption, he was seen as an enemy of the Revolution, which left Galindo disillusioned. On 2 March 1917, she took matters into her own hands and filed as a candidate for Deputy of 5th constituency of Mexico City. Gabriela Cano, historian, reported that \\"it was the first time that, in Mexico, a woman contended as an electoral choice\\". Though some records show Galindo won a majority of the votes, the Electoral College rejected her results, claiming that they were only complying with the law forbidding women. She accepted the rejection but made it clear that her purpose had been to show publicly that women could be elected and should be allowed to hold public office. In 1923, Galindo attended a Feminist Congress in the State of Tabasco and organized several revolutionary clubs in Campeche, Tabasco, Veracruz, and Yucatán. She married later that year and ended her political involvement. She died 18 August 1954 in Mexico City. ==Tribute== On 2 June 2018, Galindo was honored by a Google Doodle in Mexico, on her 132nd birthday. ==Selected works== *La Mujer moderna (1915–1919) (in Spanish) *Estudio de la Srita.

Bane earned a bachelor's degree (Phi Beta Kappa) from the University of Chicago in 1935 and was elected a Rhodes Scholar. At Oxford, he befriended fellow Rhodes Scholar and future novelist Robert Penn Warren. Bane later served on The Rhodes Scholar Selection Committee. He earned a bachelor's degree in jurisprudence from the University of Oxford in 1937 and he earned a law degree from Harvard Law School in 1938. == Professional career == Bane worked as an attorney for the law firm of Sullivan & Cromwell from 1938 until 1942 and from 1946 until 1949. From 1942 until 1943, Bane was an attorney with the U.S. Office of Lend-Lease Administration, and he was on active duty with the United States Navy as an intelligence officer with OSS, stationed in London, from July 1943 until February 1946. OSS personnel were instrumental in convincing the enemy that D-day forces would land at a beach-head other than Normandy. From 1949 until 1952, Bane was a partner with the law firm of Mitchell, Conway and Bane in Chicago. In the early 1950s, Bane also worked as the lawyer representing the Chicago City Council's Crime Investigating Committee, which focused on organized crime. He quickly concluded that the crime syndicate had corrupted Chicago's Police Department. He later resigned from his post when the Chicago City Council refused to force police officers to disclose sources of income. As a result of his crime -fighting career, he was asked by prominent Chicago Republicans to run for mayor. He declined. Bane became a partner in the Chicago law firm of Isham Lincoln and Beale in 1953. The firm was founded by the surviving son of Abraham Lincoln, Robert Todd Lincoln. The younger Lincoln used a letter of recommendation from Thomas Edison to obtain the firm's first client, Commonwealth Edison. Bane served on the Advisory Board of The Lincoln Legal Papers Project, a mammoth effort that resulted in the collection of more than 5,000 documents relating to Abraham Lincoln's legal practice. Bane also played a major role in the findings of the National Advisory Committee On Civil Disorder, or Kerner Commission, established by President Lyndon Johnson in the wake of 1967 national race riots, and chaired by Illinois governor Otto Kerner Jr. The Commission was established by Johnson to reportedly find conspiracies aimed at violence within Black communities. Bane chaired the concurrent Citizen's Committee To Study Police Relations (in Chicago). The Committee called 47 witnesses which produced 1,900 pages of transcript. When the Kerner Report, issued February 28, 1968, declared famously that \\"our nation is moving towards two societies, one Black, one White-separate and unequal\\", and that race riots could be traced to inadequate employment opportunities and substandard housing, Johnson was enraged. Bane also served as Editor of the Chicago Bar Record, Chairman of the American Bar Association Journal, and authored \\"The Electrical Equipment Conspiracies:The Treble Damage Actions\\" (1973), a groundbreaking legal text. He also served as President of The Chicago Council On Foreign Relations.He served two years as Co-Chairman of The Lawyers Committee For Civil Rights under President Jimmy Carter. Following retirement to Florida, he was Visiting Professor Of Law at the University of Miami School Of Law and planned to begin a legal biography of Abraham Lincoln. Each year the Charles A. Bane Humanitarian Award is presented to a volunteer by the United Way Of Illinois. == Failed nomination to the Seventh Circuit == On May 28, 1969, President Richard Nixon nominated Bane to a seat on the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit to replace Elmer Jacob Schnackenberg, who had died in September 1968. Immediately, Bane's nomination ran into trouble for three reasons. First, Bane had litigation pending on his 1963 tax return because of his attempt to deduct $16,000 for business and entertainment expenses. Deputy Attorney General Richard Kleindienst had asked Bane to attempt a settlement with the Internal Revenue Service, and although Bane had tried unsuccessfully to reach a settlement. With the IRS declining to back down from its position, Bane told the White House he would prefer to litigate the case. In addition, Bane had been alleged to have been anti- semitic because he allowed a Jewish family to be rejected for an apartment by the board of his cooperative apartment building at 209 E. Lake Shore Drive in Chicago. Finally, Bane, in a letter he sent to the president on June 30, 1969 requesting that his nomination be withdrawn, cited \\"pressing commitments\\" in his law firm and a growing need for him to remain there. On October 22, 1969, Nixon formally withdrew Bane's nomination. On September 22, 1970, Nixon nominated John Paul Stevens to the seat to which he had nominated Bane. Stevens was confirmed by the United States Senate on October 8, 1970, and Stevens eventually went on to a seat on the Supreme Court of the United States. Bane was the only federal appeals-court nominee of Nixon's entire presidency who was never confirmed. (Two of Nixon's Supreme Court nominees, Clement Haynsworth and G. Harrold Carswell, both were rejected outright by the United States Senate in votes.) == Death == Bane died in West Palm Beach, Florida on April 5, 1998.http://magazine.uchicago.edu/9808/html/deaths.html == References == Category:1913 births Category:1998 deaths Category:Illinois lawyers Category:University of Chicago alumni Category:American Rhodes Scholars Category:Harvard Law School alumni Category:Lawyers from Chicago Category:People from Springfield, Illinois Category:20th-century American lawyers Category:Sullivan & Cromwell people ","title":"Charles A.

A few cases of human infestation have also been reported. Though it is sometimes called a \\"lungworm\\", this term usually refers to other species of nematodes. Infestation by C. aerophila is referred to as \\"pulmonary capillariasis\\" (occasionally spelled \\"capillariosis), \\"bronchial capillariasis,\\" or (rarely) \\"thominxosis.\\" This parasite has a direct life cycle, meaning that the life cycle can be completed in a single host. C. aerophila usually causes only minor clinical symptoms, such as irritation of the respiratory tract and coughing. However, secondary bacterial infections of the respiratory tract, including pneumonia, may develop in heavy infestations. Treatment with anthelmintics, such as levamisole or fenbendazole, is usually sufficient to cure C. aerophila infestations. ==Taxonomy and description== This species was originally described in 1839, from specimens found in the trachea of a wolf, and named Trichosoma aerophila.Cross, J.H.

It was transferred to the genus Eucoleus (as Eucoleus aerophilus) by Dujardin in 1845, and to the genus Capillaria (as Capillaria aerophila) in 1911, and is sometimes referred to as Thominx aerophilum. The changes to the end of the species name in each genus, whether it ends with \\"-a\\", \\"-us\\" or \\"-um\\", are necessary to adhere to the rules of Latin grammar. Males generally range from 15–25 mm long, with a maximum width of 62 µm, while females are 18–32 mm long with a maximum width of 105 µm. Some sources report that they are larger when they occur in the nasal sinuses.Banzon, T. (1982) \\"Capillariasis\\". In: M.G. Schultz (ed) Handbook Series in Parasitic Zoonoses, Section C. Parasitic Zoonoses, Volume II. CRC Press: Boca Raton, FL. , pp. 63-65. ==Hosts and distribution== Capillaria aerophila has been found on every continent, and occurs in dogs, cats, and a wide range of wild mammals. The following species have been reported as hosts: * American marten (Martes americana) in North America * American black bear (Ursus americanus) in North America * Arctic fox (Alopex lagopus) in Iceland * Badger (Taxidea taxus) in North America * Beech marten (or stone marten; Martes foina) in Europe * Bobcat (Lynx rufus) in North America * Brown bear (Ursus arctos caucasicus) in Russia * Cat (Felis catus) in Asia, Australia, Europe, New Zealand, North America, and South America * Coyote (Canis latrans) in North America * Crab- eating fox (Cerdocyon thous) in South America * Dog (Canis lupus familiaris) in Asia, Europe, North America, South America * Egyptian mongoose (Herpestes ichneumon) in Europe (Republic of Buryatia) * Eurasian lynx (Lynx lynx) in Europe * European pine marten (Martes martes) in Europe * European polecat (Mustela putorius) in Europe * Florida panther (Puma concolor coryi) in North America * Golden jackal (Canis aureus) in Azerbaijan * Gray fox (Urocyon cinereoargenteus) in North America * Gray wolf (Canis lupus) in Europe * Hedgehog (Erinaceus sp.) in Europe, New Zealand * Human (Homo sapiens) only a few cases reported in Europe, Iran and Morocco * Iberian lynx (Lynx pardinus) in Europe * Iriomote cat (Prionailurus iriomotensis) in Japan * Japanese marten (Martes melampus) in Japan * Kit fox (Vulpes macrotis) in North America * Leopard cat (Prionailurus bengalensis euptailurus) in Japan * Opossum (Didelphis virginiana) in North America * Raccoon (Procyon lotor) in North America * Raccoon dog (Nyctereutes procyonoides) in Europe and Japan * Red fox (Vulpes vulpes) in Europe and North America * Sable (Martes zibellina) in Buryatia (Asia) * Wildcat (Felis silvestris) in Europe ==Life cycle== Capillaria aerophila has a direct life cycle, meaning that it can be completed in one host. The adults lay eggs in the lungs. The eggs are coughed up and swallowed by the host; and are then passed in the feces. In about 5–7 weeks, the larvae develop into the infective stage within the egg envelope in the soil. The infective larvae remain viable for up to 1 year. When a suitable host eats these mature eggs, the larvae hatch in the intestines and migrate to the lungs. They mature into adults about 40 days post-infection. Earthworms may act as intermediate hosts, by eating the C. aerophila eggs and infecting mammalian hosts when eaten by the mammals. However, the involvement of the earthworms is not necessary for the completion of the C. aerophila life cycle. ==Prevalence== Reported infestation rates in dogs and cats which are kept as pets in Europe and North America are generally less than 10%. In wildlife, rates as high as 74% and 88% have been reported for wild foxes. ==Clinical symptoms== Most cases of Capillaria aerophila infestation in dogs and cats are without serious clinical symptoms. Heavy infestations may result in inflammation of the respiratory tract (rhinitis, tracheitis or bronchitis), or secondary bacterial infections of the respiratory tract, including bronchopneumonia. These developments are usually characterized by a whistling sound when the animal breathes, frequent sneezing, or a deep, wheezing cough. In humans, symptoms include coughing, fever, bronchitis, dyspnea (shortness of breath), blood in the saliva, and elevated levels of eosinophils in the blood (eosinophilia). Most reports of C. aerophila in wildlife are simply parasite field surveys, and do not mention specific symptoms. However, the involvement of C. aerophila infestation and pneumonia, in addition to other parasites, in the death of an opossum has been reported. ==Diagnosis, treatment and prevention== Infestation is easily diagnosed by the presence of C. aerophila eggs in the nasal or tracheal lavage, or the feces of infested animals. Standard anthelmintics, such as ivermectin or fenbendazole, are recommended for treatment of dogs. Humans infested with C. aerophila have been successfully treated with albendazole and mebendazole. For animals kept in outdoor pens, proper drainage and allowing sunlight to hit the floor of the pen have been suggested to minimize the spread of infestation.Soulsby, E.J.

It premièred at the National Theatre in London on 4 November 2008. The work opens with a reflection on the sway religious books hold over their adherents, but it soon establishes itself as a political piece dramatising the methods used by the governing Labour Party in Britain to raise party funds. Using lapses in the personal and public lives of the characters, often easily recognisable as incidents drawn from the lives of real politicians recently departed from office, the play illuminates the cynicism and expediency of a political party too long unchallenged in power. The title Gethsemane refers to the life-changing decision by the character \\"Lori\\" to give up teaching and become a busker. Only later in the play, as other less idealistic characters avoid their own \\"Gethsemane moments\\", is it explained to her that in the Garden of Gethsemane Christ's decision was to stick with the plan and not to take the easy path. ==References== Category:2008 plays Category:Plays by David Hare Category:British plays Category:Plays set in England ","title":"Gethsemane (play)"},{"id":"20385712","text":"Mikki Padilla (born May 27, 1974) is an American actress, model, writer and author.

Pedro Lisperguer y Flores, the procurator general of Santiago, presented the ordinances to the town fathers of Santiago on December 11, 1620, and they were published in Concepción on February 14, 1621 by senior judge (oidor decano) and interim governor, Cristóbal de la Cerda y Sotomayor.

Stanford University Press, 1968. p110-114 ==Content of the ordinances== The new laws abolished compulsory personal service for all Indians except those over 18 years of age who had been captured in the war between 1608 and 1610. The slave labor system was replaced with forced tribute by the Indians to the Spanish. However, the total amount of work required of the Indians was reduced, and forced labor in mines was abolished, reflecting the transition from mine labor to agriculture in the colony. Tribute was based on the location of residence for Indians, with higher tributes required by those living in La Serena, Santiago, Chillán, and Concepcion, slightly less for those in Cuyo, while much less in the poor provinces of Chiloé. Wages were also set by region. The tasa also established a mit'a system requiring male members of an encomienda to serve as mitayos for a portion of the year during which they were required to serve the colonial government. ==References== Category:Captaincy General of Chile Category:Encomenderos Tasa de Esquilache Category:Mapuche Category:17th century in the Captaincy General of Chile Category:History of Chile ","title":"Tasa de Esquilache"},{"id":"20385788","text":"The Grove Hill Courthouse Square Historic District is a historic district in Grove Hill, Alabama.

Ferdinand became an Infante of Spain on 20 October 1905Gaceta de Madrid No. 295, 22/10/1905, p. 277. and renounced his rights to the throne of the Kingdom of Bavaria in 1914. == Early years == Prince Ferdinand María was born on 10 May 1884 at the Royal Palace of Madrid. His father was Prince Ludwig Ferdinand of Bavaria, son of Prince Adalbert of Bavaria and Infanta Amalia of Bourbon. His mother was Infanta María de la Paz of Bourbon, daughter of Queen Isabella II and King Francisco de Asís. Through both his parents, Prince Ferdinand María was a first cousin of King Alfonso XIII, who was two years younger than him. He was baptized at the Royal Palace of Madrid. In 1886, when he was two years old, his aunt the Queen Regent awarded him the Grand Cross of the Order of Charles III. Shortly after his birth, his parents moved to Bavaria, where his two siblings Adalbert and Pilar were born. Prince Ludwig Ferdinand was the only member of the Bavarian Royal Family who always remained on friendly terms with his cousin, King Ludwig II (with the exception of Elisabeth, Empress of Austria). When Ludwig II was arrested at Neuschwanstein Castle in 1886, he called Ludwig Ferdinand for help; the latter immediately intended to follow this call, but was prevented from leaving Nymphenburg Palace by his uncle Luitpold who was about to take over government as the ruling Prince Regent. From 1878 the family resided at Palais Ludwig Ferdinand, their town-house in Munich He attended the Bavarian War Academy (Bayerische Kriegsakademie), attaining the rank of Second Lieutenant of Heavy Cavalry in the Bavarian Army. Then, he returned to Spain. ==Marriage and naturalisation== On 20 October 1905, King Alfonso XIII announced the marriage between his elder sister Infanta María Teresa and Prince Ferdinand Maria. The announcement was gazetted in the Gazette of Madrid as follows: \\"For the sake of My Royal Family and of the Nation, after having heard My Council of Ministers, I shall give My Royal Consent to the contract of marriage between My Most Beloved and Most Dear Sister Infanta María Teresa and My Most Beloved Cousin Prince Ferdinand Maria of Bavaria and Bourbon. My Government will inform the Cortes this My Royal Resolution\\". That same day, Prince Ferdinand Maria naturalised and the king granted unto him the title and prerogative of Infante of Spain, by grace. He was also invested a Knight of the Order of the Golden Fleece and was granted the Collar and Grand Cross of the orders of Charles III and Isabella the Catholic, respectively. The wedding took place on 12 January 1906 at the Royal Palace of Madrid. Ferdinand and María Teresa had four children:. * Infante Luis Alfonso, Prince of Bavaria (6 December 1906 – 14 May 1983) *Infante Jose Eugenio, Prince of Bavaria (26 March 1909 – 16 August 1966), married Dona María de la Asunción Solange de Mesía y de Lesseps, Countess of Odiel in 1933, and had issue. *Infanta María de las Mercedes of Spain (3 October 1911 – 11 September 1953) married Georgian Prince Irakli Bagration of Mukhrani in 1946, and had issue. *Infanta María del Pilar, Princess of Bavaria (15 September 1912 – 9 May 1918) The couple settled down in Spain and moved into the newly built Cuesta de la Vega Palace in Madrid, which was their main residence. == Career == Infante Alfonso (right) in rayadillo breeches during the Rif War Prince Ferdinand María was incorporated into the Spanish Army with the rank of cavalry lieutenant in 1905. He was commissioned into the 20th Hussars of Pavia Regiment. On 23 June 1908, he was promoted to Commander and was commissioned into the 12th Lusitania Rifle Regiment. He was moved to Africa with his regiment and took part in the Rif War. This marriage and the granted royal rank in Spain meant that Ferdinand (also known as Infante don Fernando María de Baviera y de Borbón), the third-generation Spanish-Bavarian, committed himself to Spain. His second marriage with a Spanish noblewoman changed nothing in that respect. Ferdinand married for a second time to María Luisa de Silva y Fernández de Henestrosa, Duchess of Talavera de la Reina, daughter of Luis de Silva y Fernández, 10th Count of Pie de Concha and his wife, Maria de los Dolores Fernández de Henestrosa y Fernández de Córdoba, on 1 October 1914 in Fuenterrabía, Spain. Maria Luisa was also granted the title Infanta of Spain. ==Later life== Tomb of Prince Ferdinand with members of his family in the crypt of the Almudena Cathedral Ferdinand survived his mother by 12 years and his father by 9 years. He had Alfonso XIII of Spain as his first cousin and brother-in-law and Prince Carlos of Bourbon-Two Sicilies as another brother- in-law. Spanish claimants Infante Jaime, Duke of Segovia, and Infante Juan, Count of Barcelona, were his nephews. ==Titles, styles, honours and armsTitles and styles=== *10 May 1884 – 20 October 1905: His Royal Highness Prince Ferdinand of Bavaria *20 October 1905 – 5 April 1958: His Royal Highness Infante Ferdinand of Bavaria and Bourbon, Prince of Bavaria. ===Honours=== * : Knight of the Order of St. Hubert * : ** Knight Grand Cross of the Royal Order of Charles III, 18 November 1886; with Collar, 20 October 1905 ** 1,117th Knight of the Order of the Golden Fleece, 20 October 1905Boletín Oficial del Estado ** Knight Grand Cross of the Royal Order of Isabella the Catholic, 20 October 1905 ** Knight of the Royal Cavalry Armory of Seville, 1905 ** Grand Commander of León of the Order of Santiago, 27 June 1910Boletín Oficial del Estado ** Grand Cross of the Order of Naval Merit, with White Decoration, 1922 * : ** 300th Knight Grand Cross of the Military Order of the Tower and Sword ** Grand Cross of the Sash of the Two Orders * : Knight of the Order of the Elephant, 25 April 1907 * : Knight of the Order of the Seraphim, 18 December 1907 * : Honorary Knight Grand Cross of the Royal Victorian Order, 9 April 1907The London Gazette, issue 28014, p. 2647 * : Knight of the Order of the Black EagleJustus Perthes, Almanach de Gotha (1922) p. 15 * : Knight of the Order of the Rue Crown * : Knight of Honour and Devotion ===Arms=== File:Coat of Arms of Prince Ferdinand of Bavaria (1884-1958) as Spanish Infante.svgCoat of Arms of Ferdinand of Bavaria as Infante of Spain ==AncestryReferences== Category:Spanish infantes Category:Princes of Bavaria Category:1884 births Category:1958 deaths Category:House of Wittelsbach Category:Nobility from Madrid Category:Knights of the Order of Saint Hubert Category:Knights of the Golden Fleece of Spain Category:Knights Grand Cross of the Order of Isabella the Catholic Category:Knights of Santiago Category:Grand Crosses of the Order of the Tower and Sword 2 2 Category:Recipients of the Order of the Rue Crown Category:Recipients of the Order of the Black Eagle Category:Honorary Knights Grand Cross of the Royal Victorian Order Category:Knights of Malta Category:Grand Crosses of Naval Merit ","title":"Prince Ferdinand of Bavaria"},{"id":"20385824","text":"The Indiana Harbor East Breakwater Light is an active aid to navigationLighthouse Depot, Indiana Harbor East Breakwater Light. that marks the end of a breakwater on the east side of the Indiana Harbor and Ship Canal where it enters Lake Michigan. ==History== According to the Northwest Ordinance of 1787, Michigan's southern boundary should be a line drawn from the southern tip of Lake Michigan east to Lake Erie. Due to errors of cartography, Lake Michigan was charted further north than it really is. This error put Toledo, Ohio and the Maumee River mouth in Ohio. This was one of the bones of contention involved in the “Toledo War”, which was only resolved by Act of Congress, and the related award of the Upper Peninsula to Michigan. All of this had an indirect effect on Indiana's northern border, which now encompassed the southern tip of Lake Michigan. Indiana Harbor was constructed over several years, beginning in 1901, and this included a breakwater paralleling the east edge of the channel where it enters the lake. In 1914 responsibility for the waterway and its facilities was assumed by the Corps of Engineers, and there is some indication that the Corps erected a lighthouse on the breakwater in 1920; however, information on its construction is lacking. On 26 March 1901, Inland Steel Company contracted with Lake Michigan Land Company. It accepted fifty acres of dune land near East Chicago and a promise that a harbor and railroad would be built, in consideration of a promise to build a steel plant there that would cost no less than one million dollars. For $500,000, Inland Steel divested itself of Inland Iron and Forge Company, and raised another $500,000 to fund the project.Perry, W. A., A History of Inland Steel Company And The Indiana Harbor Works. During 1901 and 1902, Indiana Harbor was dredged and a breakwater built. In 1903, work began on a canal that would eventually linking the Indiana Harbor inland to both the Grand Calumet River and Lake George. Over the next several years, many industries were established there. In 1914, the federal government assumed responsibility for Indiana Harbor and the canal. The first lighthouse was constructed in the harbor in 1920. The current light was erected in 1935, and is identical to the better known Port Washington Breakwater Light in Wisconsin. Note that the document has a picture of this light under \\"Indiana Harbor Light,\\" and that it has the correct history and wrong picture under \\"Indiana Harbor East Breakwater Light,\\" It is an Art Deco steel tower standing on a circular pier at the tip of the breakwater.

One workpiece has a hole in it while the other has a boss that fits within the hole. The boss is very slightly undersized so that it forms a slip fit. A staking punch is then used to expand the boss radially and to compress the boss axially so as to form an interference fit between the workpieces. This forms a permanent joint.Degarmo, pp. 415–416. ==Thermoplastic staking== Thermoplastic staking, also known as heat staking, is the same process except that it uses heat to deform the plastic boss, instead of cold forming. A plastic stud protruding from one component fits into a hole in the second component. The stud is then deformed through the softening of the plastic to form a head which mechanically locks the two components together. It is a versatile technique benefiting from being quick, economical and consistent. Unlike welding techniques, staking has the capacity to join plastics to other materials (e.g. metal, PCB's) in addition to joining like or dissimilar plastics, and it has the advantage over other mechanical joining methods in eliminating the need for consumables such as rivets and screws. === Technology === Thermoplastic staking can be performed with a wide variety of technologies including: * Thermal Tooling * Thermal Punch (or Hot Punch) * Hot Air Cold Upset * Ultrasonic Staking * Cold Forming * Infrared Staking * Impulse Staking ==ReferencesBibliography=== *. == Further reading == *Tres, Paul A., \\"Designing Plastic Parts for Assembly\\", 6th ed., 2006, Category:Joining Category:Metal forming ","title":"Staking (manufacturing)"},{"id":"20385855","text":"After Dark is a VHS/DVD release by the band Type O Negative, which was released in 1998 and 2000 (VHS and DVD respectively).

A member of the Democratic Party, she represented the 18th district in the Kansas Senate from 2005 to 2019. Kelly ran for governor in the 2018 election and defeated the Republican nominee, Kris Kobach. ==Early life== Kelly was born in New York City to a military family that moved often and was stationed overseas. She studied at Bradley University, earning a Bachelor of Science in psychology, and at Indiana University, earning a Master of Science in therapeutic recreation. Kelly was the executive director of the Kansas Recreation and Park Association. ==Early political career== Kelly was elected to the Kansas Senate in November 2004, later serving as Minority Whip. In 2007, she was asked to serve as the Ranking Minority member of the Kansas Ways and Means Committee. Kelly helped to establish the Early Childhood Development Block Grants program in the State of Kansas. In late 2009 Kelly briefly considered a run for Kansas's 2nd congressional district. During the 2011–2012 legislative sessions, she served as the Assistant Minority Leader of the Kansas Senate. == Governor of Kansas  Election === On December 15, 2017, Kelly announced her intention to run for governor of Kansas. In the Democratic primary she ran against former mayor of Wichita Carl Brewer and former Kansas Secretary of Agriculture Josh Svaty. On May 24, 2018, Kelly announced State Senator Lynn Rogers as her running mate. On August 7, she defeated Brewer and Svaty, receiving 51.5% of the vote. On November 6, Kelly defeated the Republican nominee, Secretary of State Kris Kobach, receiving 47.8% of the vote. ===Campaign=== Kelly was endorsed by former Kansas Governor and U.S. Secretary of Health and Human Services Kathleen Sebelius. She was also endorsed by 28 current or former Republican government officials, including Kansas Governor Bill Graves; former State Senator, Lt. Governor and U.S. Senator Sheila Frahm, Lt. Gov. Gary Sherrer, Insurance Commissioner Sandy Praeger, Senate President Dick Bond, Senate President Dave Kerr, Senate Vice President John Vratil, Senate Majority Leaders Tim Emert and Lana Oleen; Senators Barbara Allen, David Wysong, Wint Winter, Jr., Pete Brungardt, Ruth Teichman, Barbara Bollier, Audrey Langworthy, Terrie Huntington, Bob VanCrum, and Alicia Salisbury; Representatives JoAnn Pottorff, Ginger Barr, Jim Yonally, Jim Lowther, Fred Lorentz, and Representative and Republican Party Chairperson Rochelle Chronister; Republican National Delegate Don Johnston; and Representatives Joy Koesten and Charles Roth. Graves said, \\"Laura Kelly is the only Democrat I have ever endorsed for public office. And the reason I'm doing that now is because I believe so much is at stake in the state of Kansas. I have known Laura for over 30 years. She has all the qualities and all the capabilities that we are looking for to lead the state during this difficult time and to reestablish the state to what it once was. ... Laura has integrity, and I know she will bring Kansans together regardless of party to solve problems.\\" Former Republican state senator Tim Owens was the campaign treasurer for Kansas independent candidate Greg Orman, but he stepped down from that post on October 30 and endorsed Kelly, believing only she could beat Kobach. Kelly described her candidacy as aimed at reversing the fiscal, educational and other \\"disasters\\" of Sam Brownback's governance. She characterized her opponent, who had been noted for his broad disenfranchisement of voters and legal strategies against immigrants, as \\"Sam Brownback on steroids\\". ===Cabinet=== { class= !

She would like to reverse those changes and pointed out that after there were major budget shortages she led a bipartisan effort to successfully balance the budget without increasing taxes.John Hanna, Rising Kansas revenues fuel GOP anger over lack of tax cuts, Associated Press (February 3, 2020). In 2019, Kelly vetoed two Republican bills that would have cut state income taxes in Kansas. She said that the state could not afford the cuts, and that the Republican bill, which would have cut revenues by an estimated $245 million over a three-year period, would have precipitated a \\"senseless fiscal crisis\\" and created a budget deficit.Dion Lefler, Gov. Kelly vetoes Republican tax bill, says it would bring 'senseless fiscal crisis', Wichita Eagle (May 17, 2019). Kelly's decision, as well as higher-than-expected state revenue intakes, led to the state beginning its 2020 budget year with $1.1 billion in cash reserves. She sought to use some of the reserves to pay down debt and make payments to the state pension system.Kansas Governor Seeks to Use Cash Reserves to Pay off Debt, Associated Press (January 16, 2020). Healthcare As governor, Kelly pushed the Republican-controlled Kansas Legislature to accept the Medicaid expansion under the Affordable Care Act,Phil McCausland, Kansas governor, top Republican reach deal to expand Medicaid, NBC News (January 9, 2020). to provide health care coverage to up to 150,000 Kansans.John Hanna, New Kansas proposal breaks impasse on expanding Medicaid, Associated Press (January 9, 2020). A Medicaid expansion plan had passed the Kansas Legislature in 2017, but Brownback vetoed it. In January 2020, after years of Republican opposition, Kelly struck a bipartisan compromise deal with Republican Senate Majority Leader Jim Denning that made Kansas the 38th state to accept the Medicaid expansion. Under the agreement, on January 1, 2021, Medicaid coverage will be expanded to Kansas residents earning up to 138% of the federal poverty level. Kelly has also supported reforming KanCare so that more citizens have access to health insurance. =Coronavirus responses= In response to the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States, Kelly, like other governors, took steps to halt the spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, which causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). She declared a state of emergency on March 12 following the state's first COVID-19 death,John Hanna & Heather Hollingsworth, Kansas reports COVID-19 death; governor declares emergency, Associated Press (March 12, 2020). and issued a 60-day ban on public gatherings of 50 or more people and a moratorium on utility shutoffs on March 16.John Hanna, Kansas bans gatherings of 50; Kansas City area goes further, Associated Press (March 16, 2020). On March 18, citing the unprecedented crisis, Kelly directed the end to all in-person K-12 classes for the remainder of the school year, making Kansas the first state to take that step.Colin Dwyer, Kansas Becomes The First State To End In-Person Classes For The Year, NPR (March 18, 2020). On March 23, to combat the virus's spread, she limited public gatherings to ten people.Nicole Asbury, Kelly restricts public gatherings to no more than 10 to combat coronavirus spread, Kansas City Star (March 23, 2020). On March 28, amid increasing deaths and illnesses, Kelly issued a \\"stay at home\\" order that directed all residents to remain at home, except for travel for essential work, essential business (such as traveling to obtain medical care or groceries), and outdoor exercise with social distancing measures.Kansas governor orders residents to stay home to curb virus, Associated Press (March 28, 2020). Almost two dozen states had already issued similar orders, and almost 75% of Kansas's population were already affected by similar orders from local orders, since 25 Kansas counties, including the most populous ones, already had a stay-at-home order in place. Kelly strongly criticized the Trump administration's slow response to the crisis and the federal failure to provide Kansas and other states with adequate supplies of personal protective equipment (such as masks, gloves, and gowns) and testing kits.John Hanna & Heather Hollingsworth, Kansas governor calls US officials unprepared for COVID-19, Associated Press (April 2, 2020). Because Kelly's orders on public gatherings applied to Easter Sunday celebrations in churches, the Republican- majority Legislative Coordinating Council (LCC), a group of leaders of the Kansas Legislature, voted to revoke her order on a 5-2 party-line vote on April 9, 2020, asserting that the order violated the free exercise of religion.War over Easter: Kansas lawmakers revoke Gov.

Republican Attorney General Derek Schmidt opposed Kelly's order, issuing a memorandum calling it a violation of the Kansas state law, and urged law enforcement not to enforce it. Kelly called this \\"shockingly irresponsible\\"; at the time, there had been more than a thousand confirmed COVID-19 cases, and dozens of confirmed COVID-19 deaths, in Kansas, and of 11 identified sources of contagion, three had come from recent religious gatherings.Kansas has 3 church-related COVID-19 clusters, state says amid scramble for supplies, Wichita Eagle, Jonathan Shorman, April 6, 2020.

Retrieved February 11, 2020. In January 2020, Kelly called for major changes to the Osawatomie State Hospital, the long-troubled state psychiatric hospital that has faced scrutiny from federal regulators over security, safety, and treatment lapses. She has supported a plan for state funding for mental health crisis centers in the state.Gov. Kelly: Kansas psychiatric hospital unit needs changes, Associated Press (January 3, 2020). School funding Kelly has stated that she would like to ensure Kansas schools are funded and focus on improving the performance of Kansas students to be competitive with other parts of the country. For example, she would address the statewide teacher shortage and improve pay for educators. She would also like to expand early childhood programs and increase options for students pursuing higher education. Social issues In her first official act as governor, Kelly signed an executive order reinstating the employment discrimination protections for LGBT state workers that Governor Sam Brownback had eliminated in 2015. Kelly opposed a Republican proposed anti-abortion amendment to the Kansas Constitution in early 2020, saying it would return Kansas to the \\"dark ages.\\" Amid acrimonious debate, the state House fell four votes short of the two- thirds majority required to put it on the state ballot.Jonathan Shorman, Kelly accused of pressuring 'her own Catholic people' on abortion vote as tempers flare, Wichita Eagle (February 11, 2020). == Personal life == Kelly has been married to physician Ted Daughety, a specialist in pulmonary and sleep disorders, since 1979. They moved to Topeka in 1986. They have two adult daughters, Kathleen and Molly Daughety.

It was written as an overview of how money and the financial system works, the effects of modern money paradigms, especially relating to debt and interest, and how it can work to everyone's benefit to solve a wide range of problems, especially with the use of complementary currencies.Lietaer, Bernard. The Future of Money. Random House, 2001. The book is meant to be written for the layperson, while bringing light to subjects that only relatively few are aware of at all levels of society. Lietaer gives examples of different currencies that have been used in the past or are being used today, and his assessment of the positive and negative effects they carry. He writes that while the modern money paradigm has both positive and negative consequences (e.g. that it induced industrialisation), these currencies can exist in complement at the local, regional and international levels, as well as there being currencies for various sectors, such as healthcare. Lietaer writes that in order to optimally solve problems and create a healthy society, the world needs a variety of currencies in our \\"toolbox\\", and that otherwise we are \\"painting with a screwdriver\\". ==Outline of Parts== Following the introduction and first chapter, where Lietaer outlines five core problems people are facing worldwide, the book is divided into two parts. ===Part 1: What is Money=== Following a chapter-by-chapter outline, Lietaer points to a Primer on How Money Works, which is as an appendix. He then goes on to explain the origins of our money system, and the underlying problems and benefits of it. Lietaer explains how the cybersphere is fundamentally changing money and the financial system, and what it means for us. He ends part one with five scenarios speculating what might happen if the five core problems mentioned in the first chapter come to pass, especially after a widespread monetary crash. ===Part 2: Choosing Your Future of Money=== Lietaer devotes the latter part of the book to outlining the variety of currencies that have existed in the past and exist today, with an outline of how they can be optimized towards what he describes as sustainable abundance, the most preferable outcome of the five scenarios listed in the first part. Complementary currencies are divided into work enabling currencies, such as the Worgl Stamp Scrip, Wära, and Ithaca Hour, and community enabling currencies, such as LETS, and also gives examples of corporate currencies, such as Frequent Flyer Miles. In addressing practical issues, Lietaer argues that one important solution is the idea of a complementary clearing house to trade currencies, giving them additional value. He gives a proposal for a global demurrage currency he dubs the terra, which would be backed by a basket of goods generated on commodity exchanges and including a demurrage fee associated with the costs of storing the commodities. In his outline of sustainable abundance, Lietaer gives a scenario where people have the freedom to gain a livelihood from their work, defined as what people desire to do, as opposed to the job, which was created during, and is an artifact of the industrial revolution, and wealth is sustainable, distributed, and in abundance. == References  * Excerpts from and outline of The Future of Money * George Monbiot - The Future of Money * Summary and Reviews on Author's Site Category:Finance books Category:2001 non-fiction books Category:Alternative currencies ","title":"The Future of Money"},{"id":"20385980","text":"The Last Town on Earth is a 2006 novel by American writer Thomas Mullen. The novel explores events in the fictional town of Commonwealth, Washington in 1918 during World War I and the Spanish flu epidemic. The town agrees to quarantine itself from the outside world, hoping to escape the international epidemic of the flu. Phillip Worthy, the adopted son of Charles Worthy, the town founder, brings a lost soldier into the town. While he appears to be healthy, residents begin to suffer the flu, and start to turn against each other. The politics of the Industrial Workers of the World, American Protective League, and the Four Minute Men, as well as the aftermath of the Everett Massacre, play major roles in the novel. According to the author's afterword, he created the fictional community of Commonwealth inspired by his studies of Gunnison, Colorado (which imposed a quarantine trying to prevent the flu) and the socialist communes in Washington state of Equality Colony, Freeland, and Home. Mullen also cited John M. Barry's The Great Influenza as inspiration. This novel won the James Fenimore Cooper Prize for Best Historical Fiction in 2007.

It features a gold dredge and a supporting community of several dozen buildings, established by mining entrepreneur Ernest Patty. The listed area includes the last of Coal Creek before the Yukon River, where, at the mouth, the roadhouse Slaven's Cabin is included. It includes two former locations and the current location of the gold dredging operation. It includes 26 contributing buildings and 12 contributing structures and three contributing sites. The architecture is strictly functional, besides the roadhouse. The district contains buildings, structures, a dredge, water system, tailings piles, and other mine engineering sites and objects that together represent Alaskan dredge mining operations of the 1930s. The majority of buildings and structures were built between 1934 and 1940. The mining camp has been moved twice from its original site. The design, materials, and construction of the buildings all reflect the utilitarian and remote nature of the camp. Except for Slaven's Roadhouse, workmanship is strictly functional: competent but uninspired. Nothing detracts from the feeling of a remote placer mining operation of the 20th century. The district contains 26 contributing buildings, 3 sites, and 12 structures. The noncontributing items include 5 buildings and 2 structures. In 1941, the camp was apparently moved from its original location near the mouth of Cheese Creek to a hillside location near Snare Creek, and in 1952 to the present location at Beaton Pup. The original camp site was dredged over in 1941. The creek has since changed channels and today flows through a portion of the first site. The dredge is the most significant relic in the district. It is a medium-sized diesel-powered floating dredge. It was built by the Walter W. Johnson Company of Oakland, California and shipped in pieces to Skagway, then by rail to Whitehorse, Yukon Territory and by barge down the Yukon River. The encampment moved three times. It was first established near the mouth of Cheese Creek in 1934, then moved to a location near Snare Creek in 1941. The final move brought it to its present location at Beaton Pup. The first site has not survived, having been dredged over. The second site has been altered by changes in the course of the creek. The Frank Slaven Roadhouse, separately listed on the National Register of Historic Places, is nearby and is included in the district. The third camp survives nearly intact, with its equipment and historic context preserved. The placer operation was managed by mining engineer Ernest Patty, who arrived in Alaska in 1922 and had become an instructor at the University of Alaska in Fairbanks. Patty was to return to what had become the University of Alaska in 1953 as president of the university, retiring in 1960. ==Contributing Properties== The main contributing properties to the historic districts are: * The Slaven's Cabin, , AHRS# CHR-030, built 1928-1930. * The historic road along Coal Creek, . * The trailing piles, . * The dredge, built 1935. * The Coal Creek Mining Camp, comprising 21 contributing buildings, , built 1936-1941. * The cabin ruins along Snare Creek, . * The ditch, and its intercept with Coal Creek built in 1935. * The Cheese Creek Camp, , AHRS# CHR-094, built 1936-1941. ==See also== *National Register of Historic Places listings in Yukon-Charley Rivers National Preserve *National Register of Historic Places listings in Yukon–Koyukuk Census Area, Alaska *Chatanika gold dredge (Fairbanks) *F.

A common use for a boss is to locate one object within a pocket or hole of another object. For instance, some motors use a precisely machined boss on the front face to locate it on the mating part. Like a process on a bone, bosses on castings can provide attachment points or bearing surfaces. The term 'boss' when used in engineering can also relate to a finishing edge around (usually) a circular opening that allows the opening to locate onto, or within another opening thus locating or joining two items together with a view to the location or joining being temporary or semi-permanent. A common everyday example of a boss is the housing of the rotation spindle in a washing machine drum, or on a cylinder lawn mower at the end of the cutting blade cylinder which may house a bearing set to allow the cylinder to rotate through one plane, but held firm in another plane. A boss can also be a brass eyelet on a sail. It is a generic term to describe an item designed to facilitate the use with, within, on or around another item whereby one cannot operate properly without the other. The word 'boss' is also often used to describe the end of a shaft on a boat to which a propeller might attach. A boss may also refer to a mounting feature that will receive a screw or thread-forming screw. In computer-aided design applications, a boss is a feature used to describe a type of extrusion. The word boss comes from the Middle French word ', which means protuberance. == See also == * Fillet * Draft Category:Metalworking terminology ","title":"Boss (engineering)"},{"id":"20386045","text":"Tasa de Laso de la Vega or Rate of Laso de la Vega, a new tax rate dictated in 1635 by the Royal Governor of Chile Francisco Laso de la Vega.

The freshies came from different backgrounds: from a wealthy family, a politician family, and a famous family; son of a military officer, a high rank officer, a civil servant, and a school alumnus. The boys began flourished attraction with a picture of Prince Daovadueng Sila, an alumnus whose come with reputable as excellent student but raised a question why only a young picture of him was displayed. They began to dig for more information about him from the school's yearbook of 1952. They found out he was dead by suicide. Unsatisfied with the limited resources, they began investigate the real reason behind the pronounce-suicide. Even Mr Choo, the long servant school janitor claimed that he had shot himself. The boys befriended Numkang, the daughter of fierce Mr Sawaeng (\\"Waeng\\"), the school bad-tempered teacher. Father Theodore also stated that Prince Daovadueng committed suicide. One night they decided to use an Ouija board with inclusion of Numkang, who admired the late prince. By hailing the spirit of Prince Daovadueng and ask him about the actual reason behind his death, the cause of his death are not by committed suicide, it is actually a murder! Without their acknowledgement, the broken glass released the spirit of Chatta, the evil spirit of a boy who had been bullied, mentally and physically by his school mates. Possessed-Sihnsamuth began to show some refusal sign by ignoring the further investigations and show no interest at all. He also pursued them to abandoned the research. One night after sneaking out to meet Numkang, Trai climbed to hostel dorm and tried to get in through the bedroom window with helped of a stranger's hand, unfortunately he slipped and fell to his death. Chai and Ghu wondered why in the 1952 registration book, out of 116 admission there were no record of Daovadeung and other students, only 110 of them are listed. Although in the school's hall of fame, Daovadeung was dubbed as one of the school's best student. Chatta possessed the body of weak Sihnsamuth to kill all the seniors that treat other students badly, like by electrocuting Tee and violently stabbing Joe with axe. In a flashback, Chatta also killed his schoolmates by shooting randomly and Daovadeung was one of them. He dug graves to bury them but was found out by Mr Choo and before being captured, he shot himself dead. Possessed Sihnsamuth accused his friends as murderers and practiced black magic. Afterwards, he killed the seniors and a female teacher. That night, father Theodore recalled his mistake for ignoring Chatta who pleaded of senior misconduct which led to his mental breakdown and eventually seeking revenge. They finally saved Numkang from being buried alive by Chatta/Sihnsamuth. Gun and shovel did not manage to get rid of him, they finally use St George spear from a statue and with help of Daovadeung's spirit their managed to kill Sihnsamuth possessed by Chatta. After the tragedy, Mr Choo made a false confession before dying to took all Sihnsamuth sins. The wolfpack finished their school together with better tradition and friendly approached as senior.

Its members address common issues in their communities, families and personal lives, promoting gender and racial equity. The organization has its roots in the Coalition of 100 Black Women, founded in New York City in 1970 by Edna Beach and 23 other African- American women. Jewell Jackson McCabe, one of the original founders, became President of the New York chapter in 1977 and set out to create a national coalition. Within ten months, the organization had 37 chapters in 20 states. By 1981, the organization had grown to over 500 members, gaining local and national media recognition. They worked with other chapters and women leaders across the United States to form the NCBW. In October 24, 1981, after returning from the National Conference of Black Mayors, it was determined it was imperative to formally extend the institution beyond New York City. As a result, the word \\"National\\" was incorporated into the organization's name. NCBW became a not-for-profit organization with representatives from 14 states and the District of Columbia. By 1986, there were 3000 members in 19 states, with 47 chapters altogether. In 1998, the advocacy agenda of the National Coalition of 100 Black Women, Inc. expanded to include other women of color. The National Coalition of 100 Black Women, Inc. has thousands of members with 60 chapters across 25 states and the District of Columbia.

He also competed on the school's basketball and track and field teams. ==College careerBoston College=== After sitting out the 2007 season with Matt Ryan leading the Boston College Eagles, in his second season he and Chris Crane vied for the position of quarterback early on in the 2008 season. Dominique got his first snaps in a game against University of Central Florida following a poor showing by Crane. He also played in the following game against University of Rhode Island, but then was benched by head coach Jeff Jagodzinski as Crane solidified his position. Then in week 13 against Wake Forest Chris Crane went down in the second quarter and Dominique Davis came in with a 13–0 lead. Davis played mediocre, fumbling twice as the Boston College defense kept the game close until the final minutes of the game. Then with less than 4 minutes left Davis completed a long 3rd down to WR Rich Gunnell to put BC into scoring range. Following a pass to WR Brandon Robinson, Davis capped the drive with a short run for the winning score. His first victory as a starter came on November 28, 2008.

On July 26 he announced his decision to transfer to Fort Scott Community College, where his plan was to play for one season before transferring back to a Division I program. He chose to transfer to East Carolina University and enrolled in May 2010. Davis helped lead Fort Scott Community College to its first Jayhawk Conference championship since 1974, defeating Butler (Kansas) Community College in the final game of the regular season. Butler had won the previous eight Jayhawk Conference championships. It was the first time FSCC had beaten Butler since 1986. Two weeks later, in a rematch, Davis' FSCC team defeated Butler, 13–12, to give the Greyhounds their first-ever Region VI Playoff championship. The Greyhounds were given the No. 1 ranking in the national poll and were matched up against No. 2 Blinn College (Texas) for the National Junior College Athletic Association national championship in the Citizens Bank Bowl on the campus of Pittsburg State University. Blinn rallied from a 26–10 deficit in the second half to win the game 31–26 on an 84-yard punt return with 15 seconds remaining.

On October 22, 2011 the East Carolina quarterback did not throw an incomplete pass in the first half of the Pirates 38–35 victory over the Navy Midshipmen. This gave Davis the NCAA record for most consecutive completions in one game held by Tee Martin of Tennessee in 1998. Combining the 10 consecutive completions from the ECU's previous game against Memphis, his 36 consecutive passes over two games eclipsed the previous overall consecutive completion record of 26 held by Aaron Rodgers of Cal in 2004. This performance led Dominique to be selected by ESPN analysts as one of four finalists in the AT&T; All-America Player of the Week for week 6 of the 2011 season.

He retired in 1940, but was promoted to general in 1947 while in reserve. After World War I, Atanasescu rose through the ranks of the Romanian Army; he was promoted to lieutenant colonel (1919), colonel (1923), brigadier general (1934), and major general (1939). From 1937 he was the Commanding Officer of the 6th Călărași Cavalry Regiment. In 1940, he became the Army's Inspector General of Cavalry. On June 26, 1940, the Soviet Union demanded that the regions of northern Bukovina and Bessarabia be evacuated of all Romanian military personnel and civilian administration, and that the territories be ceded to the USSR. Due to overwhelming international pressure, the Romanian government was forced to accept the ultimatum, and the Soviet occupation of Bessarabia and northern Bukovina commenced on June 28. During the retreat of the Romania Army from Bessarabia, Atanasescu abandoned his troops and fled to Galați; his actions were blamed on ethnic minorities, including Jews. Also in June 1940, France capitulated to Nazi Germany. Later that summer, the pro-France Romanian government ceded Southern Dobruja to Bulgaria under the Treaty of Craiova and Northern Transylvania to Hungary under the Second Vienna Award. These events led to General Ion Antonescu coming to power as Conducător of Romania and President of the Council of Ministers in September 1940. After forcing King Carol II to abdicate, Antonescu used Decree Law No. 3,094 of 9 September 1940 to remove from the army Atanasescu and several other generals considered to be close to Carol II and accused of behaving inappropriately as high military commanders during the dramatic circumstances of the summer of 1940.Decretul-lege nr. 3.094 din 9 septembrie 1940 al Conducătorului Statului Român relativ la scoaterea din cadrele active ale armatei, publicat în Monitorul Oficial, anul CVIII, nr. 210 din 10 septembrie 1940, partea I-a, p. 5.306 (in Romanian).Decretul regal nr. 1.649 din 1 septembrie 1944 referitor la generali reintegrați în drepturi, publicat în Monitorul Oficial, anul CXII, nr. 205 din 6 septembrie 1944, partea I-a, p. 6.248 (in Romanian). The decree-law provided for the removal of several generals from the active ranks of the army with the following justification: > Considering that by flattery and methods incompatible with the dignity of a > soldier they occupied high commands, then encouraged the frivolity and a > lack of officer dignity; Considering that the incapacity of these general > officers led to the demise of the army and to serious actions leading to the > loss of the borders; Considering that an example of duty and responsibility > must be set for the Nation by sanctioning those who have been guilty of > these violations. Antonescu fell from power on 23 August 1944, as a result of King Michael's Coup. The effects of the decree-law were annulled on 1 September 1944, and General Atanasescu was reinstated with full rights starting with the date of his retirement.

In 1945, he was arrested by the Soviets as \\"pro- German.\\" == Early life == He was born Botoșani on 26 January 1884, and attended the A. T. Laurian National College between 1898 and 1906. He then enrolled in the Military School of Infantry and Cavalry in Bucharest, graduating in 1908 with the rank of second lieutenant, and being promoted to first lieutenant in 1911. After serving in the Second Balkan War in 1913, he was admitted to the Carol I National Defence University, and promoted to captain in 1915. == World War I and Interwar == When Romania entered World War I in August 1916 on the side of the Allied powers, Avramescu fought with the Dobruja Army, under the command of Russian General Andrei Zayonchkovski, and saw action against the German forces of General August von Mackensen. In November he took command of the 2nd Battalion from the 38th Regiment, and fought in December at the Battle of the Argeș, falling back towards Moldavia in a series of defensive actions. For his valor in these engagements he was awarded in 1917 the Order of the Star of Romania, Knight class. In the summer of 1917 he fought at the Battle of Mărășești; for his service he was awarded the Order of the Crown, Grand Officer Class, and was promoted to major on 1 September 1917. In the interwar period he advanced to lieutenant colonel in 1923, colonel in 1929, brigadier general in 1935, and major general in 1940. At various times, he was in command of the 1st Division Vânători de munte, the 10th Infantry Division, and the III Army Corps. == World War II == Avramescu served as General Officer Commanding of a number of army units: the 10th Division in 1941, the Mountain Corps in June 1941, the III Corps in October 1943, the VI Corps in February 1944 and 4th Army from 1944 to 1945. At the head of the Mountain Corps, he participated in Operation München, the Battle of the Sea of Azov, Crimean campaign and Siege of Sevastopol. After the fall of Sevastopol, his Corps occupied Crimea. For his service during the Crimean campaign, Avramescu was promoted on 18 July 1942 to lieutenant general (general de corp de armată), and was awarded the Order of the Crown, Grand Officer Class (29 July 1942), the Order of Michael the Brave, 2nd Class (1 September 1942), and the German Cross, in Gold (25 October 1942). After the crushing defeat in the Battle of Stalingrad, in which he didn't participate, the Romanian Army was driven back to its own country during 1943 and the first half of 1944. In August 1944, on the eve of the Soviet Jassy–Kishinev Offensive, he took de facto command of the 4th Army, since general Ioan Mihail Racoviță was \\"away on leave\\" (preparing King Michael's Coup). Avramescu could not prevent the disastrous defeat, because of the limited number of armored and motorized units at his disposal, and was dismissed on 23 August and replaced by Ilie Șteflea. After the Royal Coup, he was recalled to command the 4th Army on the side of the Soviets against the Germans and the Hungarians. He fought many battles with his 4th Army, including the Battle of Turda and the Battle of Debrecen, and was in command at the Battle of Carei, the last engagement of the war within the present borders of Romania. Avramescu complained repeatedly to the Soviets about the lack of supplies and impossible tasks for his Army. For this, he was relieved of command on 11 January 1945, and put on reserve. Nevertheless, he was promoted to general on 9 February and recalled to duty. Returning to the front, he successfully led the 4th Army in the assault on the Zvolen–Banská Bystrica line, in what was the prelude to the Bratislava–Brno Offensive in Slovakia. ==Death== On 2 March 1945, when on the Slovakian front, General Avramescu was summoned by the commander of the Soviet 40th Army. After one hour, the Romanian delegation was told that Avramescu and the 40th Army commander, General Filipp Zhmachenko, left for the command post of the 2nd Ukrainian Front, as they were expected there by Marshal Rodion Malinovsky, leading later commentators to assert General Avramescu was arrested. Bust of Avramescu in \\"Ștefan cel Mare\\" Square, Cluj-Napoca The Romanian 4th Army was placed under command of General Nicolae Dăscălescu, who struggled to find out what had happened to Avrămescu. Zhmachenko advised him to find information about Avramescu at the Romanian Ministry of Defence or the Romanian General Staff. Avramescu was killed on March 3, 1945 in an aerial attack on the car which transported him, and his body was buried in Budapest's Soshalom cemetery. The general was the only occupant of the car to be killed. According to the official report issued on March 23, 1945 by NKVD head Lavrentiy Beria, Avramescu was hit by a bullet through the car's windshield. Also on 3 March 1945, Adela, Avramescu's wife and Felicia Avramescu-Sturdza, his daughter, were arrested and sent to Siberia. His daughter committed suicide; according to Soviet sources, this happened on 6 March 1945. Adela returned to Romania in 1956. On 23 October 2000, his remains were brought back to Romania and were reburied with military honours at the Hajongard cemetery of Cluj-Napoca.

He was deported from Canada on July 15, 2008.See also: Robin Long v. Canada (MCI & MPSEP), IMM-3042-08 (July 14, 2008), Justice Mactavish In July 2008, the Toronto Star quoted Bob Ages, chair of the Vancouver-based War Resisters Support Campaign who said that since the time of slavery, Canada has been known as a place of asylum, and Long's removal marks the first time an army deserter has been deported from Canada to the United States The Globe and Mail also reported this quote from Ages: > Mr. Long's deportation would be a terrible precedent for Canada, especially > given our history of providing sanctuary for war resisters, over 100,000 > draft dodgers and deserters during the Vietnam era. ==Long's background== At the time he voluntarily enlisted in July 2003, Long believed that his country was justified in going to war in Iraq, his lawyer Shepherd Moss said at the court hearing to halt the deportation of July 2008. Long intended to train as a tank commander. \\"He wanted to go to defend his country\\", his lawyer stated. Long trained for two years at Fort Knox in Kentucky. His perspective changed while in training at the Army base at Fort Knox. After hearing that weapons of mass destruction had not been found in Iraq, Long thought the U.S. had no reason for being at war. Also, in 2004 he was troubled by evidence of abuse of Iraqi detainees that came out in May 2004, according to his lawyer, Shepherd Moss, in July 2008. Long concluded the abuse was systemic and condoned by the U.S. administration, Moss said. After some soul-searching, Long decided he would not go to Iraq and would not participate or be complicit in what he believed were war crimes, the lawyer said. Long reportedly decided that he didn't want to go to Iraq after talking to people who had been there: \\"These people came back and were telling these horrific stories and our superiors were egging people on, some people were actually volunteering to go over there and it just seemed like justified homicide\\", he said in the interview. \\"It didn't sit right in my stomach. I morally couldn't do it.\\" Long was ordered in March 2005 to report to Iraq for service. In 2005, he left his military base in Colorado Springs, and went to Toronto. ==In Canada from 2005 to July 15, 2008== Long sought to be accepted as a refugee in September, 2006. His application for refugee status was denied on February 15, 2007. An application for leave to appeal the decision was turned down. Long moved to British Columbia in the summer of 2007. While there Long said he perfected his organic gardening skills and converted his Volkswagen to run on recycled cooking oil.The Gazette \\"Fort Carson deserter sentenced to 15 months in prison\\" In 2007, he failed to comply with bail conditions imposed when he missed an immigration hearing. ==The events of July 14 and 15, 2008== In a final attempt to stay in Canada, Long applied on July 14, 2008 for a stay of the removal order in order to allow him further judicial appeals. Long's case was heard on July 14, 2008, in front of Madam Justice Anne Mactavish of the Federal Court of Canada. Long was not in court for the hearing. He was in custody at a location outside Vancouver. Judge Mactavish stated that Long did not provide evidence to show he would be singled out for harsh treatment by the U.S. military because of the publicity associated with case. However, a month later, on August 22, 2008, in Long's court martial trial in the United States, \\"Prosecutors called no witnesses to disparage Long's character. Instead, they showed a six-minute video of Long, sporting dreadlocks and a beard, telling a Canadian news reporter \\"I think I was lied to by my president.\\" The fact that this \\"aggravating\\" evidence was accepted as admissible at the court martial for the charge of desertion was later the subject of much attention (see \\"aggravation\\" below) in Canada at the hearing of another war resister: On September 22, 2008, after the Federal Court hearing of Jeremy Hinzman, the Toronto Star reported the following: > Jeremy Hinzman's lawyer Alyssa Manning told judge Richard Mosley that new > evidence suggests outspoken critics of the 2003 American-led invasion of > Iraq face harsher treatment than other deserters. For example, she said, > deserter Robin Long was sentenced to 15 months in prison last month after > prosecutors made mention of a media interview he had given in Canada before > he was deported in July ... The issue of \\"differential\\" treatment for those > who have spoken out against the U.S.-led invasion appeared to trouble Judge > Mosley. \\"I don't know how it is an aggravating feature or element to be > introduced in sentencing\\", the judge said. ... \\"Based on the evidence and > submissions before me, I am satisfied that the applicants (Jeremy Hinzman > and family) would suffer irreparable harm if a stay were not granted pending > determination of their leave application,\\" Mosley said in his three-page > endorsement.\\" Long was removed from Canada on July 15, 2008.\\"Madam Justice Anne Mactavish of the Federal Court of Canada cleared the way for the deportation....\\" ==In the U.S. beginning July 15, 2008== Naval Consolidated Brig, Miramar, where Long served his sentence He was court-martialed at Fort Carson, Colorado in August 2008. At the trial, Long pleaded guilty to desertion and was given a sentence of 15 months in prison, reduction in rank to E-1 private, and a dishonorable discharge.Toronto Star, \\"Iraq war resister sentenced to 15 months — Deported from Canada last month, U.S. soldier given dishonourable discharge for desertion\\"The Globe and Mail, \\"U.S. war resister pleads guilty to desertion — Soldier who fled to Canada to avoid fighting in Iraq sentenced to 15 months in prison\\"CBC News \\"U.S. soldier jailed 15 months for desertion\\"\\"Soldier who fled to Canada to avoid Iraq duty to plead guilty to desertion\\" Robin Long was represented by James M. Branum (of Pine Ridge, Oklahoma), William Durland (of Colorado Springs, Colorado) and Captain Seth Cohen (of the U.S. Army Trial Defense Service). Long's principal sentencing arguments focused on the morality of civil disobedience and Long's rehabilitative potential, while the government's sole case in aggravation was a video interview that the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation did with Long. Long served the remainder of his sentence at the Miramar Consolidated Naval Brig near San Diego, California. On November 6, 2008, Long authored an open letter to then President-elect Barack Obama which included the following words: > I feel I made the right decision by refusing and am more than willing to sit > in the brig for my ideals. But I worry about the effect this has on my > family. I ask you to please consider granting me presidential clemency or a > pardon. I have given this to many different organizations and people to > ensure that you receive a copy.CourageToResist.org \\"Prisoner of conscience > Robin Long's letter to Obama\\" On March 15, 2009, two members of the Parliament of Canada visited Long in prison. They were Olivia Chow (New Democratic Party), and Borys Wrzesnewskyj (Liberal Party of Canada). On July 9, 2009, Robin Long was released from prison. On August 12, 2009, the Boise Weekly published this statement: As of August 2010, Long lives in San Francisco and survives on odd jobs in gardening and carpentry to pay for a college program to become a massage therapist. ===Continued activism=== After his incarceration, Long toured the U.S. speaking out in opposition to the Iraq War. In October 2009, he was sponsored on a trip to Israel and Palestine to speak to army resisters there and meet with high-school students. As of August 2010, Long has been sharing his experience on college campuses. ==See also== * Canada and Iraq War resisters * Canada and the Iraq War * Citizenship and Immigration Canada * Conscientious objector * Desertion * Immigration and Refugee Protection Act * Nuremberg Defense * List of Iraq War resisters * Right of asylum * War Resisters Support Campaign ==References * Global Television Network television program 16:9 documentary entitled \\"War Resisters.\\" Carolyn Jarvis interviews war resisters Robin Long and Rodney Watson, and Canadian Member of Parliament Gerard Kennedy.

Following the surrender of Friedrich Paulus' 6th Army at the Battle of Stalingrad, Brătescu became a prisoner of war and was held captive in the Soviet Union from 1943 to 1948. During a visit to Moscow in April 1946, the composer George Enescu and his wife, Princess Maruca Cantacuzino, asked the Soviet authorities to free Brătescu and a fellow prisoner, General . Brătescu was released in 1948, after five years of imprisonment, and subsequently retired from active service. He died in 1971, at the age of seventy-nine. ==References== Category:1892 births Category:1971 deaths Category:Romanian Land Forces generals Category:Romanian military personnel of World War II Category:Recipients of the Order of the Star of Romania Category:Romanian prisoners of war ","title":"Constantin Brătescu"},{"id":"20386425","text":"Ștefan Burileanu (10 January 1874–1951) was a Romanian officer, engineer, inventor, and academic who rose to the rank of major general in 1933.Din elita artileriei, col. prof. univ. dr.

Other members include his brothers, Darren and Jason, as well as Martin Healy and David Morrissey, both formerly of A House, and Rob Cumiskey of The Kybosh. == History  Bawl and Fixed Stars === Cullen and his brothers moved from Finglas, Dublin to London in the 1990s after having signed to A&M; under their then moniker, Bawl (which also featured Stephen McBride on bass). Strong, Martin C. (2003) \\"Bawl\\", in The Great Indie Discography, Canongate, Bawl had released a series of singles on their own label, Dependent Records, and in 1996 released an album, Year Zero on A&M.; This attracted critical attention and some \\"the new Smiths\\" hype (the Cullens cited their mother singing Some Girls Are Bigger Than Others at the kitchen sink as an influence) but disappointing sales. For legal reasons, the band had to change its name to Fixed Stars and signed on with Mercury. They released several singles as Fixed Stars, but broke up in 2000, having been dropped before releasing their album. Ian Broudie of the Lightning Seeds had produced some of the Fixed Stars singles, and Mark Cullen continued to work with Broudie, writing songs for the Lightning Seeds album Tilt, and contributing with Broudie to the soundtrack of Purely Belter. Cullen and Broudie continue to collaborate on \\"songs for other people\\", and Cullen has written for Kylie Minogue. ===Pony Club=== After the post-Fixed Stars transition period, Cullen then signed as a solo artist, under the name Pony Club, to Setanta Records, natural home for many Irish indie acts. As Pony Club, Cullen works with a variety of musicians, still including his brothers, and, recently, Martin Healy and David Morrissey, of Setanta labelmates A House (John Carrol, A House's manager, had also managed Bawl) and Rob Cumiskey of Dublin band, The Kybosh. So far, Pony Club have released three albums, the first two on Setanta. Home Truths (Allmusic review: 3.5/5 [ link]) was named album of the year for 2002 by Dan Cairns of the Sunday Times, and resulted in Cullen being offered a support slot on Morrissey's American tour.Strong, Martin C. (2003) \\"Pony Club\\", in The Great Indie Discography, Canongate, For financial reasons, the band were unable to take up this offer, but they did get to support him at his concert at London's Royal Albert Hall that year. The second is Family Business (Allmusic review: 4/5 [ link]) from 2004. Following the demise of Setanta, the third Pony Club album, Post Romantic, was released in November 2008 by Hum records. Cullen has been called one of Ireland's top songwriters of the last decade. He receives particular attention from critics for the quality of his lyrics, which are often compared to those of Jarvis Cocker for their power of observation and acerbity, as well as tributes for his songwriting from artists such as Morrissey and Terry Hall. The London band New Young Pony Club called themselves \\"New Young\\" to distinguish themselves from Pony Club. In response, Cullen has joked that he is happy to be known as the Old Decrepit Pony Club if needs must. ==DiscographyPony Club singles and albums=== {  - ! style=\\"text-align:left; vertical-align:top;\\"Single ! style=\\"text-align:left; vertical-align:top;\\"Album ! style=\\"vertical-align:top; text-align:left; width:40px;\\"Year ! style=\\"text-align:left; vertical-align:top;\\"Label - style=\\"text-align:left; vertical-align:top;\\"  style=\\"text-align:left; vertical-align:top;\\" Home Truths 2002 Setanta - style=\\"text- align:left; vertical-align:top;\\"  style=\\"text-align:left; vertical- align:top;\\" Family Business 2004 Setanta - style=\\"text-align:left; vertical-align:top;\\"  style=\\"text-align:left; vertical-align:top;\\" Post Romantic 2008 Hum - style=\\"text-align:left; vertical-align:top;\\" \\"Diplomat\\"  style=\\"text-align:left; vertical-align:top;\\" 2009 Hum } ===Bawl singles and albums=== { - ! style=\\"text-align:left; vertical-align:top;\\"Single ! style=\\"text-align:left; vertical- align:top;\\"Album ! style=\\"vertical-align:top; text-align:left; width:40px;\\"Year ! style=\\"text-align:left; vertical-align:top;\\"Label - style=\\"vertical-align:top;\\"  style=\\"text-align:left; \\"\\"Bathroom\\"  style=\\"text-align:left; vertical-align:top;\\"  style=\\"text-align:center; \\"1995  style=\\"text-align:left; \\"Dependent Records - style=\\"vertical- align:top;\\"  style=\\"text-align:left; \\"\\"Girls Night Out\\"  style=\\"text- align:left; vertical-align:top;\\"  style=\\"text-align:center; \\"1996  style=\\"text-align:left; \\"Dependent Records - style=\\"vertical-align:top;\\"  style=\\"text-align:left; \\"\\"Glen Campbell Nights\\"  style=\\"text-align:left; vertical-align:top;\\"  style=\\"text-align:center; \\"1996  style=\\"text- align:left; \\"Dependent Records - style=\\"vertical-align:top;\\"  style=\\"text- align:left; \\"\\"Beyond Safe Ways\\"  style=\\"text-align:left; vertical- align:top;\\"  style=\\"text-align:center; \\"1996  style=\\"text-align:left; \\"Dependent Records - style=\\"vertical-align:top;\\"  style=\\"text-align:left; \\"\\"Sticky Rock\\"  style=\\"text-align:left; vertical-align:top;\\"  style=\\"text- align:center; \\"1996  style=\\"text-align:left; \\"Dependent Records - style=\\"vertical-align:top;\\"  style=\\"text-align:left; vertical-align:top;\\"  style=\\"text-align:left; \\" Year Zero  style=\\"text-align:center; \\"1996  style=\\"text-align:left; \\"Dependent Records, A&M; Records - style=\\"vertical- align:top;\\"  style=\\"text-align:left; \\"\\"He’s All That’s Great About Pop\\"  style=\\"text-align:left; vertical-align:top;\\"  style=\\"text-align:center; \\"1997  style=\\"text-align:left; \\"Dependent Records } ===Fixed Stars singles=== {  - ! style=\\"text-align:left; vertical- align:top;\\"Single ! style=\\"vertical-align:top; text-align:left; width:40px;\\"Year ! style=\\"text-align:left; vertical-align:top;\\"Label - style=\\"text-align:left; vertical-align:top;\\" \\"Blueprints\\" 1999 Mercury - style=\\"text-align:left; vertical-align:top;\\" \\"Every Night\\" 1999 Mercury - style=\\"text-align:left; vertical-align:top;\\" \\"Here Comes the Music\\" 1999 Mercury - style=\\"text-align:left; vertical-align:top;\\" \\"What If the World Sleeps with You?\\" 2000 Mercury } ==References *Pony Club official website Category:Irish rock music groups ","title":"Pony Club (band)"},{"id":"20386565","text":"Mariner 9 image of Ascraeus Mons. This is one of the first images to show that Mars has large volcanoes. THEMIS image of lava flows. Note the lobate shape of the edges. Using Earth to understand how water may have affected volcanoes on Mars. Volcanic activity, or volcanism, has played a significant role in the geologic evolution of Mars.Head, J.W. (2007). The Geology of Mars: New Insights and Outstanding Questions in The Geology of Mars: Evidence from Earth-Based Analogs, Chapman, M., Ed; Cambridge University Press: Cambridge UK, p. 10. Scientists have known since the Mariner 9 mission in 1972 that volcanic features cover large portions of the Martian surface. These features include extensive lava flows, vast lava plains, and the largest known volcanoes in the Solar System. Martian volcanic features range in age from Noachian (>3.7 billion years) to late Amazonian (< 500 million years), indicating that the planet has been volcanically active throughout its history, and some speculate it probably still is so today. Both Earth and Mars are large, differentiated planets built from similar chondritic materials.Carr, 2006, p. 44. Many of the same magmatic processes that occur on Earth also occurred on Mars, and both planets are similar enough compositionally that the same names can be applied to their igneous rocks and minerals. Volcanism is a process in which magma from a planet's interior rises through the crust and erupts on the surface. The erupted materials consist of molten rock (lava), hot fragmental debris (tephra or ash), and gases. Volcanism is a principal way that planets release their internal heat. Volcanic eruptions produce distinctive landforms, rock types, and terrains that provide a window on the chemical composition, thermal state, and history of a planet's interior.Wilson, L. (2007). Planetary Volcanism in Encyclopedia of the Solar System, McFadden, L.-A. et al., Eds., Academic Press: San Diego, CA, p. 829. Magma is a complex, high-temperature mixture of molten silicates, suspended crystals, and dissolved gases. Magma on Mars likely ascends in a similar manner to that on Earth. It rises through the lower crust in diapiric bodies that are less dense than the surrounding material. As the magma rises, it eventually reaches regions of lower density. When the magma density matches that of the host rock, buoyancy is neutralized and the magma body stalls. At this point, it may form a magma chamber and spread out laterally into a network of dikes and sills. Subsequently, the magma may cool and solidify to form intrusive igneous bodies (plutons). Geologists estimate that about 80% of the magma generated on Earth stalls in the crust and never reaches the surface.Wilson, M. (1995) Igneous Petrogenesis; Chapman Hall: London, 416 pp. Schematic diagrams showing the principles behind fractional crystallisation in a magma. While cooling, the magma evolves in composition because different minerals crystallize from the melt. 1: olivine crystallizes; 2: olivine and pyroxene crystallize; 3: pyroxene and plagioclase crystallize; 4: plagioclase crystallizes. At the bottom of the magma reservoir, a cumulate rock forms. As magma rises and cools, it undergoes many complex and dynamic compositional changes. Heavier minerals may crystallize and settle to the bottom of the magma chamber. The magma may also assimilate portions of host rock or mix with other batches of magma. These processes alter the composition of the remaining melt, so that any magma reaching the surface may be chemically quite different from its parent melt. Magmas that have been so altered are said to be \\"evolved\\" to distinguish them from \\"primitive\\" magmas that more closely resemble the composition of their mantle source. (See igneous differentiation and fractional crystallization.) More highly evolved magmas are usually felsic, that is enriched in silica, volatiles, and other light elements compared to iron- and magnesium-rich (mafic) primitive magmas. The degree and extent to which magmas evolve over time is an indication of a planet's level of internal heat and tectonic activity. The Earth's continental crust is made up of evolved granitic rocks that developed through many episodes of magmatic reprocessing. Evolved igneous rocks are much less common on cold, dead bodies such as the Moon. Mars, being intermediate in size between the Earth and the Moon, is thought to be intermediate in its level of magmatic activity. At shallower depths in the crust, the lithostatic pressure on the magma body decreases. The reduced pressure can cause gases (volatiles), such as carbon dioxide and water vapor, to exsolve from the melt into a froth of gas bubbles. The nucleation of bubbles causes a rapid expansion and cooling of the surrounding melt, producing glassy shards that may erupt explosively as tephra (also called pyroclastics). Fine-grained tephra is commonly referred to as volcanic ash. Whether a volcano erupts explosively or effusively as fluid lava depends on the composition of the melt. Felsic magmas of andesitic and rhyolitic composition tend to erupt explosively. They are very viscous (thick and sticky) and rich in dissolved gases. Mafic magmas, on the other hand, are low in volatiles and commonly erupt effusively as basaltic lava flows. However, these are only generalizations. For example, magma that comes into sudden contact with groundwater or surface water may erupt violently in steam explosions called hydromagmatic (phreatomagmatic or phreatic) eruptions. Erupting magmas may also behave differently on planets with different interior compositions, atmospheres, and gravitational fields. ==Differences in volcanic styles between Earth and Mars== Planet Mars – volatile gases (Curiosity rover, October 2012) The most common form of volcanism on the Earth is basaltic. Basalts are extrusive igneous rocks derived from the partial melting of the upper mantle. They are rich in iron and magnesium (mafic) minerals and commonly dark gray in color. The principal type of volcanism on Mars is almost certainly basaltic too. On Earth, basaltic magmas commonly erupt as highly fluid flows, which either emerge directly from vents or form by the coalescence of molten clots at the base of fire fountains (Hawaiian eruption). These styles are also common on Mars, but the lower gravity and atmospheric pressure on Mars allow nucleation of gas bubbles (see above) to occur more readily and at greater depths than on Earth. As a consequence, Martian basaltic volcanoes are also capable of erupting large quantities of ash in Plinian-style eruptions. In a Plinian eruption, hot ash is incorporated into the atmosphere, forming a huge convective column (cloud). If insufficient atmosphere is incorporated, the column may collapse to form pyroclastic flows. Plinian eruptions are rare in basaltic volcanoes on Earth where such eruptions are most commonly associated with silica-rich andesitic or rhyolitic magmas (e.g., Mount St. Helens). Because the lower gravity of Mars generates less buoyancy forces on magma rising through the crust, the magma chambers that feed volcanoes on Mars are thought to be deeper and much larger than those on Earth. If a magma body on Mars is to reach close enough to the surface to erupt before solidifying, it must be big. Consequently, eruptions on Mars are less frequent than on Earth, but are of enormous scale and eruptive rate when they do occur. Somewhat paradoxically, the lower gravity of Mars also allows for longer and more widespread lava flows. Lava eruptions on Mars may be unimaginably huge. A vast lava flow the size of the state of Oregon has recently been described in western Elysium Planitia. The flow is believed to have been emplaced turbulently over the span of several weeks and thought to be one of the youngest lava flows on Mars. X-ray diffraction view of Martian soil – CheMin analysis reveals minerals (including feldspar, pyroxenes and olivine) suggestive of \\"weathered basaltic soils\\" of Hawaiian volcanoes (Curiosity rover at \\"Rocknest\\", 17 October 2012). Each ring is a diffraction peak that corresponds to a specific atom-atom distance, which are unique enough to identify minerals. Smaller rings corresponds to larger features and vice versa. The tectonic settings of volcanoes on Earth and Mars are very different. Most active volcanoes on Earth occur in long, linear chains along plate boundaries, either in zones where the lithosphere is spreading apart (divergent boundaries) or being subducted back into the mantle (convergent boundaries). Because Mars currently lacks plate tectonics, volcanoes there do not show the same global pattern as on Earth. Martian volcanoes are more analogous to terrestrial mid-plate volcanoes, such as those in the Hawaiian Islands, which are thought to have formed over a stationary mantle plume.Carr, M.H. (2007) Mars: Surface and Interior in Encyclopedia of the Solar System, McFadden, L.-A. et al., Eds., Academic Press: San Diego, CA, p. 321. (See hot spot.) The paragenetic tephra from a Hawaiian cinder cone has been mined to create Martian regolith simulant for researchers to use since 1998. The largest and most conspicuous volcanoes on Mars occur in Tharsis and Elysium regions. These volcanoes are strikingly similar to shield volcanoes on Earth. Both have shallow-sloping flanks and summit calderas. The main difference between Martian shield volcanoes and those on Earth is in size: Martian shield volcanoes are truly colossal. For example, the tallest volcano on Mars, Olympus Mons, is 550 km across and 21 km high. It is nearly 100 times greater in volume than Mauna Loa in Hawaii, the largest shield volcano on Earth. Geologists think one of the reasons that volcanoes on Mars are able to grow so large is because Mars lacks plate tectonics. The Martian lithosphere does not slide over the upper mantle (asthenosphere) as on Earth, so lava from a stationary hot spot is able to accumulate at one location on the surface for a billion years or longer. On 17 October 2012, the Curiosity rover on the planet Mars at \\"Rocknest\\" performed the first X-ray diffraction analysis of Martian soil. The results from the rover's CheMin analyzer revealed the presence of several minerals, including feldspar, pyroxenes and olivine, and suggested that the Martian soil in the sample was similar to the \\"weathered basaltic soils\\" of Hawaiian volcanoes. In July 2015, the same rover identified tridymite in a rock sample from Gale Crater, leading scientists to believe that silicic volcanism might have played a much more prevalent role in the planet's volcanic history than previously thought. ==Tharsis volcanic province== MOLA colorized shaded-relief map of western hemisphere of Mars showing Tharsis bulge (shades of red and brown). Tall volcanoes appear white. Viking orbiter image of the three Tharsis Montes: Arsia Mons (bottom), Pavonis Mons (center), and Ascraeus Mons (top) The western hemisphere of Mars is dominated by a massive volcano-tectonic complex known as the Tharsis region or the Tharsis bulge. This immense, elevated structure is thousands of kilometers in diameter and covers up to 25% of the planet's surface. Averaging 7–10 km above datum (Martian \\"sea\\" level), Tharsis contains the highest elevations on the planet. Three enormous volcanoes, Ascraeus Mons, Pavonis Mons, and Arsia Mons (collectively known as the Tharsis Montes), sit aligned northeast–southwest along the crest of the bulge. The vast Alba Mons (formerly Alba Patera) occupies the northern part of the region. The huge shield volcano Olympus Mons lies off the main bulge, at the western edge of the province. Built up by countless generations of lava flows and ash, the Tharsis bulge contains some of the youngest lava flows on Mars, but the bulge itself is believed to be very ancient. Geologic evidence indicates that most of the mass of Tharsis was in place by the end of the Noachian Period, about 3.7 billion years ago (Gya). Tharsis is so massive that it has placed tremendous stresses on the planet's lithosphere, generating immense extensional fractures (grabens and rift valleys) that extend halfway around the planet.Carr, M.H (2007). Mars: Surface and Interior in Encyclopedia of the Solar System, 2nd ed., McFadden, L.-A. et al. Eds. Elsevier: San Diego, CA, p.319 The mass of Tharsis could have even altered the orientation of Mars' rotational axis, causing climate changes. ===Tharsis Montes=== Topographic map centered on Olympus and Tharsis The three Tharsis Montes are shield volcanoes centered near the equator at longitude 247°E. All are several hundred kilometers in diameter and range in height from 14 to 18 km. Arsia Mons, the southernmost of the group, has a large summit caldera that is across and deep. Pavonis Mons, the middle volcano, has two nested calderas with the smaller one being almost deep. Ascraeus Mons in the north, has a complex set of internested calderas and a long history of eruption that is believed to span most of Mars' history. The three Tharsis Montes are about apart. They show a distinctive northeast–southwest alignment that has been the source of some interest. Ceraunius Tholus and Uranius Mons follow the same trend to the northeast, and aprons of young lava flows on the flanks of all three Tharsis Montes are aligned in the same northeast–southwest orientation. This line clearly marks a major structural feature in the Martian crust, but its origin is uncertain. ===Tholi and paterae=== In addition to the large shield volcanoes, Tharsis contains a number of smaller volcanoes called tholi and paterae. The tholi are dome-shaped edifices with flanks that are much steeper than the larger Tharsis shields. Their central calderas are also quite large in proportion to their base diameters. The density of impact craters on many of the tholi indicate they are older than the large shields, having formed between late Noachian and early Hesperian times. Ceraunius Tholus and Uranius Tholus have densely channeled flanks, suggesting that the flank surfaces are made up of easily erodible material, such as ash. The age and morphology of the tholi provide strong evidence that the tholi represent the summits of old shield volcanoes that have been largely buried by great thicknesses of younger lava flows. By one estimate the Tharsis tholi may be buried by up to 4 km of lava. Patera (pl. paterae) is Latin for a shallow drinking bowl. The term was applied to certain ill-defined, scalloped-edged craters that appeared in early spacecraft images to be large volcanic calderas. The smaller paterae in Tharsis appear to be morphologically similar to the tholi, except for having larger calderas. Like the tholi, the Tharsis paterae probably represent the tops of larger, now buried shield volcanoes. Historically, the term patera has been used to describe the entire edifice of certain volcanoes on Mars (e.g., Alba Patera). In 2007, the International Astronomical Union (IAU) redefined the terms Alba Patera, Uranius Patera, and Ulysses Patera to refer only to the central calderas of these volcanoes.

It is located 1200 km northwest of the Tharsis Montes, just off the western edge of the Tharsis bulge. Its summit is 21 km above datum (Mars \\"sea\\" level) and has a central caldera complex consisting of six nested calderas that together form a depression 72 x 91 km wide and 3.2 km deep. As a shield volcano, it has an extremely low profile with shallow slopes averaging between 4–5 degrees. The volcano was built up by many thousands of individual flows of highly fluid lava. An irregular escarpment, in places up to 8 km tall, lies at the base of the volcano, forming a kind of pedestal on which the volcano sits. At various locations around the volcano, immense lava flows can be seen extending into the adjacent plains, burying the escarpment. In medium resolution images (100 m/pixel), the surface of the volcano has a fine radial texture due to the innumerable flows and leveed lava channels that line its flanks.

The flanks of the volcano have extremely low slopes characterized by extensive lava flows and channels. The average flank slope on Alba Mons is only about 0.5°, over five times lower than the slopes on the other Tharsis volcanoes. The volcano has a central edifice 350 km wide and 1.5 km high with a double caldera complex at the summit. Surrounding the central edifice is an incomplete ring of fractures. Flows related to the volcano can be traced as far north as 61°N and as far south as 26°N. If one counts these widespread flow fields, the volcano stretches an immense 2000 km north–south and 3000 km east–west, making it one of the most areally extensive volcanic features in the Solar System. Most geological models suggest that Alba Mons is composed of highly fluid basaltic lava flows, but some researchers have identified possible pyroclastic deposits on the volcano's flanks.Barlow, N.G. (2008). Mars: An Introduction to Its Interior, Surface, and Atmosphere; Cambridge University Press: Cambridge, UK, p. 129. Because Alba Mons lies antipodal to the Hellas impact basin, some researchers have conjectured that the volcano's formation may have been related to crustal weakening from the Hellas impact, which produced strong seismic waves that focused on the opposite side of the planet. ==Elysium volcanic province== MOLA view of Elysium province. Elysium Mons is in the center. Albor Tholus and Hecates Tholus are at bottom and top, respectively. A smaller volcanic center lies several thousand kilometers west of Tharsis in Elysium. The Elysium volcanic complex is about 2,000 kilometers in diameter and consists of three main volcanoes, Elysium Mons, Hecates Tholus, and Albor Tholus. The northwestern edge of the province is characterized by large channels (Granicus and Tinjar Valles) that emerge from several grabens on the flanks of Elysium Mons. The grabens may have formed from subsurface dikes. The dikes may have fractured the cryosphere, releasing large volumes of ground water to form the channels. Associated with the channels are widespread sedimentary deposits that may have formed from mudflows or lahars. The Elysium group of volcanoes is thought to be somewhat different from the Tharsis Montes, in that development of the former involved both lavas and pyroclastics. Elysium Mons is the largest volcanic edifice in the province. It is 375 km across (depending on how one defines the base) and 14 km high. It has single, simple caldera at its summit that measures 14 km wide and 100 m deep. The volcano is distinctly conical in profile, leading some to call it a stratocone; however, given the predominantly low slopes, it is probably a shield. Elysium Mons is only about one-fifth the volume of Arsia Mons. Hecates Tholus is 180 km across and 4.8 km high. The slopes of the volcano are heavily dissected with channels, suggesting that the volcano is composed of easily erodible material such as volcanic ash. The origin of the channels is unknown; they have been atrributed to lava, ash flows, or even water from snow or rainfall. Albor Tholus, the southernmost of the Elysium volcanoes, is 150 km in diameter and 4.1 km high. Its slopes are smoother and less heavily cratered than the slopes of the other Elysium volcanoes.

Location is the Elysium quadrangle. ==Syrtis Major== Syrtis Major Planum is a vast Hesperian-aged shield volcano located within the albedo feature bearing the same name. The volcano is 1200 km in diameter but only 2 km high. It has two calderas, Meroe Patera and Nili Patera. Studies involving the regional gravity field suggest a solidified magma chamber at least 5 km thick lies under the surface. Syrtis Major is of interest to geologists because dacite and granite have been detected there from orbiting spacecraft. Dacites and granites are silica-rich rocks that crystallize from a magma that is more chemically evolved and differentiated than basalt. They may form at the top of a magma chamber after the heavy minerals, such as olivine and pyroxene (those containing iron and magnesium), have settled to the bottom. Dacites and granites are very common on Earth but rare on Mars. ==Arabia Terra== Arabia Terra is a large upland region in the north of Mars that lies mostly in the Arabia quadrangle. Several irregularly shaped craters found within the region represent a type of highland volcanic construct which, all together, represent a martian igneous province. Low- relief paterae within the region possess a range of geomorphic features, including structural collapse, effusive volcanism and explosive eruptions, that are similar to terrestrial supervolcanoes. The enigmatic highland ridged plains in the region may have been formed, in part, by the related flow of lavas. ==Highland paterae== Viking orbiter view of Peneus Patera (left) and Amphitrites Patera (right). Both are ancient volcanic edifices southwest of Hellas. In the southern hemisphere, particularly around the Hellas impact basin, are several flat-lying volcanic structures called highland paterae These volcanoes are some of the oldest identifiable volcanic edifices on Mars.Head, J.W. (2007). The Geology of Mars: New Insights and Outstanding Questions in The Geology of Mars: Evidence from Earth-Based Analogs, Chapman, M., Ed; Cambridge University Press: Cambridge UK, p. 11. They are characterized by having extremely low profiles with highly eroded ridges and channels that radiate outward from a degraded, central caldera complex. They include Hadriaca Patera, Amphitrites Patera, Tyrrhena Patera, Peneus Patera, and Pityusa Patera. Geomorphologic evidence suggests that the highland patera were produced through a combination of lava flows and pyroclastics from the interaction of magma with water. Some researchers speculate that the location of the highland paterae around Hellas is due to deep-seated fractures caused by the impact that provided conduits for magma to rise to the surface. Although they are not very high, some paterae cover large areas—Amphritrites Patera, for example, covers a larger area than Olympus Mons. ==Volcanic plains== Volcanic plains are widespread on Mars. Two types of plains are commonly recognized: those where lava flow features are common, and those where flow features are generally absent but a volcanic origin is inferred by other characteristics. Plains with abundant lava flow features occur in and around the large volcanic provinces of Tharsis and Elysium. Flow features include both sheet flow and tube- and channel-fed flow morphologies. Sheet flows show complex, overlapping flow lobes and may extend for many hundreds of kilometers from their source areas. Lava flows can form a lava tube when the exposed upper layers of lava cool and solidify to form a roof while the lava underneath continues flowing. Often, when all the remaining lava leaves the tube, the roof collapses to make a channel or line of pit craters (catena). An unusual type of flow feature occurs in the Cerberus plains south of Elysium and in Amazonis. These flows have a broken platey texture, consisting of dark, kilometer-scale slabs embedded in a light-toned matrix. They have been attributed to rafted slabs of solidified lava floating on a still-molten subsurface. Others have claimed the broken slabs represent pack ice that froze over a sea that pooled in the area after massive releases of groundwater from the Cerberus Fossae area. The second type of volcanic plains (ridged plains) are characterized by abundant wrinkle ridges. Volcanic flow features are rare or absent. The ridged plains are believed to be regions of extensive flood basalts, by analogy with the lunar maria. Ridged plains make up about 30% of the Martian surface and are most prominent in Lunae, Hesperia, and Malea Plana, as well as throughout much of the northern lowlands. Ridged plains are all Hesperian in age and represent a style of volcanism globally predominant during that time period. The Hesperian Period is named after the ridged plains in Hesperia Planum. ==Potential current volcanism== HiRISE image of possible rootless cones east of Elysium region. The chains of rings are interpreted to be caused by steam explosions when lava moved over ground that was rich in water ice. Rootless Cones\\" on Mars – due to lava flows interacting with water (MRO, 4 January 2013) () Scientists have never recorded an active volcano eruption on the surface of Mars; moreover, searches for thermal signatures and surface changes within the last decade have not yielded any positive evidence for active volcanism. However, the European Space Agency's Mars Express orbiter photographed lava flows interpreted in 2004 to have occurred within the past two million years, suggesting a relatively recent geologic activity. An updated study in 2011 estimated that the youngest lava flows occurred in the last few tens of millions of years. The authors consider this age makes it possible that Mars is not yet volcanically extinct. The InSight lander mission will determine if there is any seismic activity, measure the amount of heat flow from the interior, estimate the size of Mars' core and whether the core is liquid or solid. ===Volcanoes and ice=== Large amounts of water ice are believed to be present in the Martian subsurface. The interaction of ice with molten rock can produce distinct landforms. On Earth, when hot volcanic material comes into contact with surface ice, large amounts of liquid water and mud may form that flow catastrophically down slope as massive debris flows (lahars). Some channels in Martian volcanic areas, such as Hrad Vallis near Elysium Mons, may have been similarly carved or modified by lahars. (via archive.org) Lava flowing over water-saturated ground can cause the water to erupt violently in an explosion of steam (see phreatic eruption), producing small volcano-like landforms called pseudocraters, or rootless cones. Features that resemble terrestrial rootless cones occur in Elysium, Amazonis, and Isidis and Chryse Planitiae.Fagents, F.A.; Thordarson, T. (2007). Rootless Volcanic Cones in Iceland and on Mars, in The Geology of Mars: Evidence from Earth-Based Analogs, Chapman, M., Ed; Cambridge University Press: Cambridge UK, pp. 151–177. Also, phreatomagmatism produce tuff rings or tuff cones on Earth and existence of similar landforms on Mars is expected too. Their existence was suggested from Nepenthes/Amenthes region. Finally, when a volcano erupts under an ice sheet, it can form a distinct, mesa-like landform called a tuya or table mountain. Some researchersChapman, M.G.; Smellie, J.L. (2007). Mars Interior Layered Deposits and Terrestrial Sub-Ice Volcanoes Compared: Observations and Interpretations of Similar Geomorphic Characteristics, in The Geology of Mars: Evidence from Earth-Based Analogs, Chapman, M., Ed; Cambridge University Press: Cambridge UK, pp. 178–207. cite geomorphic evidence that many of the layered interior deposits in Valles Marineris may be the Martian equivalent of tuyas. THEMIS image of Hrad Vallis. This valley may have formed when eruptions in the Elysium Mons volcanic complex melted ground or surface ice. == Tectonic boundaries == Tectonic boundaries have been discovered on Mars. Valles Marineris is a horizontally sliding tectonic boundary that divides two major partial or complete plates of Mars. The recent finding suggests that Mars is geologically active with occurrences in the millions of years. There has been previous evidence of Mars' geologic activity. The Mars Global Surveyor (MGS) discovered magnetic stripes in the crust of Mars, especially in the Phaethontis and Eridania quadrangles. The magnetometer on MGS discovered 100 km wide stripes of magnetized crust running roughly parallel for up to 2000 km. These stripes alternate in polarity with the north magnetic pole of one pointing up from the surface and the north magnetic pole of the next pointing down. When similar stripes were discovered on Earth in the 1960s, they were taken as evidence of plate tectonics. However, there are some differences, between the magnetic stripes on Earth and those on Mars. The Martian stripes are wider, much more strongly magnetized, and do not appear to spread out from a middle crustal spreading zone. Because the area with the magnetic stripes is about 4 billion years old, it is believed that the global magnetic field probably lasted for only the first few hundred million years of Mars' life. At that time the temperature of the molten iron in the planet's core might have been high enough to mix it into a magnetic dynamo. Younger rock does not show any stripes. When molten rock containing magnetic material, such as hematite (Fe2O3), cools and solidifies in the presence of a magnetic field, it becomes magnetized and takes on the polarity of the background field. This magnetism is lost only if the rock is subsequently heated above the Curie temperature, which is 770 °C for pure iron, but lower for oxides such as hematite (approximately 650 °C) or magnetite (approximately 580 °C). The magnetism left in rocks is a record of the magnetic field when the rock solidified. Mars crustal magnetism Mars' volcanic features can be likened to Earth's geologic hotspots. Pavonis Mons is the middle of three volcanoes (collectively known as Tharsis Montes) on the Tharsis bulge near the equator of the planet Mars. The other Tharsis volcanoes are Ascraeus Mons and Arsia Mons. The three Tharsis Montes, together with some smaller volcanoes to the north, form a straight line. This arrangement suggests that they were formed by a crustal plate moving over a hot spot. Such an arrangement exists in the Earth's Pacific Ocean as the Hawaiian Islands. The Hawaiian Islands are in a straight line, with the youngest in the south and the oldest in the north. So geologists believe the plate is moving while a stationary plume of hot magma rises and punches through the crust to produce volcanic mountains. However, the largest volcano on the planet, Olympus Mons, is thought to have formed when the plates were not moving. Olympus Mons may have formed just after the plate motion stopped. The mare-like plains on Mars are roughly 3 to 3.5 billion years old. The giant shield volcanoes are younger, formed between 1 and 2 billion years ago. Olympus Mons may be \\"as young as 200 million years.\\" Norman H. Sleep, professor of geophysics at Stanford University, described how the three volcanoes that form a line along the Tharsis Ridge may be extinct island arc volcanoes like the Japanese Island chain.http://news.stanford.edu/pr/93/93/206Arc3014.html ==See also== *Geology of Mars *Geysers on Mars *Marsquake *Volcanology of Venus *Volcanology of Io ==References Bibliography == * * ==External links== *The Volcanoes of Mars *Geology of Mars – Volcanism ","title":"Volcanism on Mars"},{"id":"20386575","text":"\\"Still Life with Fish,\\" oil on canvas, Edward Chalmers Leavitt, 1886 Edward Chalmers Leavitt (1842–1904), a native of Providence, Rhode Island, was an early New England painter said to be the most renowned still life painter of his day in Providence, although today he is largely forgotten. Leavitt was born March 9, 1842, the son of Providence pastor Rev. Jonathan Leavitt and his wife Charlotte Esther (Stearns) Leavitt. Leavitt's father Rev. Jonathan Leavitt, was born at Cornish, New Hampshire, and later settled in the ministry at Bedford, Massachusetts, where he married the daughter of the primary minister Rev. Stearns, and subsequently was ordained minister of Richmond Street Congregational Church in Providence, where he remained for a quarter of a century.Biographical Record of the Alumni of Amherst College, 1821-1871, William Lewis Montague, Edward Payson Crowell, Walter Stanley Biscoe, Amherst, Mass., 1883 Rev. Leavitt's son Edward Chalmers Leavitt, born in Providence, attended private schools in Providence, and Kimball Union Academy in Meriden, New Hampshire. (His only sister Charlotte married Edward Slocum of Providence.)Stearns Genealogy and Memoirs, Avis Stearns Van Wagenen, Courier Printing Company, Syracuse, N.Y., 1901 At the outbreak of the American Civil War, Leavitt enlisted at Boston in the United States Navy with his friend William Warren Flint of Walpole, New Hampshire.New England Families, Genealogical and Memorial: A Record of the Achievements of Her People in the Making of Commonwealths and the Founding of a Nation, Vol. II, ed. by William Richard Cutter, Lewis historical publishing company, 1915 During his Navy service, Leavitt frequently practiced his drawing technique. Little is known of Leavitt's career. Most of his paintings featured tabletop arrangements of flowers, fruit, antiques and vintage bric-a-brac, and were sought after by the Victorian middle class. The oil on canvas paintings often were marked by their sense of texture. During the 1870s and 1880s Leavitt frequently exhibited at the National Academy of Design. But as the new century approached, Leavitt's output and quality declined, and his reputation faded. New England Beach Scene, watercolor, 1886-1887 There are indications that during his career, Leavitt worked with the gifted Martin Heade.The Life and Work of Martin Johnson Heade: A Critical Analysis and Catalogue Raisonné. Theodore E. Stebbins, Janet L. Comey, Martin Johnson Heade, Karen E. Quinn, Yale University Press, 2000, , Leavitt was known to have studied earlier with local artist James Morgan Lewin, a painter of romantic canvases. During his career, Leavitt painted thousands of canvases, turning out his trademark paintings of flowers, fruit and dead fish and game for a hungry middle class anxious for artworks to decorate their newly acquired homes. At one time, Leavitt's still lifes decorated Boston's esteemed Parker House hotel as well as the Narragansett Hotel in Providence. Leavitt worked at his studio at the Hoppin Homestead Building in Providence. Among the artists of the day, Leavitt was seen as a solid—if uninspired—craftsman. Painter Charles Walter Stetson, for instance, didn't disguise his contempt for Leavitt's steady output for the upper middle classes, which Stetson saw as influenced by the Fall River school. \\"Artists! they are not artists,\\" wrote Stetson in a fit of pique. \\"Leavitt himself said to me 'After all, Mr. Stetson, say what we may, we are only dry goods merchants in another line.\\"Charles Walter Stetson: Color and Fantasy, Charles C.

These five highways are service roads that parallel and provide access to U.S. Route 50 and US 301 along their western approach to the Chesapeake Bay Bridge; the highways also provide access to Sandy Point State Park. The first modern highway from Cape St. Claire to Skidmore was constructed in the late 1920s and replaced by the modern alignment of US 50 in the late 1940s. The frontage roads on either side of the U.S. Highway were constructed in the early 1950s. The mainline segments of MD 908 assumed their present form when US 50 and US 301 were upgraded to a freeway in the early 1990s. ==Route description== There are three mainline segments of MD 908 and two additional segments of the highway at Skidmore. *MD 908A runs from US 50 and US 301 east along the eastbound side of the U.S. Highways to MD 179 near Cape St. Claire. *MD 908B has a length of from MD 931R near Cape St. Claire east along the westbound side of US 50 and US 301 to MD 908D in Skidmore. *MD 908C extends from MD 179 near Cape St. Claire east along the eastbound side of the U.S. Highways to the end of state maintenance just east of MD 908D in Skidmore. ===Eastbound frontage=== MD 908A begins at the state highway begins as the Exit 29A ramp from eastbound US 50 and US 301 (Blue Star Memorial Highway). The highway heads east as Buschs Frontage Road, which gains a westbound lane and closely parallels the eastbound direction of US 50-301. After passing an on-ramp to the freeway, the state highway veers around a loop ramp from MD 179's interchange with the U.S. Highways and reaches its eastern terminus at MD 179 (St. Margarets Road). The roadway continues on the east side of the intersection as MD 908C. That highway heads east as Whitehall Road, which passes around another loop of the interchange and briefly parallels the freeway before temporarily moving away for an interchange with the eastbound direction of the freeway. MD 908C returns to paralleling the freeway and reaches the county-maintained north-south segment of Whitehall Road. The north leg of the intersection is a right-in/right-out interchange with eastbound US 50 and US 301. MD 908C continues east as Skidmore Drive, which veers around the U.S. Highways' interchange with MD 908D (Oceanic Drive), intersecting Holly Beach Farm Road, which is MD 931Y. The state highway meets the southern end of MD 908D (Oceanic Drive), just east of which the highway reaches its eastern terminus. The roadway continues east as Old Ferry Slip Road. ===Westbound frontage=== View east along MD 908B in Skidmore MD 908B begins in Cape St. Claire where East College Parkway makes a 90-degree turn east to closely parallel the westbound lanes of US 50 and US 301; the north-south segment of East College Parkway is unsigned MD 931R. MD 908B closely parallels the freeway until the highway approaches MD 908D (Oceanic Drive). After passing a ramp to westbound US 50 and US 301, MD 908B reaches its eastern terminus at the northern end of MD 908D (Oceanic Drive). The roadway continues east as South Beach Road, the entrance to Sandy Point State Park. ===Skidmore=== *MD 908D is the designation for Oceanic Drive, a service road that connects MD 908C and MD 908B in Skidmore and crosses over and has a partial cloverleaf interchange with US 50 and US 301. This interchange is the closest interchange to the western end of the Chesapeake Bay Bridge and its toll plaza. The four-way intersection at MD 908D's northern terminus includes the county-maintained continuation of Oceanic Drive and the access road to Sandy Point State Park. *MD 908E is the designation for Admin Service Road, a one-lane road that connects the ramp from MD 908D to westbound US 50 and US 301 to the Chesapeake Bay Bridge administration building. The highway is maintained by the Maryland Transportation Authority. ==History== The corridor today used by US 50, US 301, and MD 908 was originally constructed as an eastward extension of MD 179 from St. Margarets to Skidmore in 1928. Between 1942 and 1944, a ferry terminal was constructed at Sandy Point as the new western end of the Annapolis-Matapeake ferry. A highway was constructed from MD 2 east to the new terminal along the alignment of the modern US 50 freeway. This highway, which was designated a westward extension of MD 404 by 1946, replaced the portion of MD 179 east of what is now MD 908B's western terminus. MD 404 was expanded to a four-lane divided highway in 1948 and 1949. US 50 replaced MD 404 when the U.S. Highway was extended east from Annapolis to Ocean City in 1949 in anticipation of the Chesapeake Bay Bridge, which opened in 1952. Between 1952 and 1954, of service roads were constructed parallel to US 50. These service roads included MD 908A from its western terminus to where the highway veers away from US 50 and US 301 at the west end of the MD 179 interchange; MD 908C from where that highway veers away from the U.S. Highways at the east end of the MD 179 interchange to Holly Beach Farm Road; MD 908B between Log Inn Road and Bay Head Road; and MD 908B from the right-angle turn at MD 931R east to Stacey Lane. It is not clear when these frontage roads received the MD 908 designation. MD 908D was constructed when the U.S. Highways' interchange with Oceanic Drive was built in 1974. The gap in MD 908B was filled by 1978. US 50 and US 301 were reconstructed as a freeway from MD 2 to the Chesapeake Bay Bridge in 1991, including a new interchange with MD 179. The four segments of MD 908 assumed their present courses as part of that project. MD 908E was assigned near the Chesapeake Bay Bridge toll plaza in 2009. ==Junction lists== All sections of MD 908 are entirely within Anne Arundel County. ===MD 908A and MD 908C=MD 908B=See also== * ==References *MDRoads: MD 908 908 Maryland Route 908 ","title":"Maryland Route 908"},{"id":"20386683","text":"Horace Mann Middle School or Horace Mann Junior High School may refer to: * Horace Mann Junior High School, Chesterfield Square, Los Angeles * Horace Mann Middle School, San Diego, California, a secondary school in San Diego * Horace Mann Middle School, a Miami-Dada County public school, Florida * Horace Mann Middle School, Brandon, Florida * Horace Mann Middle School, a former school at the site of King Science and Technology Magnet Center, Omaha, Nebraska * Horace Mann Junior High School, Baytown, Texas; part of the Goose Creek Consolidated Independent School District * Horace Mann Middle School, Charleston, West Virginia * Horace Mann Middle School, Sheboygan, Wisconsin; part of Sheboygan Area School District * Horace Mann Middle School, Wausau, Wisconsin ==See also== * Horace Mann School (disambiguation) * Horace Mann (disambiguation) * Mann Arts and Science Magnet Middle School, Little Rock, Arkansas; formerly known as Horace Mann Junior High School ","title":"Horace Mann Middle School"},{"id":"20386693","text":"The 1915 Ohio State Buckeyes football team represented Ohio State University in the 1915 college football season.

The opera has been performed in modern times, for instance at the London Handel Festival in 2000 and at the Handel Festival, Halle in 2015. ==Roles== Caricature of Valentino Urbani, who created the role of Silla. {  + !Role !Voice type !Premiere cast, 2 June 1713 - Silla, Roman dictator alto castrato Valentino Urbani (\\"Valentini\\") - Metella, Silla's wife soprano Probably Elisabetta Pilotti-Schiavonetti - Lepido, tribune soprano castrato Valeriano Pellegrini - Flavia, Lepido's wife soprano Francesca Margherita de L'Epine - Claudio, senator, Celia's lover contralto Jane Barbier - Celia, Catulus' daughter soprano  Maria Manina-Fletcher-Seedo - The god Mars bass Richard Leveridge - Scabro silent  } ==Synopsis== Bust of Sulla, called \\"Silla\\" in the opera. ===Act 1=== *Scene: Rome, at the time of the Republic, about 81 B.C. The military leader Silla returns victorious to Rome, having subdued both rebellious foreign populations and his own personal enemy, Mario (the historical Gaius Marius) and his army. Silla passes through a specially constructed triumphal arch as trumpets sound and the populace acclaim him. When Silla announces that he is proclaiming himself dictator and sole law-giver for Rome, however, both his wife Metella and the tribune Lepido are appalled. Flavia, Lepido's wife, tells him of bad dreams she has been having about dangers to Rome but Lepido dismisses this as superstition. Celia, daughter of a high-ranking statesman who also opposed Silla's enemy Mario, is in love with the senator Claudio and he with her but she cannot bring herself to accept him as he is a supporter of Mario. Claudio confronts Silla and accuses him of destroying Roman liberty. Silla is furious and refuses to hear it, but, left alone, Claudio vows to continue to struggle against tyranny. ===Act 2=== Silla is discovered by his wife Metella attempting to seduce the lovely Celia. Metella puts a stop to this, for the moment. Silla next attempts the virtue of Lepido's wife Flavia, at her home. Lepido discovers him and intervenes, whereupon Silla accuses Lepido of conspiring with others to overthrow him and orders both Lepido and his wife to be imprisoned, awaiting execution. Husband and wife tearfully bid farewell. Celia has overcome her scruples about accepting a supporter of her father's enemy, Mario, and has admitted she loves Claudio. The couple are basking in their happiness when Claudio is placed under arrest for conspiring against Silla and also sentenced to death. Metella learns of her husband's cruel and tyrannical orders from her servant Scabro and vows to prevent them from being carried out. In the tower where he is imprisoned, Claudio can see the arena where he has been condemned to be torn apart by wild beasts and says farewell to life. Metella takes a garment she has soaked with animal blood and tells her servant Scabro to take it to Silla and tell him it is Lepido's, shed when he was executed. Silla is pleased but still wants to see Claudio torn by beasts. News is brought to Silla that the supporters of Mario are staging a new rebellion and Silla rushes off to quell it. Metella orders both Claudio and Lepido released from prison. ===Act 3=== Mars, god of war. Lepido thanks Metella for rescuing him and announces his intention to assassinate Silla in order to restore Roman freedom. Metella refuses to have anything to do with such a plot against her husband. They receive word that Silla is leaving Rome. While Metella regrets that she has not been able to say good-bye to him, she seizes the opportunity to tell her servant Scabro to take Lepido to his wife Flavia in her prison cell and help her to escape. Silla regrets the necessity of leaving Rome without satisfying his desires towards either Celia or Flavia. He attempts to seduce Celia again, but she repulses him and he informs her that her beloved Claudio has been torn alive by wild beasts and leaves her. Celia laments her lover's death and hears an echo of her words - it is Claudio himself, who has been listening. At first she thinks it must be a ghost, but she is then overjoyed to be re-united with the living Claudio. More or less the same scenario then occurs in Flavia's prison cell where she awaits death. Silla appears with the bloodstained garment, telling her it is what her husband was wearing when he was shot by arrows, and threatens her with the same fate unless she will yield herself to his lust. She refuses, whereupon Silla storms out. Lepido appears to his wife and at first she too believes she is seeing a ghost, but he reassures her and they express their delight. At the port where Silla is embarking to leave Rome, his wife Metella appears to bid him farewell. He expresses his regret at his treatment of her and the couple hope one day they will again be able to be together. Metella watches from the shore as the ship Silla is on flounders in a storm and sinks. Silla escapes the wreck and swims to a nearby island, Metella gets into a little boat, rows out to him and rescues her husband. Lepido and Claudio are at the Capitol rallying their supporters for a revolt against Silla's monstrous tyranny when the god Mars appears on a cloud and announces Rome's salvation. Metella leads in her repentant husband, who extends apologies to all for his behaviour and announces his retirement to a small estate where he will live quietly with his wife. Claudio and Celia will now marry. All rejoice in the fortunate outcome of events. ==Context and analysis== The German-born Handel, after spending some of his early career composing operas and other pieces in Italy, settled in London, where in 1711 he had brought Italian opera for the first time with his opera Rinaldo. A tremendous success, Rinaldo created a craze in London for Italian opera seria, a form focused overwhelmingly on solo arias for the star virtuoso singers. Rinaldo, a \\"magic\\" opera featuring enchantments, sorceresses and scenic ingenuity, was followed by Il Pastor Fido, a shorter and simpler opera, which was not a success with London audiences at its first performances. The occasion for which Silla was written is not known and the presence of a part for a non-singing actor (Scabro) in a Handel opera is a unique feature of Silla for which the reason is again unknown. The work is scored for strings, two recorders, two oboes, bassoon, trumpet, and continuo instruments. ==Recordings== Handel: Silla – London Handel Orchestra *Conductor: Denys Darlow *Principal singers: James Bowman (Silla), Joanne Lunn (Lepido), Simon Baker (Claudio), Rachel Nicholls (Metella), Natasha Marsh (Flavia), Elizabeth Cragg (Celia), Christopher Dixon (The god) *Recording date: 11 April 2000 *Label: SOMM Recordings – 227-8 (CD) Handel: Silla – Europa Galante *Conductor: Fabio Biondi *Principal singers: Sonia Prina (Silla), Vivica Genaux (Lepido), Martina Belli (Claudio), Sunhae Im (Metella), Roberta Invernizzi (Flavia), Francesca Lombardi Mazzulli (Celia), Luca Tittoto (Il Dio) *Recording date: 28-30 January 2017 *Label: Glossa Music ==References== Sources *Hicks, Anthony (1998), \\"Silla\\", in The New Grove Dictionary of Opera, ed.

The railway ran from Windsor to Annapolis Royal and leased connections to Nova Scotia's capital of Halifax. The W&AR; played a major role in developing Nova Scotia's agriculture and tourism industries, operating from 1869 until 1894 when it evolved into the larger Dominion Atlantic Railway. The locomotive Gabriel in Kentville, Nova Scotia; one of the W&AR;'s Fox, Walker and Company broad gauge locomotives The W&AR; was formed by British railway investors and Nova Scotian railway promoters in 1864. The company's operations centre was in Kentville, although corporate headquarters remained in London, United Kingdom. The Windsor and Annapolis negotiated running rights over the government-owned \\"Windsor Branch\\" of the Nova Scotia Railway to connect Windsor to the city and harbour of Halifax. Vernon Smith, an experienced railway manager and engineer from Britain was the engineer in charge of construction and became the first general manager. The resident engineer was Henry Ernest Milner, also from England. Construction began in 1866 with locomotives landed for work crews at Windsor, Wolfville, Nova Scotia and Kentville. The line began operation between Kentville and Annapolis Royal on June 26, 1869 while work continued on the line's two large bridges east of Kentville over the large estuaries of the Avon River at Windsor and the Gaspereau River at Hortonville. An official opening was celebrated on August 18, 1869 with dignitaries including Lord Lisgar the Governor General of Canada arriving by rail from Halifax, although shuttled over the uncompleted bridge works by stage coach. The devastating Saxby Gale on October 5, 1869 destroyed much of the newly built line between Hortonville and Wolfville which required hasty rebuilding. Despite these challenges, the railway opened for full operation on December 18, 1869 when the Avon and Gaspereau Bridges were complete and first train ran across the entire line from Halifax to Annapolis Royal.Marguerite Woodworth, History of the Dominion Atlantic Railway, Kentville Publishing (1937) pp. 66-70 Map of the Windsor & Annapolis and the Western Counties railways in 1885 The railway struggled at first with inexperienced staff, limited equipment and especially with extensive and ongoing repairs required on the sections of the line along the Minas Basin damaged by the Saxby Gale. However passenger traffic quickly blossomed, helped by early tourism promotion of steamship connections to the emerging New England tourism market. Freight traffic began more slowly but an explosion in apple shipments in the early 1880s ensured the prosperity of the line. The railway was built at first to the Canadian broad gauge of . It converted to the standard gauge of in 1875. The W&AR; bought out the thriving branchline, the Cornwallis Valley Railway in 1890 which ran from Kentville to Kingsport through rich apple districts. ==Merger and renaming== \\"Work at the Trestle\\" sculpture by Ruth Abernethy in Wolfville, Nova Scotia showing the Vernon Smith planning the W&AR.; A formidable rival to the W&AR; was the Western Counties Railway (WCR), based in Yarmouth, Nova Scotia, which used political allies to threaten the exclusive W&AR; access to the critical \\"Windsor Branch\\" connection into Halifax. However, the W&AR; was able to buy out the WCR in 1894 to create the Dominion Atlantic Railway, thus providing a through line from Halifax to Yarmouth. The W&AR; set the direction for the new united company which took over the W&AR; headquarters in Kentville as well as the W&AR;'s \\"Land of Evangeline\\" identity. The Windsor and Hantsport Railway continued to operate over portions of the old Windsor and Annapolis mainline until 2011.

Just like in an electrostatic interaction where a region of negative charge interacts with a positive charge, the electron-rich π system can interact with a metal (cationic or neutral), an anion, another molecule and even another π system.Anslyn, E.V.; Dougherty, D.A. Modern Physical Organic Chemistry; University Science Books; Sausalito, CA, 2005 Non-covalent interactions involving π systems are pivotal to biological events such as protein-ligand recognition. ==Types== The most common types of π-interactions involve: *Metal–π interactions: involves interaction of a metal and the face of a π system, the metal can be a cation (known as cation–π interactions) or neutral *Polar–π interactions: involves interaction of a polar molecule and quadrupole moment a π system. Polar π interaction between water molecule and benzene *Aromatic–aromatic interactions (π stacking): involves interactions of aromatic molecules with each other. **Arene–perfluoroarene interaction: electron-rich benzene ring interacts with electron-poor hexafluorobenzene. Arene perfluoroarene stacking *π donor–acceptor interactions: interaction between low energy empty orbital (acceptor) and a high-energy filled orbital (donor). Donor-acceptor interaction between hexamethylbenzene (donor) and tetracyanoethylene (acceptor) *Anion–π interactions: interaction of anion with π system *Cation–π interactions: interaction of a cation with a π system *C–H–π interactions: interaction of C-H with π system: These interactions are well studied using experimental as well as computational techniques. ==Metal–π interactions== Metal–π interactions play a major role in organometallics. Linear and cyclic π systems bond to metals allowing organic complexes to bond to metals. ===Linear systems=== Ethylene – π In the most simple linear π systems, bonding to metals takes place by two interactions. Electron density is donated directly to the metal like a sigma bond would be formed. Also, the metal can donate electron density back to the linear π system (ethylene) from the metal’s d orbital to the empty π* orbital of ethylene.Miessler, G.A.; Tarr, D.A. Inorganic Chemistry. Pearson Education, Inc. 2010 Electron density donated to the alkene π* orbitalElectron density donated to the metal like a Sigma bond Allyl–π Allyl groups can bond to metals as trihapto or monohapto ligands. Monohapto ligands bind mostly sigma orbitals and trihapto ligands bind using delocalized π orbitals. In essence the monohapto ligand binds the metal as an allyl group and the trihapto ligand binds over all three carbons, where the lowest energy π orbital donates electron density and the highest energy π orbital accepts electron density. The allyl complex is diverse because it can alter the metal's electron count by transferring between a monohapto (1 electron, η1) and trihapto ligand (3 electrons, η3). This fluctuation allows stability when a two-electron-donating group bonds or breaks from the metal. ===Cyclic systems=== The specifics for binding of π cyclic systems are much more complex and depend on the electrons, the HOMO, and the LUMO in each individual case of molecules. Cyclic π systems can bind monohapto or polyhapto depending on the individual situation. This means that π bonds can bind individually to the metal or there can be a single bond from the center of a benzene or cyclopentadienyl complex. Of course the bonding modes (η1, η3, η5, etc.) determine the number of donated electrons (1, 3, 5, etc.). The diversity of these cyclic complexes allows for a seemingly endless number of metallic structures. ===Catalysis=== The use of organometallic structures led by π–metal bonding plays an enormous role in the catalysis of organic reactions. The Stille reaction is a widely known and important reaction in organic synthesis. π interactions with the Pd catalyst in this reaction are almost necessary in pushing this reaction to completion (alkyl groups transfer is rather slow).Laszlo, K.; Czako, B. Strategic Applications of Named Reactions in Organic Synthesis, Elsevier Academic Press, Other widely known reactions based on π–metal catalysis interactions are: *Heck reaction *Hiyama coupling *Kumada coupling *Negishi coupling *Petasis reaction *Sonogashira coupling *Suzuki reaction. π–metal interactions can also be involved directly with the function of ligands on the catalyst. Chemistry involving nickel catalysis of Suzuki reactions was greatly affected by pyrazoles and pyrazolates acting as coplanar ligand. The π interactions tied multiple pyrazoles and pyrazolates together around the nickel metal to cause reaction results. Another π metal interaction directly involved with catalysis involves π stacking. Ferrocene is the standard example where the metal (iron) is trapped in between two cyclopentadienyl ligands. These interactions are commonly referred to as sandwich compounds. Specific research Due to reasons explained earlier in the article, the bonding between a nucleophilic olefin and an electrophilic palladium(II) leaves olefin susceptible to nucleophilic attack. This is true if the olefin is coordinated around Pd as the corner of a square planar complex or as the side of a cationic 18-electron Pd complex. In both cases electron donating groups on the olefin stabilize the complex, but anionic electron donors actually destabilized the complex in the case of the 18-electron Pd complex. The authors of this research proposed that when the olefin π bond is aligned on the side of the square planar Pd complex, the π* backfilling of electron density from Pd to olefin is enhanced because the more electron withdrawing orbital of the π complex can overlap better with the electron donating orbital of Pd. Interaction between benzene and an anion, \\"X−\\" ==Anion–π interactions== Anion and π–aromatic systems (typically electron-deficient) create an interaction that is associated with the repulsive forces of the structures. These repulsive forces involve electrostatic and anion-induced polarized interactions.Ballester P. \\"Anions and pi–Aromatic Systems. Do they interact attractively?\\" Recognition of Anions. Structure and Bonding Series, 129 (2008) 127-174 Berlin. Springer Verlag This force allows for the systems to be used as receptors and channels in supramolecular chemistry for applications in the medical (synthetic membranes, ion channels) and environmental fields (e.g. sensing, removal of ions from water). The first X-ray crystal structure that depicted anion–π interactions was reported in 2004. In addition to this being depicted in the solid state, there is also evidence that the interaction is present in solution. ==π-effects in biological systems== Reaction of SAM with nucleophile π-effects have an important contribution to biological systems since they provide a significant amount of binding enthalpy. Neurotransmitters produce most of their biological effect by binding to the active site of a protein receptor. Pioneering work of Dennis A. Dougherty is a proof that such kind of binding stabilization is the effect of cation-π interactions of the acetylcholine (Ach) neurotransmitter. The structure of acetylcholine esterase includes 14 highly conserved aromatic residues. The trimethyl ammonium group of Ach binds to the aromatic residue of tryptophan (Trp). The indole site provides a much more intense region of negative electrostatic potential than benzene and phenol residue of Phe and Tyr. S-Adenosyl methionine (SAM) can act as a catalyst for the transfer of methyl group from the sulfonium compound to nucleophile. The nucleophile can be any of a broad range structures including nucleic acids, proteins, sugars or C=C bond of lipids or steroids. The van der Waals contact between S-CH3 unit of SAM and the aromatic face of a Trp residue, in favorable alignment for catalysis assisted by cation-π interaction. A great deal of circumstantial evidence places aromatic residues in the active site of a number of proteins that interact with cations but the presence of cation-π interaction in biological system does not rule out the conventional ion-pair interaction. In fact there is a good evidence for the existence of both type of interaction in model system. == In supramolecular assembly == Examples of \\\\pi-\\\\pi , CH-\\\\pi , and \\\\pi -cation interactions systems are important building blocks in supramolecular assembly because of their versatile noncovalent interactions with various functional groups. Particularly, \\\\pi - \\\\pi , CH-\\\\pi and \\\\pi -cation interactions are widely used in supramolecular assembly and recognition. \\\\pi-\\\\pi concerns the direct interactions between two -systems; and cation-\\\\pi interaction arises from the electrostatic interaction of a cation with the face of the -system. Unlike these two interactions, the CH-\\\\pi interaction arises mainly from charge transfer between the C–H orbital and the -system. ==References== Category:Intermolecular forces ","title":"Pi interaction"},{"id":"20386835","text":"is a 1928 black and white Japanese silent film with benshi accompaniment directed by Shozo Makino and Sadatsugu Matsuda.

As a young man, Francisci fought in World War II and was awarded the Croix de Guerre. Following the war, he developed a business empire that included casinos in Britain, France and Lebanon.Time.com: The Milieu of the Corsican Godfathers Francisci served in the general council (conseil général) of the Corse-du-Sud (UDR) and was a member of the Civic Action Service (SAC), a Gaullist militia. He was assassinated in Paris in 1982. ==Biography== Marcel Francisci was born in Corsica circa 1919 or 1920. As a young man, he fought with the Free French Forces in Italy during World War II and was awarded four medalsFrance-Soir (Paris), 7 September 1971 for acts of heroism, including the Croix de Guerre. After the armistice with Italy, he was recruited into the Corsican Mafia by Jo Renucci and began smuggling cigarettes and silk stockings between Tangiers and Marseilles. During this time, he also established narcotics contacts in various Arab countries. In 1947 Renucci and Francisci become anti-Communist strongmen for the Rally of the French People (RDF), the forerunner of the present-day Gaullist Party (UDR). Seizing the opportunity, Francisci befriended members of the political coterie of Charles de Gaulle. Francisci's influence in the party grew with his bank account and he would later become a leader of the Gaullist Party in Corsica. When Renucci died in November 1958, Francisci gained control of his criminal empire. Though Francisci was in charge, he returned to Paris and delegated authority of heroin distribution in Marseilles to underlings. In Paris, Francisci spent much of his time befriending politicians and investing his wealth in casinos. He was the owner of a lucrative international gambling syndicate with lavish casinos in Paris, London and Beirut. He ran the prestigious Cercle Hausmann in Paris. Throughout the 1960s, Francisci was supposedly involved in gangland wars in southern France. The first war occurred in 1963. The second war occurred between 1965 and 1967 against the powerful Guérini clan. At that time, the Guérini clan was the ruling dynasty of the Corsican Mafia and had systematically organized the smuggling of opium from Turkey and other Middle Eastern countries. The Guérini clan was led by Marseilles mob boss Antoine Guérini and his underling Jean-Baptiste Andreani. The latter gangland war was reportedly sparked by competition over casino revenues between Guérini and Francisci. The war silently continued for three years with little more than extended obituary notices in the French press. On 23 June 1967, two masked motorcyclists pumped eleven bullets into Antoine Guerini at a Marseilles gas station.65\\\\. Saccomano, Bandits a Marseille, pp. 13-14. Weeks later, Francisci was nearly killed by snipers while leaving an election rally in favor of John Bozzi, a Gaullist candidate, in Ajaccio, Corsica, but he managed to escape. According to the French weekly newspaper L'Express, on 14 December 1967, two gangsters loyal to the Guérini clan tried to blow up Francisci's house with 220 pounds of TNT. The two men were blown to bits planting the bomb. On 21 June 1968, in Ajaccio, Corsica, Francisci was ambushed by five gunmen while dining at a restaurant. Although Francisci was miraculously unscathed, bystanders weren't as fortunate. One was killed, five others were wounded. Four months later, the men who tried to kill Marcel were murdered in a Parisian bar by gunmen dressed as policemen. Ultimately, the Guérini clan was exterminated in the French underworld. Later, Marcel Francisci became an elected official for the Gaullist Party in Corsica. In 1971, he and Paul Mondoloni were accused by police forces in the U.S. Bureau of Narcotics of being involved in the trafficking of heroin between Marseilles and New York City. On 16 January 1982, Marcel Francisci was killed in Paris, France. He was shot to death in the parking lot of the building where he lived as he was entering his car. ==Legacy== Although Francisci was alleged to be a fearsome Corsican godfather, he is favorably remembered in Corsica as a philanthropic businessman who funded the construction of roads, schools and clinics.On the Heroin Trail: In Pursuit of the Elusive Kingpin Francisci's family has denied his alleged involvement in organized crime. == See also == * French Connection * List of unsolved murders == Sources == * The 16 January 1982 UPI report in the New York Times entitled \\"Marcel Francisci Shot Dead; tied to 'French Connection'\\". * \\"Le retour de la mafia corse\\", Le Monde, 22 May 2006 (by Jacques Follorou). == References  External links == * « Marcel Francisci Shot Dead; Tied to 'French Connection' », The New York Times, January 16, 1982.

Llorenç sought to expand the role the guilds played in the city and to counterbalance noble power. The nobility were widely disliked as they had often abused their power and acted above the law, with the government doing little against them. After a series of plagues, floods, and economic disasters in Valencia, the royal government was practically nonfunctional. Llorenç and the Council of Thirteen, the board consisting of the heads of the thirteen Germanies, practically ran the city while the official government was absent or powerless.

Today, 250 students attend the school. SOCRATES III 11, 11e rue, Roxboro, H8Y 1K6 In 1982, a new building is built in Roxboro to attend to its Greek student population. This building consists of 29 classrooms (including a daycare center), a library, a gym, and many administrative offices. Today, more than 200 students attend this school. SOCRATES IV 5220, Grande Allée, St-Hubert, J3Y 1A1 In 1985, the H.C.M. agreed to build not only an elementary school (which would be the 4th campus built by the community) but also a community center that would be able to serve the full population of the South-Shore region. The building has a church, 18 classrooms (including a daycare center), a multimedia room, a library, a cafeteria, a gym, and many administrative offices. Today, the school consists of about 100 students. SOCRATES V 931, Emerson, Laval, H7W 3Y5 SOCRATES V(ANNEX) 1005, boul Pie X, Laval, H7V 3A9 In 1990, the H.C.M. bought a new building to serve to the students of the Laval community. This building consists of 23 classrooms, a gym, a library, and some administrative offices. Even though it is the smallest building in all the H.C.G.M (besides its annex bought in 2002 to attend a daycare and the kindergarten groups of the 5th campus) it has the largest number of students, consisting of about 500 students. DEMOSTHENES 1565, boul. St-Martin O. Laval, H7S 1N1 In 2011, the H.C.M. bought the Hellenic community of Laval along with all its organizations. One of the biggest interests of the H.C.M. was their elementary school, Demosthenes. Today, this school has more than 200 students. It is the newest addition to the community's schools. In total, the schools consist of about 1 300 students. This number is growing every year. It is the pride of not only the H.C.G.M. but of the Greek Embassy of Canada as well. ==Future projects== NEW BUILDING IN LAVAL In 2013, the H.C.G.M. had begun efforts to sell all school buildings in Laval to provide a better service in a new building that would be constructed in back of Laval's major Greek Orthodox Church, The Saint-Cross Church. This building would consist of many modern aspects. construction has been foreseen to begin in 2014, after all buildings have been sold. FUTURE HIGH SCHOOL PROJECTS For more than 30 years, the community has been talking about building a high school for the students that would graduate the elementary schools. Lately, this project has been put under a serious note. If all construction projects go well for the new elementary building in Laval, then further research will be done to make this future project possible. http://www.hcgm.org http://www.socdem.org == References == Category:Educational institutions established in 1909 Category:Elementary schools in Montreal Category:Greek-Canadian culture Category:Greek international schools Category:Schools in Laval, Quebec Category:Elementary schools in Longueuil Category:1909 establishments in Quebec ","title":"Socrates Schools"},{"id":"20386945","text":"\\"Taklamakan\\" is a short story by American writer Bruce Sterling.

G. Robley Mokomokai, or Toi moko, are the preserved heads of Māori, the indigenous people of New Zealand, where the faces have been decorated by tā moko tattooing. They became valuable trade items during the Musket Wars of the early 19th century. ==Moko== Moko facial tattoos Moko facial tattoos were traditional in Māori culture until about the mid 19th century when their use began to disappear, although there has been something of a revival from the late 20th century. In pre-European Māori culture they denoted high social status. There were generally only men that had full facial moko, though high- ranked women often had moko on their lips and chins.Palmer & Tano (2004), p.1. Moko tattoos served as identifying connection between an individual and their ancestors.Cultural Heritage, Cultural Rights, Cultural Diversity: New Developments in International Law, edited by Silvia Borelli, Federico Lenzerini, page 163 Moko marked rites of passage for people of chiefly rank, as well as significant events in their lives. Each moko was unique and contained information about the person's rank, tribe, lineage, occupation and exploits. Moko were expensive to obtain and elaborate moko were usually limited to chiefs and high-ranked warriors. Moreover, the art of moko, the people who created and incised the designs, as well as the moko themselves, were surrounded by strict tapu and protocol.Palmer & Tano (2004), pp.1-3. Moko design ==Mokomokai== When someone with moko died, often the head would be preserved. The brain and eyes were removed, with all orifices sealed with flax fibre and gum. The head was then boiled or steamed in an oven before being smoked over an open fire and dried in the sun for several days. It was then treated with shark oil. Such preserved heads, mokomokai, would be kept by their families in ornately carved boxes and brought out only for sacred ceremonies.NZETC: Mokomokai: Preserving the past Accessed 25 November 2008 The heads of enemy chiefs killed in battle were also preserved; these mokomokai, being considered trophies of war, would be displayed on the marae and mocked. They were important in diplomatic negotiations between warring tribes, with the return and exchange of mokomokai being an essential precondition for peace.Palmer & Tano (2004), pp.3-4. ==Musket Wars== In the early 19th century, with the arrival of Europeans in New Zealand, tribes in contact with European sailors, traders and settlers had access to firearms, giving them a military advantage over their neighbours. This gave rise to the Musket Wars, when other tribes became desperate to acquire firearms too, if only to defend themselves. During this period of social destabilisation, mokomokai became commercial trade items that could be sold as curios, artworks and as museum specimens which fetched high prices in Europe and America, and which could be bartered for firearms and ammunition.Palmer & Tano (2004), pp.4-5. The demand for firearms was such that tribes carried out raids on their neighbours to acquire more heads to trade for them. They also tattooed slaves and prisoners (though with meaningless motifs rather than genuine moko) in order to provide heads to order. The peak years of the trade in mokomokai were from 1820 to 1831. In 1831 the Governor of New South Wales issued a proclamation banning further trade in heads out of New Zealand, and during the 1830s the demand for firearms diminished because every surviving group was fully armed. By 1840 when the Treaty of Waitangi was signed, and New Zealand became a British colony, the export trade in mokomokai had virtually ended, along with a decline in the use of moko in Māori society, although occasional small-scale trade continued for several years.Palmer & Tano (2004), pp.5-6.Janes & Conaty (2005), pp.156-157. H.G. Robley with his mokomokai collection == Robley collection== Major-General Horatio Gordon Robley was a British army officer and artist who served in New Zealand during the New Zealand Wars in the 1860s. He was interested in ethnology and fascinated by the art of tattooing as well as being a talented illustrator. He wrote the classic text on the subject of moko, Moko; or Maori Tattooing, which was published in 1896. After he returned to England he built up a notable collection of 35–40 mokomokai which he later offered to sell to the New Zealand Government. When the offer was declined, most of the collection was sold to the American Museum of Natural History. ==Repatriation== More recently there has been a campaign to repatriate to New Zealand the hundreds of mokomokai held in museums and private collections around the world, either to be returned to their relatives or to the Museum of New Zealand for storage, though not display. It has had some success, though many mokomokai remain overseas and the campaign is ongoing.Associated Press, Wellington. 7 April 2000.

They are a migratory species, inhabiting the Florida waters during the winter and moving as far north as Virginia and into the Chesapeake Bay, sometimes seen as far north as Baltimore, Maryland and as far west as Texas in the warmer summer months. Manatees are calm herbivores that spend most of their time eating, sleeping, and traveling. They have a lifespan of about 60 years with no known natural enemies. Some of their deaths are the result of human activity. In the past, manatees were exploited for their meat, fat, and hides.West Indian Manatee: an Endangered Species. Bagheera: A Website for Earth’s Endangered Animals. 21 November 2008. . == Sources of danger == Various human activities threaten manatee populations. Fishing nets and lines can cause injuries to manatees that can lead to serious infections. Some manatee deaths are the result of collisions with boats. Additionally, coastal development can affect manatee habitats, both positively and negatively. Manatees tend to gather in the warm water outflows of power plants and springs during cold weather. == Becoming endangered / legal protection == Starting in the 18th century when the English declared Florida a manatee sanctuary and made manatee hunting illegal, people have worked to protect this species. In 1893, manatees first received protection under Florida law, and in 1907 this law was revised to impose a fine of $500 and/or six months of jail time for assaulting or killing a manatee.Manatee Timeline. MyFWC.com: Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission. 21 November 2008. . In accordance with the Endangered Species Preservation Act of 1966, an act of Congress designed to list endangered animal species and offer them limited protection, the manatee became one of 78 original species listed as being threatened with extinction. There are currently more than 1300 species on this list.Native Fish and Wildlife: Endangered Species. U. S. Fish and Wildlife Service: Endangered Species Program. 21 November 2008 . On March 11, 1967 federal efforts to protect the manatee began when the United States Fish and Wildlife Service listed the manatee as endangered. In 1972, the manatee was designated a marine mammal protected under the Federal Marine Mammal Protection Act. This act prohibited the removal of any marine mammal and imposed a fine of up to $2000 and/or one year in jail for doing so.Manatee Timeline. MyFWC.com: Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission. 21 November 2008. . The Endangered Species Act of 1966 was revised in 1973 and increased federal protection of manatees. The “act made it a violation to harass, harm, pursue, hunt, shoot, wound, kill, capture, or collect an endangered species…authorized cooperative agreements between states and the federal government with funding management, research and law enforcement.” In 1974 the Sirenia Project was established in Gainesville, Florida to provide manatee documentation and rescue programs. In 1976, Sea World of Florida began a Manatee Rescue and Rehabilitation Program. The Florida Manatee Sanctuary Act passed in 1978, amending the 1907 state law. Florida became an official refuge and sanctuary for the marine mammals, and the regulation of boat speeds in areas of manatee inhabitation became allowed. In that same year, the U. S. Fish and Wildlife Service, Florida Audubon Society, and Sea World also sponsored the “West Indian Manatee Workshop” in which six management recommendations were proposed: regulations to control boaters and divers, land acquisition for refuges, study of potential artificial refuges, explore technological control mechanisms to protect manatees, develop oil spill contingency plans, and increase public education. In 1979, Florida Governor Bob Graham made November Manatee Awareness Month, and the first state-designated protection zones were established. The year 1980 saw Congress allocate $100, 000 to the Marine Mammal Commission and the development of the initial Federal Manatee Recovery Plan by the U. S. Fish and Wildlife Service. In 1981 Bob Graham and Jimmy Buffett formed the Save the Manatee Committee, the precursor of the Save the Manatee Club, which sought to protect manatees and their habitats. Both the Marine Mammal Protection Act and the Endangered Species Act were reauthorized in 1988 as various new groups, companies, and organizations began to invest time and resources in the protection of the manatee. The early 1990s saw more government money being allocated to the cause, more research being conducted, and more protection plans being implemented. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service revised the Manatee Recovery Plan Objectives in 1996 to include the following: assess and minimize causes of manatee mortality and injury, protect essential habitat, determine and monitor the status of the manatee population and essential habitat, coordinate and oversee cooperative recovery work. Throughout the early 2000s (decade), various counties in Florida continued to revise and/or create specific conservation plans in conjunction with federal and statewide efforts. As of January 7, 2016, as a result of significant improvements in its population and habitat conditions, and reductions in direct threats, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service announced that the West Indian manatee is proposed to be downlisted from endangered to threatened status under the Endangered Species Act (ESA). The proposal to downlist the manatee to threatened will not affect federal protections currently afforded by the ESA, and the Service remains committed to conservation actions to fully recover manatee populations. The range-wide minimum known population is estimated to be at least 13,000 manatees, with more than 6,300 in Florida. When aerial surveys began in 1991, there were only an estimated 1,267 manatees in Florida, meaning that the last 25 years has seen a 400 percent increase in the species population in that state. http://www.fws.gov/news/ShowNews.cfm?_ID=35428 Retrieved on 1/17/2016 from USFWS press release == Organizations == Various institutes help promote awareness of the threats faced by manatees, raise money for manatee research, and generally work to ensure the survival of this endangered species. One of the largest and most influential organizations is the Save the Manatee Club. This non-profit organization was created by Bob Graham and Jimmy Buffett as a means of including the public in manatee conservation.About SMC. Save the Manatee Club. 21 November 2008. < http://www.savethemanatee.org/smchist.htm>. The club sponsors an Adopt-A- Manatee program that uses it funds for “public awareness and education projects; manatee research; rescue and rehabilitation efforts; and advocacy and legal action in order to ensure better protection for manatees and their habitat.” It also sponsors various public awareness, education, and volunteer activities. Sirenian International is another organization dedicated to the conservation of manatees.Sirenian International. Sirenian International, Inc. 21 November 2008. . The group considers itself a “partnership of scientists, students, educators, conservationists, and the public” that sponsors various projects throughout the world. Membership is divided into three groups based upon financial contributions and active service to the organization: participating member, supporting member, and contributing member. SeaWorld of Florida has played a major role in the efforts to protect and conserve the manatees. Sea World has the authority to rescue and rehabilitate manatees, and has had a great deal of success doing so.The Florida Manatee. EcoFlorida. 21 November 2008..

One of the most popular efforts to raise money for manatee research and conservation is the sale of license plates by the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission. The proceeds of these sales make up a large percentage of the funds dedicated to this cause, having raised $34,000,000 since 1990.Manatee License Plate.

He served during World War I and World War II under the Command of Alexandru Averescu and then Ion Antonescu, but would retire from a military life in 1941 over strategy disagreements with Antonescu. He also served as Minister of National Defense in 1938–1939. == Early Life == Ciupercă was born in Râmnicu Sărat, Buzău County, located in the northeastern part of the historical region of Muntenia in April 1882. He attended the Infantry and Cavalry Officer School in Bucharest. He graduated in 1902 with the rank of second lieutenant, and served in the World War I. In 1916 he was promoted to the rank of major. For his actions during the Hungarian–Romanian War he was promoted to lieutenant colonel in 1920. In 1930 he was promoted to brigadier general. He held multiple commands during this time, until in 1940 he was put in command of the Romanian Fourth Army. == Political Life == Ciupercă served as the Romanian Minister of Defense from 1938 to 1939 under the Second Cristea cabinet. He was a devout anti-communist and would be known for harsh purges of suspected communists within the Romanian Army. He would resign from the position after coming into conflict with king Carol II due to a proposal to decrease the budget of the Romanian Military. He would later go on to claim this to be an action of corruption by Carol, as the king refused to explain to the general where the missing funds would go. Despite his claims, it was impossible to ratify the claim, and it was passed off as rumor. Ciupercă during the Second Cristea cabinet == Soviet Occupation of Bessarabia and northern Bukovina == On June 26, 1940, the Soviet Union demanded that the regions of northern Bukovina and Bessarabia be evacuated of all Romanian military personnel and civilian administration, and that the territories be ceded to the USSR. Due to overwhelming international pressure, the Romanian government was forced to accept the ultimatum, and the Soviet occupation of Bessarabia and northern Bukovina commenced on June 28. The Fourth Army under General Ciupercă was stationed along the Soviet border with Romania, and thus he was placed in charge of the evacuation of military and civilian assets in the region. Despite the withdrawal of Romanian troops, there were a number of skirmishes in the region which the general tried to avoid at all costs. Due to this choice, not all military assets could be evacuated in time and the Soviet troops seized large numbers of weapons from the Romanian Military. The Soviet troops also seized the Herța region, which had not been agreed to by the Romanian government. A number of clashes broke out in the region between the Soviet and Romanian troops, however General Ciupercă was able to evacuate all military assets from the area with little loss of life. == Operation München == General Ciupercă was still under command of the 4th Army when Romania joined Operation Barbarossa in 1941 in order to reclaim the lost territories of Bessarabia and Bukovina. Operation München was the codename used for a joint Romanian-German invasion of the Soviet Union through Romanian territory. General Ciupercă and the Fourth Army were tasked with reclaiming the town of Țiganca in Southern Bessarabia. Due to heavy Soviet counterattacks, the 4th Army's 3rd Corps was repulsed from the bridgehead that they had attempted to form across the Prut River. The 4th Army's 4th Corps was able to create a bridgehead north of the town however, and relieved the pressure on the 3rd Corps. General Ciupercă managed to secure the bridgehead, and the town itself hours after. The 4th Army would follow the retreating Soviet forces to the Dniester River, only fighting in minor engagements along the way. == The Siege of Odessa == When Adolf Hitler convinced Romanian Conducător Ion Antonescu to cross the Dniester River, Ciupercă was still in command of the 4th Army. The Romanian 4th Army advanced along the coast of the Black Sea until it reached the outskirts of the Soviet city of Odessa. The city was encircled by elements of a mixed Romanian and German army, and due to heavy resistance from Soviet forces trapped inside of the city, the Romanian and German armies decided to lay siege to Odessa. Ciupercă was charged with the defense of the outskirts of the city, while the main army under generals Antonescu, Iosif Iacobici, and Alexandru Ioaniţiu pushed deeper into the city. During a staff meeting with the command, Ciupercă got into an dispute with general Antonescu and the General Staff over the tactics which would be used in the assault on the city. Antonescu and the General Staff favored an attack from multiple directions, and a general advance of troops on the front. Ciupercă favored a spearhead movement however, an attempt to shatter Soviet lines before they'd have a chance to organize a serious resistance. This dispute would lead to Antonescu dismissing Ciupercă from his position, and for him to be replaced by general Ioan Glogojeanu and general Iacobici. Ciupercă retired on October 13th, moving back to his hometown of Râmnicu Sărat. == Post-War Trial and Conviction == In 1946, Ciupercă joined the anti-communist Graiul Sângelui organization. Due to this and to his association with the Romanian invasion of the Soviet Union, on September 12th, 1948, the retired general was arrested and tried by the Romanian People's Tribunals; he was sentenced to 12 years in prison for conspiring against the Romanian People's Republic and conspiring against the social order. He was sent to Jilava prison, before being transferred to Văcărești prison in the southern outskirts of Bucharest. Due to failing health, Ciupercă was admitted to the medical wing of the prison, where he died on May 25th, 1950, being ill with cerebral atherosclerosis, Parkinson's disease, myocarditis, and azotemia. In 2019, a street in Buzău was named after him. ==Awards== *Order of the Star of Romania, Knight rank – I.D. 437/13.05.1917. *Order of the Crown of Romania, Officer class – I.D. 846/9.08.1917. *Croix de Guerre – brevet 834/13.02.1918. *Order of Saint Anna, 2nd class – brevet 11360/29.08.1917. *Order of Polonia Restituta, Commander class – brevet 66928/19.12.1924. *Order of the Star of Romania, Commander rank – I.D. 20/1335/9.05.1934. *Order of the Crown of Romania, Grand Cross class – 8 June 1940. *Order of Michael the Brave, 3rd Class – 17 October 1941. *Order of the Crown of Romania, Grand Cross class – I.D. 2168/29.07.1942. ==References== Category:Romanian Land Forces generals Category:Romanian military personnel of World War II Category:1882 births Category:1950 deaths Category:Romanian Ministers of Defence Category:People from Râmnicu Sărat Category:Romanian people who died in prison custody Category:Prisoners who died in Romanian detention Category:Romanian military personnel of World War I Category:People convicted by the Romanian People's Tribunals Category:Recipients of the Order of Michael the Brave Category:Grand Crosses of the Order of the Crown (Romania) Category:Commanders of the Order of the Star of Romania Category:Knights of the Order of the Star of Romania Category:Officers of the Order of the Crown (Romania) Category:Recipients of the Croix de Guerre (France) Category:Recipients of the Order of St. Anna, 2nd class Category:Commanders of the Order of Polonia Restituta Category:Romanian people of the Hungarian–Romanian War ","title":"Nicolae Ciupercă"},{"id":"20387038","text":"Tudoranca Ciurea (1888-1971) was a Romanian Land Forces general during World War II.

He was especially known for his contribution to the 1940 establishment of the National Legionary State by the far-right Iron Guard, with which he had been secretly involved for a decade. After beginnings as a schoolteacher in his native Neamț County, Coroamă had become an officer of the 15th Dorobanți Regiment, first earning distinction during World War I. Coroamă helped organize the defense of Western Moldavia, then participated in the Hungarian–Romanian War, establishing Romanian control in Bistrița and Baia Mare. He received the Order of the Star of Romania and the Order of Michael the Brave. While stationed in Piatra Neamț during the interwar, Coroamă took up various political and cultural activities, overseeing the Romanian Scouts and setting up a Military Club. He was also involved in establishing a local branch of the Iron Guard. He was moved around to the garrison in Satu Mare, also becoming a General in 1934. Despite his commitment to the revolutionary ideology of the Guard, he was well-liked by King Carol II, and in 1937 became commander of the Royal Palace garrison. This allowed him to sabotage Carol's attempt to use Palace troops against the Guard, and helped in toppling Carol. In the aftermath of the coup, Coroamă was mistrusted and marginalized by Conducător Ion Antonescu. Given command of the 4th Army Corps in Iași, he witnessed the clashes between Antonescu and his Guard colleagues, peaking during the Legionary Rebellion of 1941. Coroamă took a moderate stance, and his mediation helped Antonescu to restore order in Iași without bloodshed. However, Coroamă remained isolated by government, and had to resign. Later in 1941, as Nazi Germany and Romania opened an Eastern Front against the Soviet Union, Coroamă advised against continuing the offensive beyond Bessarabia. When this was ignored, he left military life altogether. Coroamă returned to public life after the Royal Coup of 1944, participating in conspiracies against Soviet occupation. Reportedly, he was one of the Romanian generals prepared to support Germany during Operation Spring Awakening; he later switched his allegiance toward the Romanian National Committee and worked to consolidate a national network of anti-communist resistance groups, including Guardist ones. Arrested by the communist regime in May 1948, he spent six years doing penal labor, and was reportedly tortured. He died in Bucharest within two years of his release. ==BiographyEarly decades and rise=== Coroamă was born on July 19, 1885 at Hangu, Neamț County; he was the eighth of ten children born to Toma and Ecaterina Coroamă. After graduating primary school in Schitu, he studied at Petru Rareș National College, and worked as a substitute schoolteacher in Bukovina, at Broșteni and Frumosu, and then in Neamț, at Farcașa. N. Sava, \\"Generalul Dumitru Coroamă: 'Majestate, nu pot să execut ordinul de a trage în tineretul țării!'\\", in Ceahlăul, July 19, 2014 Opting for a career in the Romanian Land Forces, he took graduate diplomas from the Infantry Officers' School (1907) and the War School, emerging as a Sub-lieutenant.Trașcă, p. 230 Assigned to the 15th Dorobanți Regiment in Piatra Neamț, Coroamă first saw action during the Second Balkan War of 1913.\\"Extrase din memoriile originale ale foștilor comandanți\\", in În Slujba Patriei, January 2007, p. 8 He was again called to action during the campaign of World War I, overseeing defensive maneuvers on the fortified lines of the Trotuș, Oituz, and Uz. By 1916, Coroamă was a Captain,Traian D. Lazăr, \\"Azi căpitan, mâine...\\", in Magazin Istoric, June 2018, pp. 60–61 and in full command the 3rd Infantry Battalion. He earned distinction following the Battle of Mărășești: he was cited on October 11, 1916 for his \\"initiative and energy in holding on to a difficult position\\", and, on December 27, was made a Knight of the Order of the Star of Romania. He continued to receive other distinctions, including the Order of Michael the Brave 3rd Class (presented by Eremia Grigorescu) and various medals of the Allied countries. He was later an Officer of the Star of Romania. On December 6, 1918, Coroamă, by then a Major, led his troops into Transylvania, arriving by train at Bistrița (see Union of Transylvania with Romania). Upon arrival, he met with the Hungarian Republican administration, which he did not immediately depose. When the incumbent mayor, Gábor Ajtai Nagy, asked him to \\"spare the city\\", Coroamă replied that this his only mandate was to reestablish order \\"together with city leaders\\".Ioana Dragotă, \\"Școala civilă de stat pentru fete Baia Mare (1893–1948).—Radiografie istorică.—Partea a III-a. Trecerea în administrația românească\\", in Bibliotheca Septentrionalis, Vol. XVI, Issue 2, 2008, p. 81 He was subsequently in charge of the Romanian garrison for the entire County of Bistrița.Victor Moldovan, Memoriile unui politician din perioada interbelică. Vol. I, pp. 81, 423. Cluj-Napoca: Presa Universitară Clujeană, 2016. Following the outbreak of a Hungarian–Romanian War, Coroamă led the assault battalion that secured Baia Mare on January 6, 1919.Liviu Tătaru, \\"Actul Marii Uniri de la 1 decembrie 1918. Desfășurări în Lăpuș, Chioar, Codru și zona Baia Mare\\", in Bibliotheca Septentrionalis, Vol. XXV, Issue 2, December 2017, p. 58 An accidental ecrasite explosionCornel Țucă, \\"Activitatea Senatului Național Român (Cluj) oglindită în notițele Sidoniei Docan\\", in Document, Issue 1/2009, p. 30 wounded Coroamă in the train station of Dej. He was badly hurt, and had to be sent to Cluj for recovery. Coroamă's interwar career saw him returning to Piatra Neamț, where he was made Garrison Commander. In October 1927, he was promoted to Colonel and in 1929 was officially made Commander of the 15th Regiment. The interval also witnessed Coroamă's involvement in far-right politics. In 1930, together with his wife, he established a Piatra Neamț chapter of the Iron Guard and sponsored its network of \\"Cross Brotherhoods\\". The family home featured a portrait of the Guardist leader, Corneliu Zelea Codreanu, whom Coroamă had met during the previous war.Silvian-Emanuel Man, \\"Alegerile parlamentare din județul Neamț în anul 1931 în documente de arhivă\\", in Zilele Cercetării Științifice Studențești din Universitatea Constantin Brâncuși, Issue IV, 2012, p. 153 The building was flooded and suffered damages during the heavy rains of May 1930,Neptun, \\"Inundațiile catastrofale din orașul Piatra-Neamț\\", in Avântul, Issue 56/1930, p. 2 but was swiftly restored.A. A. Rotundu, \\"Colonelul Coroamă\\", in Avântul, Issue 150/1934, p. 1 King Carol II appointed Coroamă Brigadier General in late 1934, after he had taken the final exams with top honors.\\"D-l colonel Coroamă a reușit întâiul pe țară la examenul de general\\", in Avântul, Issue 143/1934, p. 1 During the early 1930s, he had involved himself with the Romanian Scouting Movement, presiding upon its meetings in Neamț County and directing its propaganda efforts.I. Fuioagă, \\"În sprijinul cercetășiei\\", in Avântul, Issue 122/1934, p. 1 He also founded a Military Club and provided lectures detailing his own front-line experience. In 1935, he was reassigned to lead the 16th Infantry Brigade of Satu Mare. In November 1936, he presented military honors to Carol and Crown Prince Michael, who passed through Satu Mare on their way back from a state visit in Czechoslovakia.Claudiu Petru Porumbăceanu, \\"Dezvoltarea relațiilor de bună vecinătate la frontiera de nord vest a României cu Cehoslovacia în perioada 1934—1937\\", in Diana Kinces (ed.), Relații româno-ucrainene. Istorie și contemporaneitate. Румунсько-українські відносини. Історія і сучасність, p. 8. Satu Mare: Editura Muzeului Sătmărean, 2015 ===1940 coup and 1941 rebellion=== In November 1937, Coroamă became General Officer Commanding 1st Guard Division at the Royal Palace in Bucharest, in service to Carol II. However, he secretly supported the Iron Guard's leader Horia Sima, who was in conflict with Carol's National Renaissance Front.Dennis Deletant, Hitler's Forgotten Ally: Ion Antonescu and His Regime, Romania, 1940-1944, pp. 49–50. London: Palgrave Macmillan, 2006. Z. Ornea, Anii treizeci. Extrema dreaptă românească, p. 327. Bucharest: Editura Fundaţiei Culturale Române, 1995. Sima's rise had been made possible by Carol's decision to arrest, and then assassinate, Codreanu. Coroamă's contacts with Sima were at the core of an enduring controversy between Guard factions: Codreanu's loyalist cells, which distrusted Sima, also viewed Coroamă as an agent of the Front and an appeaser. They noted in particular Coroamă's acknowledgement that he had mediated a September 1938 encounter between Sima and Carol's spymaster, Mihail Moruzov.Mihai Demetriade, \\"Victor Biriș, cel mai important agent de influență din penitenciarul Aiud (1957–1963)\\", in Caietele CNSAS, Issues 1–2/2012, p. 87 As acknowledged by Sima, by May 1940 there were other encounters involving all three men. During these parlays, they agreed that the Iron Guard should merge into the Front, which, on Coroamă's suggestion, was to be renamed \\"Front of the Nation\\".Miskolczy, p. 926 Coroamă rose to prominence after the events of autumn 1940, when the Second Vienna Award, which lost Romania rule over Northern Transylvania, engendered a political crisis. In this context, he cooperated with Sima on the Iron Guard's attempt to seize power, and came into contact with another authoritarian figure, General Ion Antonescu, who was reluctantly appointed Premier by Carol. In early September, as a sign of his cooperation with Sima, Antonescu appointed Coroamă to the post of General Officer in charge of the Capital's Military Command, replacing the loyalist Gheorghe Argeșanu.Miskolczy, p. 937 Soon afterward, Antonescu was told that two other loyalist generals, Gheorghe Mihail and Paul Teodorescu, were planning to have him killed. He consequently demanded Carol's abdication. In tandem, General Coroamă refuse to comply with the royal order of shooting down Guardists who marched in front of the Palace.Miskolczy, p. 936 According to one account, his resistance persuaded Antonescu to follow suit, and allowed form a bloodless transition. Coroamă himself confessed that he was an active participant in the coup, bringing up reserve troops to support the Guard. For this reason, Carol arrested him; Antonescu ordered his release, thus signaling to the king that he was no longer in control of the country. An anecdote relayed by the old-regime politician Constantin Argetoianu presents another version of events, claiming that Antonescu had asked Coroamă to storm the area outside the Palace, though \\"without firing a shot.\\" Also according to Argetoianu, Coroamă never showed up for duty, and claimed that he was \\"besieged in my own house\\" by the Guardists, who had mistaken him for the detested Argeșanu, also a mustachioed general. Coroamă's \\"inane\\" request was to have dispatches aired by Radio Bucharest, informing his assailants that \\"General Coroamă and General Argeșanu both wear mustaches\\"; an amused Antonescu urged him to \\"shave it off\\".Constantin Argetoianu, Însemnări zilnice. Volumul IX: 21 aprilie—31 decembrie 1941, p. 31. Bucharest: Editura Machiavelli, 2008. Like other Guardists, Coroamă was dissatisfied with Antonescu's regime, or \\"National Legionary State\\". Already on September 9, 1940, he was sent over as General Officer of the 4th Army Corps, stationed at Iași, which equated with a demotion. Coroamă survived Antonescu's violent split with the Guard and the Legionary Rebellion of January 1941. As reported by diarist Mihail Sebastian, rumor spread that Coroamă and Corneliu Dragalina were marching on Bucharest to assist Sima against Antonescu.Mihail Sebastian, Journal, 1935–1944, p. 312. London: Random House, 2003. However, Coroamă had again resumed his mitigating position and, alongside other Iași Guardists, including Ilie-Vlad Sturdza, he fought to pacify the city and minimize bloodshed. According to Nazi German diplomatic cables, he did so because he feared that the Soviet Union would profit from the unrest and invade Romania.Trașcă, pp. 226–234 Coroamă also sought an understanding with the Guardist leader, Gheorghe Grijincu, asking him to return control over government buildings, and also to pledge resistance in case of a Soviet attack.Trașcă, pp. 232–233 Another army leader, Constantin Sănătescu, noted that despite his standing as a \\"Guard sympathizer\\" Coroamă \\"behaved well, managing to peacefully quell the rebellion\\".Constantin Sănătescu, Jurnal, p. 25. Bucharest: Humanitas, 1993. ===Repression and imprisonment=== In February, following the resumption of government control over Iași, Coroamă was sent to the reserves. Sănătescu, who took over as commander of the 4th Army Corps in January 1941, claimed that his predecessor had been sacked following a quarrel with Antonescu. He continued to be marginalized as Romania opened an Eastern Front: Coroamă supported the retaking of Bessarabia, but argued that Romania should only send an expeditionary corps to assist Germany beyond that stage. Antonescu ignored this advice, pushing Coroamă to resign from the army and return to civilian life in Piatra Neamț. By 1944, a Soviet offensive had pierced into Romania, prompting the Royal Coup which toppled Antonescu. When Romania formally joined the Allied Powers, Coroamă was an alleged double-dealer, resuming his contacts with Sima, who now headed a pro- Nazi government in exile. During Operation Spring Awakening in March 1945, generals Coroamă, Dragalina, Sănătescu, Petre Dumitrescu, and Radu Korne were reportedly involved in a Nazi-organized plot to overthrow the Soviet occupation forces.Mircea Tănase, \\"1945 — ripostă sovietică la operațiunile 'Parașutiștii' și 'Deșteptarea Primăverii'\\", in Cetatea Bihariei. Revistă de Cultură și Istorie Militară, Issue 1/2007, pp. 62–63 Such initiatives failed and, over the following three years, the country underwent steady communization, ultimately reemerging as a communist state. As reported by the Guardist Ion Gavrilă Ogoranu in a 1999 interview, \\"in 1946–1947\\" Coroamă integrated with the anti-communist resistance, though as an army representative rather than as a Guard member. Ogoranu identifies Coroamă and Dragalina as members of the resistance coordinating committee, answering to the National Peasants' Party and the Romanian National Committee; Guardist cells were represented therein by Nicolae Petrașcu.Teodor Gheorghe Păiușan, \\"Forme organizate și spontane ale rezistenței anticomuniste și la colectivizare din Valea Crișului Alb\\", in Doru Sinaci, Emil Arbonie (eds.), Administrație românească arădeană. Studii și comunicări. Volumul III, pp. 272–273. Arad: Vasile Goldiș University Press, 2011. Gavrilă Ogoranu also recalled that in autumn 1947 Coroamă, who was based in Sibiu, traveled to Sâmbăta de Sus Monastery and met Arsenie Boca, with whom he planned various anti-communist activities.Eugen Șahan, \\"Aspecte din rezistența românească împotriva sovietizării în perioada martie 1944—1962\\", in Romulus Rusan (ed.), Instaurarea comunismului. Între rezistență și represiune (Analele Sighet 2). Comunicări prezentate la simpozionul de la Sighetu Marmației (9—11 iunie 1995), p. 175. Bucharest: Fundația Academia Civică, 2016 On May 15, 1948, as the new regime inaugurated its hunt for Guardists, Coroamă became a political prisoner at Jilava. He was then sentenced to eight years in \\"labor colonies\\". Coroamă was sent to do penal work at Ocnele Mari, alongside other former members of the Guard—including Petre Țuțea and Ioan Victor Vojen; they joined a selection of former political rivals, including Mihail Manoilescu, Aurel Leucuția, and Petre Pandrea. In his samizdat memoirs, Pandrea would include an account of \\"Carol II's odyssey, with its exact details\\", claiming that it was partly sourced from \\"things confessed to me by Mihail Manoilescu and General Coroamă\\".Petre Pandrea, Memoriile mandarinului valah. Jurnal I: 1954–1956, p. 92. Bucharest: Editura Vremea, 2011. Reportedly, Coroamă was slated for persecution by a Romani man of the Securitate, who made him perform pointless physical exercise and beat him repeatedly. He was relocated to Aiud prison, Gherla, and Văcărești, being ultimately released in June 1954. By then, he had been deemed to ill to survive detention, and was dropped off by Securitate officials at the home of a Bucharest relative; this was to be his last domicile. Coroamă died in 1956. Eight years later, his body was reburied at Eternitatea Cemetery in Piatra Neamț. This final ceremony was attended by fellow generals Nicolae Dăscălescu and Ilie Crețulescu, but also by Securitate agents monitoring dissent. ==NotesReferences== *Ambrus Miskolczy, \\"A Vasgárda útja a hatalomhoz\\", in Hadtörténelmi Közlemények, Vol. 129, Issue 4, 2014, pp. 909–940. *Ottmar Trașcă, \\"Rebeliunea legionară în viziunea Consulatului german din Iași, 19–25 ianuarie 1941\\", in Archiva Moldaviae, Vol. II, 2010, pp. 235.

Promulgated in 1558, it was the first set of laws that regulated labor relations between the Spaniards and Mapuche natives. Its creator was jurist Hernando de Santillán, who came with Garcia Hurtado de Mendoza to Chile. == Description == The Rate was a system for indigenous labor, that instead of making all the natives work in a repartimiento, determined a system whereby they took turns doing the required service. The cacique of each tribe being forced to send a man for each six men in the encomienda for the operation of the mines, and one of each five for agricultural work. This worker, who until then had not been paid a wage, had to be remunerated with the sixth part of the product of his work. The form of remuneration the native was due, called Sesmo, was regular pay every month end, the sixth part that he extracted from the mine. In addition the regulation exempted from this work women and men of under 18 and over 50 years old. It established that the encomendero was to maintain the laborers in healthy condition and in addition that they procured their quick evangelisation. The duration of the Rate of Santillán in all their integrity did not last long and the governors who replaced Mendoza abolished it almost totally. Actually, this rate allowed some Spaniards like Pedro Avendaño to greatly abuse the Indians in their encomiendas, sowing the seeds of future rebellions, especially among the Huilliche. In replacement of the Rate of Santillán governor Martin Ruiz De Gamboa dictated a new rate in 1580 in a new decree, it was known as the Tasa de Gamboa. == See also == * Tasa de Esquilache * Tasa de Laso de la Vega Category:Encomenderos Category:Captaincy General of Chile Category:Arauco War Category:Mapuche Category:16th century in the Captaincy General of Chile Category:1558 in law Category:History of Chile ","title":"Tasa de Santillán"},{"id":"20387213","text":"Yonn-Dé is an album by David Murray released on the Canadian Justin Time label.

The SS Ypiranga was a German steamer that was commissioned to transport arms and munitions to the Mexican federal government under Victoriano Huerta. The United States had placed Mexico under an arms embargo to stifle the flow of weaponry to the war-torn state, then in the throes of civil war, forcing Huerta's government to look to EuropeThomas Baecker, \\"The Arms of the Ypiranga: The German Side,\\" The Americas, Vol. 30, No. 1 (Jul., 1973), pp. 1–17 Published by: Academy of American Franciscan HistoryYpiranga and Bavaria Unloaded Cargoes at Puerto Mexico.; First had 10,000 Rifles – The New York Times, 28 May 1914 and Japan for armaments. Ypiranga tried to enter the harbor at Veracruz to unload on the first day of the US occupation but was detained by US troops who were ordered by President of the United States Woodrow Wilson to enforce the arms embargo he had placed on Mexico. There was neither a declaration of war on Mexico by the United States nor a formal blockade on its ports, thus the detention of Ypiranga was not legal and she was released. She proceeded to a port where the US military was absent, Puerto México (modern-day Coatzacoalcos, Veracruz), and was able to offload her cargo to Huerta's officials. == Background == In February 1913, General Victoriano Huerta launched a coup, known as the Ten Tragic Days, with the support of Félix Díaz (the nephew of deposed president Porfirio Díaz) and American Ambassador Henry Lane Wilson, as well as ambassadors from other great powers, to overthrow the federal government of Francisco I. Madero. Madero had kept the Mexican Federal Army and called for the disbanding of revolutionary forces that had helped bring him to power. Madero called upon General Huerta to suppress rebellions that had broken out. Increasing opposition of Madero put his presidency in peril. Michael C. Meyer, \\"The Arms of the Ypiranga,\\" The Hispanic American Historical Review, Vol. 50, No. 3 (August 1970), p. 546 Published by: Duke University Press The coup that ousted and murdered Madero occurred in February at the tail-end of the Taft administration and his full support. From March 1913 on, the administration of U.S. president Woodrow Wilson switched tack and opposed the Huerta regime, supporting the rebels instead. Wilson imposed an arms embargo on the Huerta regime, cutting off their access to the weaponry that would keep the regime in office. The European powers did not want to be seen to be involved in the financing and shipping of arms to Huerta, since it could provoke a conflict with the U.S. if not increase tensions, which they wished to avoid.Katz, The Secret War in Mexico, pp. 232-35. Huerta sought an agent to purchase the arms he needed, and began working closely with Leon Raast, the Russian vice-consul in Mexico City. Raast traveled to New York City to meet with the Huertista agent Abraham Ratner and Marquard and Company, Importers to purchase twenty machine guns to add to the stockpile already warehoused in the city. Raast then met with the president of Gans Steamship Line who would transport the contraband for him but could not legally consign the weapons to a port in Mexico, however, he would consign to a port in Odessa, Russia.Meyer, p. 547 == Shipment == The manifest obtained by the United States Justice Department following the departure of the SS Brinkhorn lists the large amount of ordnance that was on board the ship. The cargo included: 10,000 cases of 30-caliber cartridges; 4,000 cases of 7-millimeter cartridges; 250 cases of 44-caliber cartridges; 250,000 carbine rifles; 1000 cases of 14/30 carbines; twenty rapid fire machine guns. The total value of the 15,770 cases is recorded at US$607,000.Report of Scully, agent, Department of Justice, December 17, 1913, RDS 812.00/10284 Raast shipped the arms to Odessa but did not appear there in time to clear it through customs. As a result, the Russian government seized the consignment. Raast with the help of the Russian embassy in Washington was able to get the shipment released and sent to Hamburg. However, there Raast could not pay for the freight charges resulting in the German government impounding the shipment. Money from the American financier and Huerta supporter John Wesley De Kay finally achieved a release. The arms now went to Havana with German-made Mauser rifles and cartridges added to it. The arms on Ypiranga required \\"three trains of ten cars each\\" to unload.Heribert von Feilitzsch, In Plain Sight: Felix A. Sommerfeld, Spymaster in Mexico, 1908 to 1914, Henselstone Verlag LLC, Amissville, VA, 2012, p. 356 ==U.S. actions== The U.S. sought to prevent off-loading of the arms to Huerta. Wilson ordered on 21 April 1914 U.S. troops to occupy the customs house at the port of Veracruz. The Ypiranga was a privately-owned vessel, but the German government declared it part of the Reich's navy, which would protect it from U.S. seizure. The German government filed a protest with the U.S. State Department, saying that seizing the ship and its cargo was a violation of international law, since the U.S. and Mexico were not officially at war. The U.S. apologized for overstepping, but also hoped that it could persuade Germany to cease supplying more arms to Huerta. The arms remained on board the Ypiranga but were off-loaded at Puerto Mexico. More arms for Huerta arrived at the same time on other ships owned by the same company as the Ypiranga. Although the incident had the potential for greater conflict, in the assessment of historian Friedrich Katz, \\"the affair had no further consequences and was quickly forgotten,\\" attributing this to the shift in German policy which came more in line with that of the U.S. in May-June 1914.Katz, The Secret War in Mexico, p. 240. == References Further reading== *Katz, Friedrich.

The M8F, as with previous McLaren sports cars, featured a large radiator mounted in the nose of the car, through which air was drawn from openings in the nose, and exited upwards over the open cockpit. McLaren designers Gordon Coppuck and Tyler Alexander devised a solution to this heat problem by using two radiators, one each mounted on either side of the cockpit, and drawing air from the side of the bodywork. This meant that hot air exiting the radiator no longer passed over the cockpit, and decreased fatigue on the drivers. With a radiator no longer housed in the nose of the car, McLaren designs were free to redesign the nose for better aerodynamic efficiency. This resulted in the addition of an adjustable airfoil between the front wheel fenders which increased the downforce on the front end of the car, leading to increased grip while cornering. The new radiator design also required a redesign of the fuel tanks within the car. The new tanks for the M20 were compacted around the cockpit and designed to flow from the outward tanks into the central tank so that as fuel was burned off during the race, it would not affect the weight distribution of the car. The engine of the M20 was once again a Chevrolet V8 engine, increased in displacement to and producing approximately 750 horsepower. Attached to the engine was a Hewland Mk II gearbox, mounted behind the engine rather than between the engine and cockpit as competitors Porsche and Alfa Romeo used. The fiberglass bodywork attached to the aluminium chassis was similar to the M8F, maintaining the \\"Coke bottle\\" design, but with the addition of ducting on the side to feed the radiators. Brakes were developed in conjunction with Lockheed. Improving on the recently developed cross- drilled brakes from the previous season, grooves were machined into the discs to prevent outgassing. Goodyear remained as the team's official tire supplier. In total, three M20s were built by McLaren in 1972. Unlike previous McLarens, no customer variants were developed for private teams prior to McLaren leaving the Can-Am series, although all three cars were eventually sold to other teams. ==Racing history== Two new McLaren M20s made their debut at Mosport Park, the inaugural round of the 1972 season. The #5 entry of Denny Hulme was able to achieve victory after some tire difficulties, beating Porsche's brand new turbocharged 917/10. Further problems appeared at Road Atlanta, where aerodynamics led to Hulme's car becoming airborne and flipping while following closely behind one of the Porsches. Although Hulme's car was destroyed and had to be replaced by the third M20, Denny was quickly able to recover and earned his second victory of the season at Watkins Glen International, followed immediately by Revson in the other McLaren. Porsche earned their second victory in the next round, aided by rain on race day. After maintaining a close battle with Porsche in the first four races, McLaren saw the rest of the 1972 championship hopes slip away as numerous mechanical problems, mostly related to their Chevrolet motors, left them unable to finish several events. Although Hulme earned two second-place finishes at Edmonton and Riverside, it was no match for Penske-Porsche driver George Follmer. Hulme was able to maintain second place over the trouble season, but earned only half the points total that Follmer amassed; Revson meanwhile was classified sixth in the standings. After failing to secure the Can-Am Championship for the first time since 1966, team owner Teddy Mayer decided to concentrate the company on Formula One and USAC IndyCars, leaving the Can-Am series behind. After McLaren no longer had use for the M20s, all three (including Hulme's rebuilt car) were sold to separate teams. Roy Woods Racing purchased one car for driver David Hobbs to continue campaigning in Can-Am, while Fred Corbett (under the guise of Commander Motor Homes) purchased a car initially for Mario Andretti, who was later replaced by John Cannon. Corbett's M20 was modified to add a turbocharger in an attempt to better match Porsche's further improved car, the 917/30. The third M20 was sold to the German Felder Racing Team for driver Helmut Kelleners, who used it in the European Interserie championship. Although none of the M20s were successful in 1973, the cars would once again be victorious during 1974. Roy Woods' M20 was sold to Herb Caplan's U.S. Racing for the 1974 Can-Am season, with driver Scooter Patrick. Patrick won the final race of the season at Road America after the dominating Shadows suffered mechanical problems. The Can-Am series would be cancelled shortly thereafter. Meanwhile, Kelleners's M20 was able to win in an Interserie event at the Nürburgring en route to finishing second in the drivers championship. ==References== M20 Category:Can-Am cars ","title":"McLaren M20"},{"id":"20387262","text":"Standard ComicsStandard at the Grand Comics Database was an American comic book company owned by publisher Ned Pines.

Ryskulov was born on 26 December 1894 in East-Talgar volost of Semirechensk Province (now Talgar District of Almaty Region), in the family of a nomadic herder. He took part in the Central Asian revolt of 1916 and then in the Russian Revolution in Turkestan and Kyrgyzstan. He defended a view that all the Turkic nations should form one state and one communist party. His policy was rejected and his party was ordered to join Russian Communist Party. He was executed in 1938 during the Great Purge being accused of being a National Communist. Today he is considered a national hero and honored with a large statue at the entrance of Kazakhstan Economic University in Almaty. ==References== Category:1894 births Category:1938 deaths Category:People from Almaty Region Category:Soviet politicians Category:Kazakhstani politicians Category:Great Purge victims from Kazakhstan Category:Pan-Turkists ","title":"Turar Ryskulov"},{"id":"20387459","text":"John L. Martin (born June 5, 1941, in Eagle Lake, Maine) is an American politician of the Democratic Party. Martin has been in Maine politics since his first election to the Maine House of Representatives in 1964, and is sometimes called \\"The Earl of Eagle Lake\\" as a result. With his election in 2014, he is the longest serving legislator in Maine history. ==Political career== Martin was a member of the Maine House of Representatives from 1964 through 1994, serving as Minority Floor Leader from 1971 through 1974. Following that he was elected Speaker of the House from 1975 through 1994. In 1992, one of his aides was convicted in a ballot tampering scandal involving two close House races. It is believed that, combined with his length of service, contributed to Maine voters approving legislative term limits in 1993. In criticizing term limits in 2014, Governor Paul LePage cited Martin as an example of how experienced legislators would benefit the State as opposed to inexperienced legislators with \\"firm agendas\\". From 1998 through 2008, Martin represented the 35th district in the Maine Senate. During that time he also served as Assistant Majority Leader. In 2008, Martin was again elected to the House. He was defeated for re-election in 2012 by Republican Michael Nadeau. Martin stated it was due to money and negative campaigning, stating that \\"If you throw enough mud around, some of it’s going to stick.\\" Financial problems, including failing to pay back loans from two government agencies for his Tamarack Inn, as well as a bankruptcy, may also have played a role in his defeat. He did not rule out running in the future, and said he would remain involved in politics. Martin filed to enter the 2014 race for his old seat, which was re-numbered District 151. State records erroneously listed him as a Republican despite his still being a Democrat. Maine Secretary of State Matthew Dunlap stated the error would be corrected. Martin defeated Nadeau in the November 4, 2014 election. ==Family== Martin is single. ==Education== In 1963, Martin received his BA in History/Government from the University of Maine Orono. ==Political experience== *From 1964 to 1994, 2008–2012, and again from 2014 to present, Martin has been a representative for the Maine State House of Representatives *In 2008 was an assistant majority leader for the Maine State Senate *From 2000 to 2008 was a senator for Maine State Senate *From 1975 to 1994 was a Speaker of the House for the Maine State House *From 1971 to 1974 was a House minority floor leader for the Maine State House *Member of the Democratic National Committee ==Professional experience== *Is an assistant professor in political science and government at the University of Maine Fort Kent. *Takes part in graduate work in political science at the University of Maine Orono. ==References *Maine Senate Democrats - Senator John L.
