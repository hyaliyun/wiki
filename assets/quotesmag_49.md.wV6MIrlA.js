During the breeding season, the males group together at night at temporary pools and call to attract mates. When a female chooses one of the males, amplexus occurs at the edge of the water and the male creates a foam nest in which the eggs are laid; the tadpoles develop in the water and undergo metamorphosis into juvenile frogs in about four weeks. ==Breeding== Female frogs choose a mate based on the attractiveness of a male's call. The females are able to recognize the species of the calling maleRyan, Michael, and Monica Guerra. (2014). The Mechanism of Sound Production in Tungara Frogs and Its Role in Sexual Selection and Speciation. Current Opinion in Neurobiology 28: 54-59. and will preferentially choose to mate with males of the same species. Female preference within the species is based on complexity of call. Males produce a call that consists of a whine, and can also add up to seven short chuck sounds to their mating call. A call consisting of both a whine and a chuck is considered a complex call. The chuck portion of the call is produced by vibrations of a fibrous mass suspended near the frog's larynx, with larger masses allowing production of more chucks per whine. Females usually prefer complex mating calls (whine and chucks) to simple ones.Ryan, MJ. 1985. The túngara frog: a study in sexual selection and communication. University of Chicago Press, Chicago. One study found that females will choose a simple call from a member of their own species rather than a complex call from a foreign or different species. Females prefer the mating call of frogs who produce chucks with lower frequencies. One explanation for this preference is that lower frequency calls are found in males of larger body size, which usually correlates with a higher rate of fertilization.Page, R.A., Bernal, X.E. 2006. Túngara frogs. Current Biology. 23:R979-980 If a female finds a male's call attractive, she will use the call, as well as ripples in the water caused by the its production, to locate her new mate. Natural selection plays a role in the varying complexity of a male's advertisement call. Parasites and predators – such as the fringe-lipped bat (Trachops cirrhosus) – are able to recognize species of frogs based on their mating calls. Like females, these predators prefer complex calls and will use them to locate and prey upon male túngara frogs; thus, males have been found to alternate between complex and simple calls depending on the situation. Males produce complex calls more often when there are other calling males nearby, forming what is known as a chorus. Males that use such calling strategies such are able to maximize the possibility of finding a mate and minimize predation risk.Baugh, A.T, Ryan, M.J. 2010. The relative value of call embellishment in túngara frogs. Behavioral Ecological Sociobiology. 65:359-367. When mating, the male frog centers himself atop the female to do rhythmic mixing of a foam-producing solvent released by the female to generate a floating foam nest.Dalgetty L. and M. W. Kennedy. (2010). Building a home from foam - túngara frog foam nest architecture and three-phase construction process. Biol. Lett. 6(3) 293-296. The nests are resistant bio-foams that protect the fertilized eggs from dehydration, sunlight, temperature, and potential pathogens until the tadpoles hatch. After about four days, the tadpoles leave and the nest degrades but otherwise can last for up to two weeks. The foam is made up of a mixture of novel proteins (ranaspumins) with unusual surfactant and carbohydrate binding properties that are thought to contribute to the formation and stabilization of the nest structure, resisting dehydration, predation and microbial degradation, whilst being compatible with developing eggs and embryos.Alan Cooper & Malcolm W. Kennedy, Biofoams and natural protein surfactants, 2010, Biophysical Chemistry, 151: 96-104. doi:10.1016/j.bpc.2010.06.006Fleming, R. I., C. D. Mackenzie, A. Cooper, and M. W. Kennedy. 2009.

At the age of 18, she considered consecrating her life to God in a contemplative monastery of the Basilian nuns, then the only Eastern-rite women's religious congregation.\\"Josaphata Hordashevska(1869-1919)\\", Vatican News Service She attended a spiritual retreat which was preached by a Basilian monk, Father Jeremiah Lomnytskyj, whose spiritual guidance she sought. With his permission, Hordashevska took a private vow of chastity for one year. She was to renew this vow twice. At that time, Lomnytsky, seeing that there was a need of active Religious Sisters to meet the social needs of the poor and needy faithful of the church, had decided to establish a women's congregation which would follow an active life of service. He did so in conjunction with Father Cyril Sielecki, pastor of the village of Zhuzhelyany. Lomnytsky felt that Hordashevska would be an appropriate candidate to found such a congregation. Thus she was asked to be the foundress of such a group, rather than follow the monastic life she had been considering. When she agreed, she was sent in June 1892 to the Polish Roman Catholic Felician Sisters to experience the life of community which followed an active consecrated life. Hordashevska returned to Lviv two months later and, on 24 August 1892, took the religious habit of the new Congregation and received the name Josaphata, in honor of the Ukrainian Catholic martyr, Josaphat Kuntsevych. She then went to Zhuzhelyany, and became the first Superior of the seven young women who had been recruited for the new institute, training them in the spirit and charism of the Sisters Servants: \\"Serve your people where the need is greatest\\". For the rest of her life, Hordashevska led the new Congregation, through its growth and development. She oversaw the development of the various new ministries the Sisters entered. For this, she had to steer a new path for the Sisters in the Eastern Church, sometimes being caught between the conflicting visions of Fathers Lomnytsky and Sielecki.\\"Blessed Josaphata Hordashevska and Her Icon\\", Ukrainian Catholic Eparchy of Saskatoon By 1902 the Congregation numbered 128 Sisters, in 26 convents across the country. They were able to hold their first General Chapter in August of that year, at which Hordashevska was elected the first Superior General of the Congregation and Lomnytsky resigned from that office. Soon, however, internal divisions led Hordashevska to tender her resignation to the Metropolitan Archbishop of Lviv, Andrey Sheptytsky. Under the new Superior General appointed by the Metropolitan Archbishop, Hordashevska and her natural sister, Sister Arsenia Hordashevska, were denied permission to take permanent vows. Due to her canonical status of still being in temporary vows, Hordashevska was ineligible to participate in the next General Chapter of the Congregation. Nonetheless, she was elected Vicaress General of the Congregation in absentia, with the delegates of the Chapter petitioning the Metropolitan that she be allowed to make her permanent vows. This request was granted, and Hordashevska did so the following day, 11 May 1909, and assumed the office to which she had been voted. Three years later, Hordashevska was diagnosed with tuberculosis of the bone. In 1919, at the age of 49 and on the day she had predicted, she died amidst terrible suffering. Her mortal remains were exhumed in 1982 and taken to Rome, where they are kept in a reliquary in the General Motherhouse of the Sisters Servants in Rome. The process of her beatification started in Rome in 1983 and on 27 June 2001 she was beatified by Pope John Paul II in Lviv. \\"Beatifications of Pope Saint John Paul II\\", Vatican News Service Numerous miracles are ascribed due to her intercession after her death. As of 2001, her religious order, the Sisters Servants of Mary Immaculate is now the largest female religious community in the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church. == Influence == According to the testimony of Sister Philomena Yuskiv, \\"She[Josaphata Hordashevska] showed her love for her people through her heart-felt desire to lift them up morally and spiritually; she taught children, youth and women, served the sick, visited the poor and needy, taught liturgical chant and looked after the Church's beauty.\\" == Relics == In November 1982, Sister Josaphata's remains were transferred to a small chapel in the General Chapter of the Congregation of the Sisters Servants of Mary Immaculate in Rome. Small parts of the relics remain in various places around Ukraine. This includes a monastery in the city of Lviv, located on Pasichna Street. == Beatification == On 27 June 2001, she was proclaimed Blessed by Pope St. John Paul II in Lviv.

He was twice Mayor of Albany, New York and built one of the largest mansions in the area, the Ten Broeck Mansion, that still stands more than 200 years later. ==Early life== Abraham Ten Broeck was the son of Dirck Ten Broeck (1686–1751) and Margarita (née Cuyler) (1682–1783). He was the brother of Catharine Ten Broeck Livingston, who was married to John Livingston (a son of Robert Livingston the Younger), Anna Ten Broeck, and Christina Ten Broeck, who was married to Philip Livingston, and New York State Senator Dirck W. Ten Broeck, who married Anna Douw (a daughter of Mayor Volkert P. Douw). His father was a prominent merchant and politician who served as Albany's mayor beginning in 1746. His paternal grandfather Wessel Ten Broeck, was the son of former Albany mayor Dirck Wesselse Ten Broeck. His maternal grandparents were Abraham Cuyler, the brother of former Albany mayor Cornelis Cuyler, and Caatje (née Bleecker) Cuyler, a daughter of former Albany mayor Jan Jansen Bleecker. ==Career== Abraham was sent to New York City to learn business with his sister Christina's husband, Philip Livingston. In 1751, at seventeen years old, he was sent to Europe to learn international business after his father's death, returning to Albany in 1752. Ten Broeck increased his wealth via trade while in Albany. During the 1750s, he was involved in the provincial militia. In 1759, he was elected to the Albany City Council and in 1760, he was elected to the Province of New York Assembly while continuing to serve Albany. In 1769, his brother-in-law died at age 27 and Ten Broeck was named co-administrator of the Manor of Rensselaerswyck, a position he held until 1784 when his nephew, Stephen Van Rensselaer III, came of age. American Revolution Ten Broeck continued his military involvement and was named colonel of the Albany County militia in 1775. He was Commander of Ten Broeck's Brigade (New York Militia) at the Second Battle of Saratoga (Battle of Bemis Heights) on October 7, 1777, as part of the Left wing of Major General Horatio Gates. On June 25, 1778, he was named Brigadier General of the Tryon and Albany Counties of Militia and then Albany County only. He resigned March 26, 1781. He was a member of the New York Provincial Congress from 1775 to 1777 and was its chairman of its Committee of Safety in 1777. After war years After the death of Mayor John Barclay, Ten Broeck was appointed Mayor of Albany in 1779, remaining in office until 1783. In March 1789, he ran for Congress but was defeated by Jeremiah Van Rensselaer. In 1796, Mayor Abraham Yates, Jr. died and Ten Broeck was again appointed Mayor of Albany, remaining in office until 1798 when he was succeeded by another nephew, Philip Schuyler Van Rensselaer (1767–1824). Ten Broeck was a Federalist presidential elector in 1796, and cast his votes for John Adams and Thomas Pinckney. ==Personal life== Prospect\\", the Ten Broeck Mansion, built 1798.

Elizabeth and her brother were great-grandchildren of the first native-born mayor of New York City, Stephanus Van Cortlandt. Together, they were the parents of five children, including: * Dirck Ten Broeck (1765–1833), who married Cornelia Stuyvesant (d. 1825), a daughter of Petrus and Margaret (née Livingston) Stuyvesant. * Elizabeth Ten Broeck (1772–1848), who married Rensselaer Schuyler (1773–1847), a son of Philip Schuyler and Catherine Van Rensselaer, and the younger brother of Angelica Schuyler Church, Elizabeth Schuyler Hamilton, Peggy Schuyler Van Rensselaer, and Philip Jeremiah Schuyler. * Margarita Ten Broeck (1776–1812), who died unmarried. By the mid-1760s, Ten Broeck was one of Albany's wealthiest men. The Ten Broecks lived in a house that was assessed equally with the Schuyler Mansion and Yates Mansion in 1788.

It is endemic to eastern and southeastern Brazil. This common frog is found in primary and secondary forest, on the forest edge, and in degraded areas near forest. This species is present in the illegal pet trade. Its habitat is subject to loss caused by agriculture, wood plantations, livestock grazing, clear-cutting, human settlement and tourism. The specific name boiei was given in honour of German zoologist Heinrich Boie or his brother Friedrich Boie. ==Description== Juvenile Proceratophrys boiei from Carlos Botelho State Park, Brazil Proceratophrys boiei is a moderate-sized, robust frog, growing to a length of between , with males tending to be slightly smaller than females. Both head and body are relatively broad, the snout is rounded, and long, tapering peaks of skin project from above the eyes. The surface of the skin on both back and flanks is covered with warts. The colouring is an irregular geometric pattern of brown, black, yellow, orange and red, such that the frog becomes nearly invisible against the background of leaf litter among which it lives. There is also a broad brown or grey dorsal stripe. ==Ecology== Proceratophrys boiei feeds largely on insects and their larvae. An examination of the stomach contents showed that beetles constitute about 40% of the diet, with othopterans (grasshoppers and crickets) constituting another 25%. When disturbed, Proceratophrys boiei makes a leap and then flattens itself on the leaf litter with its limbs stiff and splayed; with its skin protuberances and cryptic colouring it then closely resembles dead leaves and is likely to be overlooked by predators that hunt by sight. This stiff-legged defensive posture has now been recorded in at least seven frog species in four different families; one of these is Scythrophrys sawayae, which is also found in the forests of southeastern Brazil. ==Status== This frog has a wide range and a presumed large total population. The threats it faces are likely to be as a result of such human activities as forest clearance for agriculture, plantation crops and grazing, and it is also collected for the pet trade. The International Union for Conservation of Nature has rated its conservation status as being of \\"least concern\\" as any decrease in population sizes is likely to be at too slow a rate to be sufficient to classify it in a more threatened category. ==References== boiei Category:Amphibians of Brazil Category:Endemic fauna of Brazil Category:Amphibians described in 1824 Category:Taxa named by Prince Maximilian of Wied-Neuwied Category:Taxonomy articles created by Polbot ","title":"Proceratophrys boiei"},{"id":"12390620","text":"Proceratophrys brauni is a species of frog in the family Odontophrynidae.

Common name horn toad has been coined for this species. ==Description== Adult males measure and adult females in snout–vent length. The body is robust and stout. The snout is short but has a pointed tip in dorsal view. The eyes are large. The tympanum is scarcely visible. The arms and the legs short and robust; the toes are slightly webbed. The upper eyelids have usually three distinct protuberant tubercles. Dorsal skin is granular and warty, bearing variably arranged and sized tubercles and ridges.

His grandfather, Jeremiah Hatfield, was a half-brother to Valentine Hatfield (1789–1867), grandfather of William Anderson \\"Devil Anse\\" Hatfield, leader of the Hatfield family involved in the famous Hatfield-McCoy Feud (see Hatfield Family Tree). According to the 1900 Census, two older brothers, Orison and Hereford, an older sister Chloe, and a younger sister and brother, Martha Alice and Freeland, were then still living at home with him and their parents. His eldest sister Vandalia or Vandella was already married by this time, and an older brother, Melvin, had left home. As a child, Hatfield worked on his father's farm. He became a miner in his teens, and then worked as a blacksmith for several years. He received his nickname, \\"Smilin' Sid\\", because of the gold caps on several of his upper teeth. He seems to have had a reputation for hard living and fighting, and his appointment in 1919 to the post of Police Chief of Matewan, by the mayor, Cabell Cornelis Testerman (1882–1920), surprised some of the more \\"respectable\\" townsfolk.See interview with Dixie Accord in documentary West Virginia: A Film History However, he was a staunch supporter of the United Mine Workers of America, as was Testerman: together, they were instrumental in leading the mining community's resistance to the Baldwin-Felts operatives. Operatives offered both men substantial bribes to allow them to station machine guns in the town. Hatfield and Testerman refused. The Battle of Matewan was precipitated by the Baldwin-Felts agents' attempts to evict the families of unionized miners. On June 2, 1920, in Huntington, he married Jessie Lee Maynard (1894–1976), the widowed second wife of Testerman, who had been mortally wounded in the battle. The speed of the marriage (they were married 11 days after Testerman's death, the morning after being arrested in a hotel room together and charged with having \\"improper relations\\") led to an attempt at arrest and accusations by Thomas Felts and the Baldwin-Felts spy, Charles Everett Lively, that he, not Albert Felts, had shot the Mayor because of his desire for Jessie. However, according to Jessie, her first husband, aware of the danger of their situation, had asked that his friend take care of her and their young son, Jackson (1915–2001), should he be killed.Lon Savage, Thunder in the Mountains: the West Virginia Mine War, 1920–21, 1985, pp. 26-28. The battle had given Hatfield a degree of celebrity. He appeared in a short film, \\"Smilin' Sid,\\" for the United Mine Workers (UMWA), and was photographed with other UMWA activists, including Mary Harris \\"Mother\\" Jones. However, he was aware that his life was in danger from Felts, who sought vengeance for his brothers Albert and Lee. He was indicted on murder charges stemming from the Matewan shootout but was later acquitted by the jury. He was sent to stand trial with his friend and deputy, Edward Chambers, on conspiracy charges for another incident, in Welch, West Virginia. The conspiracy charges were based on an incident in Mohawk, West Virginia, located in McDowell County near the border of Mingo County. The mining camp of Mohawk was shot up, and according to the local mine guards, the perpetrators were Mingo County strikers led by Sid Hatfield and Ed Chambers, intending to force the Mohawk miners to unionize. (p 65, Howard B. Lee, Bloodletting in Appalachia) According to C.E. Lively's secret testimony (leading to Hatfield's indictment), Lively had persuaded miners in his restaurant--as well as Hatfield and Chambers--to do something drastic: he encouraged the miners to arm themselves and shoot up the nonunion tipple at Mohawk. At this location, the mine guards had a reception committee waiting for them, with bloodhounds and machine guns, while Lively made himself busy on the telephone. (When Miners March, William Blizzard) The union leaders, on the other hand, argued that the shooting was done by McDowell County mine guards, and that they were attempting to falsely accuse Hatfield and Chambers of the offense in order to ambush them in McDowell County. (p 65, Howard B. Lee, Bloodletting in Appalachia) At the assurances of McDowell County sheriff W.J. \\"Bill\\" Hatfield, a distant relative of Sid Hatfield, Ed Chambers and Sid Hatfield were told that they would have the fullest protection of the sheriff's office. However, the day before the shooting at Mohawk, Sheriff Hatfield left the county for Craig Healing Springs in Virginia. (p 67, Howard B. Lee, Bloodletting in Appalachia) Both men arrived in Welch on August 1, 1921, unarmed and accompanied by their wives. Several Baldwin-Felts men shot them on the McDowell County Courthouse steps. Hit in the arm, and three or four times in the chest, Hatfield died instantly.Death Certificate. Mrs Hatfield's distress is suggested by her confusion over her father-in-law's name: the correct name, \\"Jake\\", has been struck out and overwritten with \\"Freeland\\", the name of Sid's younger brother. Chambers was shot several more times, as his wife tried to defend him, and finished off with a bullet in the head by Charles Everett Lively.Both the film \\"Matewan\\" and Newsinger's review of it, \\"Matewan: film and working class struggle\\", mistakenly claim that it was Hatfield to whom Lively gave the coup-de-grace: Sallie Chambers' testimony and the injuries noted on the two men's death certificates make it clear, however, that it was Chambers. None of the Baldwin-Felts detectives was ever convicted of Hatfield's assassination: they claimed they had acted \\"in self-defense.\\" There was an outpouring of grief for the fallen local heroes at the funeral, which was attended by at least 3,000 people, and conducted with full honors from the Odd Fellows, Knights of Pythias and Redmen (he was a member of all of these organizations). ==Legacy== Director John Sayles' Academy Award-nominated 1987 film Matewan starred David Strathairn in the role of Hatfield. West Virginia: A Film History mistakenly identifies him as Albert Sidney Hatfield, as well as claiming that he was not related to \\"Devil Anse\\" Hatfield. This may be because of rumours that he was illegitimate, and so possibly not of Hatfield descent.Lon Savage, Thunder in the Mountains, p. 10: however, the name Savage gives for Sid's putative father, Crabtree, is his mother's maiden name, and he gives no source for the claim. ==See also== * List of worker deaths in United States labor disputes ==ReferencesFurther reading== * David Alan Corbin (ed.), Gun Thugs, Rednecks, and Radicals: A Documentary History of the West Virginia Mine Wars, PM Press, Oakland CA, 2011, * Desmond Kilkeary, The Hatfields and the Baldwin- Felts * Joe Roxby, '\\"Two Gun\\" Sid Hatfield' * Lon Savage, Thunder in the Mountains: The West Virginia Mine War, 1920–21, University of Pittsburgh Press, Pittsburgh, 1990, * West Virginia Archives & History, On This Day in West Virginia History...: The Matewan Massacre * Matewan at the Internet Movie Database ==External links== * * West Virginia Mine Wars Museum independent history museum covering the Mine Wars Era in Matewan, WV.

There has been discussions whether these two species are distinct. In 1997, Caramaschi and Ulisses argued that the distinguishing character between P. schirchi and P. precrenulata—the apparent absence of tubercles on the upper eyelids in the former—was not real but attributable to the poor preservation of the types. The type series of both taxa were collected from the same locality. This led Caramaschi and Ulisses to argue that P. schirchi and P. precrenulata are the same species, and chose P. schirchi as the valid name because the type series of P. precrenulata is lost and P. schirchi appeared first in the publication in which both were described. ==Description== Adult males measure in snout–vent length. The eyelids have a row of enlarged, pointed tubercles.

Artifacts found at the site are concentrated in multiple small middens that are believed to represent individual campsites.

Such large sites as Adams County, or \\"Sandy Springs\\" as it is also known, are rare among Paleo-Indian sites; most discoveries related to the people are isolated finds, although a comparable archaeological district known as the Welling Site has been discovered in Coshocton County, Ohio. It appears that southern Adams County was highly significant for such primitive peoples because of its geology: one of Ohio's few regions with combined shale and limestone bedrock, the Sandy Springs area is geologically similar to the Kentucky Bluegrass, making it a natural migration route for herds of animals roaming the Bluegrass. As a result, Paleo-Indian hunters learned to use the area to watch for and ambush large herds of animals, which would have been travelling slowly due to the large river. ==Recognition== The Adams County Paleo-Indian Archeological District is particularly valuable as a well-preserved example of the Paleo-Indian period.

In the 19th century, a part of the Austrian Empire belonged to the German Confederation. In the revolutionary era of 1848–1850, it was discussed whether Austria or a part of Austria could belong to a new German federal state. In 1867–1871, the 'Lesser Germany' became reality: a federal state under leadership of Prussia and without Austria. After that, the term lost its significance because since then 'Germany' is usually identified as this Lesser Germany. The other term, Greater Germany, remained in use for those who sought to incorporate Austria or the German-speaking parts of Austria into Germany. This became a political issue in the aftermath of World War One and then again in 1938–1945. During the Cold War, when Germany was divided, a unified Germany was called 'Gesamtdeutschland'. == Evolution in the revolutionary era == Map of the German Confederation, 1815-1848 and 1851-1866 Since 1815, the German states had belonged to the German Confederation. Its territory was defined essentially after the Holy Roman Empire. Some member states belonged to the confederation only with a part of their territories, such as Prussia and especially Austria. The territory within the confederation was called bundeszugehörig (belonging to the confederation), the other bundesfremd (foreign to the confederation). Only Bundesgebiet (federal territory = territory within the boundaries of the confederation) was protected by the military provisions of the German Confederation. In March 1848, revolution broke out in Germany and other European countries. The Federal Assembly, the only organ of the German Confederation, elected a National Assembly to work out a constitution for a German federal state. The German National Assembly also installed a provisional head of state (the uncle of the Austrian Emperor) and government. Initially, it was universally accepted that the federal territory of Austria should be a part of the new German state. During the course of 1848, it became evident that the Austrian government was not willing to live with the consequences of a German federal state. The German National Assembly refused to accept all of Austria, as this would have burdened the new state with the nationality conflicts of Austria. Only the part of Austria that was already federal territory was welcome, even if it included a large ethnic minority (the Czechs). The rest of Austria had to be separate in terms of constitution, government and administration. The Austrian Emperor would be head of state of both parts in a personal union. Austria refused this division of its imperial territory: It was afraid that the personal union was insufficient to keep the parts of Austria together. In March 1849, the Austrian Emperor issued a new Austrian constitution which defined Austria as a centralist state. By then, the German National Assembly was already divided in 'Greater Germans' (often Catholics) and 'Lesser Germans'. The latter tendency became in March 1849 the majority.Wolfram Siemann: Die deutsche Revolution von 1848/49. Suhrkamp Verlag, Frankfurt 1985, pp. 195-197. It voted for a German constitution that left open the accession of Austria, but elected the Prussian king to be German Emperor. The Prussian king refused to accept the imperial crown in April. But immediately, he tried to unify Germany by himself with a project that was later called 'Erfurt Union'. Austria was not supposed to become part of this version of Lesser Germany. Joseph von Radowitz, adviser to the Prussian king and actual leader of the project, tried to bind Austria and the Union together in a confederation. Austria rejected these attempts and made Prussia give up its union plans in late 1850. == Evolution after 1850 == Germany since 1871: In late 1870, the south German states joined the North German Confederation which changed its name to Deutsches Reich. 'Lesser Germany' became a reality. Austria remained a part of the re-established German Confederation, while Prussia still tried to improve its position within the confederation and even cherished its union plans. Around 1860, the German question became dynamic again. Austria came out weakened by the Italian War of the previous year while Prussia sought to gain the approval of the national movement. Several proposals were made to reform the German Confederation, most notably in 1863 at the Frankfurter Fürstentag. At this moment, the networks of the political elites in Lesser Germany were already quite separate from the Austrian ones. In April and June 1866, Prussia proposed to convert the German Confederation into a federal state without Austria. Bavaria refused to become Prussia's junior partner in this project. But nevertheless Prussia sought the confrontation with Austria that was unwilling to accept Prussia as its equal within the confederation. The Austro-Prussian War of summer 1866 ended with a Prussian victory and the dissolution of the German Confederation. Prussia established a federal state in Northern Germany, called the North German Confederation. In the peace treaty with Austria, and already before with France, Prussia promised not to expand the North German state to southern Germany. Austria still tried to be a player in the German question. In summer 1870, war broke out between France and the North German Confederation. The south German states were loyal to their military conventions with the North. Austria did not dare to support France because of its weak position after the war of 1866 and because of the German-speaking inhabitants sympathizing with the German cause. Finally, the Austrian government accepted the evolution and the creation of a Lesser Germany in December 1870.Michael Kotulla: Deutsche Verfassungsgeschichte. Vom Alten Reich bis Weimar (1495–1934).

It is monotypic, being represented by the single species, Scythrophrys sawayae, commonly known as the Banhado frog, after its type locality. It is endemic to Serra do Mar in Paraná and Santa Catarina states, south-eastern Brazil. Its natural habitats are secondary and old growth forests; reproduction takes place in temporary pools. Its populations are scattered but it is locally common. It is threatened by habitat loss. This species was first described in 1953 by the American herpetologist Doris Mable Cochran whose research was focused on the herpetofauna of the West Indies and South America. ==Description== The Banhado frog is a small, plump frog, growing to a length of about , with males being slightly smaller than females. The snout is pointed and there are pointed projections above the eyes. The limbs are slender and the digits bear small disc-shaped pads. There are three distinct colour forms; about 50% of individuals are dark brown, the rest being either green or light tan. The limbs are yellowish-brown, and there is a pale fold of skin separating the dorsal surface from the flanks. ==Ecology== The Banhado frog lives among the leaf litter on the forest floor. When it is stationary it is difficult to discern among the dead leaves; the shape of its body and the variability of its colouring may make it more difficult for a potential predator to learn to recognise it as prey. When disturbed, it adopts a defensive posture, thrusting its limbs stiffly outwards, thereby making itself appear larger than it actually is. In this posture and in its resemblance to a dead leaf, it is similar to Proceratophrys boiei, another frog found on the floor of Brazil's rain forests. ==Status== The Banhado frog is endemic to the Serra do Mar, a series of mountain ranges in southeastern Brazil, in the states of Paraná and Santa Catarina. Its typical habitat is virgin or secondary growth forest at altitudes of between . It has a somewhat limited range, with an area of occupancy of probably less than and it is common in suitable habitat. Although it does not occur in any protected areas, the forests in which it lives are relatively undisturbed, and any decrease in populations is likely to be at too slow a rate to be sufficient to classify it in a more threatened category, so the International Union for Conservation of Nature has rated its conservation status as being of \\"least concern\\". ==References== Category:Leptodactylidae Category:Monotypic amphibian genera Category:Amphibians of Brazil Category:Endemic fauna of Brazil Category:Taxa named by John Douglas Lynch Category:Taxonomy articles created by Polbot ","title":"Scythrophrys"},{"id":"12390745","text":"Hiroshige's print of Samegai-juku, part of the series The Sixty-nine Stations of the Kiso KaidōA view of Samegai-juku from Kamo Shrine (加茂神社 Kamo Jinja). was the sixty-first of the sixty-nine stations of the Nakasendō.

Fingers and toes are long and slender, with the toes being about one-third webbed. Eyes have two symmetrical rounded structures on the centre of the upper and lower border of the iris. The skin is smooth. Colouration is bright yellowish-brown on the upper surfaces of the head, body and legs. There are irregular dark spots across the back, and wavy dark reticulated lines on the sides of the body and backs of the thighs. There is a characteristic yellowish stripe that runs centrally down the top of the head and half of the back. The belly is purplish-yellow with dark grey reticulated spots. The lower surface of the thighs is purplish-rose and bears faint grey reticulated spots. ==Habitat and conservation== Pleurodema somuncurense is a fully aquatic frog that inhabits geothermal springs and streams. It is threatened by predation by introduced rainbow trout and by habitat loss from canalization of spring water. Also livestock farming has negative impacts through overgrazing and chemical pollution. The grassland fires used to promote regrowth of pasture for livestock impact the frogs availability of shelters, reproductive sites, and terrestrial preys.

Stefania evansi is, along with other closely related frogs, known for its unusual reproductive mode where females carry the eggs and juveniles on their back. It is sometimes known under common names Groete Creek carrying frog, Groete Creek treefrog, or Evans' stefania (the \\"treefrog\\" designation can be misleading as Stefania are no longer included in the family Hylidae). These names refer to its type locality, Groete Creek in the region Essequibo Islands-West Demerara, Guyana, where the holotype was collected by one Dr. R. Evans. ==Distribution and habitat== Stefania evansi is endemic to Guyana and distributed in forested lowlands of west-central Guyana at altitudes below . Frogs collected at higher altitudes probably represent Stefania scalae, a species that was for a while considered to be synonymous with Stefania evansi. It generally occurs in habitats with low human impact and is not considered threatened. ==Description== Stefania evansi is one of the largest members of the genus: males grow to up to in snout–vent length and females to . Stefania evansi is dimorphic with respect to colouration: one morph is plain, and the other one is striped. A single brood can contain both morphs. ==Reproduction== As is typical for the genus, female Stefania evansi carry the eggs on their back and juveniles develop fully on their mother's back. The eggs and juveniles are exposed but adhere to a mucus layer. Brood size is variable: among 11 recorded clutches, it is 11–30 eggs and increases with female size; 30 eggs is the highest brood size recorded in the genus. Eggs containing tailed, gilled larvae measure in diameter. Eggs hatch on the female's back as froglets, without free-living larval stage. Juveniles stay on their mother's back until they are about in length, although smaller ( SVL) independent juveniles can also be found. It is speculated that the juveniles leave their mother's back when the resorption of the gill stalks is complete, coinciding with the consumption of all yolk. Juveniles may leave their mother also prematurely, showing residual gill stalks and yolk in their bellies, in response to stress caused by handling or predation. The duration of development and brooding is not known, but is assumed to require about 2–3 months. Breeding seems more frequent during—but not strictly restricted to—the rainy season. ==References== Category:Stefania Category:Amphibians of Guyana Category:Endemic fauna of Guyana Category:Taxonomy articles created by Polbot Category:Amphibians described in 1904 ","title":"Stefania evansi"},{"id":"12390776","text":"Stefania ginesi (tepuis treefrog, ) is a species of frog in the family Hemiphractidae.

It was held six times, traditionally in late summer approximately six months in advance of contested presidential Iowa caucuses, from 1979 until 2011, on the campus of Iowa State University in Ames. The event attracted both praise and criticism, with supporters noting that it raised funds for the Republican Party of Iowa and winnowed large fields of presidential candidates. Critics asserted that it catered to extremist candidates and put a financial squeeze on campaigns.https://www.nytimes.com/1987/09/12/us/in-iowa- republicans-who-pay-their-money-can-vote-their-choice.html The poll itself held a mixed record as a bellwether for either the Iowa caucuses or the GOP nomination; three times (George H. W. Bush in '79, Bob Dole in '95, and George W. Bush in '99) would the winner of the straw poll also win the Iowa caucuses the next year, but only twice ('95 and '99) did these candidates go on to win the GOP nomination. Only one winner of the straw poll, George W. Bush, would go on to win the presidency. On June 12, 2015, the Republican Party of Iowa announced that the straw poll will no longer be held. A similar poll (also at times referred to as the Iowa Straw Poll ) has been conducted at the Iowa State Fair since 2015. ==Format== The poll took place among attendees of a fundraising dinner benefiting the Iowa Republican Party. Before the vote, each candidate was given an opportunity to make a short speech to the attendees. The poll has been described as a cross between a political convention and a county fair, where Iowa voters had a chance to mingle, eat barbecue and have a little fun. The party divided the venue into sections and auctioned each to the candidates, who could then set up booths to present their case to the voters. The larger areas and those closest to the entrance tended to fetch the highest price. In 2011 bidding started at $15,000 and ranged to as high as $31,000 (bid by Ron Paul). Non-Republicans were allowed to vote in the Iowa Straw Poll. However, for the later years of the poll, all voters were required to be at least 16 1/2 years of age, be a legal resident of Iowa or a student attending an Iowa university or college, and purchase a ticket, although some campaigns paid the fee for their supporters. Voters had their hands stamped or their thumbs dipped in ink when entering the voting area so that they could not vote twice. Ballots were put into electronic voting machines. ==Significance== As a straw poll, the Iowa Straw Poll's results were non- binding and had no official effect on the presidential primaries. However, the straw poll was frequently seen as a first test of organizational strength in Iowa by the news media and party insiders. As such, it could be beneficial for the winning candidate on the national level because it built momentum for their campaign, enhanced their aura of inevitability, or showed off a superior field operation. Nevertheless, in the six times the poll was held, the winner of the Iowa Straw Poll went on to win the Iowa caucuses only three times for that same election cycle. The winner of the straw poll won the Republican presidential nomination twice for that same election cycle. Two additional winners of the straw poll (George H.W. Bush and Mitt Romney) would win the Republican nomination, but not in the same election cycle that they won the straw poll. Usually the winner or the second-place finisher in the straw poll went on to win the Iowa caucuses, although in 2011, Rick Santorum placed fourth in the straw poll before winning the caucuses the following January. On a more local level, the Iowa Straw Poll gave a major boost to the local economy. Thousands of people, including journalists, campaign staffers, and voters, arrived in town each election cycle around the time of the poll. The Iowa Straw Poll was one of the Iowa Republican Party's most lucrative fundraising events. ==Criticisms== In its early years, the Iowa Straw Poll was criticized for having many voters who were not residents of Iowa. Candidates would bus in supporters from other states. However, beginning with the 1999 Iowa Straw Poll, all voters were required to show proof of legal residence in Iowa. Before the 1999 Iowa Straw Poll, cheating was perceived to be widespread: many individuals managed to vote repeatedly by visiting the bathroom and washing off the stamp on the back of their hand which indicated they had voted. Beginning with the 1999 Iowa Straw Poll, the ink used for hand-stamping was changed to one that resisted being washed off. In 2007, instead of hand-stamping, thumbs were dipped in indelible ink. In 2007, the Iowa Straw Poll was criticized for having only 14,302 voters participating, compared to about 23,000 voters eight years earlier in the 1999 polls, and for failing to have three of the four leading candidates participate in the poll, Rudolph Giuliani, John McCain and Fred Thompson. Consequently, the votes received by Mitt Romney and second-place finisher Mike Huckabee failed to demonstrate the consequence of full competition among all candidates. The poll was criticized for heavily favoring better-funded candidates, as better-funded candidates were able to afford transportation costs to bus in more supporters and to reimburse those supporters for meal tickets. In 2012, Iowa Governor Terry Branstad said \\"I think the straw poll has outlived its usefulness\\" and \\"It has been a great fundraiser for the party but I think its days are over.\\" Iowa governor: Straw poll 'outlived usefulness' USA Today. November 21, 2102. The party eventually decided to cancel the 2015 contest and all future contests on June 12, 2015; several high-profile candidates had indicated they would not participate in that year's poll, and the party stated that the poll was causing a distraction from the state's official caucus several months after the straw poll. ==Results== Summary of results {  ! width=\\"16%\\"  Date ! width=\\"16%\\"  Associated primaries and/or elections ! width=\\"16%\\"  Winner of Iowa Straw Poll ! width=\\"16%\\"  Winner of Iowa Caucus ! width=\\"16%\\"  Winner of Republican primaries ! width=\\"16%\\"  Winner of presidential election ! width=\\"4%\\"  Price of a dinner ticket -   1980 Republican primaries 1980 presidential election  George H.

Bush was cemented as the frontrunner by the results of the Iowa Straw Poll and eventually went on to win the Iowa caucuses; Steve Forbes, who had committed a fair amount of cash to winning the poll, was embarrassed by his second-place showing. Elizabeth Dole, who had spent comparably less, considered her third-place finish a boost to her flagging campaign (though she dropped out two months later due to lackluster fundraising). John McCain, who would later emerge as Bush's only serious competition in the GOP primaries, received just 83 votes in the poll, but was not an official candidate at the time; he was also considered unpopular in Iowa due to his opposition to ethanol subsidies. Due to poor results in the Iowa Straw Poll, Lamar Alexander and Dan Quayle both dropped out of the presidential race immediately after the Iowa Straw Poll. 2007 Sources of results: CBS News, Des Moines Register, KCCI {  style=\\"margin:auto;\\" - !

On March 12, 2015, Boone was announced as the winning bidder, after a vote by GOP party board members. However, several of the Republican presidential candidates—including Jeb Bush, Lindsey Graham, Mike Huckabee, and Marco Rubio—announced that they would not take part in the straw poll. On June 12, 2015, the Republican Party of Iowa announced that, as the result of a unanimous vote, the straw poll would no longer be held due to the decline in candidate support. Despite the absence of an official straw poll, the 2015 Iowa State Fair held an informal poll of its attendees (both Republican and Democrat), and found Donald Trump to be the most favored GOP candidate, and Bernie Sanders the most popular Democrat.

It is endemic to Chile and is only known from its type locality near Calama, in the El Loa province. Only 14 individuals are known from captivity following the destruction of its habitat prior to 2019, so it may already be extinct in the wild. The specific name dankoi honors professor , a Chilean geneticist. Prior to its description in 1999, it was confused with Telmatobius halli. ==Description== Adult males measure and females in snout–vent length. There are small thorns on the posterior third of the body, flanks, head, and extremities. Tympanum and tympanic ring are absent. The toes are webbed. Males have small nuptial spines. The tadpoles are large: the longest measured tadpole was . The body is ovoid and measures about among the largest tadpoles. ==Habitat and ecology== The species has been collected in small streams along the Loa River at about above sea level. The streams are bordered by Baccharis glutinosa and Tessaria absinthioides and are located in a high desert environment. Stomach contents of two adult specimens revealed a diet consisting of odonate larvae, snails of genus Littoridina, and amphipods (Hyalella gracilicornis); the last were the dominant group. Beetles from families Dytiscidae and Elmidae were present in the habitat but not identified in the stomach contents. Tapeworm Ophiotaenia calamensis was described as a new species based on specimens from the small intestine of this frog. Three tapeworms, measuring in total length, were found in the eight adult male frogs examined. ==Conservation== In 2015, the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) assessed Telmatobius dankoi as being critically endangered. Its range is very small, and the habitat is affected by water pollution from mining activities. Additional threats are abstraction of surface water for human consumption and agriculture, as well as recreational activities. In 2019, a team of conservationists and indigenous leaders visited the type locality of the species and found that it had been devastated by water extraction by mining, agriculture, and real estate development, with the creeks completely dry and the vegetation parched. The lack of dead frogs indicated that the change had happened a long time prior to their arrival. Further surveys found a small, muddy pool of water nearby which contained 14 highly malnourished individuals, possibly the last surviving members of the species. The frogs were captured and transported to the Chilean National Zoo for the purpose of captive breeding. Conservationists have petitioned the Chilean government to protect and restore the habitat of T. dankoi for reintroduction. ==References== dankoi Category:Amphibians of the Andes Category:Amphibians of Chile Category:Endemic fauna of Chile Category:Amphibians described in 1999 Category:Taxonomy articles created by Polbot ","title":"Telmatobius dankoi"},{"id":"12390902","text":"Telmatobius degener is a species of frog in the family Telmatobiidae.

This information is important to consumers wishing to minimize their ecological footprint and contribution to global warming made by their purchases. ==Existing programs== The world's first carbon label, the Carbon Reduction Label, shows the carbon footprint embodied in a product and was first introduced in the UK in 2006 by the Carbon Trust. Examples of products featuring their carbon footprint are Walkers Crisps, Kingsmill bread, British Sugar, Cemex cement, Marshalls paving and Quaker Oats, which have all used the label. One of the biggest supporters of carbon labelling was Tesco, who began labelling a range of products including washing detergent, light bulbs, oranges, milk and toilet paper in 2007. In 2012 the scheme was terminated due to unforeseen costs and lack of take-up by other businesses. HBOS feature it on their online bank account. The Carbon Trust label also requires companies to commit to reduce the embodied carbon in the labeled product or they lose the right to feature the label. An independent panel is currently verifying the process alongside Defra and the British Standards Institute BSI and a new standard PAS 2050 is due to be introduced in mid-2008. As of August 2009, Defra is undertaking a radical rethink of the food industry on issues of security and sustainability, among many things proposing a green labelling scheme for food products.Marketing Week - Defra proposes green food labelling scheme. The CarbonCounted label started in January 2007. It uses a live carbon supply chain to determine the amount of carbon dioxide emitted to bring a product to market. This third party certified system, based on an open standard, eliminates the need for heavy auditing and guess work associated with values determined when using isolated accounting methods. This also addresses how to consistently and fairly apply the smaller details such as the heating, cooling, lighting etc. in the shops the products are sold in. Another label initiative started in spring 2008 in Switzerland. The independent association climatop labels the most climate friendly products with their label «approved by climatop». In contrast to the label of Carbon Trust, this label does not indicate the carbon footprint of a specific product, it labels those products out of a comparable group of products with a remarkably lower carbon charge. As a rule of thumb, products have to be at least 20% better than other products from the same category. Therefore life cycle assessments or the products are calculated by independent offices, and the calculations are reviewed by a third party. Beside the fact that it has to be proven that those products have a lower climate charge, the products also have to fulfil several environmental and social standards. Examples of labeled products can be found at the Swiss retailer Migros, such as an organic fair trade sugar from Paraguay, recycling kitchen towels or laundry detergents. This approach has been shown to influence customer purchasing decisions. Japan announced a carbon footprint labelling scheme in 2008.Guardian - Japan to launch carbon footprint labelling scheme. The labels appeared on dozens of items including food and drink starting in April 2009,http://www.environmentalleader.com/2009/07/02/australia-joins-carbon- reduction-label-scheme/ providing detailed breakdowns of each product's carbon footprint under a government-approved calculation and labeling system. ==Proposed programs== California state representative Ira Ruskin sponsored a carbon labeling bill—the Carbon Labeling Act of 2009—in the California state legislature, which has been voted out of the Assembly Committee on Natural Resources. The act would require the State Air Resources Board to develop and implement a program for the voluntary assessment, verification, and standardized labeling of the carbon footprint of consumer products sold in the state. In July 2009, Walmart announced an environmental labeling program for its products.NYTimes - At Wal-Mart, Labels to Reflect Green Intent. The intent is to create over the next five years a universal rating system, that scores products based on how environmentally and socially sustainable they are over the course of their lives. Wal-Mart’s goal is to have other retailers eventually adopt the indexing system. In the United States, the Clean Energy Standard (CES) mandates that electric utilities generate a certain percentage of their power from clean energy sources.Caperton, R.

Multiple additions were constructed later in the century while it was the home of Olmstead Falls postmaster Arthur P. Gray. Beginning in the 1930s and continuing into the 1970s, the house was the property of a family named TeGrotenhuis, whose ancestors were part of an old New England family. Despite its early construction date, just six years after the arrival of the area's first settlers, the partially stone Adams House is built in the Italianate style, which is much more commonly found in buildings from the later part of the century. However, the stylistic elements, including components as large as the house's tower, were entirely absent from the original building; the Italianate portions of the house were all built as part of the expansion during Arthur Gray's time as owner.

The Williams-Wynn baronets had been begun in 1688 by the politician Sir William Williams, 1st Baronet, but had inherited, in the time of the 3rd baronet, Sir Watkin's father, the estates of the Wynn baronets, and changed their name to reflect this. ==Biography== Williams-Wynn was the eldest son of the second marriage of his father, Sir Watkin Williams-Wynn, 3rd Baronet, to Frances Shackerley of Cheshire. He was a baby when his father was killed by a fall from his horse while out hunting, and he inherited the extensive Wynnstay estates, the largest in North Wales. These straddled at least five Welsh counties and extended into Shropshire in England, and yielded an estimated rental income of £20,000 — a very substantial sum at the time, whose spending he tackled with enthusiasm and considerable success. On his coming of age in 1770, he held an extravagant party for 15,000 guests; the bills record consumption of \\"31 bullocks, 50 hogs, 50 calves, 80 sheep, 18,000 eggs....\\"Thomas An embroidered suit which he may have worn on this occasion is in the possession of the National Museum of Wales. 20 St James's Square The family had been powerful in politics for several generations, and Sir Watkin effectively controlled several Parliamentary seats and led a Tory faction in the House of Commons, though he was less involved in politics than his father, and tended not to lead his faction decisively. The influence of the family had declined during his long minority.Thomas Sir Watkin was Member of Parliament (MP) for Shropshire from 1772 to 1774, and for Denbighshire from 1774 until his death in 1789 aged 39. He was criticized for poor attendance. He was Lord Lieutenant of Merionethshire from 1775 to 1789.Thomas ==Family== He was married twice, first in April 1769 to Lady Henrietta Somerset, daughter of the Duke of Beaufort. As Wiliams-Wynn was a minor (under 21) he had to get Parliamentary permission by a special Act for the marriage settlement. Lady Henrietta died very shortly afterwards in July 1769. Secondly in December 1771 he married Lady Charlotte Grenville, daughter of a former Whig Prime Minister.Hughes He had three sons and two daughters from this second marriage, including Sir Watkin Williams-Wynn, 5th Baronet, and Charles Williams-Wynn. His daughter, Henrietta Elizabeth Williams-Wynn, married Thomas Cholmondeley, 1st Baron Delamere of Vale Royal (b. 9 Aug 1767, d. 30 Oct 1855).Cokayne, G.E.; Vicary Gibbs, H.A. Doubleday, Geoffrey H.

In Rome Pompeo Batoni painted him with some companions, and a classical subject, Bacchus and Ariadne was commissioned later, in 1774. The Rococo silver-gilt toilet service he gave to his first wife, by the London goldsmith Thomas Heming, is now in the National Museum of Wales. The Neoclassical grave monument for her is by Joseph Nollekens, in St Mary's Church, Ruabon, Clwyd.Hughes Sir Watkin played a significant role in the development of art in Wales, as an early patron of landscape painting there, which was to become the largest area of artistic activity in Wales. He brought both Richard Wilson and Paul Sandby to his seat at Wynnstay, Sandby staying six weeks in the summer of 1770, giving lessons to the family as well as painting, on his first visit to Wales. The next year Sandby returned and from 21 August to 4 September 1771 he and Sir Watkin toured through the mountains of northern Wales. From the sketches made on the tour Sandby published twelve aquatint Views in North Wales in 1776, and five of his Views in Wales of 1777. Matching sets from South Wales came from his tours there with Sir Joseph Banks, who commissioned the whole series. A more ambitious tour together, to Italy, was planned but cancelled after Sir Watkin's second marriage.Hughes Sir Watkin commissioned Robert Adam to build 20–21 St James's Square in London which was constructed between 1771 and 1775. Sir Joshua Reynolds received several commissions from Sir Watkin, some of which remain with the family. These include a portrait of him with his first wife in \\"Van Dyck\\" costume, and another of his second wife with her children, in around 1784, one with his mother (1768–69, National Gallery, London), one of Sir Watkin presiding over the Society of Dilettanti (1777, now on loan to Brooks' Club), and one of his eldest son as John the Baptist.Hughes He supported the Concerts of Antient Music, and is caricatured by James Gilray in a depiction of King George III of England attending one he organized. ==NotesReferences== *Hughes, Peter, \\"Williams-Wynn, Sir Watkin, 4th Baronet of Wynnstay.\\" Grove Art Online, Oxford Art Online, Oxford University Press, accessed June 13, 2015, subscription required *\\"Rhagor\\", \\"One of the wealthiest families of Wales\\", National Museum Wales *Thomas, Peter, D.G., Biography in History of Parliament Online, extracted from The History of Parliament: the House of Commons 1754–1790, ed.

It is endemic to Bolivia. Its natural habitats are subtropical or tropical moist montane forest, rivers, and freshwater marshes. It is threatened by habitat loss. While it is currently listed as vulnerable by the IUCN, this is based on an assessment that has not been updated since 2004. No individuals had been encountered in the wild between 2008 and 2019. Until 2019, there was just one captive individual called \\"Romeo\\" in Bolivia's Cochabamba Natural History Museum. There were fears that Romeo was the last of his kind, an endling. Romeo is 10 years old, and individuals of this species often do not live past age 15. Bolivian conservationists had long been looking for other Sehuencas water frog individuals, particularly females, in hopes of creating a captive breeding program. To raise awareness and money about the plight of the Sehuencas water frog, conservationists from Global Wildlife Conservation and the Bolivian Amphibian Initiative created a profile for Romeo on Match.com, an online dating website. In January 2019, an expedition to a Bolivian cloud forest led to the discovery of five more individuals: three males and two females. The re-discovered frogs will be treated against chytridiomycosis, a fungal disease causing widespread decline of amphibians. After treatment, Romeo will be introduced to a female called Juliet. Despite this, there are concerns that there are too few frogs left in the wild for a sustainable long-term population, and thus captive breeding is considered the best way to restore the species. == References External links== *Romeo's profile on a dating website yuracare Category:Amphibians of the Andes Category:Amphibians of Bolivia Category:Endemic fauna of Bolivia Category:Amphibians described in 1994 Category:Taxonomy articles created by Polbot ","title":"Sehuencas water frog"},{"id":"12391058","text":"The Adams–Gray House is a historic farmhouse in the community of Adams Mills, Ohio. Constructed in the 1840s in two separate counties, it has been named a historic site. ==History== Unusually, the Adams–Gray House sits on both sides of the line dividing Coshocton County to the north and Muskingum County to the south. At one time, the house's site was entirely within Muskingum County's Jefferson Township, but after Coshocton County was formed, its portion of the site became part of Virginia Township,Hill, N.N., ed. History of Coshocton County, Ohio: Its Past and Present, 1740. Newark: A.A.

Adams.Frary, I.T. Early Homes of Ohio. Richmond: Garrett and Massie, 1936. Although construction began in 1840, a date reflected in an inscription above the house's entrance, the house was not completed until 1841. Destruction by fire On February 19, 2019, a fire broke out in the kitchen of the house, though it was unoccupied. Local fire crews were able to control the fire and limit the damage, but the following morning, while Adams Mills was hit with heavy snow and ice, the fire started again and completely engulfed and destroyed the house.

Two and a half stories tall, the house is pierced by five openings on each story of the facade, with the portico-sheltered entrance replacing a window in the center of the first story, while the side features two windows in each story. To the rear, a smaller addition features dormer windows above its sole full story. The primary section of the house is covered by a gabled roof, with the gable featuring small windows and being defined by a broken pediment. As the house is set on land that rises slightly toward the rear, the entrance is placed several feet above the surrounding ground, so a set of steps provides access to the main entrance. A pair of square chimneys sits atop the peak of the roof., Ohio History Connection, 2015. Accessed 2016-01-02. The floor plan consists of rooms placed around a large hallway at the center of the house, reflecting the traditional architecture of Edward Adams' native Virginia, where such a hallway provided plenty of ventilation during the hot months of summer, as well as furnishing space for the elaborately decorated staircase. Adams included ornate cast iron in the fireplaces of two of the rooms, with reliefs of Ceres holding baskets of fruit and flowers being placed on both sides of each opening, while above each opening he placed a relief depicting a scene from Byron's Mazeppa in which wolves chase a wild horse to which the naked Ivan Mazepa is bound. These sculptures' origin is uncertain; they may well have been transported from an Eastern foundry with which he would have been familiar, or even imported from Europe, but Ohio metalworkers were already producing similar workmanship by this time. ==Historic site== In 1979, the Adams–Gray House was listed on the National Register of Historic Places, qualifying because of its historically significant architecture and because of its connection to Edward Adams. It is one of few National Register-listed sites located in multiple Ohio counties; except for a survey marker, the Seven Ranges Terminus, it is the only one that is not a historic district, a bridge, or some other linear site important for its role in transportation.

The intention was to profit from lending books to the public for a fee. Donald McDonald, stationer, and his Circulating Library, Gulgong, 1870 ==Overview== Circulating libraries offered an alternative to the large number of readers who could not afford the price of new books in the nineteenth century but also desired to quench their desire for new material. Many circulating libraries were perceived as the provider of sensational novels to a female clientele but that was not always the case. Many private circulating libraries in Europe were created for scientific and/or literary audiences. In Britain, readers in the middle classes depended on these institutions to provide access to the latest fiction novels that required a substantial subscription that many lower class readers couldn't afford. Circulating libraries were important cultural institutions in Britain and America during the nineteenth century, affording the rising middle class access to a broad range of reading material including poetry, plays, histories, biography, philosophy, travels, and especially fiction (now immensely popular). Circulating libraries were of three major types: specialist libraries; book clubs, which were flourishing; and commercial libraries, which developed to major cities and most notably offered a wide collection of novels. Although university and college libraries flourished, as did special libraries for governments, associations, and businesses, these were still not open to the general public.Stuart, Murray A.P. (2009) The Library: An Illustrated History. Chicago, IL. Skyhorse Publishing. (p.196) Circulating libraries rented out bestsellers in large numbers, allowing publishers and authors to increase their readership and increase their earnings, respectively. Publishers and circulating libraries became decreasingly dependent on each other in the nineteenth century for their mutual profit. Circulating libraries also influenced book publishers to keep producing expensive volume-based books instead of a single-volume format (see Three-volume novel). However, when bestselling fiction titles went out of fashion quickly, many circulating libraries were left with inventory they could neither sell nor rent out. This is one of the reasons why circulating libraries, such as Charles Edward Mudie, were eventually forced to close their doors in response to cheaper alternatives. It is complicated to precisely define circulating libraries and specifically what separates them from other types of libraries. In the time period of circulating libraries, there were other libraries, such as subscription libraries, that operated in a similar fashion but were not the same. However, when both types of libraries were commonplace, the terms circulating libraries and subscription libraries “were completely interchangeable.\\" It was logical that they were considered to be the same since both libraries circulated books and charged a subscription fee. The libraries differed in their intent. Circulating libraries’ intent was financial gain, and subscription libraries intended to obtain literary and scholarly works to share with others. No.82 Main Street, Gloucester, Massachusetts Circulating libraries were popular in the 18th and 19th century and were located in large and small communities. Usually they were operated out of stores that sold other items such as newspapers and books. Sometimes they were in stores that sold items completely unrelated to books. The fees were for long periods of time such ranging from several months to a year. Eventually the fees changed to daily rates to try to entice customers in some libraries. One difference between circulating libraries and other libraries was that their collection reflected public demand, which led to larger collections of fiction. When circulation decreased, the books were sold. Another difference was the customers were often female. These factors contributed to the popularity of circulating libraries. Circulating libraries were the first to serve women and actively seek out their patronage. It was not coincidence that some of these libraries were located in millinery and stationery stores and midwives' offices.Freeman, Robert & Hovde, David. (2003). Libraries to the People: Histories of Outreach. Jefferson, NC: McFarland and Company. P. 13. Early circulating libraries *1725, Allan Ramsay opened the first circulating library in Edinburgh, Scotland. *1728, The first circulating library in England was opened by James Leake. *1745, year of dissolution of a circulating library operated by Samuel Fancourt *1762, The first circulating library in America was opened in Annapolis, Maryland by William Rind. ==Criticism of circulating libraries and novels== The late 18th century was when novels became commonplace. The demand for novels was high but the cost of them made them inaccessible for many. They held wide appeal because they were less complex than more scholarly types of literature. However novels were not greeted with an overwhelmingly popular reception. Aspects of novels were realistic, which made them appealing and relatable. The elements of novels that made them sensational and alluring were the parts that deviated from what would usually happen in reality. Society feared that people, mainly women, would not be able to differentiate between the realistic and completely fictional elements. Basically the argument against novels was that it would cause people to have unrealistic expectations of life. Circulating libraries were highly criticized at the height of their popularity for being providers of novels. The views about novels and their readers, sellers, and writers went beyond simple criticism to being slanderous. Much of the information known about criticism of novels comes from a variety of public and privately written sources. ==Publishing== Some circulating libraries were publishers although many did not have widespread distribution for the works they printed. By the end of the 18th century, they had increased the amount of fiction they published. They favored publishing works from women whereas other publishers still favored works by men. It was common for people to publish their works anonymously. Circulating library publishers were known for publishing anonymous works, and it is believed that many of the ones they published were written by women. Circulating library publishers were not viewed as favorably as other major publishers since they printed works that were considered unsavory by society. People may have wanted their works to be anonymous to avoid the stigma of being associated with a publisher with a dubious reputation. ==Decline== By the beginning of the 20th century the ways people procured books had changed, and circulating libraries were no longer the favored way of obtaining them. The biggest contributor to the contraction of circulating libraries was reduced the price of books, which made them more accessible to the public, so that they were less reliant on circulating libraries. In an attempt to compensate for the loss of revenue, the subscription fees were lessened to daily rates down from monthly or yearly ones. Commercial circulating libraries were still common into the 20th century, although as modern public libraries became commonplace, this contributed to their decline. Another contributing factor was the introduction of paperback books, which were less expensive to purchase. In the UK, the retail chain WHSmith ran a library scheme from 1860, which lasted until 1961, when the library was taken over by that of Boots the Chemist.

They are endemic to eastern and southeastern Brazil. They are sometimes known as river frogs. ==Description, ecology, and behavior== Thoropa are associated with rocks and have cryptic coloration. Their size ranges from small to medium, in snout–vent length. They occur at elevations up to above sea level; Thoropa miliaris and Thoropa taophora can even live on rocky marine shores, foraging in the intertidal zone. Male Thoropa are associated with wet rock faces, whereas the females seem to range more widely. In species where reproduction is known, males are territorial—suitable wet rock faces are a scarce resource. Furthermore, mature male Thoropa feature characteristic clusters of dark spines on the inner portions of the hand. It appears that these are associated with male-male combat, probably in conjunction with territorial disputes. Scratch marks in males, but not in females, support this interpretation. The eggs are laid on rocks with a thin layer of water. Tadpoles are semiterrestrial and have a depressed shape, long tail, and bulging eyes. Male T. taophora frogs mate exclusively and repeatedly with two females per season in a polygynous system in which the semiterrestrial tadpoles from both females share the same freshwater seep. The females have a dominance hierarchy, and the males mate more with the dominant female. ==Species== The genus contains the following species: * Thoropa lutzi Cochran, 1938 * Thoropa megatympanum Caramaschi and Sazima, 1984 * Thoropa miliaris (Spix, 1824) * Thoropa petropolitana (Wandolleck, 1907) * Thoropa saxatilis Cocroft and Heyer, 1988 * Thoropa taophora (Miranda-Ribeiro, 1923) ==References== Category:Cycloramphidae Category:Amphibian genera Category:Frogs of South America Category:Endemic fauna of Brazil Category:Taxa named by Edward Drinker Cope Category:Taxonomy articles created by Polbot ","title":"Thoropa"},{"id":"12391083","text":"Adelbert Hall is an administration building at Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland, Ohio and a registered historic building, listed in the National Register on 1973-10-30. == Construction == It was built in 1881 to serve as the home of Western Reserve College and named after Adelbert Stone, the son of industrialist Amasa Stone.

It is endemic to southern Brazil and occurs in the Santa Catarina and Rio Grande do Sul states, corresponding to the southernmost extent of the Atlantic Forest biome. The specific name ' refers to its association with rocks. Common name Brazilian river frog has been coined for it. ==Description== Adult males measure in snout–vent length. The snout is rounded. The tympanum is distinct and relatively large (about as large as the eye ); the prominent supratympanic fold partly hides the tympanum dorsally. Finger tips have prominent discs; those of the toes are less prominent. The thumbs have a dark cluster of spines, and fingers have II–III rows of spines. Both fingers and toes have lateral ridges but no webbing. Preserved specimens are mottled with dark and light brown or grey. The upper surfaces of the limbs are barred. The venter is cream with some brown wash. No vocal sac is present. The tadpoles are elongated and have a depressed body and a low tail fin with rounded tip. The largest tadpoles (Gosner stage 39) measure in total length. The body makes about third (29–33%) of the total length. ==Habitat and conservation== Thoropa saxatilis occurs on rocky cliffs in forested areas at elevations of above sea level. The holotype was collected on a rock near a small waterfall. Other adult males have been collected along road cuts where water was trickling over steep rock faces; tadpoles were collected from the same habitat. The eggs are laid under waterfalls on rocks. It is a rarely collected species, and it appears to have disappeared from some localities. It can be threatened by habitat loss and modification (alteration of water causes, sedimentation, forest loss), but it has also vanished from some areas of apparently suitable habitat.

The theatre is operated by the Palace Performing Arts Center, Inc - a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization. Established in 1984 and incorporated as a not-for-profit corporation in 1989, the Palace Performing Arts Center, Inc. was created to operate the theatre and utilize its full potential as a cultural and entertainment center in Albany. It continues its tradition of hosting the finest in live entertainment with over 150 events annually, from public performances such as concerts, world-class ballet and dance, Broadway, educational programs, live comedy and classic movies to private events such as weddings, dance competitions, corporate events, and graduations. Home to the Grammy Award-winning Albany Symphony Orchestra, artists as diverse as the Rolling Stones, Jerry Seinfeld, Bruce Springsteen, Roy Orbison, Tony Bennett, and Melissa Etheridge have graced the Palace stage over the years. Designed by John Eberson, one of the world's foremost theatre architect of the time and well noted for his atmospheric theatre designs. The Radio Keith Orpheum (RKO) owned facility spared no expense in its design and boasted an ornate Austrian Baroque design with \\"atmospheric\\" elements in the auditorium. Though many changes have taken place since its opening, the Palace has retained most of its original design features, including an impressive brass chandelier in the main lobby, original murals painted by Hungarian artists Andrew Karoly and Louis Szanto and plaster beams in the fore-lobby painted to resemble carved wood. In 1979 it was listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Nine years later it was declared a contributing property to the Clinton Avenue Historic District. ==History== 75th anniversary logo The Palace Theatre was originally built as an RKO movie palace. Construction took place from June 1930 to October 1931, when it opened it was Albany's largest movie theatre.The Palace Theatre In 1940, The Palace was sold to FAST Theatres, part of Fabian Enterprises, when RKO exited the theatre business due to antitrust concerns. The theatre underwent a $250,000 renovation in 1960, seating capacity was reduced to allow for more comfortable seating. The Palace closed in September 1969, as it had become unprofitable. Soon after its closure, the building was purchased by the City of Albany for $90,000 and reopened. During the first few years of the city's ownership, a new boiler and roof were installed, the limit of its renovations for decades. It was added to the National Register of Historic Places on October 4, 1979. In 2002, an extensive restoration project began at a cost of $3 million. Completed in January 2003 the project restored the look and feel of the interior of the theatre closer to its original historic design and included the addition of a new LED marquee, replicating the original 1931 design. Work was carried out by Conrad Schmitt Studios of New Berlin, WI. The local firm of Einhorn Yaffee Prescott were the architects for the project. ==Building== Interior during a sold out performance. The theatre is on a small lot at the northwest corner of the intersection, just north of downtown. It is a brick and stone steel frame building in two sections. The front two stories, facing the corner and including the marquee with a modern scrolling LED display, are faced in tan brick with some stone ornamentation. The windows have carved brackets. There are open pediments with cartouches and brick parapets with molded stone coping. The taller auditorium, to the northwest, features a banded chimney and decorative brickwork facing the south. The east elevation, along Pearl, has circular arcading and banded pilasters. The interior is designed and decorated in the Austrian Baroque style. The foyer, between the lobby and main entrance, has red marble staircases decorated in scrollwork, cartouches, and garlands. The wrought iron railing is foliated. Murals by two Hungarian artists decorate the walls. The balcony level extends over two-thirds of the sloping main floor. The heavily decorated ceilings and walls include pilasters rising to complex entablatures, statuary, and arches framing the wall boxes. A Czech made crystal chandelier hangs from the ceiling. The orchestra pit can be raised and lowered by an elevator. ==See also== *Albany Symphony Orchestra *David Alan Miller ==External links== *Palace Theatre at albany.org ==References== Category:Buildings and structures in Albany, New York Category:Theatres on the National Register of Historic Places in New York (state) Category:Movie palaces Category:Theatres completed in 1931 Category:U.S. Route 9 Category:Culture of Albany, New York Category:Tourist attractions in Albany, New York Category:National Register of Historic Places in Albany, New York Category:Companies based in Albany, New York Category:1931 establishments in New York (state) Category:Theatres in New York (state) Category:Entertainment venues in New York (state) Category:Music venues in New York (state) ","title":"Palace Theatre (Albany, New York)"},{"id":"12391132","text":"Zachaenus parvulus (common names: Girard's frog, Rio bug-eyed frog) is a species of frog in the family Cycloramphidae.

Formed by a colony of more than 300 freedmen from Virginia, who were freed in the will of John Randolph of Roanoke, it has been the resting place for many. Active into the 20th century, it is one of the last extant physical remnants of Rossville, a black settlement founded near the city of Piqua in the late 1840s. The cemetery is listed on the National Register of Historic Places because of its connection to the history of free people of color in pre-Civil War Ohio. ==History== Beginning in the 1820s, Virginia planter John Randolph of Roanoke, a US Congressman, wrote a succession of wills in which he planned for the manumission of his more than 600 slaves, together with providing money to relocate the freedmen to the free state of Ohio and buy land for them. He contradicted himself in various documents and failed to provide clear direction regarding which will was to be followed. Following his death in 1833, lawsuits were quickly filed to challenge probate of his estate, and twelve years passed before the litigation was finished and his 600 slaves' futures were resolved. As ultimately resolved by the courts, his will provided for his slaves' emancipation and transportation to a free state, and western Ohio was chosen as their destination.Owen, Lorrie K., ed. Dictionary of Ohio Historic Places. Vol. 2. St. Clair Shores: Somerset, 1999. Money from Randolph's estate was used to buy in Mercer County, but the area was home to the freedmen for only a short while. They left due to hostility and discrimination by the whites living in the region. Some 383 freedmen migrated southward to Miami and Shelby counties.Randolph Settlement/Jackson Cemetery (African) , Ohio Historical Society, 2008. Accessed 2013-12-20. They developed the Randolph Slave Settlement, located just north of Piqua at Rossville, as one of many rural black settlements in pre-Civil War Ohio. Churches had been established in Rossville as early as 1815, but the new settlers ultimately founded their own church in 1864, a Baptist congregation.The History of Miami County, Ohio. Chicago: Beers, 1880, 397. Within the following decade, they established their own cemetery (1866) and school (1872). In contrast to the white Baptist cemetery, which was abandoned and thoroughly derelict by 1880, their African Jackson Cemetery was active well into the twentieth century.Rayner, John A. The First Century of Piqua, Ohio. Piqua: Magee Brothers, 1916, 192. By the early 1980s, comparatively little remained of the black settlement at Rossville; it had been absorbed by Piqua. The nearby York Rial House has been documented as the home of a prominent member of this black community. The cemetery is the chief surviving physical remainder of the community. For this reason, it was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1982, and the York Rial House was added in 1986. ==References== Category:African- American cemeteries Category:African-American history of Ohio Category:Cemeteries on the National Register of Historic Places in Ohio Category:Geography of Miami County, Ohio Category:National Register of Historic Places in Miami County, Ohio ","title":"African Jackson Cemetery"},{"id":"12391189","text":"Higher state of consciousness may refer to: *Higher consciousness *Higher State of Consciousness (song), a song by American electronic artist Josh Wink ","title":"Higher state of consciousness"},{"id":"12391192","text":"Aye, and Gomorrah, and other stories is a collection of stories by American writer Samuel R. Delany, published by Vintage Books in 2003. It is a thematically arranged collection, in the style of James Joyce’s Dubliners (1914), Sherwood Anderson’s Winesburg, Ohio (1919), and Willa Cather’s Youth and the Bright Medusa (1920). The book is closely based on an earlier collection, Driftglass, which first appeared in 1971. The dedication to the two books is similar: one is simply an updated version of the other, dedicating the book to Delany’s immediate family: his maternal grandmother, mother, sister, and father. Both carry identical epigraphs. The ten tales contained in Driftglass are all contained in Aye, and Gomorrah, along with five other stories (\\"Omegahelm\\", \\"Among the Blobs\\", \\"Tapestry\\", \\"Prismatica\\", \\"Ruins\\"). The stories consist of ten science fiction tales, in the order the writer wrote them, followed by five fantasies, also in chronological order. When the first collection was put together, Delany and his editor gave serious thought to calling it Aye, and Gomorrah, instead of Driftglass. The title story had won Delany his third Nebula Award — this one for best short story of 1967, so that using it to entitle his first collection would have seemed a reasonable choice. But New American Library, the initial contractors for the book (who had licensed it to the Science Fiction Book Club for a hardcover edition that would appear four months before their Signet paperback), decided they did not want a title that pushed any of the homosexual implications in the stories. Note, nevertheless, that even Driftglass, with its suggestion of wandering, continues the theme of homelessness that the current title and the epigraph suggest. Thus, it is probably not wrong to read Aye, and Gomorrah, and other stories as an ideal version of the older Driftglass. The unifying thematic, suggested by the epigraph, is that it is a book in which the science fiction stories are largely about the problems of people who do not live in the city of their birth—who have all come to where they are from somewhere else. The epigraph — on the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah, from a speaker who clearly has great feeling for the destroyed cities — suggests that his home city has been devastated. In some of the tales, such as the opening story in both books, “The Star-Pit,” the narrator’s family and children have been destroyed in a horrific war many years before and many light years away: a war of a sort, which, in the future the story depicts, has become so common that it would seem to be a background reality gotten through for better or for worse by pretty much everyone who currently survives. And the fantasies, such as “Prismatica,” “Dog in a Fisherman’s Net,” and “Ruins” all deal with the possibilities or the wages of journeying from one's home. Only three Delany SF stories are not included in Aye, and Gomorrah. All three are slight enough so that one can understand why Delany might not wish to preserve them: two are collaborations, one with Harlan Ellison (“The Power of the Nail,” contained in Ellison’s collection of collaborations Partners in Wonder); the other is a page-long prose poem, “The Dying Castles,” which appeared in a 1968 issue of the British SF magazine New Worlds (#200), as under the joint authorship of James Sallis, Samuel R. Delany, and Michael Moorcock. (Several times Delany has said that he has no memory of having written any part of it; and he has assumed the use of his name among the authors was a jape.) The third is a piece only slightly longer called “The Desert of Time,” which was commissioned by Omni Magazine to accompany an illustration in the late 1980s. But other than the stories that comprise his four-volume Return to Nevèrÿon series, it is fair to say that Aye and Gomorrah represents the totality of Delany’s SF and fantasy short fiction. ==Contents== * \\"The Star Pit\\" * \\"Corona\\" * \\"Aye, and Gomorrah…\\" * \\"Driftglass\\" * \\"We, in Some Strange Power’s Employ, Move on a Rigorous Line\\" (this story is written in the style of and as a homage to Roger Zelazny, who also appears in it as a character) * \\"Cage of Brass\\" * \\"High Weir\\" * \\"Time Considered as a Helix of Semi-Precious Stones\\" * \\"Omegahelm\\" * \\"Among the Blobs\\" * \\"Tapestry\\" * \\"Prismatica\\" * \\"Ruins\\" * \\"Dog in a Fisherman’s Net\\" * \\"Night and the Loves of Joe Dicostanzo\\" * Afterword: Of Doubts and Dreams ==References== * ==External links== *Errata page for Aye, and Gomorrah, approved by the author Category:2003 short story collections Category:Fantasy short story collections Category:Science fiction short story collections Category:Short story collections by Samuel Delany ","title":"Aye, and Gomorrah, and other stories"},{"id":"12391195","text":"Zachary Jason Boyer (born October 25, 1971) is a former National Hockey League right winger.

He is the son of former world champion Wilfredo Vázquez. ==Professional career== Vázquez Jr. debuted as a professional in an event that took place on December 18, 2006 in Kissimmee, Florida. In this event he fought against Octavius Davis who was also debuting as a professional, Vázquez won the fight by knockout in the first round. His second professional fight was on February 2, 2007, against Daniel Lornezano in a boxing card presented in Miami, Florida. Vázquez won three more fights by knockout over the course of the first half of 2007, against Danny Esquivel, Cature Hicks Juan Camacho and Jaime Villa, on cards that took place in Kissimmee and Miami. Vázquez participated in his first fight outside Florida on August 25, 2007, in a card that took place in Bayamón, Puerto Rico. In this event, he defeated Anthony Chacon via knockout on the first round. On September 14, 2007 Wilfredo participated in a fight scheduled for six rounds for the first time in his career, he won the fight by technical knockout in the third round. On December 15, 2007, Vázquez fought Jorge Cardenas in Cancún, Mexico. The judges scored the fight as a draw, marking the first instance that he did not win in his professional career. His return to the ring was on March 28, 2008, when he fought against Corey Goodwin, winning the contest by knockout in the third round. Two months later, he defeated Moises Carrasquillo by knockout. On July 26, 2008, Vázquez defeated Felipe Almanza by disqualification. The result was determined after Almanza tried to kick Vázquez after the fourth round had concluded. His first title opportunity took place on September 12, 2008, when he fought Adolfo Landeros for the vacant WBO Latino Super Bantamweight Championship. Vázquez won the regional championship by technical knockout in the eighth round. He returned to action on November 21, 2008, being paired against Victor Martínez in a fight for his championship and the vacant WBA Fedecentro title. Vázquez opened the fight in a slow pace, utilizing the first round as a stage to study his opponent. After the second round, Vázquez began executing the offensive more fluidly, using jabs and counterattacks to his advantage. During the second half, he continued pressuring the offensive, scoring solid combinations in the seventh stanza. Martínez improved in the ninth and tenth round, being more effective on his attack. In the following stage, Vázquez regained control of the offensive’s tempo, scoring a knockdown. This pace continued in the final round, with Martínez receiving combinations. Following one of these attacks, Vázquez connected a left hook that made Martínez fell to the canvas, unable to continue before the referee counted ten, leading to a knockout. On March 13, 2009, Vázquez returned to action, defending the WBA Fedecentro Championship against José Ángel Beranza. Early in the fight, both pugilists exchanged punches, before Vázquez was able to employ a calm pace which favored him. Early in the third round, Beranza displayed a better offensive, but lost control of the fight’s tempo later in that round. Vázquez began the fourth round on the offensive, with this pace continuing throughout the chapter. After receiving a warning for \\"roughhousing\\" in the fifth, Beranza was unable to respond effectively during the sixth and seventh. Using this to his advantage, Vázquez pressured the offensive and established control of the fight’s tempo. Beranza was eventually deducted a point for using illegal tactics. After the twelfth round, the fight's outcome was decided by the judges, who gave scores of 118-109, 119-108 and 120-106 in favor of Vázquez. On July 17, 2009, he fought Cecilio Santos, winning by knockout in the second round. On November 20, 2009, Vázquez defended the regional title against Genaro García in a world championship eliminatory. He dominated the early stages by using jabs and moving, but García was able to pressure the fight as the rounds advanced. In the seventh round, both pugilists exchanged combinations, but Vazquez was able to score a knockdown and continued on the offensive. Consequently, the referee stopped the fight by technical knockout. WBO super bantamweight champion and establishing world records Vázquez's first world championship fight was scheduled for February 27, 2010, in Bayamón's Rubén Rodríguez Coliseum. His opponent was former WBO Super Flyweight titlist, Marvin Sonsona, with the WBO Super Bantamweight World Championship left vacant by Juan Manuel López being in play. The card was named Haciendo Historia (lit. \\"Making History\\") because Vázquez had an opportunity to establish several records, while Sonsona could become the youngest two-division champion in history. The first round was slow, with both boxers using it to study their opponent's tactic, Sonsona was slightly aggressive, winning the round. In the following chapter, Sonsona used straight left punches, while Vázquez injured him with a series of right punches. This pattern continued in the third, when he pinned Sonsona to the ropes and focused his offensive to the body, also bruising his opponent's left cheek. Despite being on the defensive, Sonsona was able to counter with an uppercut once. The fourth round began with Vázquez pressuring the offensive, while his opponent kept his back to the ropes intending to counter. However, Sonsona was unable to successfully connect, while throwing uppercuts. Vázquez continued on the offensive, connecting a combination to the head and liver that injured his opponent, who was unable to recover before the referee's protective count concluded. With this knockout victory, he established several boxing records, such as becoming the first fighter to win a world title without participating in a single amateur contest. The pugilist joined his father as the third father-and-son combination to win world championships, the first to do so in the same division and the first son trained by a tri-champion father to win a title. Incidentally, he also became the first boxer to win a world title, while being promoted by the son of the man that promoted his father's successful championship contests. Vázquez's first title defense was against mandatory challenger, Zsolt Bedák. Both boxers exchanged punch combinations throughout the first six rounds. By the seventh, Bedák began showing signs of exhaustion, which tilted the fight against him. Consequently, Vázquez gained complete control of offensive, eventually scoring a knockdown in the tenth round. Bedák was able to recover before the referee's protective count concluded, but his corner submitted the fight afterwards. ==Personal life== Vázquez is married to Jacqueline Román, with whom he has two children,Lya M. Vázquez Román and Liaris C. Vázquez Román Initially, he began studies in law, but abandoned them in favor of boxing. Although his father, Wilfredo Vázquez, held world titles in three different divisions, he had not been interested in pursuing a professional career until this point, only entering the sport to provide income for his family. Consequently, he began training under his father when he was 21 years old, learning the basics without any amateur experience. During this timeframe, he experienced complications that made him consider leaving the sport and pursuing employment in other fields. ==Professional boxing record== { center; font-size:95%\\" - ! !Result !Record !Opponent !Type !Round, time !Date !Location !Notes - 33 Win 25–7–1 left;\\" Cristian Mijares KO 3 (10) Jun 16, 2018 left;\\"  - 32 Loss 24–7–1 left;\\" Juan Manuel López TKO 11 (12), Oct 29, 2016 left;\\"  - 31 Loss 24–6–1 style=\\"text- align:left;\\" Rafael Rivera SD 10 Dec 5, 2015 left;\\" left;\\" - 30 Loss 24–5–1 left;\\" Fernando Vargas UD 8 Jun 6, 2015 left;\\"  - 29 Win 24–4–1 left;\\" Jonathan Arrellano MD 8 Nov 1, 2014 left;\\" left;\\" - 28 Loss 23–4–1 left;\\" Marvin Sonsona SD 10 Jun 7, 2014 style=\\"text- align:left;\\" left;\\" - 27 Win 23–3–1 style=\\"text- align:left;\\" Guillermo Avila UD 12 Sep 20, 2013 left;\\" left;\\" - 26 Loss 22–3–1 left;\\" Yasutaka Ishimoto  10 Apr 6, 2013 left;\\" style=\\"text- align:left;\\" - 25 Win 22–2–1 left;\\" Jonathan Oquendo TKO 7 (12), Oct 6, 2012 left;\\" style=\\"text- align:left;\\" - 24 Loss 21–2–1 left;\\" Nonito Donaire  12 Feb 4, 2012 left;\\" left;\\" - 23 Win 21–1–1 left;\\" Roberto Carlos Leyva KO 3 (10), Oct 29, 2011 left;\\"  - 22 Loss 20–1–1 style=\\"text- align:left;\\" Jorge Arce TKO 12 (12), May 7, 2011 style=\\"text- align:left;\\" left;\\" - 21 Win 20–0–1 style=\\"text- align:left;\\" Iván Hernández TKO 11 (12), Oct 16, 2010 style=\\"text- align:left;\\" left;\\" - 20 Win 19–0–1 style=\\"text- align:left;\\" Zsolt Bedák TKO 10 (12), May 29, 2010 style=\\"text- align:left;\\" left;\\" - 19 Win 18–0–1 style=\\"text- align:left;\\" Marvin Sonsona KO 4 (12), Feb 27, 2010 style=\\"text- align:left;\\" left;\\" - 18 Win 17–0–1 style=\\"text- align:left;\\" Genaro García TKO 7 (12), Nov 20, 2009 style=\\"text- align:left;\\" left;\\" - 17 Win 16–0–1 style=\\"text- align:left;\\" Cecilio Santos KO 2 (12), Jul 17, 2009 style=\\"text- align:left;\\" left;\\" - 16 Win 15–0–1 style=\\"text- align:left;\\" Jose Angel Beranza UD 12 Mar 13, 2009 style=\\"text- align:left;\\" left;\\" - 15 Win 14–0–1 style=\\"text- align:left;\\" Victor Martinez KO 12 (12), Nov 21, 2008 style=\\"text- align:left;\\"  - 14 Win 13–0–1 left;\\" Adolfo Landeros TKO 8 (12), Sep 12, 2008 left;\\" style=\\"text- align:left;\\" - 13 Win 12–0–1 left;\\" Felipe Almanza  4 (6), Jul 25, 2008 left;\\" left;\\" - 12 Win 11–0–1 left;\\" Moises Carrasquillo KO 2 (4), May 16, 2008 left;\\"  - 11 Win 10–0–1 style=\\"text- align:left;\\" Corey Goodwin KO 3 (6), Mar 28, 2008 style=\\"text- align:left;\\"  - 10 style=\\"background: #B0C4DE\\"Draw 9–0–1 style=\\"text- align:left;\\" Jorge Cardenas  8 Dec 15, 2007 left;\\"  - 9 Win 9–0 left;\\" Corey Goodwin TKO 2 (6), Nov 16, 2007 left;\\"  - 8 Win 8–0 left;\\" Benjamin Orozco TKO 3 (6), Sep 14, 2007 left;\\"  - 7 Win 7–0 left;\\" Anthony Chacon KO 1 (4), Aug 25, 2007 left;\\"  - 6 Win 6–0 left;\\" Jaime Villa KO 3 (4), Jul 20, 2007 left;\\"  - 5 Win 5–0 left;\\" Cature Hicks TKO 1 (4), Jun 1, 2007 left;\\"  - 4 Win 4–0 left;\\" Juan Camacho TKO 1 (4), Apr 20, 2007 left;\\"  - 3 Win 3–0 left;\\" Danny Esquivel  3 (4), Mar 23, 2007 left;\\"  - 2 Win 2–0 left;\\" Daniel Lorenzana  4 Feb 23, 2007 left;\\"  - 1 Win 1–0 left;\\" Octavius Davis  1 (4) Dec 8, 2006 style=\\"text- align:left;\\"  } ==See also== *List of Puerto Rican boxing world champions *List of boxing families#Puerto Rico ==ReferencesExternal links== * Category:1984 births Category:Living people Category:World Boxing Organization champions Category:People from Bayamón, Puerto Rico Category:Puerto Rican male boxers Category:Featherweight boxers Category:World super-bantamweight boxing champions ","title":"Wilfredo Vázquez Jr."},{"id":"12391238","text":"FSV 1913 Ludwigshafen-Oggersheim is a German association football club based in the Oggersheim district of Ludwigshafen, Rhineland-Palatinate. The club advanced to the Regionalliga Süd (III) following an Oberliga (IV) title win in 2007, but found itself overmatched at that level of competition. After struggling through two poor seasons and in increasing financial difficulty, they withdrew to 11th tier local level play in 2010–11. ==History== The club was established in 1913 as VfR 1913 Oggersheim and in 1937 merged with SC Eintracht Oggersheim, which had been formed in 1924 as the football department of the gymnastics club Vereinigten Turnerschaft Oggersheim, to create SpVgg Oggersheim. The following year, all of the area clubs were reorganized into a single association known as Gemeinschaft für Leibesübungen Oggersheim. In the aftermath of World War II, occupying Allied authorities ordered the dissolution of all organizations in the country, including sports and football clubs, as part of the process of denazification. A new association was formed as ASV Oggersheim in 1945 and its football department became independent in 1949 as Fussball Sportverein Oggersheim. The footballers played as a lower tier lower side until winning their way to the third tier Amateurliga Südwest for a single season in 1963–64. FSV made a DFB-Pokal (German Cup) appearance in 1978, going out in the first round 0:3 to 1. FC Kaiserslautern in the opening round. A 1992 Landesliga Ost (VI) title led to promotion to the Verbandsliga Südwest (V), where the club remained for five seasons before being relegated again. In 2004, FSV returned to the Verbandsliga, followed by a further promotion two years later to the Oberliga Südwest (IV). After only two seasons in this league, the club won promotion to the Regionalliga Süd (III) in 2007. They finished in last place in 2007–08, but avoided being sent down when the league was restructured, instead becoming part of the Regionalliga West (III) in 2008–09. Despite an improved performance and a 12th-place result, the club decided to withdraw from the league. After struggling financially, FSV made a fresh start in the 11th tier 1. Kreisklasse Rheinpfalz Süd in 2010–11 and earned a second-place result there in 2011–12. In 2013 this league was renamed B-Klasse Rhein-Pfalz Süd. ==Honours== The club's honours: * Oberliga Südwest (IV) ** Champions: 2007 * Verbandsliga Südwest (V) ** Champions: 2005 ==Recent seasons== The recent season-by-season performance of the club:Das deutsche Fußball-Archiv Historical German domestic league tablesFussball.de – Ergebnisse Tables and results of all German football leagues {  - align=\\"center\\" bgcolor=\\"#dfdfdf\\"  Season  Division  Tier  Position - align=\\"center\\"  2003–04  align=\\"left\\" Landesliga Südwest-Ost  VI  ddffdd\\" 2nd ↑ - align=\\"center\\"  2004–05  align=\\"left\\" Verbandsliga Südwest  V  ddffdd\\" 1st ↑ - align=\\"center\\"  2005–06  align=\\"left\\" Oberliga Südwest  rowspan=2 IV  6th - align=\\"center\\"  2006–07  align=\\"left\\" Oberliga Südwest  ddffdd\\" 1st ↑ - align=\\"center\\"  2007–08  align=\\"left\\" Regionalliga Süd  III  18th - align=\\"center\\"  2008–09  align=\\"left\\" Regionalliga West  IV  ffcccc\\" 12th ↓ - align=\\"center\\"  2009–10  align=\\"left\\" Verbandsliga Südwest  VI  ffcccc\\" withdrawn - align=\\"center\\"  2010–11  align=\\"left\\" 1.

Built in 1929 and expanded in 1951 it was a Jewish Community Center and headquarters for the organization with the same name for over 45 years. ==Description== The address of the center is 220 S. Balch Street. Designed by architectural firm Fichter & Brooker in a free Romanesque style the details display Byzantine influences. Built in 1929 the two and a half story masonry building is constructed of red brick in American bond pattern. Exterior trim is faux granite terra-cotta, with the raised basement demarcated by a prominent terra-cotta water table. The main entrance is raised six steps above ground level. Exterior walls rise to a parapet with a frieze that creates the effect of corbelling and a low profile ornamented cornice. The parapet conceals a flat roof. On the long side of this basically rectangular structure the grandly ornamented main entrance is set off center. An archway featuring multiple archivolts resting on a boss that is a stylized (see Torah) figure in turn resting on lions (see Lion of Judah). The entire arch is supported by multiple engaged columns in groups set at 90 degrees from each other. Four multiple light doors with the center two paired are topped by wide cross beam bearing the words, \\"Akron Jewish Center\\" supporting a fully glazed tympanum. A smaller doorway on the left leading directly to the athletic facilities has a deep transom and ornamented lintel. Further to the left is a large addition constructed in 1951. This addition was designed by Michael M. Konarski in a congruent Art Deco style with interpretations of Byzantine influences evident in the terra-cotta detailing. Matching brick was used for this addition. A notable feature of the interior is a multipurpose auditorium with balconies and a full proscenium stage. The seating capacity in stage configuration is 1,000. Extensive athletic facilities with equipment and a wide variety of recreational and social purposed rooms are complemented by office and civic spaces. The low profile building fits quietly in a neighborhood that remains residential. ==Jewish Community Center== The Akron Jewish Center is also the name of the organization for whom this building was headquarters for over forty-five years. The charter to establish the Akron Jewish Center was secured by a group of prominent local Jewish men who organized for that purpose in 1924. As a Jewish Community Center the organization and the facility served a deep variety of religious and secular purposes. A Synagogue and all associated functions were just the beginning of the activities of the center. The health of the community was advanced physically, socially, intellectually, spiritually and in civic discourse. The organization was very active in the community at large as well as within the Jewish community of Akron. In addition to the full complement of religious and Jewish cultural programming, concerts, theatrical performances and a civic speaker series aimed at the wider community were put on by the center. The theatrical performances and concerts were popular and the speaker series Akron Civic Forum had developed into a television and radio program in 1986. Notable guests of the speaker series included Franklin Delano Roosevelt Jr., Eleanor Roosevelt, Robert A. Taft, Edward R. Murrow and Drew Pearson. The program America's Town Meeting of the Air broadcast from the center twice. The property is composed of several lots including one that had been a meeting place for a local Jewish congregation. The cornerstone was laid on November 4, 1928 and the building was dedicated and opened on September 22, 1929. The building's architects were J. Adam Fitcher and Harry A. Brooker namesakes of a firm that left a notable imprint on Akron across two decades. ==Modern times== The Akron Jewish Center organization moved out of the building in 1973, selling it to Shadyside Baptist Church which occupied it until 1985. there were plans to renovate the building and open it as an athletic club. The property was listed in the United States National Register of Historic Places on July 24, 1986. ==See also== * History of the Jews in Ohio * National Register of Historic Places listings in Akron, Ohio == References External links== * * * Category:Properties of religious function on the National Register of Historic Places in Ohio Category:Buildings and structures in Akron, Ohio Category:Jews and Judaism in Ohio Category:National Register of Historic Places in Summit County, Ohio ","title":"Akron Jewish Center"},{"id":"12391260","text":"Akron Post Office and Federal Building is a historic former post office building in Akron, Ohio.

He was educated at Westminster School and Christ Church, Oxford. He succeeded his father in the baronetcy on 29 July 1789. He received Hon. D.C.L. at Oxford in 1793 and was Lord Lieutenant of Merionethshire from 1793 to 1840 and Lord Lieutenant of Denbighshire from 1796 to 1840. In 1819 Williams-Wynn was admitted to Magdalene College, Cambridge and was awarded MA. He declined several offers of a peerage. History of Parliament Online article by R.G. Thorne (volume 1790-1820).

He held the seat until his death in 1840. He served as Mayor of Oswestry in 1800 and 1831, and of Chester in 1813. In 1800 he served as treasurer of the Salop Infirmary in Shrewsbury.

In 1794 he raised a cavalry regiment called the \\"Ancient British Fencibles\\" and took part in the suppression of the Irish rebellion of 1798, when they were known as \\"Sir Watkin's lambs\\" and \\"a terror of the rebels\\", acquiring a reputation that he had to defend from charges of cruelty among the Irish. He commanded them until they disbanded in 1800, after Williams-Wynn unsuccessfully requested they be deployed on foreign service. Colonel of the Denbighshire Militia since 1797, he deployed with a battalion of them under his kinsman the Marquess of Buckingham for service in France from March to June 1814. Originally intending to link up with the Duke of Wellington's army who had come from Spain before the French armistice intervened, they were garrisoned in Bordeaux where he was known among local people as \\"le gros commandant Whof Whof Whof\\". He also became Colonel commanding the Denbighshire Yeomanry Cavalry in 1820 and was Welsh Militia aide-de-camp to King William IV from 1830 to 1837 and to Queen Victoria from 1837 until his death. He grew to be a portly man of seventeen and half stone (), which sometimes caused chairs to collapse under him, and Lady Holland, in her Journal (volume I, page 238), commented: \\"Sir Watkin is a Grenville in person and manner all over him; his tongue is immensely too big for his mouth and his utterance is so impeded by it that what he attempts to articulate is generally unintelligible.\\" From the winter of 1826–27, when he contracted erysipelas, he was affected by varying degrees of deafness at their worst in 1831.

He played for the Penticton Broncos in the British Columbia Junior Hockey League from 1969–71 and the New Westminster Bruins in the Western Canadian Hockey League from 1971-73. Mercredi was drafted 16th overall in the first round of the 1973 NHL Amateur Draft by the Atlanta Flames, and 35th overall in the 1973 WHA Amateur Draft by the Houston Aeros. He played 2 games for Atlanta in the 1974–75 season, and three games for the Calgary Cowboys during the 1975-76 WHA season. He also played for a time in Stockholm, Sweden, on the now defunct Hammarby IF Hockey team. Mercredi was the 1970-71 BCJHL MVP and voted on the BCJHL all-star first team. He was also inducted into the Northwest Territories Sport Hall of Fame in 2013 for being the first hockey player born in the Northwest Territories to play in the National Hockey League. ==Political involvement== Mercredi ran for public office to the Legislative Assembly of the Northwest Territories in the 2011 Northwest Territories general election in the electoral district of Kam Lake.

It is endemic to Western Australia. Its natural habitats are temperate forests, temperate shrubland, intermittent rivers, freshwater marshes, rocky areas, granite outcrops, arable land, pastureland, open excavations, and canals and ditches. It is threatened by habitat loss and salinity. ==Breeding== Heleioporus albopunctatus has terrestrial egg deposition. Males excavate burrows up to 1 m deep in sandy substrates surrounding ephemeral waterbodies, and commence calling in autumn (March/April). Amplexus (mating) occurs in the burrow and females deposit a clutch of eggs embedded in foam, in a chamber at the base of the burrow. Eggs develop to mid-stage tadpoles within the eggs, but final development is dependent on winter rains filling the waterbody and flooding burrows. Tadpoles then hatch and complete development in the pond. Some clutches of eggs have been found to be infested by the larvae of a dipteran fly Aphiura breviceps and females of this fly may reside in the burrows of this frog where they are presumed to feed on the outer capsules of the eggs. In one study, around 7% of burrows were found to have eggs infested with maggots from this phorid fly and the mean egg clutch size was 391, and on average, only 2.8% of clutches were found to experience some form of egg mortality. ==Population== Genetic studies have shown that there is good dispersal across the range of this species, however high levels of inbreeding were detected between some populations in the central wheatbelt region of WA, indicating that habitat fragmentation and salinity may be restricting gene flow. A comprehensive study of populations in the central wheatbelt of Western Australia used mark-recapture studies and found low levels of recapture (0.05 to 0.45) between years and estimated an overall survival rate ranging from 0.34-1. This study concluded that survival rates were generally high and the species was persisting in highly modified landscapes. A further population viability analysis study of 24 populations across a gradient from forest to cleared land, found that frog populations connected by dispersal (metapopulations) were less likely to become extinct than isolated populations. That study also found that the survival rates of juvenile frogs was the most important factor in the persistence of populations and that populations may survive well even under a drying climate, if breeding ponds can be managed to not dry out too quickly. ==ReferencesFurther reading== * Lee, A.

It is endemic to Australia. Its natural habitats are temperate forests and intermittent rivers. The hooting frog is the largest member of the genus Heleioporus found in Western Australia. Like all west Australian species it breeds in late autumn and winter, calling from a burrow in which the female later deposits a foamy egg mass. Males excavate burrows in the banks of bottom of dry watercourses, usually lateritic clay based streams of the Darling Range. barycragus means 'deep-voiced' in reference to the low 'hooting' call that also gives its common name.

The administration building is a significant contribution to the development of early commercial aviation in Akron. Its Art Deco architecture and its design are a good representation of the development of airports during the first major expansion of air travel in the 1920s and 1930s. The administration building is located just north of the runways and the Goodyear Airdock, which was built in 1929. The Akron City Council authorized construction of the terminal in 1930, with construction completed and the terminal opening on June 15, 1931. The location and layout of the terminal was influenced by the City Beautiful movement, originally reached through a landscaped traffic circle and at the end of a boulevard-like parking area with lines of trees. The terminal building is in an Art Deco style, with a facade built of cream-colored brick and terra cotta detailing with cream, muted orange, and soft green colors. The terminal served commercial air traffic until 1962, when the Akron–Canton Airport opened to the south. The customs and administrative offices continued to serve traffic from Canada, as well as small aircraft traffic, until the early 1990s. At that time, the property was sold, and the terminal was adaptively reused as Cafe Piscatelli, an Italian restaurant.

The head city of the canton is the homonymous Barva district. ==Toponymy== The name comes from Barvac or Barvak a cacique of the area around 1569, which in turn might come from either: * From New Tlapallan in Nahuatl language, or Tla pallapan, which in Huetar language was Tabaraba or Abaraba, hispanicized as Barba and meaning Black River or Dark River as explained by José Fidel Tristán in 1910. * Bal (town) and wac (anteater), meaning Anteater Town, according to Luis Ferrero. * Bar or bur (bees) with ba or bac (tribe), meaning Bees Tribe, as explained by bishop Bernardo Augusto Thiel y Hoffmann in late 19th century, from sources from 1575 and 1599. By Decree 188 of 4 October 1974, the name changes from Barba to Barva. ==History== Barva was first mentioned as a canton in a decree dated December 7, 1848. The territory that today corresponds to the canton was part of the Western Huetar Kingdom, where the cacique named Barbak had his settlement, whose name was extended to the region between the Virilla River and the mountains of \\"Monte de Aguacate\\", which was called Barva (Valle de Barva). On the slopes of the volcanoes Barva Barva Volcano and Poás Poás Volcano National Park there were also settlements of the indigenous ethnic group of Botos people. == Geography == Barva has an area of km² and an elevation of metres. The elongated canton climbs from the city of Barva on the outskirts of the capital city of Heredia up the slopes of the dormant Barva Volcano, with the mountain's summit serving as its northern boundary. The mountainous region of the canton, where the lagoon of the Barva volcano is located, is part of the area protected by the Braulio Carrillo National Park. Barva is also the access point to the Poás Volcano National Park, the most visited in the country. Many aquifers around the are supply water for the Greater Metropolitan Area. ==Districts== The canton of Barva is subdivided into six districts. # Barva # San Pedro # San Pablo # San Roque # Santa Lucía # San Jose de la Montaña == Demographics == For the 2011 census, Barva had a population of inhabitants. The town has a high literacy rate of (99%), and by 2012 it had a high rate of human development of (0.829) United Nations Development Program. == Transportation ==  Road transportation  The canton is covered by the following road routes: == Economy == The mountains of the region are appropriate for the agriculture. There are plenty of coffee plantations around the slopes of the Barva Volcano. There is also dairy production. == Culture == Masquerade Festival in Barva central park The canton of Barva is known for its mix between rural and urban.

The book and the religious groups that have formed around it exist within DC's main shared universe, known as the DC Universe. The book deals with the exploits of Cain and his works of evil in the world, in association with Lilith. The copy of the Bible seen most often in the DCU allegedly has a cover of stone, made from the physical rock used to kill Abel. ==Publication history== The Crime Bible first appeared in the 2006 to 2007 series 52, in the sections dealing with the characters Renee Montoya and Batwoman. The story was continued in the later part of 2007 in Crime Bible: Five Lessons of Blood, a five-issue limited series featuring Montoya in her new guise as the Question. Since then it has reappeared as the inspiration for the villains facing Batwoman in Detective Comics, in which it appears that a rift has developed between the followers of the Crime Bible based on differing interpretations of its teachings. The focus of the rift is that the book supposedly predicts the actual death of Batwoman; when she survives being stabbed through the heart many of the cultists come to believe the book is deeply flawed. Bruno Mannheim even uses the Crime Bible to help in running Intergang.52 Week Twenty-Five Final Crisis In 2008, the Crime Bible was featured once again in the series Final Crisis.

He was the oldest son of Mieszko III the Old, Duke of Greater Poland (and since 1173, High Duke of Poland) by his first wife, Elisabeth, who was the daughter of King Béla II of Hungary. ==Life== Odon's name appeared for the first time as a signatory in a document issued on 21 May 1161 at Łęczyca, the location of the first Polish Sejm. In 1177, Odon joined the revolt of the Lesser Polish nobility against his own father, Mieszko III, because of the favoritism Mieszko III had shown to the offspring of his second marriage. Additionally, the High Duke had attempted to force Odon to become a priest in order to eliminate him from the succession. As well, Odon wanted to enlarge his domains and found an opportunity to conquer the Duchy of Greater Poland. His uncle, Casimir II the Just, had offered him only Poznań. Odon pursued the war against his father for a year until Mieszko III was forced to abdicate and flee. By 1181, Miesko III had returned to Poland. Enlisting the aid of the Pomeranians, he wrested control over Greater Poland and Poznań from Odon. In 1182, by mutual consent, father and son agreed to divide Greater Poland between them: Odon would receive a portion of Greater Poland south of the river Obrą. Some historians believed that he remained in the Greater Poland capital until his death. When Odon’s younger brother, Mieszko the Younger, died on 2 August 1193, Odon obtained the Duchy of Kalisz with his father's blessing. Little is known about Odon's reign over Kalisz beyond the fact that he founded a mint, where coins have been recovered bearing the inscription \\"Odon Dux\\" (\\"Duke Odon\\")—suggesting a high degree of autonomy. Odon died on 20 April 1194. He was buried in the Cathedral of Poznań. ==Marriage and issue== In about 1184,Włodzimierz Dworzaczek, Genealogia, Warszawa 1959, tabl. 31; Jerzy Wyrozumski, Dzieje Polski piastowskiej, Kraków 1999, p. 153.

The back is yellowish or greyish-brown in colour, dappled with darker markings and dotted with small warts. Some individuals have a red or a white streak along the spine. The underside is pale. The feet of females have webbing to halfway along the toes while the feet of males are fully webbed. This species gets its common name from the characteristic trill made by males at breeding time. ==Distribution and habitat== The humming frog is endemic to the south western part of Western Australia, its range extending from Geraldton to Esperance. It is found in both sandy and clay areas of deserts and agricultural land at altitudes up to and is a burrowing species. ==Biology== In the hottest part of the summer the humming frog buries itself deeply, sheds its skin to make a cocoon and aestivates. During this period of dormancy its metabolic activity diminishes by up to 85% and its oxygen requirement is much reduced. It emerges when the rains arrive in autumn and early winter and then finds its way to temporary pools and other water bodies to breed. Females lay up to a thousand eggs and the tadpoles undergo metamorphosis into juvenile frogs after about four months of development. ==Status== The IUCN Red List of Threatened Species lists the humming frog as being of \\"Least Concern\\".

A conspicuous local Methodist, Sharp was among the pillars of the Methodist Church in the city: he gave land for the construction of its first building, and he also contributed to the establishment of the Blendon Young Men's Seminary, a predecessor institution of Otterbein University. Like other prominent Methodists, Sharp was an active participant in the Underground Railroad, helping to ferry runaway slaves from modern-day metro Columbus to a Quaker community in Morrow County to the north.Sharp Family Homes , Ohio Historical Society, 2002.

St. Clair Shores: Somerset, 1999, 416. Here he lived for part of his life, surrounded by family members: some of his sons lived nearby along State Street or Africa Road. Like their father, the sons were active Underground Railroad participants, and slaves would often be conveyed to any of the houses in the complex. ==Architecture== The Alkire House is a brick building with an asphalt roof, decorated with elements of wood and stone.

This door is approached by a wooden porch with a distinctive balustrade under the eaves, and sidelights frame the doorway. Masonry is employed throughout the construction; the foundation mixes brick and stone, while the windows and doorways uniformly feature stone lintels. ==Preservation== In early 1978, the Alkire House was listed on the National Register of Historic Places, qualifying because of its historically significant architecture. It is one of fourteen National Register-listed locations citywide; among the others are several buildings associated with the Otterbein University campus as well as the home of Garrit's son Stephen Sharp, one of the Africa Road houses that was used for slave-transporting purposes. ==References== Category:Houses completed in 1849 Category:Houses in Franklin County, Ohio Category:National Register of Historic Places in Franklin County, Ohio Category:Houses on the Underground Railroad Category:Houses on the National Register of Historic Places in Ohio Category:Vernacular architecture in Ohio Category:Westerville, Ohio Category:1849 establishments in Ohio ","title":"Alkire House"},{"id":"12391438","text":"USS Pontiac may refer to: *, was a side-wheel gunboat launched in 1863 and sold in 1867 *, was laid down as Right Arm in 1891 and purchased by the US Navy in 1898; sold in 1922 *, was originally Pioneer built in 1883, chartered by the US Navy in 1918 and returned to the owner the same year *, was a refrigerator ship built in 1937, chartered by the US Navy in 1942 and returned to the Maritime Commission in 1945 *, was a large harbor tugboat launched in 1960 and struck from the Naval Vessel Register in 1992 Category:United States Navy ship names ","title":"USS Pontiac"},{"id":"12391441","text":"Gregory Brooks Vaydik (born October 9, 1955) is a former National Hockey League (NHL) player.

Domenech (born April 29, 1978 in San Juan, Puerto Rico) is a former Director of the Office of Legislative Services of Puerto Rico (2005–2008). Domenech spent part of his childhood, and adolescent years, in Ocala, Florida, having attended Blessed Trinity Catholic School, and Forest High School. == DNC Superdelegate and Democratic Party Conventions == Domenech has been a delegate to Democratic National Convention in 2004, 2008, 2012, and 2016. By virtue of the position he held for more than five (5) years in the Democratic National Committee,http://www.politico.com/superdelegates/title_3.html, representing the Young Democrats of America (YDA), as their Democratic National Committeeman, he was a Superdelegate to the 2008 and 2012 Conventions. During the 2004 Convention, Domenech served as one of the whips for the Puerto Rico Delegation. During the 2016 Puerto Rico Democratic primary campaign, Domenech was Hillary Clinton's top fundraiser in the U.S. territory and attended his fourth consecutive Democratic National Convention, after being elected as a Delegate representing his Bayamón Senatorial District. == Politics == In the political sphere, Domenech, is a supporter of admitting Puerto Rico as the 51st state of the United States. In May 2003 he became President of the Puerto Rico Young Democrats (PRYD). During his tenure as President of the PRYD's, Domenech led a team of 14 young Puerto Rican professionals in Central Florida that campaigned for several weeks for the Kerry/Edwards ticket. He also volunteered extensively during 2003–2004 in former Gov. Pedro Rosselló's gubernatorial campaign, both in island wide political organizing, as well as platform and opposition research activities. In November 2004, Domenech also organized and hosted YDA's Fall National meeting in San Juan, Puerto Rico. Domenech then was elected as a national officer of YDA in 2005 as Vice President for Development and on July 21, 2007 became a member of the DNC,http://www.politico.com/superdelegates/title_3.html when YDA's national convention elected him as its Democratic National Committeeman. In 2010 he was reelected for his third and last term as YDA's Democratic National Committeeman, before he aged out of the youth organization. During the last years of his active participation in YDA, Domenech was a co-founder of the YDA Hispanic Caucus. Domenech is the only person in the history of the Young Democrats of America to have served as a national officer for seven (7) consecutive years, two (2) years as a Vice President and five years (5) as Democratic National Committeeman. Following in the footsteps of many Democratic leaders, such as the young Hillary Clinton who registered Hispanics in Southwest Texas in the 70's, Domenech led voter registration drives aimed at potential Puerto Rican voters in Florida's I-4 Corridor in several election cycles between 2004 and 2010, staffed by YDA Puerto Rico chapter volunteers. In December 2007, Domenech was appointed by Senator Hillary Clinton to Co- Chair her presidential campaign's Hillblazers, a national network of young professionals and students. He also served as Deputy State Coordinator of Sen. Clinton's successful primary campaign in Puerto Rico, where she polled a 68–32 margin over Sen. Obama in the June 1, 2008 Puerto Rico Democratic primary, 2008. Domenech served as one of the national co-finance chairs of Ready for Hillary, and coordinated fundraisers for the super PAC in and out of Puerto Rico, from California to Washington, DC. He served on the National Finance Committee for Hillary Clinton presidential campaign, 2016, was her top fundraising bundler from Puerto Rico, assisted in organizing her first campaign trip to Puerto Rico in the current election cycle, which took place on September 4, 2015. He additionally served as the campaign manager for her successful primary camping in Puerto Rico, where she polled a 61–37, margin of victory over Sen. Sanders in the June 5, 2016 Puerto Rico Democratic primary, 2016. Domenech also served as Representative Jenniffer Gonzalez campaign manager during her historic run to become the first woman to hold the Resident Commissioner of Puerto Rico seat in Washington, D.C. On November 8,2016, and after 14 months of campaigning, Domenech successfully led a campaign team that made history by electing the first woman and youngest person to represent Puerto Rico in the U.S. Congress. == Professional background == While practicing law at the age of 27, Domenech argued on behalf of the Puerto Rico Senate before a relatively rare en banc hearing of the United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit in the case of Igartúa De La Rosa v. United States of America. He has also appeared before Puerto Rico's Supreme Court, as well as its Court of Appeals. In 2005 he was appointed jointly by Senate of Puerto Rico President Kenneth McClintock and Puerto Rico House of Representatives Speaker José Aponte as Director of the Office of Legislative Services of Puerto Rico.the local legislative equivalent of the United States Congress' Congressional Research Service with a staff of about 120 and a budget of $10 million. During his tenure, he streamlined the staff, expanded the Office's Tomás Bonilla Legislative Library, including access to the blind and the physically handicapped, operated a 100-intern Summer program three years in a row, and turned budget surpluses during four consecutive fiscal years. In early 2013, the Puerto Rico Supreme Court in Domenech Fernández v. Integration Corporate Services, et al ruled unanimously in his favor in a case arising from a shareholders' dispute within the firm for which he had previously worked. In the Supreme Court's Opinion, in which the Court for the first time interprets Puerto Rico's 2009 Corporations Law, it ruled that whenever fraud or irregularities are alleged in the keeping of a corporation's records, as Domenech alleged, evidence extraneous to the corporate records will be admitted. He currently maintains a bipartisan government affairs firm in Puerto Rico, Politank*,http://politank.com/ which hired Puerto Rico's former Secretary of State and Senate President Kenneth McClintock and Guillermo San Antonio-Acha, former Legal Counsel to the Governor during Governor Aníbal Acevedo Vilá's administration and who served from late 2014 until early 2017 as the Popular Democratic Party of Puerto Rico (PPD) Electoral Commissioner.http://www.elnuevodia.com/noticias/politica/nota/nuevocomisionadoelectoralenelppd-1863320/ He has managed three (3) successful presidential campaigns within the Puerto Rico Physicians Association, the statutorily-created organization to which the islands' approximately 11,000 physicians mandatorily belong, to elect in 2014, reelect in 2016, and again reelect in 2018 the organization's current president, Dr. Víctor Ramos. The reelection of Ramos on April 10, 2016 resulted in a majority of 71.6% in a three-way race. The third re-election of Dr. Ramos, led by Domenech, took place on April 22, 2018, by another comfortable margin of 67% https://www.noticel.com/ahora/negocio-de-la- salud/revalida-vctor-ramos-a-la-presidencia-del-colegio-de-mdicos- cirujanos/733073472 of all the votes cast. It was an even more historical feat than his two prior victories led by Domenech, because in the 25 years of the Colegio Médico's existence, no one candidate had ever been elected three (3) times to its presidency. Mr. Domenech is a regular commentator in Puerto Rico media such as El Nuevo Día, El Vocero, Puerto Rico TV (Channel 6), Wapa America (Channel 4), Caribbean Business. Mr. Domenech is also frequently quoted in Puerto Rico's main media outlets. == Philanthropy == Both individually and through his lobbying firm Politank*, Mr. Domenech has actively supported through the years various philanthropic endeavors.

During his years at UPR, Domenech was President of the General Student Body Council during the 1999–2000 academic year, a position that had never been held by a statehooder before or since him. During that same year he also served as an Academic Senator before the UPR Río Piedras campus Academic Senate. Prior to that, from 1998 to 1999, Domenech was UPR's College of Social Sciences Student Body President. Academically, Domenech was a twice participant (2002 & 2003) in the international rounds of the Philip C. Jessup International Law Moot Court Competition on behalf of UPR's School of Law. He ranked in the top 15% of oralists. ==Family== He is the great grand nephew of Manuel V. Domenech, an engineer, who was a member of the first Puerto Rico House of Representatives after the Spanish–American War of 1898, and was reelected in 1902 and 1904.https://www.loc.gov/rr/hispanic/1898/domenech.html During 1904 he served as Mayor for the city of Ponce, Puerto Rico. In 1914 he was appointed to serve as Commissioner of the Interior, becoming one of the first Puerto Ricans to hold an officer's position in the Cabinet which was appointed by the President of the United States. Also, he was later appointed as Treasurer of Puerto Rico serving in this capacity from 1930–1935. Unlike his great grand nephew, Manuel Domenech was a very active member of the Republican Party of Puerto Rico attending the 1928 Republican National Convention as an alternate delegate. Domenech is also second cousin of the former Commonwealth of Virginia's Secretary of Natural Resources, Douglas Domenech who served in the Bush Administration as Deputy Chief of Staff for the United States Department of the Interior and who is pending Senate confirmation to become Assistant Secretary for Insular Affairs of the United States Department of the Interior under the Trump Administration.\\"Boricua en la Casa Blanca, 18 Feb 2008, El Nuevo Día, accessible through paid subscription to Endi.com archives ==ReferencesExternal links== *Francisco J.

The main mass of the church building was constructed in 1850 by William Newman and is an example of Gothic Revival architecture, the first of that style in Portsmouth. It was built in four sections the first in 1833. Sitting on a stone foundation the brick building has multiple steeply pitched gable roofs. Windows are separated by buttresses and topped by lancet arches. The main section, built in 1850, is a nave with a high altar. A two-story tower with paired narrow windows rises from the southwest corner of the nave. The facade of this mass has a large central rose window and two compounded gothic arch entries each with double vertical board doors. The section of the building called the guild hall was built in two sections. The first, from 1833, was the original church and retains its original stone foundation. A section was added to the west in the 1880s with a brick foundation and fenestration and buttresses similar to the main mass. The entries to the guild hall section have Tudor arches. Another addition was made in 1953 consisting of a two-story cement block with parish house, offices and classrooms. ==History== In 1855 it was the first public building in the city to use gas lighting. It has survived an interior fire in 1893 and extensive flood damage in the Ohio River flood of 1937. On June 23, 1819 the Episcopal Parish of All Saints of Portsmouth, Ohio was organized in the home of John Smith. The first rector, installed on June 19, 1831 was Henry Caswell. A sanctuary was built on the church property in 1833, the church website states that the cornerstone for this building was the first for any church in the Portsmouth area. The main building was erected in 1850. The nave was updated in 1972 then in 1995 it was restored. Remaining original furnishings include the baptismal font, the low altar and an original pew. A chalice from the 1820 visit of Philander Chase, Bishop of Ohio is on display in the narthex set in a niche. It was listed in the National Register on March 25, 1982, significant primarily as striking example of Gothic Revival architecture. An organ originally built in 1962 by the Schlicker Organ Co. of Buffalo, New York and renovated and updated by Peebles–Herzog Inc. of Columbus, Ohio in 2006 is installed in the church. ==See also== * National Register of Historic Places listings in Scioto County, Ohio ==ReferencesExternal links== * * * Category:Churches on the National Register of Historic Places in Ohio Category:Episcopal churches in Ohio Category:National Register of Historic Places in Scioto County, Ohio Category:Churches in Portsmouth, Ohio ","title":"All Saints Episcopal Church (Portsmouth, Ohio)"},{"id":"12391471","text":"The desert spadefoot toad (Notaden nichollsi) is a species of frog in the family Limnodynastidae.

They are generally larger than a sailing dinghy.Royce, Patrick M.: Royces Sailing Illustrated, pages 52-57. Delta Lithograph, 1993. Trailer sailers include day sailers and small cabin cruisers, suitable for living on. Trailer sailers are used for both racing and recreation and are popular with small families and retirees. They occupy a space between smaller trailerable sailing dinghys which are intended for day use and larger boats which can only be removed from the water with specialised equipment such boat lifting cranes. Unlike dinghys, many feature enclosed cabins which allow for overnight sleeping and dry storage. Most trailer sailers also feature ballast, either fixed or in a swinging centreboard or dagger board to make them easier to launch and retrieve. This makes these boats more stable than a dinghy, as well as less prone to capsize and more capable of self-righting. Sails on trailer sailers can also be lowered easily on water unlike dinghys which are often rigged fully on the shore. Trailer sailers offer a number of advantages over larger boats that are impractical to tow on a trailer. Because they can be towed and stored at home, owners can avoid the mooring fees and maintenance costs of boats that remain in the water. Towing is also a relatively fast and efficient way of reaching new destinations from which to sail. However, they generally have less living space. All but the biggest do not have standing room in their cabins. Moreover, trailer sailers are generally more lightly- built and ballasted, making them incapable of tackling open oceans, confining them to coastal and protected waters. Due to the limitations of trailer capacity, towing vehicle size and weight, as well as highway width limitations, most trailer sailboats are limited in size to about in length and beams of . ==History== Siren 17 with its trailer. The first trailer sailers were built in the 1950s. They were light, marine plywood boats designed for home builders. Robert Tucker in the UK designed the Silhouette, in the early 1950s. His concept was to build a small boat suitable for overnight camping, which could be trailed to different locations behind a small car. It is thought that over 3000 of this type have been built. In the mid 50s, Richard Hartley of New Zealand designed the Hartley TS 16, a 16 ft long trailer sailer with a towing weight of . The TS 16 was built in large numbers in New Zealand and Australia, spurring the popularity of trailer sailers in these countries. Over 12,000 boats of this type have been built.According to the Hartley Boats website: The advent of mass production fibreglass boats in the mid 1960s saw an expansion of trailer sailer designs, such as the Aquarius 21 Boomerang 20, Cal 21, Careel 18, Neptune 16, and Pearson 22. The Catalina 22,launched in 1969, is particularly notable as it continues in production, with over 15,000 built. Trailer cabin sailboats appeared on the US market in 1970 and were sailed on small lakes and rivers. A large number were initially sold in North America in areas such as Arizona, New Mexico and the Great Lakes region. In the late 1980s and early 1990s trailer sailers evolved into sportsboats, of a similar size but more optimised for racing speed with reduced accommodation and lightweight hulls. There is an absence of an accepted definition of the term. ==Accommodation== Sandpiper 565 Cabins in trailer sailers are usually arranged with dual purpose settee-berths running along the side of the boat from a V-berth at the bow, to quarter berths underneath the cockpit. Usually, the centreboard or daggerboard trunk encroaches into the cabin in the middle of the boat, but can form the base for a folding table. Some types have a small four person table with club seating. Boats may or may not have a small galley with a stove, a food preparation area and a sink. In terms of headroom, the smallest types do not have sitting head room for taller sailors, while only the largest have standing headroom. Some boats address this problem using cabin pop-tops that can be raised when not underway to provide additional head room. The smallest trailer sailers in the range generally have two berths. As boats become larger four berths are commonly fitted, with a V-berth at the bow and quarter berths at the rear. Larger boats might have up to six berths. Many trailer sailers have a small galley with a stove, built in, although on smaller trailer sailers, this may be omitted. Usually, trailer sailers have a head, which is most commonly a portable toilet, mounted in the bow V-berth area of the cabin. Some larger boats however have an enclosed toilet. ==Towing== Corsair F-27 Sport Cruiser trimaran being loaded on its trailer Trailer sailers, by necessity, must be transported by trailer, which places a number of restrictions on their design. To make them easy to launch, retrieve and transport by trailer, boats cannot have long fixed keels. Therefore most trailer sailers have swing keel centreboards or daggerboards. Generally a trailer sailer should be towable behind a vehicle without special licences for oversized loads. This means that the beam is usually limited to approximately depending on jurisdiction. The practical limit for the length of such boats is , although some trailer sailers such as the Robb Legg 28 or the Gougeon 32 are longer. Weight limitations are determined by the towing vehicle. Smaller trailer sailers can weigh or less and can easily be towed behind average cars, while larger, heavily ballasted trailer sailers can weigh over require heavy vehicles with specialised towing equipment. Larger trailer sailers over 26 ft are difficult to tow and are sometimes kept in the water and only placed on their trailers for occasional towing or storage. Trailer sailer masts must be lowered for towing. This becomes difficult on larger boats with heavier, longer masts. Such boats require complex mast raising systems. Some sailboat designs for trailering incorporate special features. The MacGregor 26S, for example is a boat in length, but that weighs empty and dry and carries of flooding water ballast in tanks which are filled when the boat is launched and drained when the boat is removed from the water, thus making the boat lighter to transport than if it used more traditional iron or lead ballast. The design also has a pivoting centreboard, plus a pivoting rudder and easily rigged mast to make getting the boat from the trailer to the water easy to accomplish. It also has a beam of , under the width limit for highway trailers. On the design limitations of trailerable boats with flooding water ballast, Cruising World writer Bill Lee said in 1996: ==Rigging== A Corsair F31 trimaran sailboat folded while at the dock Most trailer sailers use a Bermuda rig with one stayed mast, a mainsail and a single foresail. Mast raising Masts can be raised by attaching them to the deck and walking them up. This is practical on smaller boats with lightweight masts, but as larger boats have longer and heavier masts. On such boats, raising the mast by brute force requires significant strength and is beyond the abilities of smaller, frail and short- handed crews. Therefore, many designs employ mast raising systems to make the task easier. Methods vary but can be classed into three groups. One method is to use the boom as a gin pole, laying the mast on deck, with the boom at right angles. Hauling on the boom then raises the mast. This method has the advantage of using equipment that is already on the boat. A second method is to attach two poles called shear legs in an A-frame configuration with poles running from the sheer to meet above the boat. The mast can then be hauled upward using the forestay. This method requires additional equipment. A third method is to attach a pole to the winch post on the trailer and haul the mast upwards once again with the forestay, which also requires additional equipment. As the mast is being raised, it must be tensioned laterally. In many boats, the sidestays are not attached to the deck close to the axis of rotation of the mast and therefore tighten or loosen as the mast raises. The mast can be either held straight by a second person, or with temporary babystays mounted close to the masts axis of rotation. ==Engines== Farrier F-22A trimaran, with Torqeedo electric outboard motor Trailer sailers usually have a motor for docking and maneuvering. Most trailer sailers use outboard motors, which are best suited to sailboats 28 ft in length and under. Outboards offer the advantage of being light, easy to use and maintain and are also inexpensive, as they are commercially produced on a large scale and sold off-the-shelf. They can also be raised out of the water, to eliminate drag when sailing. This contrasts with inboard diesel engines which are heavy and occupy significant internal space and are best suited to larger vessels. Outboard motors used for trailer sailers need to be geared down as trailer sailers sail at slow displacement speeds compared to the higher planing speeds of powerboats, which are the most common application for outboard motors. Outboards are often mounted on the transom, with some boats mounting them in a well, also at the stern. Outboards may be mounted on a lifting mount, to allow them to be raised up out of the water. Long shaft outboard motors are advantageous, as they prevent the propeller from exiting the water and over- speeding when the boat rides over waves. ==Anchoring== Trailer sailers usually carry anchoring equipment. Due to their small size, the tackle is also light and can lowered and raised by hand. Therefore power winches are unnecessary. ==See also== *Day sailer *Pocket cruiser ==References== Notes Citations Bibliography * * Category:Trailers ","title":"Trailer sailer"},{"id":"12391499","text":"All Souls Unitarian Universalist Church, built in 1894 in the Richardsonian Romanesque style is an historic building located at 25 Church Street in Bellville, Ohio.

The first courthouse was a simple log structure consisting of two floors, a small hipped roof and a single chimney. The courthouse served the county until 1840 when the county realized the space was not adequate for the growing population. A contest was announced and seventeen bids were submitted. The contract was awarded to Orlando Boughton and was designed in the Classical Revival style. The amount was $13,325 and construction was underway. The courthouse was two stories tall and was built out of brick and stone. Pilasters lined the facade between the long windows with dark shutters. The entrance was framed with four fluted Doric columns supporting a portico. A square drum rose from the roof and supported large rectangular windows capped with a dome ending in a weather vane. The tower contained a large bell which rang periodically through the years, including the 14th of April in 1865 in honor of the slain president, Abraham Lincoln. The courthouse standing today is the county's third. It was built between 1881-1884 at a cost of $360,000 by architect George H. Maetzel. The courthouse is designed in the popular Second Empire style. ==Exterior== The stone foundation is smooth sandstone. The ground floor has recessed rectangular windows. The southern center pavilion projects from the facade and is flanked by mansard-roofed towers which used to be topped with windows. A statue of an eagle once topped the pediment. The main entrance is reached by a flight of stairs and a small landing leading to a story arch. The windows of the main floor are high rectangular panels, the windows on the floor above are high arched panes. Above the main entrance rises a pediment that was once topped by the statue of Justice. The tower rises above the roof and consists of two bases stacked one on top the other. A dome with a four faced clock sits on the base. The dome narrows to a small spire. In the 1990s the courthouse was remodeled and updated. At this time the new Justice Center was built next door. The two buildings are connected by an overhead walkway. The new addition was constructed in the same colors to match the courthouse and houses a jail, several courtrooms and the sheriff's administrative offices. == References Further reading== *Thrane, Susan W., County Courthouses of Ohio, Indiana University Press, Indianapolis, Indiana 2000 *Marzulli, Lawrence J., The Development of Ohio's Counties and Their Historic Courthouses, Gray Printing Company, Fostoria, Ohio 1983 *Stebbins, Clair, Ohio's Court Houses, Ohio State Bar Association, Columbus, Ohio 1980 Category:National Register of Historic Places in Allen County, Ohio Category:County courthouses in Ohio Category:Buildings and structures in Lima, Ohio Category:Courthouses on the National Register of Historic Places in Ohio Category:Sandstone buildings in the United States Category:Second Empire architecture in Ohio Category:Clock towers in Ohio Category:Government buildings completed in 1884 Category:1881 establishments in Ohio ","title":"Allen County Courthouse (Ohio)"},{"id":"12391527","text":"Vasyl Velychkovsky (June 1, 1903 - June 30, 1973) was a priest, and later bishop, of the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church, one of the Eastern Catholic Churches in communion with Rome.

For many years, the road between Huntington Center and Wellington (now State Route 58) has possessed a reputation of architectural distinction: numerous Greek Revival farmhouses from the mid-19th century still stand on both sides of the road, giving it a historically unique built environment.McQuillin, Steven. '. National Park Service, 1978-05. Along with many of their outbuildings, these houses are among the region's best Greek Revival buildings, due in part to the area's early prosperity and long decline: after growing rapidly in its early years, Huntington Township declined after 1850, and the remaining residents continued using their older buildings instead of building new ones. In 1979, many of the houses on State Route 58 south of Wellington were listed on the National Register of Historic Places via a multiple property submission. The Allen House was among these, qualifying both because of its place in the area's history and because of its historically significant architecture; it was included because of its exceptional degree of preservation, even when compared to the other houses in this exceptionally well-preserved stretch of road. Two agricultural outbuildings were included in the designation, as well as the main house. ==References== Category:Houses completed in 1830 Category:Greek Revival houses in Ohio Category:Houses in Lorain County, Ohio Category:National Register of Historic Places in Lorain County, Ohio Category:Houses on the National Register of Historic Places in Ohio Category:Wooden houses in the United States Category:1830 establishments in Ohio ","title":"Darlon Allen House"},{"id":"12391548","text":"Allen County Courthouse may refer to: *Allen County Courthouse (Indiana), Fort Wayne, Indiana *Allen County Courthouse (Kansas), Iola, Kansas *Allen County Courthouse (Ohio), Lima, Ohio ==See also== *Allen Parish Courthouse, Oberlin, Louisiana ","title":"Allen County Courthouse"},{"id":"12391555","text":"Dr. Peter Allen House is a registered historic building near Kinsman, Ohio, listed in the National Register on 1971-09-03. It currently operates as the Peter Allen Inn & Event Center, a small inn and wedding venue. ==History== The Peter Allen House was built by architect Willis Smith in 1821 for Kinsman doctor Peter Allen. In 1808, Peter Allen relocated to Kinsman. He would later become the town's first medical doctor. In addition, architect Smith built the Kinsman Presbyterian Church, as well as several other buildings around the Kinsman community. Smith also built the home for John Kinsman, for whom the township is named. The home originally cost $3,000 on a $2-an-acre lot. Allen became a skilled surgeon during the War of 1812. Allen first married in 1813 to Charity Dudley, who died in a runaway carriage accident in 1840. He would later marry Fanny Starr, the niece of General Simon Perkins. At an unspecified date, Allen and his family moved to Oberlin. The house was then purchased by the Reverend James Plant. In 1903, the grandson of Peter Allen, Dr. Dudley Allen, negotiated with the Plant family descendants and purchased the woodwork from the parlor and had it transferred to Cleveland to be used for two separate homes. When the second home, built by Dudley Allen, was torn down the fittings were stored at the Western Reserve Historical Society until replaced after 51 years in the original Kinsman home. == Preservation efforts == Over time, the property changed hands. Restoring the property was greatly furthered by an initiative during the Great Depression. The Works Progress Administration sent draftsmen across the country to document historic structures, including the Allen house. Years later, preservation projects on the Peter Allen House continued. In 1938, the building was listed in the Library of Congress. During the 1970s, only three families had occupied the Peter Allen House. Mrs. Alice Blaemire purchased the house sometime during the 20th century, opening it up as a tea room and for private dinners and parties. == Current status == Richard Thompson and his wife, Rhonda, purchased the property in 2008, with aspirations in mind to preserve its history, but add a new chapter to it. The Business Journal reported; \\"Thompson is a founding partner and owner of Therm-O-Link Inc., an electrical wire and cable manufacturer with plants in Warren, Garrettsville and Texas. When he stepped down from active operations of the company in 1993, he turned to farming. He had started his Kinsman farm as a hobby when his son graduated from high school in the mid-1990s and decided to pursue agriculture as a career.\\" Previously, the Thompson's purchased Peter Allen's home from the Alice Blaemire estate. Soon after purchasing the property, in 2010, the couple started the Richard and Rhonda Thompson Foundation. The foundation would focus primarily on the restoration and preservation of historic structures. In 2016, the Peter Allen House opened as the Peter Allen Inn & Event Center. The home has hosted weddings, bridal and baby showers, bereavement dinners, reunions, corporate retreats and a prom for a local charter school. ==Notes and References External Links == * Peter Allen Inn & Event Center website Category:Houses on the National Register of Historic Places in Ohio Category:Houses in Trumbull County, Ohio Category:National Register of Historic Places in Trumbull County, Ohio ","title":"Dr. Peter Allen House"},{"id":"12391563","text":"Remembrance – A Memorial Benefit is the twelfth album of pianist George Winston, released in 2001.

This event restricts the flow of blood to the brain in a near-immediate fashion. The blood hammer is analogous to the water hammer in hydrology and it consists of a sudden increase of the upstream blood pressure in a blood vessel when the bloodstream is abruptly blocked by vessel obstruction. Complete understanding of the relationship between mechanical parameters in vascular occlusions is a critical issue, which can play an important role in the future diagnosis, understanding and treatment of vascular diseases. Depending upon the location and severity of the occlusion, signs and symptoms may vary within the population affected with PCA syndrome. Blockages of the proximal portion of the vessel produce only minor deficits due to the collateral blood flow from the opposite hemisphere via the posterior communicating artery. In contrast, distal occlusions result in more serious complications. Visual deficits, such as agnosia, prosopagnosia or cortical blindness (with bilateral infarcts) may be a product of ischemic damage to occipital lobe. Occlusions of the branches of the PCA that supply the thalamus can result in central post-stroke pain and lesions to the subthalamic branches can produce “a wide variety of deficits”.

The mound is believed to have been built between AD 800 and 1200 by people of the Fort Ancient culture. The mound was likely a ceremonial site, as it was not used for burials. Located on privately owned land, Alligator Mound is one of two extant effigy mounds known in the present- day state of Ohio, along with Serpent Mound in Adams County, Ohio. It has been listed on the National Register of Historic Places since 1971. Effigy mounds were built more often by ancient indigenous peoples located in the areas of the present-day states of Illinois, Iowa, and Wisconsin than in the Ohio area, and many have survived there. ==Survey history== Squier and Davis: 1848 Ephraim George Squier and Edwin Hamilton Davis surveyed the privately held site in Granville, Ohio for the Smithsonian Institution and reported their findings in their 1848 publication Ancient Monuments of the Mississippi Valley. They described the site as \\"strange.\\" They report the location of the work as being 150 to 200 feet in height. They note that people in the area called it \\"the alligator,\\" \\"although the figure bears as a close resemblance to the lizard as any other reptile.\\" The head of the effigy points towards the southwest. The work totaled 250 feet in length from head to tail. The body was noted at 40 feet wide, and each leg was measured at 36 feet. They describe the ends of the paws as being \\"a little broader than the remaining portions of the same, as if the spread of those toes had been originally indicated.\\" Squier and Davis note that the head, shoulders and rump of the effigy are higher than the rest of the body. The height of the mound ranges from four feet to six feet. In the middle of the effigy was a small mound, which they believed was used as an altar. Stones covered the altar, with marks from being lit on fire in the past. A graded way was made from the altar to the \\"top of the effigy.\\" The graded way is ten feet wide. They note evidence of excavation in parts of the effigy with little disturbance to the site. Through excavation they determined that the site is made of clay and that the clay had been imported from another area. They also noted that no historical excavation, made by the creators of the effigy, was found in the region. They examine the headland where the mound is built. They describe it as a \\"beautifully rounded spur of land,\\" and question if the site was rounded by humans to create such a rounded place. During their visit, they also noticed that damage had been done to the headland. They note that other earthworks can be seen from the top of the headland, specifically those in the Newark group. After their survey, Squier and Davis concluded that the site was used for sacrifices or \\"on stated or extraordinary occasions,\\". Lepper and Frolking: 1999 In 1999 Brad Lepper and Tod A. Frolking conducted a professional archaeological investigation of the mound. By radiometric dating of a piece of charcoal recovered from the base of the mound, they estimate its construction to have been 1,000 years BP (about AD 950). Lepper suggests that the Alligator Mound is an effigy of an underwater panther, a powerful figure in Native American myth. He thinks that early European settlers misinterpreted what Native Americans told them about the effigy. They were told that it was a fierce creature that lived in the water and ate people, which they assumed to be an alligator. == References External links== * Ohio Exploration Society - Alligator Mound * - The Project Gutenberg EBook of Animal Carvings from Mounds of the Mississippi Valley, by Henry W.

Post, the building (completed in 1914) was an addition to the existing Alta House, a settlement house for the Italian American community in Cleveland. Although Alta House burned in 1980 and was demolished in 1981, the library survived undamaged. The Alta Public Library was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on October 4, 2005. ==Construction of Alta House and the Alta Public Library== In 1895, billionaire oilman John D. Rockefeller, Sr. agreed to fund the construction of a settlement house consisting of a kindergarten and day care nursery in the Little Italy area of Cleveland, Ohio. It was named Alta House, in honor of Rockefeller's daughter, Alta. Charles W. Hopkinson, a noted local architect, was commissioned to design the building, which opened in 1899. In 1910, Rockefeller agreed to fund the expansion of Alta House to include a gym, library, and swimming pool. George B. Post designed the Neoclassical addition to Alta House as well as the library. The library opened on February 10, 1914. ==Fire and loss of Alta House== A fire struck the Alta House portion of the complex on June 22, 1980, doing $40,000 ($ in dollars) in damage. A second fire on July 1 caused $8,000 ($ in dollars) in damages. Both fires were later believed to be arson, although over time an electrical fault was found to be the cause of the first fire. Arsonists struck the building again twice more in the following weeks, although each blaze was small. The cumulative effect of the fires was to force Alta House programs to use the Alta Public Library building for programming. City officials determined that the damage to Alta House was too extensive, and condemned the structure on November 12, 1980. Alta House officials decided to tear down the structure after determining that the cost of repairs would be more than $1 million ($ in dollars), and that no company would insure the structure. Only the main building was razed, saving the Alta House swimming pool and gymnasium. The Alta Public Library was undamaged. A new structure to house Alta House opened in May 1982. This consisted of a much smaller building (essentially a wing of the library), two stories in height. Bocce courts replaced much of the site of the old building. In 2016, the Alta Public Library received a major refurbishment. Overseen by Cleveland architect Joseph Linek, the $1.6 million ($ in dollars) renovation (partially funded by $240,000 ($ in dollars) in historic preservation tax credits) included conservation, restoration, and refurbishment of the original oak floors, window wells, windows, and cornice brickwork.

Depending upon the location and severity of the occlusion, signs and symptoms may vary within the population affected with MCA syndrome. More distal blockages tend to produce milder deficits due to more extensive branching of the artery and less ischemic response. In contrast, the most proximal occlusions result in widespread effects that can lead to significant cerebral edema, increased intracranial pressure, loss of consciousness and could even be fatal. In such occasions, mannitol (osmotic diuretic) or hypertonic saline are given to draw fluid out of the edematous cerebrum to minimise secondary injury. Hypertonic saline is better than mannitol, as mannitol being a diuretic will decrease the mean arterial pressure and since cerebral perfusion is mean arterial pressure minus intracranial pressure, mannitol will also cause a decrease in cerebral perfusion. Contralateral hemiparesis and hemisensory loss of the face, upper and lower extremities is the most common presentation of MCA syndrome. Lower extremity function is more spared than that of the faciobrachial region. The majority of the primary motor and somatosensory cortices are supplied by the MCA and the cortical homunculus can, therefore, be used to localize the defects more precisely. Middle cerebral artery lesions mostly affect the dominant hemisphere i.e. the left cerebral hemisphere. ==Signs and Symptoms== * Hemiparesis or hemiplegia of the lower half of the contralateral face * Hemiparesis or hemiplegia of the contralateral upper and lower extremities* * Sensory loss of the contralateral face, arm and leg* * Ataxia of contralateral extremities* * Speech impairments/aphasia: Broca's area, Wernicke's or Global aphasia as a result of a dominant hemisphere lesion (usually the left brain) * Perceptual deficits: hemispatial neglect, anosognosia, apraxia, and spatial disorganization as a result of a non-dominant hemisphere lesion (usually the right brain) * Visual disorders: déviation conjuguée, a gaze preference towards the side of the lesion; contralateral homonymous hemianopsia Note: *faciobrachial deficits greater than that of the lower limb ==Diagnosis== Diagnosis can be confirmed by CT Scan or MRI for advanced investigations. ==References External links == Category:Stroke Category:Syndromes affecting the nervous system ","title":"Middle cerebral artery syndrome"},{"id":"12391666","text":"Ambler Heights Historic District is a historic district in Cleveland Heights, Ohio, United States.

F.A. Davis, Philadelphia. Depending upon the area and severity of the occlusion, signs and symptoms may vary within the population affected with ACA syndrome. Blockages to the proximal (A1) segment of the vessel produce only minor deficits due to the collateral blood flow from the opposite hemisphere via the anterior communicating artery. Occlusions distal to this segment will result in more severe presentation of ACA syndrome. Contralateral hemiparesis and hemisensory loss of the lower extremity is the most common symptom associated with ACA syndrome. ==Signs and symptoms== # Hemiparesis or hemiplegia contralaterally, involving primarily the lower limbs and pelvic floor musculature # Sensory deficits contralaterally, involving primarily the leg and perineum # Apraxia (due to branches to the supplementary motor area and corpus callosum) # Disconnection syndrome (due to callosal branches) # Anosmia (due to branches of the olfactory bulb and olfactory tract) # Urinary incontinence # Grasp reflex and or sucking reflex contralaterally (if circle of Willis compromised) ==Diagnosis== Once an acute ischemic stroke is suspected, the standard evaluation includes performing routine airway, breathing and circulation assessment, checking blood glucose, performing a validated stroke severity scale assessment and accurate, focused history regarding the time of symptom onset or last known well or at baseline. The National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) is a standardized method for quantifiable assessment of stroke symptoms. It is the preferred scoring system, and scores range from 0 to 42. A patient with a higher score on this scale is more likely to be considered disabled; however, the definition of \\"disabling\\" depends on age, occupation, underlying life-limiting comorbidities, advance directives. The crucial step in the evaluation of stroke patients is to obtain brain imaging to ascertain the type and characteristics of the stroke. In this regard, non-contrast CT of the head is the imaging modality of choice. Ischemic changes may classify as acute, subacute, and chronic, depending on the time in which they present after the onset of stroke. CT scan can also rule out intracranial hemorrhage.[18] If an intracranial hemorrhage is present, aneurysmal rupture should be investigated given its association with arterial vasospasm resulting in stroke.[3] Anterior cerebral artery strokes could be missed on imaging studies depending on their location or size. One case series found that 37.5% (6 of 16) of ACA infarcts evaluated by CT were identifiable only after using contrast injection or angiography. If the area of hypodensity is small and localized over a sulcus, the infarct could be overlooked.[1][13] Noncontrast head CT should be quickly followed by CT angiography of the head and neck to expedite identification of intracranial large vessel occlusion. The finding of a hyperdense lesion in the ACA on CT scan aid in the diagnosis of stroke in its acute phase, particularly when it may be otherwise difficult to establish. The frequency of this sign in ACA infarcts is similar to that in the territories of the middle cerebral artery and the posterior circulation.[19] As in strokes involving other areas of the brain, magnetic resonance imaging is also of critical value in the diagnosis of ACA strokes. MRI with diffusion-weight imaging is a highly useful modality, which facilitates the demarcation of ischemic boundaries in the territory of the ACA.[3][18] MR angiography can be a helpful adjunct in the evaluation of stroke mechanisms.[7] The goal of completing head CT or MRI should be 25 min or less within patient arrival. The National Institutes of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) established time frame goals in the evaluation of stroke patients: door to physician less than 10 min, door to stroke team less than 15 min, door to CT scan less than 25 min, door to drug less than 60 min.[20] Along with accurate history and early imaging, laboratory studies including capillary blood glucose, complete blood count with platelets, chemistries, coagulation studies, hemoglobin A1c, lipid panel, and markers of hypercoagulability or inflammation can be useful in identifying the risk factors or establishing the etiology of stroke. The medication checklist is an integral part of the evaluation, specifically recent use of anticoagulants, as contraindications to thrombolytic therapy should undergo rapid assessment. Cardiac sources of embolism can be evaluated as part of the work up with EKG monitoring and echocardiogram. ==Management== Pulse oximetry can guide the use of supplemental oxygen to maintain oxygen saturation greater than 94%. Hyperoxia should be avoided as may be detrimental in stroke. Hypertension is common in an acute ischemic stroke. A low BP is uncommon and may indicate symptoms exacerbation of a previous stroke due to poor perfusion. Blood pressure of 220/120 mmHg should receive treatment. There is a consensus approach of allowing permissive hypertension up to 220/120 mmHg for patients that are not candidates for thrombolysis.[21] However, for a patient that is a potential candidate for alteplase, attempt to control BP should be made immediately as goal BP for initiation of IV alteplase is 185/110 mmHg. Usually, titratable short-acting intravenous hypotensive agents are recommended to avoid dropping the BP too much once the patient is at goal. Hypotensive agents that can be options include labetalol, nicardipine, clevidipine, hydralazine, enalaprilat.[21] For the patients that present within the therapeutic window, the decision to treat with intravenous recombinant tissue plasminogen (less than 4.5 hours from symptom onset) or endovascular treatment with mechanical thrombectomy should be made. Initiation of IV alteplase treatment in the 3 to 4.5-hour window is the current recommendation for patients less than 80 years of age, no history of both diabetes mellitus and prior stroke, use of anticoagulants, and NIHSS score of less than 25. Only patients with disabling symptoms are considered eligible for thrombolytic treatment. Eligibility and absolute and relative contraindications should undergo rapid assessment. Randomized controlled trials have shown that intravenous administration of recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (alteplase) decrease functional disability with an absolute reduction risk of 7%-13% relative to placebo.[21] Unfortunately, over half of patients arrive after this time window has closed and are not eligible for thrombolysis. Treatment delays may result from failure to ascribe a patient's symptoms to stroke, and furthermore, the risk of harm increases with time elapsed from symptom onset.[21] This situation could be of particular concern in ACA strokes, given their sometimes atypical presentation. Endovascular treatment with mechanical thrombectomy (MT) is another proven treatment modality in the management of patients with acute stroke suffering a large vessel occlusion, although treatment efficacy is highly time-dependent. The procedure is available in tertiary hospitals as requires stroke team with the expertise to use timely imaging and intervention. One study evaluating MT in ACA stroke patients found that while recanalization rates were high, the outcomes were otherwise unsatisfactory. The latter was attributed to larger infarct volumes and longer times to recanalization.[22][23]. New guidelines recommend that in patients with acute ischemic stroke within 6 to 24 hours from last known well and who have large vessel occlusion in anterior circulation, obtaining CTP, DW-MRI, or MRI perfusion is recommended to aid in selection for mechanical thrombectomy. However, this is only with the strict application of imaging or other eligibility criteria from RCTs showing benefit are in selecting patients for MT. The DAWN trial used clinical imaging mismatch (imaging from CTP or DW-MRI and NIHSS scoring) as criteria to select patients with anterior circulation LVO for MT between 6 and 24 hours from last known well. The trial demonstrated an overall functional benefit at 90 days in the treatment group (mRS score 0 to 2, 49% versus 13%, adjusted difference 33%, 95% CI, 21 to 44; a probability of superiority greater than 0.999). The DEFUSE 3 trial used perfusion core mismatch and maximum core size as criteria in selecting the patient for MT with LVO in anterior circulation 6 to 16 hours from last time seen normal. This trial also showed outcome benefit at 90 days in the treated group (mRS score 0 to 2, 44.6% vs. 16.7%, RR 2.67, 95% CI, 1.60 to 4.48, p greater than 0.0001). DAWN and DEFUSE 3 are the only trials showing a benefit of mechanical thrombectomy greater than 6 hours from symptoms onset. Only criteria from these trials should be viable for patient selection who might benefit from MT.[21] One should be aware that most of the patients involved in DAWN and DEFUSE 3 trials had middle cerebral artery occlusions. Beyond the acute management of stroke, the use of antihypertensives, dual antiplatelet therapy, anticoagulants, carotid endarterectomy should be used to prevent recurrent events. Antiplatelet therapy or anticoagulants are not recommended within 24h after alteplase administration. Aspirin is not a recommendation as a substitute for other interventions for acute stroke. Administration of glycoprotein IIb/IIIa receptor inhibitor is not recommended, and a recent Cochrane review showed that these agents correlated with a high risk of intracranial hemorrhage. Dual antiplatelet therapy (aspirin and clopidogrel) are recommended to start within 24 hours for 21 days in patients with minor stroke for early secondary stroke prevention. The CHANCE trial showed that the primary outcome of recurrent stroke at 90 days favored dual antiplatelet therapy over Aspirin alone (HR 0.68; 95% CI, 0.57 to 0.81, p<0.0001). Ticagrelor over aspirin in acute stroke treatment is not recommended. According to SOCRATES trial with the primary outcome of time to the composite endpoint of stroke, MI or death up to 90 days, ticagrelor was not found to be superior to aspirin (HR 0.89, 95% CI, 0.78-1.01; p=0.07). However, ticagrelor is a reasonable alternative in patients with contraindication to aspirin. The efficacy of tirofiban and eptifibatide is currently unknown.[21][20] Optimization of risk factors is essential for secondary prevention of stroke in order to improve outcomes from the principal event.[21] ==References== 1\\\\.

The land for the schoolhouse was given from the farm of Albert Fike, but the building in the National Register of Historic Places is not the first schoolhouse built on the property. An original, likely wooden, schoolhouse could have existed on the property as early as 1850, the year the Union School plan was adopted by Ashland County.Duff, W. A. (1915).

Described as “unusually ornate” for a one-room school house, it features a three-staged bell tower with archways on bottom and a roof shaped like a pyramid. It has an addition on the back and electricity, but it still does not have indoor plumbing. The original bell is missing. The 1938–39 school year was the last time students were taught in the Anderson Schoolhouse because the school consolidated into Ashland City School District. Hilda Carpenter, who taught grades 1–4, was the last teacher in this school. Glenn Messner also taught grades 5-8 that year but in a different building. L. L. Garber, an English professor at Ashland College purchased the building in 1941 for $75.00. On September 15, 1946, he sold it to the Anderson Community Club, Inc. for $200.00. It was used for its club meetings and sometimes by some 4-H clubs and was available for rental. Ruth Emmons purchased the building from the Anderson Community Club and ran her business, Thymes Past, from it until 2014. Two Ashland University education professors, Dr. Jason Ellis and Dr. Carla Abreu-Ellis, purchased the house from Emmons in September 2014. The restored, one-room school now serves as a museum, “providing immersive living history experiences to children of all ages.” Field trips allow school children, who are encouraged to wear period clothing, to reenact a nineteenth-century school day. == References External links== *School website Category:School buildings on the National Register of Historic Places in Ohio Category:Buildings and structures in Ashland County, Ohio Category:National Register of Historic Places in Ashland County, Ohio Category:Schoolhouses in the United States ","title":"Anderson Schoolhouse"},{"id":"12391734","text":"Judge William Shaw Anderson House is a building in Austintown, Ohio, listed in the National Register of Historic Places on 1976-03-17. It is also known as the \\"Strock Stone House.\\"http://austintownhistoricalsociety.com/index.php == Historic uses == *Single Dwelling History of the Strock Stone house 1831 to 1890 The Judge William Shaw Anderson house, also known as the Strock Stone House, was built in 1831 of huge blocks of sandstone, some weighing as much as 750 pounds, quarried from Stony Ridge on South Turner Road in Austintown. The 1921 publication, History of Youngstown and the Mahoning Valley, says the Strock Stone house was built in 1830 by William McClure. However, the first residents were William Strock and his family. Strock was born June 12, 1801 to Joseph Strock and Betsy Bensinger Strock in Tyrone Township, Pennsylvania. Strock's entire family migrated to Austintown in 1813 or 1815. The Strocks settled in the southern part of Austintown township near the Smiths Corner area. William became a carpenter and married Lydia Crum. The couple had three children, two of whom died as infants. In 1830, Strock bought of land in Great Lot 8, Township 2, Range 3 of the Western Reserve from John Jordan and had McClure build the house there. In 1851, Strock sold the house and the accompanying to Francis Henry. Henry was active in the Restoration (reformed Baptist) movement. The Strock Stone house was reputedly a stop on the Underground Railroad that smuggled fugitive slaves to safety in Canada. This claim has yet to be proven, but some evidence appears to support it. Austintown was listed in Galbreath's History of Ohio as part of the path of the Underground Railroad that included \\"Salineville, New Lisbon, Canfield, Austintown, Edinburgh, Warren, Bloomfield, Rome, Lenox, Austinburg, Ashtabula Harbor.\\" William Strock's brother, John Henry Strock, was described as one of the first abolitionists in Mahoning County. Additionally, Francis Henry appears on William Seibert's 1898 list of known underground railroad operators in Mahoning County. Finally, Heffelfinger's unpublished History of Meander says that slaves were hidden in a tunnel that connected the house basement with the barn. Henry lived in the Strock Stone house with his wife, Mary, and their four children. . In 1863, Henry sold the Strock Stone house to David Anderson. Anderson was a native of Derry, Northern Ireland who immigrated to Philadelphia in 1831 or 1832. According to the History of Youngstown and the Mahoning Valley, Anderson worked setting curbstones for five years in Philadelphia. While in Philadelphia, he met Jonathan Wick who brought him to Brookfield area in 1839. Anderson and Wick eventually opened a store, Anderson and Wick, in Austintown. In 1843, Anderson opened a general store in Jackson Township, which he operated for 37 years. The 1870 census listed David Anderson as the wealthiest man in Austintown Township with a real estate value of $42,000 and a personal estate value of $24,570. Anderson and his wife, Hannah L. Shaw Anderson, had four children including William Shaw Anderson, David Fitch Anderson, Julia E. Anderson, and Margaret J. \\"Maggie\\" Anderson. After Hannah died of an accidental fall in 1879, Anderson reportedly let the Strock Stone house fall into disrepair. Donald Heffelfinger's unpublished History of the Meander says that Anderson moved to a nearby frame house that was built during the American Civil War. The Strock Stone house became an animal shelter. 1890 to present In 1890, David Anderson's oldest son, William Shaw Anderson, acquired the property from his father. The younger Anderson originally used the Strock Stone house as a summer home. Anderson, who lived in the house from 1890–1925, was a prominent lawyer and judge in the Youngstown Court of Common Pleas. Anderson reportedly entertained President William McKinley at the house. Anderson and his wife, Louise Shields Anderson, had four children: Blanche Anderson, William Noble Anderson, Randall H. Anderson, and Anna Anderson. Anderson restored the house and expanded it between 1912 and 1918. This addition included the sun porch, dining room, and dinette on first floor, three bedrooms and a bath on the second floor, and an enlarged cellar. Anderson also added central heat. Other buildings on the property at this time included three barns, a pump house, a poultry house, a bull barn, a log house, a milk house, an ice house, a tool house, a tool shop and a corn crib. Anderson's children, Randall H. and Blanche Anderson, acquired the Strock Stone house upon their father's death in 1925.

Dictionary of Ohio Historic Places. Vol. 2. St. Clair Shores: Somerset, 1999, 1211-1212. The oldest (rear) part of the house was built in 1826; its first resident appears to have been William Robinson (1764 - 1834), who participated in the first settlement of Ross County in 1795. William was a participant of the last deadly conflict between whites and Native Americans in Ross County while surveying the Indian homeland under the current treaty for future white development with the hope that the Natives would give up their land. The survey party was caught attempting to steal the Natives' horses and the ensuing battle killed William's half-brother Joshua (1769 - 1795) and some of the natives but resulted in the successful theft of all of the Natives' property. (ref.

Martzolff, pages 199 - 200) After a new treaty was made he bought approximately of land surrounding the present house and built a log cabin on the property, becoming Union Township's first settler. The property was purchased by Levi Anderson (1790 - 1846) in 1838, who arranged for the expansion of the house and the embellishment of its interior. Responsible for the interior improvements was Levi's brother Gershon Anderson (1780 - 1842); he crafted detailed woodworking, which remains to the present day. The house itself is a brick structure, covered with weatherboarding; it rests on a foundation of sandstone and is ornamented by elements of wood and stone. Many original elements of the house survive, qualifying it for inclusion on the National Register of Historic Places because of its well-preserved historic architecture. It was added to the Register in late 1976, both because of its architecture and because of its place in local exploration and settlement., Ohio Historical Society, 2007.

It was built in 1796, and originally operated by two brothers, Issacher and Mahlon Schofield. It was given the name \\"Adelphi\\" after the original land patent title.

In the early 1920s, it became part of the Langley Park estate of Leander McCormick-Goodhart. In 1950, Mr. McCormick-Goodhart transferred the mill and surrounding to the Maryland- National Capital Park and Planning Commission (M-NCPPC).

They were the college's three original buildings, and were listed together on the National Register of Historic Places listings in Greene County, Ohio in 1975. ==History== Antioch Hall Antioch Hall was constructed in the 1852–53 timeframe by architect Alpheus Marshall Merrifield. It combines elements of Romanesque, Greek Revival and Gothic architectural styles, the latter being most noticeable in its towers. It underwent a massive renovation from 1958 to 1962. This included the inset of a concrete structure inside the original building which stabilized it and insulated its interior against weather and degradation. The renovation also created four floors, instead of the previous three, and relocated its entrance from the east side to the west side. Antioch Hall was closed along with the College in June 2008; however, while the College reopened, Antioch Hall did not. Lack of heating led to plumbing failures and flooding in February of 2009. Some restoration has been done, the largest from a $500,000 directed grant from Yellow Springs Community Foundation in 2019, intended to tackle projects of immediate need such as reintroducing heating. But considerable additional funding is needed to bring the building back online, with estimates ranging from $7.5 million to $20 million. North Hall North Hall is an operational residence hall. Its first residents were the entering class of 1853. In 2011 it underwent a $5.7 million renovation effort to combine both comfortable and sustainable living, and reopened in 2012. The renovation project achieved a LEED energy-efficiency Gold Level Certification on July 26, 2013, and was the oldest building in the country to obtain such a rating, taking the title from the U.S. Treasury Building. The project included solar panels on the building’s roof, and twenty-five 600'-deep geothermal wells for heating and cooling. South Hall South Hall was also shuttered in 2008, and experienced flooding after the closure. However, alumni and villagers helped push an environmental cleanup effort to dry it out. It reopened after some exterior renovations in January of 2010. It is the location of college offices, as well as Herndon Gallery, which is used for exhibitions and academic conferences. == See also == * Horace Mann == References == Category:National Register of Historic Places in Greene County, Ohio Category:School buildings completed in 1852 Category:Buildings and structures in Greene County, Ohio Category:Antioch College Category:1852 establishments in Ohio ","title":"Antioch Hall, North and South Halls"},{"id":"12391835","text":"Antlers Hotel is a historic hotel building in Lorain, Ohio, it was listed on the National Register of Historic Places November 30, 1982. ==Building== The building sits on the southwest corner of Washington Avenue and West Erie Avenue overlooking a small city park.

A front porch is partially enclosed by bays projecting from each end of the facade. The porch features balusters and classic detailing which is also present around the windows. The 80 room hotel includes a large auditorium, lobby, restaurant space, kitchen, bar and laundry facilities.

The play is set in the ancient city of Ujjayini during the reign of the King Pālaka, near the end of the Pradyota dynasty that made up the first quarter of the fifth century BCE. The central story is that of a noble but impoverished young Brahmin, , who falls in love with a wealthy courtesan or nagarvadhu, . Despite their mutual affection, however, the couple's lives and love are threatened when a vulgar courtier, Samsthānaka, also known as Shakara, begins to aggressively pursue Vasantasenā. Rife with romance, comedy, intrigue and a political subplot detailing the overthrow of the city's despotic ruler by a shepherd, the play is notable among extant Sanskrit drama for its focus on a fictional scenario rather than on a classical tale or legend. Mṛcchakaṭika also departs from traditions enumerated in the Natya Shastra that specify that dramas should focus on the lives of the nobility and instead incorporates many peasant characters who speak a wide range of Prakrit dialects. The story is thought to be derived from an earlier work called Cārudatta in Poverty by the playwright Bhāsa, though that work survives only in fragments. Of all the Sanskrit dramas, Mṛcchakaṭika remains one of the most widely celebrated and oft- performed in the West. The work played a significant role in generating interest in Indian theatre among European audiences following several successful nineteenth century translations and stage productions, most notably Gérard de Nerval and Joseph Méry's highly romanticised French adaptation titled Le Chariot d'enfant that premiered in Paris in 1850, as well as a critically acclaimed \\"anarchist\\" interpretation by Victor Barrucand called Le Chariot de terre cuite that was produced by the Théâtre de l'Œuvre in 1895. Unlike other classical plays in Sanskrit, the play does not borrow from epics or mythology. The characters of Śūdraka are drawn from the mundane world. It is peopled with gamblers, courtesans, thieves, and so on. The protagonist of the play, Cārudatta, does not belong to the noble class or royal lineage. Though Vasantasenā is a courtesan, her exemplary attitude and dignified behavior impress the audience. The nobility of the characters does not stem from their social conditioning but from their virtues and behaviour. ==Plot summary== Cārudatta is a generous young man who, through his charitable contributions to unlucky friends and the general public welfare, has severely impoverished himself and his family. Though deserted by most of his friends and embarrassed by deteriorating living conditions, he has maintained his reputation in Ujjayini as an honest and upright man with a rare gift of wisdom and many important men continue to seek his counsel. Though happily married and the recent father of a young son, Rohasena, Cārudatta is enamored of Vasantasenā, a courtesan of great wealth and reputation. At a chance encounter at the temple of Kāma she returns his affection, though the matter is complicated when Vasantasenā finds herself pursued by Samsthānaka, a half-mad brother-in-law of King Pālaka, and his retinue. When the men threaten violence, Vasantasenā flees, seeking safety with Cārudatta. Their love blossoms following the clandestine meeting, and the courtesan entrusts her new lover with a casket of jewelry in an attempt to ensure a future meeting. Her plan is thwarted, however, when a thief, Sarvilaka, enters Cārudatta’s home and steals the jewels in an elaborate scheme to buy the freedom of his lover, Madanikā, who is Vasantasenā’s slave and confidant. The courtesan recognizes the jewelry, but she accepts the payment anyway and frees Madanikā to marry. She then attempts to contact Cārudatta and inform him of the situation, but before she can make contact he panics and sends Vasantasenā a rare pearl necklace that had belonged to his wife, a gift in great excess of the value of the stolen jewelry. In recognition of this, Cārudatta's friend, Maitreya, cautions the Brahmin against further association, fearing that Vasantasenā is, at worst, scheming to take from Cārudatta the few possessions he still has and, at best, a good-intentioned bastion of bad luck and disaster. Refusing to take this advice, Cārudatta makes Vasantasenā his mistress and she eventually meets his young son. During the encounter, the boy is distressed because he has recently enjoyed playing with a friend's toy cart of solid gold and no longer wants his own clay cart that his nurse has made for him. Taking pity on him in his sadness, Vasantasenā fills his little clay cart with her own jewelry, heaping his humble toy with a mound of gold before departing to meet Cārudatta in a park outside the city for a day’s outing. There she enters a fine carriage, but soon discovers that she is in a gharry belonging to Samsthānaka, who remains enraged by her previous affront and is madly jealous of the love and favor she shows to Cārudatta. Unable to persuade his henchmen to kill her, Samsthānaka sends his retinue away and proceeds to strangle Vasantasenā and hide her body beneath a pile of leaves. Still seeking vengeance, he promptly accuses Cārudatta of the crime. Though Cārudatta proclaims his innocence, his presence in the park along with his son's possession of Vasantasenā's jewels implicate the poverty-stricken man, and he is found guilty and condemned to death by King Pālaka. Unbeknownst to all, however, the body identified as Vasantasenā’s was actually another woman. Vasantasenā had been revived and befriended by a Buddhist monk who nursed her back to health in a nearby village. Just as Cārudatta faces execution, Vasantasenā appears and, seeing the excited crowd, intervenes in time to save him from execution and his wife from throwing herself onto the funeral pyre. Together the three declare themselves a family. Reaching the courts, Vasantasenā tells the story of her near death and, following her testimony, Samsthānaka is arrested and the good Prince Āryaka deposes the wicked King Pālaka. His first acts as the newly declared sovereign is to restore Cārudatta’s fortune and give him an important position at court. Following this good will, Cārudatta demonstrates in the final act his enduring virtue and charity, appealing to the King for pardon on behalf of Samsthānaka who is subsequently declared free. ==Characters== * Cārudatta, an impoverished young Brahmin * Vasantasenā, a courtesan in love with Cārudatta * Maitreya, a poor Brahmin, Cārudatta’s friend * Vardhamānaka, a servant in Cārudatta's house * Radanikā, a maid in Cārudatta's house * Dhuta, wife of Cārudatta * Rohasena, Cārudatta's son * Viṭa, a courtier in service of Vasantasenā * Madanikā, Vasantasenā’s maidservant and confidant * Mother of Vasantasenā * Karnapūraka and Kumbhīlaka, Vasantasenā's servants * Bastard pages in Vasantasenā's house * King Pālaka * Samsthānaka, Brother to one of the King's concubines also called sakaara * Vita, a courtier in service of Samsthānaka * Sthāvaraka, Samsthānaka's servant * Āryaka, a herdsman and prince in exile who becomes king * Sarvilaka, a Brahmin who became a thief to free his love Madanikā * Māthura, a gambling-master * Darduraka, a gambler, friend to Sarvilaka * Vīraka and Chandanaka, captains of the civil guard, friends to Sarvilaka * Gōha and Ahīnta, executioners * Former masseur of Cārudatta who becomes a Buddhist monk * Judge * Scribe * Citizens, slaves, and attendants ==Media== * Play adaptions: The play was translated into English, notably by Arthur W.

Its roof features a distinctively large overhang.Owen, Lorrie K., ed. Dictionary of Ohio Historic Places. Vol. 2. St. Clair Shores: Somerset, 1999, 1133. When the depot was built, Antwerp was the largest community in Paulding County, due to an active logging industry. Accordingly, the depot was built to be larger than most train stations in small northwestern Ohio communities. Inside, the station is divided into several distinct areas: freight, ordinary passengers, mail and express packaging, and internal railroad offices; each possess their own rooms. Other than its size, the depot is typical of late nineteenth- century train stations in northwestern Ohio, which frequently served as commercial hubs for their communities. After the station closed in 1976, the Antwerp Historical Society purchased it from the Norfolk and Western Railway; having no use for the station, the railroad asked the society to relocate it, and the depot was moved to its present location, approximately to the west of its original site. Four years later, the depot was listed on the National Register of Historic Places as the Antwerp Norfolk and Western Depot, both because of its distinctive architecture and because of its significance in local history. This designation is unusual, for buildings that have been moved from their original locations are not normally eligible for inclusion on the National Register.National Register Criteria for Evaluation, National Park Service.

Composed of houses constructed around the turn of the twentieth century, it has been one of the neighborhood's most important streets since it was established, and it was designated a historic district in 1987. When South Brooklyn was first platted, Archwood Avenue was included as one of the village's side streets. Lots along Archwood were larger than those along other streets, and the street itself was atypically wide, so the village's largest original houses were built along the street. Although South Brooklyn was annexed as Cleveland's Old Brooklyn neighborhood in 1894, Archwood retained its significant place in the neighborhood. The street's built environment is variable: late nineteenth- century styles such as Colonial Revival, Italianate, and Queen Anne are all found in the district.Owen, Lorrie K., ed.

The Congregational Church of Brooklyn was founded in 1819. It was affiliated with both the Congregational church movement and the Presbyterian Church in the United States of America. In 1867, the congregation had grown large enough to no longer need the support of the Presbyterian diocese, and it affiliated fully with the Congregationalists.; The congregation's first permanent place of worship was a wood frame structure built about 1830 near the intersection of Pearl Road and Willowdale Avenue. It was moved to the intersection of Liberty Street (now W. 33rd Street) and Newburgh Road (now Denison Avenue) in 1851. In 1879, the congregation constructed a brick church in the Late Gothic Revival style at the intersection of Greenwood Avenue (now Archwood Avenue) and Pearl Street (2794 Greenwood Avenue). By 1925 the congregation had grown so much that the 1,100 members approved construction of a new church building. The new building, erected at 2800 Archwood Avenue next to the existing structure, was designed by local architect Daniel Farnham in the Colonial Revival style. It was completed in 1929.

He had performed Ashvamedha (horse sacrifice) ritual to prove his superiority, and immolated himself at the age of 110 years, after crowning his son as the new king. The prologue describes him as a distinguished wise man, who had gained knowledge of the Rigveda, the Samaveda, mathematics, the Kamashastra and the art of training elephants. No historical records mention a king by the name Shudraka (which literally means \\"little servant\\"). The first four acts of Mrichchhakatika are virtually a copy of the corresponding acts from Bhasa's unfinished play Charudattam. One theory is that the poet of Mrichchhakatika simply finished Bhasa's play out of respect, styling himself as the \\"little servant\\" of Bhasa. A fourteenth century text attributes Mrichchhakatika to a duo, Bhartrimentha and Vikramaditya. The Mrichchhakatika is set in Ujjain. It is known that an Ujjain-based poet by the name Bhartrimentha was a contemporary of Kalidasa; the legendary king Vikramaditya also lived in Ujjain. However, identifying these two as the authors of Mrichchhakatika is chronologically impossible. According to Farley P. Richmond, Shudraka was simply a mythical figure, and the authorship of the play is uncertain. Others have identified Shudraka as the pen name of an Abhira king from the third century CE, either Indranigupta, or Shivadatta, father of Ishvarasena. citing ==See also== *Sanskrit drama ==Notes References == * Ryder, Arthur William.

This very diverse \\"species\\" with its numerous subspecies and morphs has since long posed a taxonomic problem, and recent research suggests it is a cryptic species complex that has now been split into several species.Harris & Franklin (2000), Nguembock et al. (2008) == Description == The tropical boubou is fairly large for its family (bushshrikes), measuring 23–25 cm in length. Its weight can vary between about 38-70 g, but typically adults weigh between 50 and 60 g. Females are on average a bit smaller than males, but individual variation is so large that for most practical purposes the sexes seem to be of identical size. The wing measures about 98 mm on average (between 85 and 110), the tail is a mere two millimetres longer both on average and as regards variation. The tarsus is c.29–37 mm long, 33 mm on average, while the bill's exposed culmen measures a little over 20 mm in some populations and as much as 25 mm in others. Unlike the other measurements where there is mostly individual variation, the bill length might distinctly vary between subspecies.Harris & Franklin (2000) Not only are males and females the same size, they have identical plumage too. The adults' upper parts and tail are glossy blue-black except for concealed white spots on the rump, visible only when the wings are spread and the rump feathers are erected. The underparts are white, in some populations with a buffy or pinkish tinge on the breast and flanks, which is not always noticeable except in good light. The wings of most subspecies have a white stripe on the wing coverts, in some extending onto the secondary remiges. The tips of the outer tail feathers can be white in some subspecies. The bill is black, the legs and feet bluish grey. The irides are dark reddish brown. Nestlings have pinkish-brown skin and are nude after hatching, later growing sparse down; they apparently have spots inside their bills which they show their parents to get fed. Fledglings are similar to adults but duller, with the brownish head and the upper parts appearing mottled due to yellowish-ochre to tawny feather tips, forming a barring on the lower back and rump. The wing- stripe, if present, is dulled down. The undertail coverts are buff, and there is usually dusky barring on the dull white underside, especially on the flanks. The bill is greyish brown above, paler below. Immature birds independent from their parents have lost most of the mottling (except on the wing coverts) and barring, but their wing stripe and underside are still dull white, shading to brown on the flanks; any white tail feather tips appear at this stage. The northwesternmost populations of major might be confused with Turati's boubou (L. turatii), which has no white wing-band and a buff chin and white belly, while major around the southern edge of the Congo Basin look almost identical to the swamp boubou (L. bicolor), but this is pure white below and its females give a characteristic \\"ratchet\\" call in duets. Southeastern birds (mossambicus and especially limpopoensis) resemble the southern boubou (L. ferrugineus) but are black above instead of dark brown and grey - though this may be hard to see at a distance and entirely indistinguishable in the occasionally seen hybrid. When the tropical boubou is sympatric with other Laniarius, they are rarely found in the same habitat. Voice This species is heard more often than seen, but its calls often help to locate it visually. To vocalize they move higher off the ground than during their usual activities, and may perch on an exposed site. They also nod their head and bow their body when calling, making them even conspicuous sometimes. Calls like ' or ' give the bird its name; they may be extended into a bubbling ' and are given loudly and higher-pitched to announce the birds' presence, or lower and softer by foraging groups to maintain contact. Like many bush-shrikes, it has a wide vocal repertoire that includes duets in which two individuals - a male-female pair or two males with adjacent territories - give notes alternately in so rapid a sequence that they sound like one bird. As the voicebox of birds is a syrinx not a larynx, in particular many Passeri can sing in two voices at the same time; tropical boubous that have lost their mate can make the same sequence that a pair would make. Males probably start most duets, and their notes are mostly low-pitched whistles and/or harsh croaks; females' notes are typically higher whistles and/or \\"harsh tearing or rattling sounds\\". But although the birds' vocalizations are somewhat harsh, they are still able of a wide range of frequencies and males provide the higher voice in certain duets.Harris & Franklin (2000), Grafe & Bitz (2004) Duets usually consist of one exchange, two or three calls in total. But up to seven exchanges have been recorded. A duet may be repeated up to 75 times, and in experiments where the birds were confronted with taped vocalizations, they could be enticed to up to 200 duets. A dozen or more duet types exist, and some seem to confer specific information, forming a Morse code-like sort of language. Examples of typical duet sequences include ' and '. During territorial contests of subspecies major, a wide range of duet types is sung, in particular 1–3 and 9–11. Playback of duet types 1, 2, 9 and perhaps 6 elicits duets of the same type, as well as of others; types 2 and 6 are typically also answered with types 9 and 11, and type 9 with type 3 and perhaps 11. Duet type 5 of major consists of one to several dozen (typically about 3) short call notes given simultaneously by territorial pairs. Its loud male calls are at about 1.4 kHz, 0.4 seconds and downslurred, while the female calls increase in frequency between 900–1,000 hertz, are less than half as long, and begin about halfway through the males' calls. After a pair has prevailed in a song contest with an intruder, the birds quieten down for some time and ascertain that the contestant has called it quits; then, they usually move to a prominent perch, the male at the very top with his mate below, and sing duet type 5. This vocalization might be considered a sort of \\"victory chant\\", conferring information about the events to neighboring pairs.Grafe & Bitz (2004) Northern birds typically give resonant ' or ' whistles, variously short or drawn-out. Among southern birds, grating ' and ' calls, snoring ' croaks and rattling ' are more common. Other harsh calls, like a metallic ' or ' are given by the male in aggression and courtship; eastern birds may also give call ' at the end of a courtship display. Alarm calls are a variety of chattering outbursts; before roosting, birds often make a series of ' calls, and they also give a call when the parents change to brood the eggs or young. During social interactions, the wings are often forcefully shaken, producing a ripping mechanical sound.Traylor & Parelius (1967), Harris & Franklin (2000) This species may duet with the slate-colored boubou (L. funebris). Trios are common, especially young birds learning to sing tend to join in when a pair duets. Nestlings that want to be fed give high repeated chirps, as usual among passerines. ==Taxonomy and systematics== L. m. ambiguus Soysambu Conservancy, Kenya Traditionally, seven subspecies of the tropical boubou were recognized - that is, if L. aethiopicus was considered a distinct species at all. As late as the mid-20th century for example, some authors included the entire tropical boubou complex within L. ferrugineus, which nowadays refers to the southern boubou only. Recent cladistic analysis of nDNA BRM15 intron-15 and mtDNA NADH dehydrogenase subunit 2 and ATP synthase F0 subunit 6 sequence data indicates that the tropical boubou was traditionally recognized is a polyphyletic cryptic species complex, and that three additional species have been recognized, the Ethiopian boubou, the black boubou, and the East Coast boubou. Contrary to what one might expect in a purely phenetic analysis, the conspicuous variation of wing stripes is no good indicator of relationships among these and related boubous. Vocalizations and habitat preferences, on the other hand, allow a good delimitation of the clades conventionally grouped as tropical boubou. The four proposed species are: * Black boubou, L. nigerrimus - S Somalia. Includes L. liberatus :Outer tail feathers never have white tips. Short wings stripe across the median coverts. Breast and belly pinkish. The liberatus morph has long white wing stripe like aethiopicus, and a yellowish-buff chin to chest and supercilium. ::A quite ancient lineage, part of a rather basal group of mostly allopatric relict forms - the dark-bellied mountain sooty boubou (L. poensis), Fuelleborn's boubou (L. fuelleborni) and perhaps slate-colored boubou (L. funebris), and the sympatric light-bellied red-naped boubou (L. ruficeps) to which it might be closest. The western members of this group inhabit montane forest, the others dry shrubland. The liberatus morph may be an atavism of plesiomorphic alleles retained from a common ancestor with L. ruficeps, as the type specimen showed no indication of recent hybridization whatsoever. :::Many taxonomists now consider it to be a distinct species * East Coast boubou or dimorphic boubou, L. sublacteus - Coastal Kenya, Zanzibar :Vestigial or no white wing stripe. Outer tail feathers may have white tips. Juveniles have no barring on underside. An all-black morph occurs in the area around the lower Jubba and Tana Rivers and on the Lamu Archipelago. * Ethiopian boubou, L. aethiopicus - E Sudan through Djibouti, Eritrea, Ethiopia and W Somalia to N Kenya :Breast and belly pinkish. Narrow wing stripe, extending across the median and larger wing coverts, and often a bit onto the secondary remiges. Outer tail feathers never have white tips. Laniarius m. mossambicus in Malawi Current subspecies of the tropical boubou now include: * West African boubou (tropical boubou in the strict sense), L. major - Sierra Leone east to Sudan, then south to the Great Lakes region, from there excluding the inner Congo basin southwest to the Scarp of Angola. Intergrades with mossambicus in the southeastern Congo Basin. Possibly hybridizes with swamp boubou (L. bicolor) in the Angola region. ** L. m. ambiguus - highlands of Kenya and NE Tanzania :In major, long narrow wing stripe across the median and larger wing coverts, and usually continuing onto the secondary remiges; breast and belly may be pinkish (particularly in northern birds) or off-white (as in most southern birds). In ambiguus, short wings stripe across the median coverts; breast and belly pinkish. Outer tail feathers may have white tips in both subspecies. * L. \\"m.\\" mossambicus - S DRCongo, S Tanzania, E Zambia, Malawi, E Mozambique, N Zimbabwe.

Hybridizes with southern boubou (L. ferrugineus) in Limpopo valley. :The buffiest of all, without pink tones. Long narrow wing stripe like in major. Outer tail feathers never have white tips. ::These seem to be part of a close-knit and more apomorphic clade of parapatric to sympatric black-and-white (or -buff/-pinkish) boubous which mostly inhabit semihumid lowland habitat. Their relatives are Turati's boubou (L. turatii) and perhaps Luehder's bushshrike (L. luehderi), and the southern and swamp boubous. L. sublacteus seems to form a distinct southern lineage with the last two, but the southernmost tropical boubous are too little studied. It seems certain that they belong to the second group, where they may be a southward extension of L. aethiopicus, but more likely represent the southwestern populations of L. major. The hybridization is liable to confound DNA sequence analyses, particularly of mtDNA. ==Range and ecology== The tropical boubou occurs from about 10° northern latitude south to the Limpopo River in South Africa. In the western part of its range, it is found as a regular breeder from Côte d'Ivoire eastwards to about 5° N; it is not found further south along the Atlantic coast and in the inner Congo Basin, but occurs on the Scarp of Angola. It also does not seem to occur in northern Somalia, eastern Ethiopia and Kenya, and central Tanzania as well as the lower Ruvuma River basin. It is not a migratory bird and only moves around locally. Seasonal movements are known from Kenya. Vagrants have been recorded from Senegal, and records from The Gambia and Liberia probably are also mostly or all stray birds; a supposed vagrant from Bioko is not anymore believed to have been of this species.Harris & Franklin (2000), BLI (2008) It is not found in decidedly arid regions and dense forests such as the equatorial rain forest, but occurs on mountains up to 3,000 m ASL. It requires dense ground cover, and is found in a variety of forest and forest-edge habitats, including savannah, Miombo woodland and village gardens. In the drier parts of its range, it is generally restricted to riparian forest, though the black boubou also utilizes semiarid shrubland. Typical vegetation in its habitat is characterized by such plants as African juniper (Juniperus procera), bracken (Pteridium), Rosoideae shrubs or Brachystegia. The birds defend a breeding territory of 1–3 hectares; outside the breeding season they move about in a larger area (up to 8 hectares) and are more tolerant of conspecifics, sometimes assembling into loose noisy groups. They rarely fly long distances and tend to skulk in the shrubs and low in trees like a coucal (Centropus), or move on the ground interrupted by bouts of watching where they stand alert, with the tail slightly raised. When alarmed, they will make a slow descending flight, flashing their white rump patches and giving warning calls, before taking cover. As usual for passerine birds, they scratch indirectly (foot-over-wing). Allopreening has been recorded between mates. At least southern birds moult their whole plumage after the breeding season. This species is presumably preyed upon by the usual vertebrate predators of mid-sized birds. A ringed individual nine to ten years old was recorded. The tropical boubou may be common locally, with 100 individuals per square kilometer; in other places only one-third this population density is recorded however. Still, it is not an uncommon bird across its breeding range and the IUCN treats it as a species of least concern. When the species is split up, the black boubou and dimorphic boubou, which are found only in a limited area, might warrant uplisting. Food and feeding It usually forages on or near the ground, and does not ascend to the tree canopy often. It holds large prey down with its foot while eating. Like other bushshrikes (and true shrikes, Laniidae), the tropical boubou impales prey on thorns to eat later; it also wedges prey into crevices. The food includes many kinds of large terrestrial invertebrates and their larvae as well as small terrestrial vertebrates, e.g. amphibians, beetles, geckos, lizards, Lepidoptera (moths and butterflies), mantises, Orthoptera (crickets, grasshoppers and locusts), rodents, snakes and termites. It often plunders other birds' nests and occasionally eats snails and fruit. Reproduction This species is monogamous. The tropical boubou, like many tropical birds, does not have a pronounced breeding season. Around the Equator, birds may breed at any time in the year. Further north and south, there is a peak breeding season in late spring and early summer at the start of the wet season, and little to no breeding takes place during late autumn and early winter at the start of the dry season. Courtship starts with the male chasing the female, the two hopping together through branches, and the male bobbing its head, bowing and giving a croaking call or low whistle. It makes gliding or descending display flights with the white rump spots exposed and producing mechanical noises with its remiges. The courtship climaxes with the male - wings drooped, tail fanned and rump feathers puffed up - giving repeated metallic or whistling calls. The couples may duet, but courtship feeding has not been observed. The flimsy cup nest is built by both parents, but the female does more of the work. It consists of twigs, tendrils, small roots and the occasional grass leaf or bark piece, held together with spider web and sometimes lined with finer fibres; the walls are thick - more than one to more than 5 cm - but loosely constructed and the eggs can often be seen from the outside. The nest measures 10 to 20 cm in diameter, with a shallow nest cup around 8 cm in diameter and 2–5 cm deep. It is placed at varying heights, from a few dozen cm above ground in a thicket to more than a dozen meters up in a tree top; typically, however, it is built around 3 m in a bush, a horizontal branch fork, or in vines. Nesting sites are often solitary bushes, which provide cover while allowing the incubating bird to observe the surrounding terrain for threats. The female lays three, sometimes two eggs, which are bluish to buff green with brown and lilac spots and measure around 22–27 by 17–19 mm, or about 25 by 18.3 mm on average. Both parents incubate, but the female does most of the work. The eggs hatch after 14–16 days, and nestlings take again as long to fledge. The parents usually destroy the nest after the young have left it. They continue to feed their offspring for about seven more weeks, after which the young can forage on their own. They stay with their parents for about five months. The black cuckoo (Cuculus clamosus) is a common brood parasite of this boubou, parasitizing about 2 percent of its nests. When tropical boubous spot black cuckoos, they usually try to mob them away and are often successful in this; some pairs, however, seem to be very inept at preventing brood parasitism and may be affected several times per year. ==See also== * Animal communication ==FootnotesReferences== * Grafe, T.

It also guarded the approach to the bridge that connected Anacostia (then known as Uniontown) with Washington. Built in 1861, the fort was expanded throughout the war and was joined by two subsidiary forts: Fort Ricketts and Fort Snyder. Following the surrender of the Army of Northern Virginia, it was dismantled and the land returned to its original owner. It never saw combat. Abandoned after the war, the site of the fort was planned to be part of a grand \\"Fort Circle\\" park system encircling the city of Washington. Though this system of interconnected parks never was fully implemented, the site of the fort is today a park maintained by the National Park Service, and a historical marker stands near the fort's original location.Cultural Tourism DC. \\"Fort Stanton and the Washington Overlook\\" Culturaltourismdc.org. Accessed January 6, 2009. ==Planning and construction== Following the secession of Virginia and that state joining the Confederacy, Federal troops marched from Washington into the Arlington region of northern Virginia. The move was intended to forestall any attempt by Virginia militia or Confederate soldiers to seize the capital city of the United States. Over the next seven weeks, forts were constructed along the banks of the Potomac River and at the approaches to each of the three major bridges (Chain Bridge, Long Bridge, and Aqueduct Bridge) connecting Virginia to Washington and Georgetown.J.G. Barnard and W.F. Barry, \\"Report of the Engineer and Artillery Operations of the Army of the Potomac from Its Organization to the Close of the Peninsular Campaign,\\" (New York: D. Van Nostrand, 1863), pp. 9–10. While the Potomac River forts were being built, planning and surveying was ordered for an enormous new ring of forts to protect the city. Unlike the fortifications under construction, the new forts would defend the city in all directions, not just the most direct route through Arlington. In mid-July, this work was interrupted by the First Battle of Bull Run. As the Army of Northeastern Virginia marched south to Manassas, the soldiers previously assigned to construction duties marched instead to battle. In the days that followed the Union defeat at Bull Run, panicked efforts were made to defend Washington from what was perceived as an imminent Confederate attack.Margaret Leech, Reveille in Washington (New York: Harper & Brothers Publishers, 1941), pp. 101–110. The makeshift trenches and earthworks that resulted were largely confined to Arlington and the direct approaches to Washington. On July 26, 1861, five days after the battle, Maj. Gen. George B. McClellan was named commander of the military district of Washington and the subsequently renamed Army of the Potomac. Upon arriving in Washington, McClellan was appalled by the condition of the city's defenses. \\"In no quarter were the dispositions for defense such as to offer a vigorous resistance to a respectable body of the enemy, either in the position and numbers of the troops or the number and character of the defensive works... not a single defensive work had been commenced on the Maryland side. There was nothing to prevent the enemy shelling the city from heights within easy range, which could be occupied by a hostile column almost without resistance.\\"U.S., War Department, The War of the Rebellion: A Compilation of the Official Records of the Union and Confederate Armies, 70 Volumes (Washington, DC: The Government Printing Office, 1880–1901) I, Volume 5, p. 11. To remedy the situation, one of McClellan's first orders upon taking command was to greatly expand the defenses of Washington. At all points of the compass, forts and entrenchments would be constructed in sufficient strength to defeat any attack. One area of particular concern was the region of Maryland south of the Anacostia River. Confederate artillery floated across the Potomac in secret and mounted south of the river could threaten the Washington Navy Yard and Washington Arsenal, both of which lay at the junction of the Potomac and Anacostia Rivers. This map shows the location of Fort Stanton, the site of which is highlighted. To the north is the city of Washington, D.C. and the suburb of Uniontown, today known as Anacostia. To the east (not shown) are Forts Snyder and Ricketts. To prevent that threat from coming to pass, Brig. Gen. John G. Barnard, chief engineer of the defenses of Washington, directed that a line of forts be constructed on the heights southeast of the Anacostia River. From Fort Greble at the western end to Fort Mahan at the eastern end, the forts along the Eastern Branch River (as the Anacostia was then known) were not intended to constitute a continuous defensive line as was the Arlington Line that defended the Virginia approaches to the city. Instead, they were merely intended to deny Confederate artillery the position and to provide warning of any sneak attack upon Washington from the southeast. General Barnard illustrated this in an October 1862 report, saying, \\"As the enemy cannot enter the city from this direction, the object of the works is to prevent him seizing these heights, and occupying them long enough to shell the navy-yard and arsenal. For this, the works must be made secure against assault, and auxiliary to this object is the construction of roads by which succor can be readily thrown to any point menaced.\\"Official Records I, 19, Part 2 (serial 28), pp. 391–93 Fort Stanton, located in the Garfield Heights, was the first fort of this line to begin construction. Begun in September 1861, the fort was located almost directly south of the Washington Navy Yard and the Navy Yard Bridge that crossed the Anacostia River and connected Uniontown, a suburb of Washington, with the city itself. Work progressed rapidly, and by Christmas, a report by General Barnard indicated the fort was \\"completed and armed.\\"Official Records I, Volume 5, 11, pp. 678–84 Despite that speed, not everything went in the engineers' favor. Barnard's report indicates \\"the sites of Fort... Stanton and others were entirely wooded, which, in conjunction with the broken character of the ground, has made the selection of sites frequently very embarrassing and the labor of preparing them very great.\\"Official Records I, Volume 5, 11, p. 681 The experience of surveying and preparing the site of Fort Stanton would serve the engineers well in the construction of future forts around Washington and in service to the Army of the Potomac. Clearing brush and forest away from the site of Fort Stanton allowed for clear fields of fire for the fort's cannon for several hundred yards in each direction, a technique that would be applied (and later used) to great effect at Fort Stevens. ==Wartime operation== By the summer of 1862, the fort was already being heavily used. A garrison had been assigned in the winter, and the 1862 report of the Commission to Study the Defenses of Washington describes Fort Stanton as \\"a work of considerable dimensions, well built, and tolerably well armed. Casemates for reversed fires are recommended in northwest and southwest counterscarp angles, and platforms for two or three rifled guns on the east front. The deep ravine which flanks this work on two sides requires some additional precaution, and further study of it is recommended.\\"Official Records I, 21 (serial. 31), pp. 915–16 The commission had been ordered by Secretary of War Edwin M. Stanton to inspect each of the forts surrounding Washington in late 1862 and make a report on the deficiencies of each. In addition to examining Fort Stanton, the commission analyzed two smaller works that supported Fort Stanton. Fort Ricketts was identified in the report as \\"a battery intended to see the ravine in front of Fort Stanton, which it does but imperfectly,\\" while Fort Snyder \\"may be regarded as an outwork to Fort Stanton, guarding the head of one branch of the ravine just mentioned. Except additional platforms for field guns, and a ditch in front of the gorge stockade, and blockhouses, nothing further seems necessary.\\"Official Records I, 21 (serial. 31), p. 915 To support Fort Stanton and its two subsidiary positions, a military road was constructed from Uniontown to the fort. Tributary roads led from Fort Stanton to the other forts in the Eastern Branch line. These roads were eventually widened into a large ring road that circled most of the 37-mile perimeter of Washington, a fact that can be noted in the 1865 mapEngineer Bureau, War Department. \\"Military Map of NE Virginia and the Washington Defenses\\", Library of Congress Department of Maps. Republished on Wikipedia. Accessed January 6, 2009. of the city's defenses. In fall 1862, however, the commission examining the defenses noted that \\"the work on roads about Washington requires ten regiments for twenty days ... or an equivalent of labor in some other shape.\\"Official Records I, 21 (serial. 31), 916 An 1864 inspection by Brig. Gen. Albion P. Howe, Inspector-General of Artillery, found Fort Stanton to be well-equipped, but the garrison poorly trained. The fort was armed with six 32-pounder barbettes, three 24-pounder field howitzers, four 8-inch siege howitzers, one Coehorn mortar, and one 4-inch rifled mortar. The ammunition was listed as \\"complete and servicible,\\" but the 131 men of a single company of the Heavy Massachusetts Volunteer Artillery that comprised the garrison at the time were \\"not drilled in artillery; some in infantry.\\"Official Records I, 26, Part 2 (Serial 68), pp. 893–97 Following the Confederate raid on Washington that resulted in the Battle of Fort Stevens, new assessments were made of weak spots in Washington's defenses. In the three years between the construction of Fort Stanton and the attack on Fort Stevens, Fort Stanton's perimeter had been greatly increased with the addition of two subsidiary forts and additional rifle pits and trenches, as well as the completion of the military ring road. A report by Maj. Gen. Christopher C. Augur of the U.S. Volunteers recommended Fort Stanton receive one 32-pounder howitzer, two 4½-inch rifled guns, four 12-pounder howitzers, and two 12-pounder Napoleons to bolster its defenses and control its position at the center of the Eastern Branch defenses.Official Records I, 37, Part 2 (serial 71), pp. 492–95 In August 1864, Gen. Barnard was replaced in his capacity as chief engineer of the defenses of Washington by Lt. Col. Barton S. Alexander. With the war winding down, Alexander's duties consisted primarily of maintaining and expanding the already-existing defenses, rather than building new forts as Barnard had done. An October 1864 report from Col. Alexander to Brig. Gen. Richard Delafield, head of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, lists a series of improvements to Fort Stanton's already-impressive defenses. \\"Constructing three bastions, two new magazines, bomb-proofs, traverses, platforms, embrasures, grading glacis, and renewing abatis,\\" the report reads.Official Records I, 43, Part 2 (serial 91), pp. 280–82. ==Post-war use== After the surrender of Robert E. Lee's Army of Northern Virginia on April 9, 1865, the primary reason for manned defenses protecting Washington ceased to exist. Initial recommendations by Col. Alexander, chief engineer of the Washington defenses, were to divide the defenses into three classes: those that should be kept active (first-class), those that should be mothballed and kept in a reserve state (second-class), and those that should be abandoned entirely (third-class). Fort Stanton fell into the first-class category, as it was thought that the fort would be needed to defend the Washington Navy Yard.Official Records, (Serial 97) Series I, Volume XLVI, Part 3, p. 1130. Thanks to its status as a first-class fortification, Fort Stanton continued to receive regular maintenance and was continually garrisoned even after the final armistice. Work was even done to strengthen the defenses, as a stockade was added in the summer of 1865, and the parapets of the fort were re-sodded with fresh grass for better traction and to improve the look of the fortification.Engineer Orders and Circulars, Orders, Issuances, 1811–1941, Records of the Office of the Chief of Engineers, Record Group 77, A2232, B.S. Alexander to Richard Delafield, July 10, 1865 Letters Received, 1826-66 Abandonment With the conclusion of the fighting, however, military budgets were slashed, and even the forts that were designated for second- and first-class status were deemed surplus. The guns were removed, surplus equipment sold, and the land returned to its original owners. Fort Stanton itself was officially closed on March 20, 1866.Army and Navy Journal, 3 (March 24, 1866), p. 486 Following the closure, the fort was abandoned to the elements, and the woods of Anacostia rapidly reclaimed the land. In 1873, journalist George Alfred Townsend published Washington, Outside and Inside. A Picture and A Narrative of the Origin, Growth, Excellences, Abuses, Beauties, and Personages of Our Governing City, a work that covered the history of Washington from its inception to the then-present day. The Civil War defenses of Washington figure prominently in the later portions of the book, and he uses the state of Fort Stanton as an example of what had become of the forts a decade after they had been built. The Fort Circle Parks The fort remained in a constantly deteriorating condition until 1919, when the Commissioners of the District of Columbia pushed Congress to pass a bill that would consolidate the aging forts into a \\"Fort Circle\\" system of parks that would ring the growing city of Washington. As envisioned by the Commissioners, the Fort Circle would be a green ring of parks outside the city, owned by the government, and connected by a \\"Fort Drive\\" road in order to allow Washington's citizens to easily escape the confines of the capital. However, the bill allowing for the purchase of the former forts, which had been turned back over to private ownership after the war, failed to pass both the House of Representatives and Senate.Journal of the House of Representatives of the United States ... 66th Congress, 1st Session (Washington, DC: The Government Printing Office, 1919), p. 594 Despite that failure, in 1925 a similar bill passed both the House and Senate, which allowed for the creation of the National Capital Parks Commission (NCPC) to oversee the construction of a Fort Circle of parks similar to that proposed in 1919.\\"Linking of Forts Embodied in Plan,\\" The Evening Star, December 4, 1925 The NCPC was authorized to begin purchasing land occupied by the old forts, much of which had been turned over to private ownership following the war. Records indicate that the site of Fort Stanton was purchased for a total of $56,000 in 1926.Record Group 328, Records of the National Park Service, National Archives, General Records, Planting Files, 1924-67, 545-100, Fort Drive, #2, T.C. Jeffers, Landscape Architect, \\"THE FORT DRIVE, A Chronological History of the More Important Actions and Events Relating Thereto,\\" Feb. 7, 1947. The duty of purchasing land and constructing the fort parks changed hands several times throughout the 1920s and 1930s, eventually culminating with the Department of the Interior and the National Park Service taking control of the project in the 1940s.National Capital Park and Planning Commission.\\" In H.S. Wagner and Charles G. Sauers, Study of the Organization of the National Capital Parks (Washington, DC: The National Park Service, National Capital Parks, 1939), p. 40 During the Great Depression, crews from the Civilian Conservation Corps embarked on projects to improve and maintain the parks, which were still under the control of District authority at that time. At Fort Stanton, CCC members trimmed trees and cleared brush, as well as maintaining and constructing park buildings.Record Group 79, Records of the National Park Service, National Archives, Records of the Branch of Recreation, Land Protection, and State Cooperation, Narrative Reports Concerning ECW (CCC) Projects in NPS Areas, 1933-35, District of Columbia, Boxes 11, National Capital Parks, Narrative Report covering Fifth Enrollment Period, ECW Camp N.A. #1, Washington, DC, Apr-Oct 1935 Various non-park buildings were also discussed for the land. The City Department of Education proposed building a school on park land, while authorities from the local water utility suggested the construction of a water tower would be suitable for the tall hills of the park.Record Group 66, Records of the National Park Service, National Archives, Entry 17, Project Files, 1910-52, Forts, Fort Stanton The Second World War interrupted these plans, and post-war budget cuts instituted by President Harry S. Truman postponed the construction of the Fort Drive once more. Though land for the parks had mostly been purchased, construction of the ring road connecting them was pushed back again and again. Other projects managed to find funding, however. In 1949, President Truman approved a supplemental appropriation request of $175,000 to construct \\"a swimming pool and associated facilities\\" at Fort Stanton Park.House Executive Document No. 361, 81st Congress, 1st Session, \\"Supplemental Estimate of Appropriation for the Department of the Interior,\\" October 11, 1949. By 1963, when President John F. Kennedy began pushing Congress to finally build the Fort Circle Drive,Martha Strayer, \\"JFK Settles Battle Over Ft. Drive,\\" Washington Daily News, May 28, 1963. many in Washington and the National Park Service were openly questioning whether the plan had outgrown its usefulness.National Capital Planning Commission, Fort Park System: A Re-evaluation Study of Fort Drive, Washington, D.C. April 1965 By Fred W. Tuemmler and Associates, College Park, Maryland (Washington, DC: National Capital Planning Commission, 1965), pp. 3–9 After all, by this time, Washington had grown past the ring of forts that had protected it a century earlier, and city surface roads already connected the parks, albeit not in as linear a route as envisioned.\\"Fort Sites Eyed for Future Use,\\" The Washington Post, Friday, October 2, 1964. The plan to link Fort Stanton Park with other fort parks via a grand drive was quietly dropped in the years that followed. Continuing use Not all the land that made up the site of Fort Stanton was converted to public park land. In 1920, local African-American Catholics constructed Our Lady of Perpetual Help church on land formerly owned by Dr. J.C. Norwood, a local physician.Louise Daniel Hutchinson, The Anacostia Story: 1608–1930 (Washington, DC: Published for the Anacostia Neighborhood Museum of the Smithsonian Institution by the Smithsonian Institution Press, 1977), p. 126 After the remaining grounds of the fort were purchased in 1925, nearby residents reportedly \\"walked family cows to Fort Stanton Park to graze before the school bell rang.\\"Louise Daniel Hutchinson, The Anacostia Story: 1608–1930 (Washington, DC: Published for the Anacostia Neighborhood Museum of the Smithsonian Institution by the Smithsonian Institution Press, 1977), p. 129 Today, the church still stands adjacent to the grounds of the park. The Washington D.C. Department of Parks and National Park Service jointly manage the of park land that stand on the site of the fort today. D.C. authorities manage approximately that contain a recreation center and ball fields, while the National Park Service manages the remaining acreage, which is mostly wooded and contains the remains of forts Stanton and Ricketts.

Sir Herbert Lloyd Watkin Williams-Wynn, 7th Baronet, (6 June 1860 - 24 May 1944) was a Welsh politician. ==Career== Williams-Wynn succeeded to the baronetcy on the death of his uncle and father-in-law, Sir Watkin Williams-Wynn, 6th Baronet in May 1885. He was Member of Parliament (MP) for Denbighshire from May to November 1885, when the constituency was abolished. He lost the subsequent election for the new East Denbighshire constituency, and tried unsuccessfully to gain the seat in the following two elections in 1886 (when he lost by only 0,4 percent) and 1892. He was High Sheriff of Denbighshire for 1890, and served as Lord Lieutenant of Montgomeryshire from 1891 until 1944. During the Second Boer War, he was instrumental in raising four companies of Imperial Yeomanry for service in South Africa, attached to the Montgomeryshire Yeomanry. For this he was appointed Companion of the Order of the Bath (CB) in the 1902 Coronation Honours. During World War I he established a munitions factory on the Wynnstay estate. ==Family== Williams-Wynn married his cousin Louise Alexandra Williams- Wynn (1864–1911), daughter of Sir Watkin Williams-Wynn, 6th Baronet and the sole heiress of the Wynnstay estate.

On 1 April 2018, IE Singapore merged with SPRING Singapore to form Enterprise Singapore. Enterprise Singapore will enable the growth of Singapore companies through an integrated support network to build business capabilities and access overseas markets. ==History== IE Singapore originated from a re-organization of what used to be called the Singapore Trade Development Board (TDB). The TDB was formed in 1983 to develop Singapore as an international trading hub, promoting the nation's goods and services. Activities ranged from basic trade facilitation, to reviewing existing marketing policies, strategies and techniques. It explored opportunities in both traditional and non-traditional markets, and subsequently exported business systems and developed international offshore trading. It also had a role in trade policy after Singapore joined the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), to actively secure market access and lobby for free trade. It issued its own revenue stamps as well. The re-branding coincided with an acknowledgment that Singapore had to move beyond its investment-led and electronics-dominated export base and to diversify her sources of growth. One of the key thrusts in Singapore's new economic strategy was to help Singapore- based companies internationalize and grow in an increasingly global market. TDB was thus renamed International Enterprise Singapore (IE Singapore) on 12 Apr 2002 to mark a strategic shift in activities, which would now focus less on export promotion, and more on helping Singaporean business start and develop their business overseas. In this way, IE Singapore is analogous to other trade and export promotion agencies such as the Australian Trade Commission (Austrade) and the Japan External Trade Organization. However, their roles differ to reflect the different economic strategies envisaged by their respective governments, which also depend on the relative profile and orientation of their economies. IE Singapore, for example, focuses also on investment matters, while organizations such as JETRO have also shifted to activities such as import promotion. It is one of many examples of Trade Promotion Agencies (TPOs) internationally facing change, and having adjusted their mission appropriately to suit the times.TPO's Facing Change.

Henry Glover is credited on the original 45 rpm single as the songwriter, although Roulette Records owner Morris Levy's name sometimes fraudulently appears on later renditions. In 1961, Roulette issued the song with \\"Please Don't Talk About Me When I'm Gone\\" as the B-side. The single reached number 89 on Billboard's Hot 100.Joel Whitburn's Top Pop Singles 1955-2002 ==The Rivieras cover== The most successful version of the song was released by the Rivieras in 1964 and became the group's biggest hit in their short career. This song was the result of their first recording session at Chicago's Columbia Recording Studios in 1963 (purchased by manager Bill Dobslaw). The lineup for this session included Marty Fortson on vocals and rhythm guitar, Joe Pennell on lead guitar, Doug Gean on bass guitar, Otto Nuss on Vox Continental organ, and Paul Dennert on drums. The original single cut from this session included the song \\"Played On\\" as the A-side, with \\"California Sun\\" as the B-side and was released on Dobslaw's Riviera label in 1963. DJ Art Roberts ensured that the \\"California Sun\\" side saw significant airplay on WLS. In response to the growing success, Dobslaw got the band a national distribution deal with USA Records, and the song was adequately distributed with \\"H.B. Goose Step\\" as the B-side. The song entered the charts on January 25, 1964, and reached number five on the US Billboard Hot 100 chart, where it remained for 10 weeks. The song was further hailed as the last American rock and roll hit before the British Invasion. Shortly after the song's release, the band experienced internal problems as Fortson and Pennell enlisted in the Marines, in addition to various lineup changes afterwards. A re-recording of the song with new lyrics, titled \\"Arizona Sun\\" was recorded in 1964, but not released until 2000 on the compilation Let's Stomp with The Rivieras! Unissued 1964 Recordings. \\"California Sun\\" was eventually featured on the band's debut album Let's Have A Party. A later version was released later that year as \\"California Sun '65\\" on their second and final album, Campus Party. The song was used in the 1987 movie Good Morning, Vietnam, as well as on its soundtrack album. It was also featured in the 1991 biopic The Doors. It was also one of many California-related songs played throughout \\"Sunshine Plaza\\" in the original Disney California Adventure. and can also be heard as part of the background music loop at Disney’s Typhoon Lagoon water park.

It ran for 49 episodes, animated at Studio Gallop, directed by Takashi Watanabe and follows the adventures of Dome Shinjo, a 10-year-old boy who is the son of a deceased legendary player of the Yomiuri Giants. ==Plot== Dome Shinjo, From his father he inherited the love for baseball and his great abilities for the sport, although his mother and his older sister try to avoid that he practices it. In fact, his father, before dying, had time to teach him a magical shot. Dome, after his mother gave him the glove his father used, he makes that shot in a training session of the Giants and is contracted immediately. With the support of the veteran players of the team, this young player will, from this very moment, make the Giants become unbeatable at home and none of the main batters of the Japanese professional league manages to end with his magical shot. Although that does not apply to the games played away, as Dome is just allowed to play at home, in the Tokyo Dome in which his father was consecrated (and the place by which he did chose such name for his son). When the veteran captain of the Dragons manages to bat his shot, it seems that the young boy is finally and definitely defeated, but then he invents another magical shot. New rivals, but also friends (such as Melody Norman, an American girl who disguises herself as a boy because women can't play baseball), will appear in scene, until the arrival of the mysterious Don Carlos, a Spanish ex-bullfighter who plays for the Hiroshima Toyo Carp and had an old rivalry with his father. ==Cast== *Chika Sakamoto (Dome Shinjo) *Kikuko Inoue (Mayumi Shinjo) *Rena Kurihara (Akane Shinjo) *Satomi Kōrogi (Kaori) ==External links== * * Category:1989 anime television series Category:1989 Japanese television series debuts Category:1990 Japanese television series endings Category:Gallop (studio) Category:Nippon TV original programming Category:Baseball in anime and manga Category:Shotaro Ishinomori ","title":"Miracle Giants Dome-kun"},{"id":"12392302","text":"* Will Boswell Timms (1872–1922), Australian-born Scotland rugby international player * Arthur Timms (1914–1970), Australian rules footballer * Brian Timms (born 1940), English cricketer * Charles Gordon Timms (1884-1958), British Army officer and rugby union player * Chris Timms (1947–2004), New Zealand yachtsman * Colin Timms, musicologist * E.

Due to difficulties in paying their rent, their landlady forces two new male tenants on them, Nesta and Aldi. Key and Citra, despite their beauty, are for some unexplained reason very unlucky in love and fear that they will end up as spinsters. They immediately fall for their handsome housemates. Unbeknown to them, the two young men are actually lovers, though various visual clues ensure that the audience is let in on the secret. While Nesta has a very masculine and straight-acting look, Aldi is feminine and moody. Nesta explains to Aldi – and to the audience – the theory of chocolate strawberry. Basically, strawberry equates to feminine and gay, and so in order not to be found out it is important to act chocolate – that is, to act masculine and straight. As well as more innocent ways of showing that one is straight, such as doing weight training, spending hours on the PlayStation, and not cooking, Nesta decides it would be a good ploy to start flirting with and eventually dating Key. Aldi becomes increasingly jealous as he sees his love of the last two years devoting far too much attention to Key. Meanwhile, Citra starts flirting with Aldi, although he notices none of her various manoeuvres. Aldi decides he will lie no longer, and when his parents come to dinner, he comes out to them. His father has an asthma attack, such is his shock and disgust, and his mother leaves with his father, urging Aldi to revert to how he used to be. Things further come to a head when Citra and Key walk in on the two men as they are kissing. But instead of admitting it was all a deception, Nesta states that he really is in love with Key. Nesta has turned truly chocolate (or straight). Key initially rejects Nesta for lying to her, but returns to him after having run through the Jakarta night to stop him before he leaves forever. So it seems we have the conclusion: Nesta is turned straight by the charms of the pretty Key; Citra is still alone due to her distrust of men; Aldi is also to spend his life alone as a sad but out homosexual. However, in the final scene, as is demanded by romantic comedies, everyone is provided with a partner: Citra wins the attention of a cool rocker at a pop concert, and then Aldi appears hand in hand with Citra's boss, Dani.

The most important of these controversies concerned the substantial relationship between God the Father and God the Son. The deep divisions created by the disputes were an ironic consequence of Emperor Constantine's efforts to unite Christianity and establish a single, imperially approved version of the faith during his reign. These disagreements divided the Church into two opposing theological factions for over 55 years, from the time before the First Council of Nicaea in 325 until after the First Council of Constantinople in 381. There was no formal resolution or formal schism, though the Trinitarian faction ultimately gained the upper hand in the imperial Church; outside the Roman Empire this faction was not immediately so influential. Arianism continued to be preached inside and outside the Empire for some time (without the blessing of the Empire), but it was eventually killed off. The modern Roman Catholic Church and the Eastern Orthodox Church, as well as most other modern Christian sects, have generally followed the Trinitarian formulation, though each has its own specific theology on the matter. ==History== Beginnings The early history of the controversy must be pieced together from about 35 documents found in various sources. The Trinitarian historian Socrates of Constantinople reports that Arius first became controversial under the bishop Alexander of Alexandria, when Arius formulated the following syllogism: \\"If the Father begat the Son, he that was begotten had a beginning of existence: hence it is that there was when the Son was not. It follows then of necessity that he had his existence from the non- existence\\".. Bishop Alexander of Alexandria was criticised for his slow reaction against Arius. Like his predecessor, Dionysius, he has been charged with vacillation. According to Eusebius's work, The Life of Constantine, the controversy had spread from Alexandria into almost all the African regions, and was considered a disturbance of the public order by the Roman Empire. Constantine the Great (Constantine I) sent two letters to Arius and Bishop Alexander, asking the religious leaders to stop the controversy. Because the controversy continued to spread, in 325 Emperor Constantine held the first Council of Nicaea with an agenda to prosecute Arius. ==First Council of Nicea (325)== The First Council of Nicaea, with Arius depicted beneath the feet of emperor Constantine the Great and the bishops Arianism would not be contained within the Alexandrian diocese. By the time Bishop Alexander finally acted against his recalcitrant presbyter, Arius's doctrine had spread far beyond his own see; it had become a topic of discussion—and disturbance—for the entire Church. The Church was now a powerful force in the Roman world, with Constantine I having legalized it in 313 through the Edict of Milan. The emperor had taken a personal interest in several ecumenical issues, including the Donatist controversy in 316, and he wanted to bring an end to the Arian dispute. To this end, the emperor sent bishop Hosius of Corduba to investigate and, if possible, resolve the controversy. Hosius was armed with an open letter from the Emperor: \\"Wherefore let each one of you, showing consideration for the other, listen to the impartial exhortation of your fellow-servant.\\" As the debate continued to rage despite Hosius' efforts, Constantine in AD 325 took an unprecedented step: he called an ecumenical council composed of church prelates from all parts of the empire to resolve this issue, possibly at Hosius' recommendation. All secular dioceses of the empire sent one or more representatives to the council, save for Roman Britain; the majority of the bishops came from the East. Pope Sylvester I, himself too aged to attend, sent two priests as his delegates. Arius himself attended the council, but his bishop, Alexander, did not, but sent instead his young deacon Athanasius. Athanasius would become the champion of the Trinitarian viewpoint ultimately adopted by the council and spend most of his life battling Arianism. Also there were Eusebius of Caesarea and Eusebius of Nicomedia. Before the main conclave convened, Hosius initially met with Alexander and his supporters at Nicomedia. The council would be presided over by the emperor himself, who participated in and even led some of its discussions. Those who upheld the notion that Christ was co-eternal and con-substantial with the Father were led by the young archdeacon Athanasius. Those who instead insisted that God the Son came after God the Father in time and substance, were led by Arius the presbyter. For about two months, the two sides argued and debated, with each appealing to Scripture to justify their respective positions. Arius maintained that the Son of God was a Creature, made from nothing; and that he was God's First Production, before all ages. And he argued that everything else was created through the Son. Thus, said Arius, only the Son was directly created and begotten of God; furthermore, there was a time that He had no existence. He was capable of His own free will, said Arius, and thus \\"were He in the truest sense a son, He must have come after the Father, therefore the time obviously was when He was not, and hence He was a finite being.\\" According to some accounts in the hagiography of Saint Nicholas, debate at the council became so heated that at one point, he slapped Arius in the face. The majority of the bishops at the council ultimately agreed upon a creed, known thereafter as the Nicene Creed formulated at the first council of Nicaea. It included the word homoousios, meaning \\"consubstantial\\", or \\"one in essence\\", which was incompatible with Arius' beliefs. On June 19, 325, council and emperor issued a circular to the churches in and around Alexandria: Arius and two of his unyielding partisans (Theonas and Secundus) were deposed and exiled to Illyricum, while three other supporters—Theognis of Nicaea, Eusebius of Nicomedia and Maris of Chalcedon—affixed their signatures solely out of deference to the emperor. However, Constantine soon found reason to suspect the sincerity of these three, for he later included them in the sentence pronounced on Arius. Ariminum, Seleucia, and Constantinople (358–360) In 358, the emperor Constantius II requested two councils, one of the western bishops at Ariminum (now Rimini in Northern Italy) and one of the eastern bishops at Nicomedia.Philostorgius, in Photius, Epitome of the Ecclesiastical History of Philostorgius, book 4, chapter 10.Socrates of Constantinople, Church History, book 2, chapter 37. In 359, the western council met at Ariminum. Ursacius of Singidunum and Valens of Mursa declared that the Son was like the father \\"according to the scriptures,\\" following a new (Homoian) creed drafted at Sirmium (359). Many of the most outspoken supporters of the Creed of Nicaea walked out. The council, including some supporters of the older creed, adopted the newer creed. After the council, Pope Liberius condemned the creed of Ariminum, while his rival, Pope Felix II, supported it.Socrates of Constantinople, Church History, book 2, chapter 40. An earthquake struck Nicomedia, killing the bishop Cecropius of Nicomedia, and in 359 the eastern council met at Seleucia Isauria instead. The council was bitterly divided and procedurally irregular, and the two parties met separately and reached opposing decisions. Basil of Ancyra and his party declared that the Son was of similar substance to the Father, following a (Homoiousian) Creed of Antioch from 341, and deposed the opposing party. Acacius of Caesarea declared that the Son was like the Father, introducing a new (Homoian) creed.Philostorgius, in Photius, Epitome of the Ecclesiastical History of Philostorgius, book 4, chapter 11. The Son was begotten – generated from God's own substance. Constantius requested a third council, at Constantinople (359), of both the eastern and western bishops, to resolve the split at Seleucia. Acacius now declared that the Son was like the Father \\"according to the scriptures.\\" Basil of Ancyra, Eustathius of Sebaste, and their party again declared that the Son was of similar substance to the Father, as in the majority decision at Seleucia. Maris of Chalcedon, Eudoxius of Antioch, and the deacons Aëtius of Antioch and Eunomius of Cyzicus declared that the Son was of a dissimilar substance from the Father.Philostorgius, in Photius, Epitome of the Ecclesiastical History of Philostorgius, book 4, chapter 12 and book 5, chapter 1.Socrates of Constantinople, Church History, book 2, chapter 41. The Heteroousians defeated the Homoiousians in an initial debate, but Constantius banished Aëtius, after which the council, including Maris and Eudoxius, agreed to the homoian creed of Ariminum with minor modifications. After the Council of Constantinople, the homoian bishop Acacius deposed and banished several homoiousian bishops, including Macedonius I of Constantinople, Basil, Eustathius, Eleusius of Cyzicus, Dracontius of Pergamum, Neonas of Seleucia, Sophronius of Pompeiopolis, Elpidius of Satala and Cyril of Jerusalem.Philostorgius, in Photius, Epitome of the Ecclesiastical History of Philostorgius, book 5, chapter 1.Socrates of Constantinople, Church History, book 2, chapter 42. At the same time, Acacius also deposed and banished the Anomoean deacon Aëtius. In 360, Acacius appointed Eudoxius of Antioch to replace Macedonius and Athanasius of Ancyra to replace Basil, as well as Onesimus of Nicomedia to replace Cecropius, who had died in the earthquake at Nicomedia. The controversy in the 360s In 361, Constantius died and Julian became sole Roman emperor. Julian demanded the restoration of several pagan temples which Christians had seized or destroyed.Henry Chadwick, History of the Early Church, chapter 9 According to Philostorgius, pagans killed George of Laodicea, bishop of Alexandria, allowing Athanasius to reclaim the 'see', or ecclesiastical jurisdiction.Philostorgius, in Photius, Epitome of the Ecclesiastical History of Philostorgius, book 7, chapter 2. ==Sides== Homoousian The Homoousians taught that the Son is of the same substance as the Father, i.e. both uncreated. The Sabellian form had been condemned as heresy in the 3rd century by Pope Calixtus. The Athanasian form would be declared orthodox at the Council of Constantinople in 383, and has become the basis of most of modern trinitarianism.Bernhard Lohse, A Short History of Christian Doctrine, pp. 56-59 & 63.

The station is owned and operated by Pilot Media. ==History== The station signed on in late 2001 as WCSO, and the call letters were soon changed to WDQZ. It was a classic rock simulcast with WDQX in Peoria. In December 2005 WDQX was sold, and the simulcast with WDQZ was split. Sometime after that, the station evolved into a more straight-ahead classic hits station. In September 2009, WDQZ stunted as an all-TV-themed station for a day and a half. On September 18, 2009 at noon, WDQZ changed back to a classic hits format. Scott Robbins, a longtime Bloomington/Normal host, hosted mornings on \\"The Eagle\\" for many years, with two different co-hosts. In April 2007, Mancow's Morning Madhouse was added, and Robbins moved to afternoons, then left the station in August 2007 to host mornings on Cities 92.9. In February 2008 he returned to middays on \\"The Eagle\\". The syndicated Nights With Alice Cooper served as the night show. On August 17, 2010 WDQZ changed its call letters to WZIM. On April 5, 2012 WZIM changed its format from classic hits to sports, branded as \\"The Ticket\\".http://radioinsight.com/blog/headlines/56271/sports-comes-to- bloomingtonnormal/#.T34ZO-0Zy70 The move meant that Bloomington-Normal had an all-sports radio station for the first time. Immediately after announcing the switch, 99.5 The Ticket became the B-N affiliate for the Chicago Cubs, taking over from WJEZ. WZIM was also the Bloomington-Normal affiliate for the Chicago White Sox, although the station gave first priority to the Cubs. The Ticket also aired Indianapolis Colts games in the fall. WJBC airs nearly all local sports teams. WZIM aired one local program, The Front Row, from 4-6 p.m. The show was hosted by Dan Swaney and Paul Jackson. It was cancelled sometime in the fall of 2012. On November 13, 2013 at 10 am, WZIM dropped its sports format and began stunting with automated classic rock songs.http://radioinsight.com/blog/headlines/netgnomes/86665/ticket-giving- way-to-magic-in-bloomingtonnormal/ On November 15 at noon, it changed its format to AC as Magic 99.5, with the slogan, \\"80s, 90s, And Now!\\" and began promoting itself as the new home in Bloomington and Lexington for the syndicated John Tesh radio show in the morning. In April 2018, Joe Greenwood took over as Program Director and added The Kidd Kraddick Morning Show. Joe Greenwood had previously been in Peoria for nearly a decade at Alpha Media being a part of WDQX, WMBD and burst onto the country scene on WXCL (where he would go on to win the \\"Best DJ in Peoria\\"). Joe has made several changes to the station, including freshing up the format to lean more towards Hot AC while still featuring 80's music with \\"Awesome 80's double plays\\" and adding \\"Throwback Thursday\\". The lineup on-air as of that time is the nationally syndicated \\"Kidd Kraddick Morning Show\\" from 6am-9am, 99 minute work day kick off from 9am-11am, former morning host and program director Adam Chandler 11am-3pm, Rick Dee's 3pm-7pm and John Tesh from 7pm-midnight. Weekends feature Jim Brickman, Rick Dees, John Tesh and locally \\"Johnny B\\". Program Director, Joe Greenwood isn't on-air on WZIM but does the mid-day show on sister station WIBL 107.7 & 92.1 The Bull with ratings success, success that Great Plains Media hopes he can bring to WZIM. ==ReferencesExternal links== * ZIM Category:Radio stations established in 2001 ","title":"WZIM"},{"id":"12392569","text":"The 1998–99 ISU Junior Grand Prix was the second season of the ISU Junior Grand Prix, a series of international junior level competitions organized by the International Skating Union.

Colloquially referred to as the White Cathedral, it is a prime example of the so-called 'Polish Cathedral style' of churches in both its opulence and grand scale. Along with St. Wenceslaus, St. Mary of the Angels, and Holy Trinity it is one of the many monumental Polish churches visible from the Kennedy Expressway. Due to the building's high maintenance costs it was sold in December 1993 and now houses Covenant Presbyterian Church of Chicago, a church affiliated with the Presbyterian Church in America. A former chapel at All Saints Polish National Catholic Cemetery on Higgins Avenue and River Road was expanded and now houses the current Cathedral of the Western Diocese of the Polish National Catholic Church. ==History== The congregation that founded All Saints was formed in 1895 from a group of disgruntled former parishioners of St. Hedwig's which is only three blocks north of the church. Resentful of the dominance of the Resurrectionist Order and dismayed with the Catholic Church hierarchy in the U.S., tensions arose within St. Hedwig's parish. This culminated in the so- called \\"Pepper Riots\\", where a crowd of 3,000 protesters broke into the foyer and assaulted the priests. When the police intervened, the protesters notably threw red pepper into their eyes. The end result was that shots were fired and dozens were injured, including one policeman who was struck by a hammer. The disgruntled anti-Resurrectionist faction broke off from the parish to form an independent church, which became All Saints Cathedral of the Polish National Catholic Church.  History of Covenant PCA  The core group of the church gathered in 1981. This group was officially organized as a church of the Presbyterian Church in America in 1982. Until 1993, the congregation worshiped in rented spaces in the Lincoln Park neighborhood. In December 1993 Covenant PCA purchased the All Saints Cathedral building. In 2007 the church planted its first daughter church in Lincoln Square. Its second daughter church was planted in Austin-Oak Park. Membership is about 400. ==Architecture== Dedicated in the midst of the Great Depression on June 14, 1931, the church was designed by John G. Steinbach who later partnered with another local architect to form the noted firm of Worthmann and Steinbach which drew up the architectural plans for many of the Northwest Side's Polish American churches as well as parts of the campus of Loyola University Chicago. Its Gothic architecture clearly differentiates it from the Renaissance style favored by the Resurrectionist Order, representing the more populist nature of the Polish National Catholic Church. Measuring only 63 feet in width, Steinbach's design makes effective use of the site. Built in the form of a cross, its two towers are each 135 feet in height while the center frame reached a height of 54 feet. Like most other Polish Cathedrals, it was originally designed with an exterior of brick and terracotta, which was later changed to white imitation cement stone. Although more expensive than natural limestone, the material is also more durable, giving the church the appearance of Joliet Limestone that decorates such famous Chicago area landmarks such as the Chicago Water Tower or the old Statesville Prison. Set among the intricate carving above the main entrance is the emblem of the Polish National Catholic Church adopted at the Synod of Scranton in 1904 which depicts a book, above which rises the bright sun of freedom, light and warmth, surrounded to the right by the cross and to the left by the palm. Emblazoned on the streamer beneath is an inscription in Polish: Prawdą, Pracą, Walką, which translates into English as \\"with truth, with work, with struggle\\", a motto by which Christian values are to be brought into life. The interior decorations are especially suited to All Saints' former status as a cathedral. Dominating the Dickens Avenue facade is a massive stained glass window installed in the early 1940s which portrays Saint Cecilia, the patroness of Music above the shield of the Western Diocese. All the paintings are on canvas and the Gothic motif is reflected throughout in the shrines, altars, Stations of the Cross and the canopies over the doorways. There are strong parallels between the church's internal painting scheme with its art nouveau-like flairs and the painter of many of Kraków's most famous Gothic churches Stanisław Wyspiański, making the church unique in this respect among Chicago's Polish churches. The main altar was imported from Italy, a gift of the ladies rosary sodality, and was originally designed to have its paintings change to reflect the different seasons of the liturgical year, a unique innovation. The Christmas season would have featured Mary and the Child Jesus; Lent, Jesus on the Cross; and Easter, the Resurrected Savior. The hand- carved altar rails, now removed, had portrayed The Passion of the Christ through such powerful symbols as palm, snake, wheat, fish, bread baskets, money bags, chalice, reed and rooster. Several of the other stained glass windows commemorate Polish Saints and writers, while the angels painted along the nave walls carry the crests of cities in Poland where the immigrants hailed from. The small altars along the east and west walls were carved by former parishioner Jan Wellnitz, and were originally installed in the 1910 church located next door. While the former Cathedral of All Saints is often overshadowed by its more famous Roman Catholic sister churches such as the Basilica of St. Hyacinth, it is nonetheless highly regarded as a beautiful specimen of Chicago's historic church architecture. The church was featured in the Landmarks Preservation Council of Illinois annual tour of Chicago's historic churches and synagogues, and the site of a lecture delivered by historian Dominic Pacyga as well as Vincent Michael the director of Chicago Programs at the Landmarks Preservation Council of Illinois on its behalf. The Curt Teich Postcard Archives at the Lake County Discovery Museum in Wauconda has among its collection a postcard of the church interior dating from the early 1940s. ==See also== *Polish Cathedral style churches of Chicago *Polish American *Poles in Chicago *Roman Catholicism in Poland ==Notes and referencesBibliography== * ==External links== *official website of Covenant Presbyterian Church, the church's current congregation *official website of the Western Diocese of the Polish National Catholic Church, of which All Saints' Parish is the cathedral Category:Religious organizations established in 1895 Category:Churches in Chicago Category:Presbyterian Church in America churches in Illinois Category:Polish-American culture in Chicago Category:History of Catholicism in the United States Category:Former cathedrals in the United States Category:Former churches in Illinois Category:Polish Cathedral style architecture Category:Polish National Catholic Church Category:Presbyterian churches in Illinois Category:1895 establishments in Illinois ","title":"Covenant Presbyterian Church (Chicago, Illinois)"},{"id":"12392591","text":"Magnolia Heights School is a private school in Senatobia, Mississippi.

Huckabee ultimately ended his bid for the nomination after losing the Texas Republican primary on March 4, 2008. Huckabee's campaign began with a first-quarter fundraising total lower than many of the front-running Republican candidates, raising $544,880.\\"Huckabee fundraising totals .\\" The Washington Post, June 30, 2007 Huckabee said that he found it difficult to move forward in a race \\"ruled by candidates with the biggest names\\".Baxter, Sarah.

Nonetheless, Huckabee placed second in the August 11 Iowa Straw Poll with 18.1 percent.\\"Huckabee: I'm In The Top Tier After Iowa.\\" CBS News, August 12, 2007 He came in second at the onsite polling of the Family Research Council Values Voters Summit on October 21, 2007, with 28% of the vote, and garnered a celebrity endorsement from actor Chuck Norris. In December 2007, Huckabee began challenging other candidates for first place in national polls among Republicans. On January 3, 2008, Huckabee won the Iowa Republican Caucuses with 34% of the electorate. On Super Tuesday, Huckabee won an additional six states, including most of the Deep South. After losing the Texas primary in March, however, Huckabee officially ended his campaign and conceded the race to U.S. senator John McCain. ==Campaign development== Beginnings On January 27, 2007, the Associated Press reported that Huckabee planned to file papers to form a presidential exploratory committee. He announced his run for the White House on Meet the Press on January 28, 2007.\\"MTP Transcript for Jan. 28, 2007\\". Associated Press, January 27, 2007 Huckabee told reporters \\"I think this is an opportunity to show the American dream is still alive and there's hope and optimism that can be awakened in a lot of people's lives if they think that a person like me can run and actually become president.\\"\\"Mike Huckabee Launches Presidential Bid.\\" Associated Press, January 29, 2007.James Carville, Clinton's former political consultant, said the following about Huckabee: \\"He likes people, he knows how to relate to people. He can talk the talk. I'm impressed with this guy's political skills.\\"\\"Dark horse Huckabee enters the race .\\" Thefirstpost.co.uk, March 7, 2007. On Meet the Press, Huckabee said \\"I think you've got to be very careful. I wouldn't propose any new taxes. I wouldn't support any. But if we’re in a situation where we are in a different level of war, where there is no other option, I think that it's a very dangerous position to make pledges that are outside the most important pledge you make, and that is the oath you take to uphold the Constitution and protect the people of the United States.\\" Grover Norquist, the president of Americans for Tax Reform, who in 2006 called the governor a \\"serial tax increaser,\\" stated recently, \\"Gov. Huckabee recognizes that the challenge is to rein in spending and reduce taxes.\\" Huckabee supports the Fair Tax, which would do away with all federal taxes and replace them with a single national sales tax. In March 2007, Huckabee signed the Presidential Taxpayer Protection Pledge of Americans for Tax Reform, promising not to increase taxes at the federal level. On April 3, 2007, Huckabee's campaign reported that it had raised only $500,000 in the first quarter of 2007, much less than rival candidates. The numbers prompted speculation in Arkansas that Huckabee might abandon the Presidential race for a U.S. Senate race against first-term Democrat Mark Pryor. Huckabee denied any plans to do this, and Huckabee campaign manager Chip Saltsman claimed that the campaign had actually surpassed its first quarter fund raising goal. On April 23, 2007, Huckabee finished second in a South Carolina straw poll conducted by the local Republican parties in Greenville, Spartanburg and Richland counties with 111 votes behind former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney. That same day, Huckabee said that Attorney General Alberto Gonzales is \\"creating a major distraction for the President and for the administration and for the Republican Party,\\" and suggested that perhaps Gonzales should consider resigning due to the current controversy surrounding him. Huckabee participated in the May 3, 2007 Republican Presidential Debates along with the party's other nine declared candidates. Huckabee expressed support of a FairTax, a balanced budget with reduced spending, making the Bush administration's 2001 and 2003 tax cuts permanent, combating climate change, and comprehensive immigration reform. Political analyst and former Clinton and Huckabee adviser Dick Morris said Huckabee performed well, asserting that he was the \\"most original\\" candidate, especially with his explanation of the pro-life platform; and that his articulation was \\"novel and intriguing.\\"\\"John McCain Wins First GOP Debate, but MSNBC Shows Anti-Giuliani Bias\\". Fox News Huckabee was one of three candidates in the debate who said that they do not believe in human evolution. Huckabee generated even better reviews from his performance in the May 15, 2007 Republican Presidential Debates. He received what was characterized by Esquire as \\"gales of laughter\\" as well as approval from the political press for his statement that \\"[w]e've had a Congress that's spent money like John Edwards at a beauty shop,\\" a reference to the report of Edwards, a 2008 Democratic Presidential candidate, spending $800 of campaign money on two haircuts.Esquire: John Edwards Political Future. January 21, 2010 Many supporters of the FairTax plan were also impressed by Huckabee's unfettered support of that proposed policy. Huckabee said on May 16 that, if his campaign falters, he would have to think long and hard before agreeing to become a vice-presidential candidate on a ticket whose presidential candidate believes that abortion should remain legal. \\"This is an issue to me that is very critical. It's one of the reasons that I got into politics because I believe the manner in which we treat innocent life and the matter in which we respect human life, at whatever stage ... is an incredibly powerful statement about who we are as a people,\\" Huckabee told reporters in a conference call in South Carolina. The Huckabee campaign announced on Friday, June 8, that the former governor would participate in the Iowa Republican Party's Straw Poll, scheduled for Saturday, August 11, 2007, in Ames, at Iowa State University. An Iowa poll conducted in mid-June showed Huckabee in fourth place with 7 percent; ahead of John McCain and Sam Brownback.\\"McCain Drops in Iowa Poll\\". Fox News, June 20, 2007 Later, an ABC News/Washington Post poll showed Huckabee at 8%, tied with John McCain. That was the highest Huckabee had polled in that state. Third quarter 2007 Mike Huckabee giving a speech in 2004 Early in the third quarter, after second-quarter fundraising totals increased only slightly to over $760,000, Huckabee criticized the top-tier Republicans for wastefully spending their campaign money and said that \\"I really don't want some folks in charge of the federal treasury if the way they're burning campaign money is indicative of how they would burn taxpayer money\\" Political analyst and former Bill Clinton campaign manager Dick Morris called Huckabee his favorite among the bottom-tier candidates on Hannity and Colmes on July 3.Hannity and Colmes transcript, Fox News, July 3, 2007 Huckabee began a grassroots movement in Iowa, and stumped throughout the state during July. In a July 9, 2007, interview, Huckabee said that his solution for ending the ongoing violence in Iraq would include a troop increase and seeking additional support from other nations in the Middle East. He was a guest on Fox News' 'The Neal Cavuto Show' on Friday, July 20, and then returned to Iowa for numerous Meet Mike Huckabee events. He traveled to Amarillo, Texas on July 22 to give a sermon at The Church at Quail Creek.Mike Huckabee Press Release Mike Huckabee, July 16, 2007 Huckabee continued to keep a busy schedule in Iowa in late July; he traveled to Muscatine and was a guest on the conservative radio talk show The Right Balance with host Greg Allen on July 24. An Iowa poll conducted on July 26 placed Huckabee far behind front-runners Mitt Romney and Fred Thompson, but ahead of second tier candidates Tom Tancredo, Ron Paul, Duncan Hunter, and Tommy Thompson.\\"Edwards, Romney Top Iowa Poll\\" Fox News, July 26, 2007 Huckabee has also agreed to be part of a Cancer Forum in Iowa on August 28, held by cancer survivor Lance Armstrong.\\"Armstrong to Hold Cancer Forums in Iowa\\". Fox News, July 27, 2007 In the summer of 2007, Huckabee began to become closely compared to Kansas Senator Sam Brownback, also a Presidential candidate, for their similar socially conservative views. Huckabee and Brownback have been said to be the top candidates among evangelicals and other Christians.\\" Huckabee tried to separate himself from Brownback (and succeeded, as Brownback dropped from the campaign) whom he saw as his main rival at that point. When asked what separates him from Brownback, he said that \\"the key difference is I've actually been a Governor for ten and a half years and I've run a government.\\"\\"Huckabee, Brownback, and the Race for Iowa\\". Real Clear Politics, July 23, 2007 He also said that no senator has been elected since JFK, and \\"frankly there's a good reason for that.\\" Several polls in the state have placed Huckabee ahead of Brownback; a Mason-Dixon poll placed him at 7% with Brownback at 6. Huckabee acknowledged their similarities and said that \\"without a doubt, we're going after the same voters.\\" Other sources have expressed concern that there is room for only one of them in the race, and that if Huckabee comes out on top, Brownback will struggle to raise money and vice versa.\\"'Electability' the Key \\" Pittsburgh Tribune-Review, July 28, 2007 On July 26, Huckabee called upon Tom Tancredo to pull his campaign's campaign ad which attacked Huckabee on the subject of illegal immigration. Huckabee called the ad \\"blatantly dishonest\\" and said that \\"when people engage in a completely false attack, it's usually an act of desperation. To me, it's a badge of honor because he sees that we are reaching the people we are trying to reach.\\"\\"Huckabee calls on Tancredo to pull campaign ad\\". Aurora Sentinel, July 26, 2007 Tancredo's campaign responded by saying that Huckabee supports amnesty for illegal immigrants, and that the ad was correct while Huckabee's campaign insisted that the ad \\"clearly distorts Mike Huckabee's conservative record on amnesty.\\" In early August, after the collapse of the I-35W Mississippi River bridge in Minneapolis, Minnesota, Huckabee expressed his sympathy to the victims of the disaster and said that taxes do not need to be raised in order to fix the roads, bridges, and other infrastructure, claiming that the billions of dollars spent on other countries' infrastructure should be spent in the United States. He said that \\"we have to start addressing building this country, not everybody else's.\\"\\"Huckabee Among Republican Debaters in Iowa .\\" KAIT, August 5, 2007 Mike Huckabee appeared on the CBS Evening News on August 1 to discuss the Iowa Straw Poll and his ongoing campaign in Iowa.

In late September, Former Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich and former President Bill Clinton said in separate interviews that Huckabee will catch on with Republican primary voters, and called him most likely \\"dark horse\\" candidate to win.

On October 22, actor Chuck Norris announced his endorsement of Huckabee in a release on Huckabee's website. Norris said that \\"I believe the only one who has all of the characteristics to lead America forward into the future is ex-Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee. Mike Huckabee is the real deal.\\" On The Sean Hannity Show on October 22, debate analyst Frank Luntz said \\"I think Mike Huckabee's coming in 2nd in Iowa.\\" In late October, following the Republican Presidential Debate in Orlando, Florida, Huckabee's website traffic increased to more than that of all of the other Republican candidates except for Ron Paul. On October 25, a national Rasmussen poll gave Huckabee his highest polling number yet – 10%. Talk show host Bill O'Reilly, who was a skeptic of Huckabee's success, had previously made a bet with Dick Morris that Huckabee would never reach double digits. There was controversy when Huckabee was asked about responses he gave on a questionnaire during his 1992 race for the U.S. Senate. Huckabee stated in 1992, \\"I feel [homosexuality] is an aberrant, unnatural, and sinful lifestyle, and we now know it can pose a dangerous public health risk.\\" He also suggested that AIDS patients should be \\"isolated from the general population.\\" He stuck by those comments in December 2007 when asked if homosexuality is sinful. He replied, \\"Well I believe it would be—just like lying is sinful and stealing is sinful. There are a lot of things that are sinful. It doesn't mean that a person is a horrible person. It means that they engage in behavior that is outside the norms of those boundaries of our traditional view of what's right and what's wrong. So, I think that anybody who has, maybe a traditional worldview of homosexuality would classify that as an unusual behavior that is not traditional and that would be outside those bounds.\\"Huck defends AIDS stance MSNBC.com He also defended his statements about isolation of AIDS patients, claiming that in 1992 \\"we were still learning about the virus that causes AIDS.\\" Huckabee's poll numbers rose consistently through November and December. On November 15, 2007, Huckabee was recorded as placing second in Iowa in an American Research Group poll at 24%. This was only 2% points lower than the leader Mitt Romney. Polls in early December placed Huckabee ahead of Romney in Iowa by as much as 5 points in a poll by the Des Moines Register, and 3 points in a Rasmussen poll. On November 16, 2007, Huckabee was recorded as placing second, for the first time, in a nationwide poll, garnering 12% of presidential tracking poll by Rassmussen Reports. He was tied with Mitt Romney and Fred Thompson. On December 1, 2007, Huckabee moved up to 15%, his highest percentage yet - and he surpassed Giuliani on December 5 with 20% of Republican voters supporting him nationally versus Giuliani's 17%. On December 19, Huckabee tied with Giuliani in the national Reuters/Zogby poll. Huckabee credited divine intervention for his rising poll numbers. \\"There's only one explanation for it,\\" Huckabee said, \\"and it's not a human one. It's the same power that helped a little boy with two fish and five loaves feed a crowd of 5,000 people.\\"Matter of Faith: Vote God 2008 Dec. 5, 2007 When the close proximity of the first contests to the holidays led to many candidates putting out Christmas ads and videos — allowing them to keep presenting their message but in a more appropriate setting — Huckabee chose one acknowledging that viewers were tired of political messages in the holiday season and that what \\"really matters is the celebration of the birth of Christ,\\" avoiding other candidates' \\"Happy holidays\\" formulation. The ad generated considerable media discussion about whether a white bookshelf in the background was a subliminal Christian cross; Huckabee mocked the suggestion and said it was just a bookshelf. When asked about the ad and the thought of it being a cross, Republican presidential candidate Ron Paul stated that he had not seen the ad, but replied with the assumption that it was a cross, quoting Sinclair Lewis' warning that \\"when fascism comes to this country, it will be wrapped in the flag, carrying a cross.\\"Huckabee ad delivers a Christmas message The Boston Globe, Dec. 19, 2007 Roy Beck, whose 1.5-million-member organization NumbersUSA played a major role in defeating the Senate immigration bill, calls Huckabee \\"an absolute disaster as governor of Arkansas...

On February 9, 2008, Huckabee won the first election following Super Tuesday, by winning 60% of the vote in the Kansas Republican Caucuses. This was also the first contest to be held without Mitt Romney, who was said to be splitting the conservative vote with Huckabee and some pundits suggested it was the reason for Huckabee's landslide victory. Huckabee also won the Louisiana Republican Primary with 44% of the vote to John McCain's 43% in second. Although Huckabee won the primary he was not awarded any delegates, because of the state party rules that state a candidate must pass the 50% threshold to receive the state's pledged delegates. Despite those wins, however, McCain won all the other post-super- Tuesday February primaries. On March 4, McCain obtained the necessary delegates to secure the nomination with wins in the first four March primaries. As a result, Huckabee conceded the nomination to McCain in the late evening of March 4.

Thompson has stated that such issues should be left to the states to decide. Thompson returned the criticism by criticizing Huckabee on immigration and taxes. Mitt Romney criticized Huckabee on immigration by stating, \\"Giving a better deal to the children of illegal aliens than we give to US citizens from surrounding states is simply not fair and not right.\\" Huckabee responded, \\"I guess Mitt Romney would rather keep people out of college so they can keep working on his lawn, since he had illegals there.\\" Previously, Huckabee had criticized Romney for claiming to have been a hunter. The Club for Growth criticized Huckabee in November 2007 over inconsistencies in how Huckabee represents his tax record, specifically regarding the 1999 gas and diesel fuel tax hikes. The 1999 gas and fuel tax hikes were never on the ballot in Arkansas, but Huckabee has told reporters that \\"the fuel tax was a vote of the people—eighty percent of the people voted to improve roads\\".Explanation Needed From Huckabee Club For Growth.

Retrieved November 9, 2007 However, FactCheck.org, after looking at the nuances of the issue in detail, states \\"Huckabee seems to be describing the plan he wanted rather than the plan he actually supported\\", which was a compromise plan arrived at after much political wrangling. Huckabee's son, David Huckabee, has also posed a small controversy with his arrest for carrying a weapon in a prohibited place after a Glock pistol was found in his briefcase while going through a security checkpoint at the Little Rock National Airport. David Huckabee, who pleaded guilty to the misdemeanor charge, said that he forgot to take the gun out of his bag before going to the airport. After the events took place, Mike Huckabee, a strong right to bear arms candidate said \\"I love my son but what he did was irresponsible, but not intentional. The right to carry a firearm has to be balanced with an equal responsibility to not make foolish errors like forgetting about it being in one's briefcase. ...I make no excuses for him and would expect him to accept whatever penalties are given. It is the court's responsibility to properly consequence him for a foolish act but his family's responsibility to love him and temper our disappointment with our support.\\" Some critics, including Romney, have accused Huckabee of using his religion background for political advantage. A Romney campaign staff member pointed out that similar ads in Iowa and New Hampshire are different in that the New Hampshire ad did not include the term \\"Christian Leader\\" in the spot, while an ad in Iowa did. Alice Stewart, a spokeswomen of the Huckabee campaign, later said there was no intention to downplay religion in New Hampshire, noting the ads \\"were simply different spots running in different markets, which is typical in presidential campaigns.\\"In S.C., Romney's campaign slugs at Huckabee's surging campaign Boston.com, December 14, 2007 Huckabee received further criticism in early January 2008 when, having previously agreed to try to work with unions if elected,Unions Back Clinton, Edwards, Huckabee www.washingtonpost.com, August 30, 2007 he then crossed a WGA Writer's Strike picket line in order to appear on The Tonight Show with Jay Leno.Huckabee Likely to Have to Cross Picket Line to Appear with Leno www.time.com, January 2, 2008 Relationship with McCain campaign In most of the primaries, the conservative votes had been split between Huckabee and Romney while Romney was in the race. Due to Huckabee's third-place standing in the delegate count and his refusal to concede, some prominent conservative pundits had charged that \\"a vote for Huckabee equals a vote for McCain\\", and that Huckabee's actions hinted to a possible bid to a vice presidency or cabinet position for Huckabee in McCain's administration, should McCain win the Presidency. McCain and Huckabee have had a cordial relationship during the campaign, which has been questioned by those who see Huckabee campaigning from a strong social conservative platform while McCain is seen by many as socially moderate or liberal. On Super Tuesday in West Virginia, McCain supporters threw their support to Huckabee, which resulted in a highly publicized Huckabee win early on Tuesday. Romney had been leading there in the polls prior to the primary. This strategy likely both increased the number of votes given to Huckabee and reduced the number that went to Romney of those voting Tuesday evening. The strategy appears to have been successful as Romney suspended his campaign two days later after a poor showing in Super Tuesday. Although the Romney campaign initially criticized the deal between McCain and Huckabee, Romney later threw his support behind McCain after dropping out of the race, stating that \\"This is a man capable of leading our country at a dangerous hour.\\" ==Lincoln-Douglas debate== On September 7, Huckabee sent an open letter to Fred Thompson inviting him to participate in a Lincoln-Douglas style debate. \\"I share your view of the debates and agree that Newt's 'Nine Nineties in Nine' concept is a far better way to make sure America's next President has the character and capacity to lead our nation forward, and that's why I have already signed that pledge,\\" Huckabee wrote in his letter. \\"I agree that what is needed is a real discussion by the candidates about their vision for the future of our country.\\" He suggested that the first debate be held in New Hampshire.Press Release: Mike Huckabee to Fred Thompson 9/07/07. Huckabee posted the letter on his campaign site and invited American voters to co-sign it as an appeal to Thompson to accept the challenge. In 72 hours it received nearly 2,000 signatures. The Strafford County Republican Women group agreed to host the debate and CNN's Wolf Blitzer suggested to Huckabee on The Late Edition that it be broadcast by CNN.Huckabee Eager to Debate Thompson 9/11/07. On September 11, the media reported that Thompson campaign had turned down the challenge, saying that they would \\"push hard for Lincoln-Douglas style debates once [they] get into the General Election, when there are only two candidates running.\\"Thompson Campaign Says No to Huckabee Debate Challenge Christian Broadcasting Network, 9/11/07 ==Financial struggles== In late January 2008, after finishing 2nd in the January 19 South Carolina primary, the Huckabee campaign faced significant financial setbacks, due to a decrease in cash flow expectations after not meeting the expectation of winning the first in the south primary. This caused Huckabee to ask some senior staff members to work without pay, and put uncertainty on the future of his campaign and how long Huckabee would be able to compete financially.Huckabee Broke Washington Prowler, January 22, 2008 ==Media== Mike Huckabee's campaign has used various forms of media to reach out to voters. Beginning in March 2007, Huckabee created a YouTube account to update followers of his campaign with videos. Since then, more than 90 videos have been posted.Huckabee at YouTube YouTube, March 30, 2007 Huckabee also initially formed a website at www.explorehuckabee.com, in which he based his exploratory committee.

In addition, Huckabee has created a Facebook page, in which he has over 30,000 supporters. Huckabee plays the bass guitar in a band known as Capitol Offense. He has performed with the band at numerous events throughout his campaign, including at a troop rally in New Hampshire in July.\\"Troop Rallies Held Across U.S.\\" Fox News, July 7, 2007 Earlier in 2007, the band played at a National Governors Association staff party in Des Moines, Iowa. On January 2, Huckabee played the guitar along with The Tonight Show Band on The Tonight Show with Jay Leno. During his campaign, Huckabee made frequent appearances on late night television shows including The Tonight Show with Jay Leno, the Late Show with David Letterman, Saturday Night Live, Late Night with Conan O'Brien, The Daily Show with Jon Stewart, The Late Late Show with Craig Ferguson and The Colbert Report. ==Popularity among young voters== Mike Huckabee generated a considerable following of young voters, primarily because of his support of the Fair Tax as well as his concerns about global warming, education, and several other issues typically not referred to by Republicans. Mike Huckabee Weighs In on Gay Rights... And Opening for Zeppelin? (MTV News, February 1, 2008) Most notable is the following Huckabee gathered among the younger crowd via the internet. Huck's Army, an online grassroots coalition and volunteer think tank, is largely composed of younger, more technologically savvy adherents. So productive was this group, that it received national media attention and was credited by Huckabee as \\"the secret weapon of our campaign.\\" Huckabee has also gained considerable popularity from his frequent appearances on The Daily Show, The Tonight Show with Jay Leno, and The Colbert Report, all of which have considerably younger viewers. In the early part of 2008, there was a comedic on-air \\"feud\\" between Conan O'Brien (host of Late Night with Conan O'Brien), Stephen Colbert (host of The Colbert Report), and later Jon Stewart (host of The Daily Show), with the three men taking credit for Huckabee's success and popularity among young voters, saying that they \\"made Huckabee\\".\\"Conan vs. Colbert: The Brawl\\".

On February 7, 2008, Huckabee made a trip to New York to appear on The Tyra Banks Show, a popular show with younger women, and later that night, went back on The Colbert Report to declare he was still a candidate in the race and played a game of air hockey with the host, Stephen Colbert. On February 23, 2008, Huckabee appeared on the Weekend Update portion of Saturday Night Live to explain why he was still in the election despite the \\"mathematical impossibility\\" of him winning the nomination. After an explanation by Seth Meyers about why he cannot win, Huckabee said that he would \\"not overstay his welcome\\" if he did not win the nomination. ==African-American support== In a debate, Huckabee claimed to have gained 48 percent of the black vote, a feat seldom reached by Republican candidates since the 1930s. However, this figure was based on a very small sample of blacks polled at exit polls; the actual number has been estimated at 20%. On January 21, 2008, Mike Huckabee received the endorsement of 50 African-American leaders in Atlanta, Georgia. Huckabee Courts Black Vote (CBS News, January 21, 2008) The endorsers cited Huckabee's record on life, education, minorities, the economy, the prison system, and immigration as Arkansas governor.

He received his bachelor's degree from Washington & Jefferson College, and his Ph.D at the University of the Witwatersrand, South Africa in 1984. His research focuses on the hominin fossil record, during the Pliocene and early Pleistocene and the reconstruction of phylogenetic relationships through dental morphology. Among his most important work has been the analysis of dental microwear in order to reconstruct early hominin dietary habits. Together with his former graduate student, David Strait, he has also published influential studies of early hominin phylogenetic relationships.

It was the city's first and only \\"locals casino\\". The Atlantic Club permanently closed on January 13, 2014, at 12:01 AM, largely as a result of dwindling casino visitors to Atlantic City due to increased competition in neighboring states. A third of Atlantic City's boardwalk casinos closed the same year, the others being Revel, Trump Plaza, and Showboat. Redevelopment proposals include a water park. On November 6, 2013, Atlantic Club owner Resorts International Holdings, itself owned by Colony Capital, filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy protection and a source revealed to the Wall Street Journal that a bankruptcy sale would occur. On December 23, 2013, Federal Bankruptcy Judge Gloria M. Burns approved the sale of Atlantic Club to Caesars Entertainment Corporation and Tropicana Entertainment. Tropicana acquired the gaming equipment and the data records of customers from Atlantic Club. Caesars acquired the real estate and non-gaming assets. This returned ownership of the property to Caesars Entertainment, which sold it nine years before to Colony Capital as part of its acquisition by Harrah's Entertainment. ==History== Golden Nugget (1980–1987) The Golden Nugget Hotel & Casino was built in 1980 by a partnership of Golden Nugget Companies and Michael R. Milken for $140 million. Steve Wynn bought the Strand Motel on Boston Avenue and the Boardwalk for $8.5 million and tore it down. Joel Bergman, who designed Wynn's other resorts, designed the Golden Nugget, and Atlandia Design managed the design, construction and furnishing of the original facility. It was Atlantic City's sixth casino after legalized gambling was passed in 1976. It had 506 rooms and at the time was the second smallest casino in the city. By 1983 it was the city's top earning casino. Its entertainment in the 500-seat Opera House included Frank Sinatra, Dean Martin, Sammy Davis, Jr., Dolly Parton, Lou Rawls and Don Rickles. Advertisements featured Wynn, including one where he delivered towels to Sinatra. It was Wynn's first major casino after establishing his reputation with resurrecting the Golden Nugget Las Vegas. Bally's Grand & The Grand (1987–1996) Wynn had high-profile squabbles with state officials, and in 1987 he sold the casino for $440 million to Bally Manufacturing, which changed the name to Bally's Grand Hotel and Casino. Frustrated with state gaming regulators, Wynn publicly vowed he would never return to Atlantic City, though he had hedged his rhetoric with the purchase of an area by the Atlantic City Marina. Wynn left Atlantic City to build The Mirage in Las Vegas that heralded the modern transformation of the Las Vegas Strip. Hilton (1996–2011) After the Hilton Hotels Corporation acquired Bally Entertainment, the property was renamed the Atlantic City Hilton. In 1998, Hilton Corporation spun off its casino properties into a new company initially called Park Place Entertainment. In 2000 Nicholas L. Ribis, in partnership with Colony Capital, LLC bought the poorly-performing Resorts Atlantic City for $140 million and created Resorts International Holdings. Then, in 2005, they set out to buy four casino properties across the U.S., including the Atlantic City Hilton, for a combined total of $1.24 billion. Through December 2009, Resorts Atlantic City and the Atlantic City Hilton were managed as a single entity named \\"Atlantic City Hilton and Resorts Atlantic City\\", whose president was Anthony Rodio. On December 10, 2009, it was announced that Resorts International was unable to pay the mortgage for the Resorts Atlantic City property and made a deal to have the loan canceled and surrender the property to RAC Atlantic City Holdings L.L.C. ACH Casino Resort (2011–2012) In June 2011, Hilton Hotels ended the licensing agreement with Colony Capital and the Hilton name was officially removed as the casino name, with the temporary name of the casino becoming ACH Casino Resort. The signage on the outside and inside of the casino was removed in the fall when the licensing agreement termination was approved. Its sister property, the Las Vegas Hilton also lost its agreement and changed its name to the LVH – Las Vegas Hotel & Casino in January 2012. The Atlantic Club (2012–2014) Exterior of the closed Atlantic Club, 2016. On February 7, 2012, the casino became a locals casino and re-branded as The Atlantic Club Casino Hotel. Renovations to the gaming floor and rooms began immediately in an effort to refresh and update the property. The new slogan also went into effect: \\"A casino for the rest of us.\\" In December 2012, the Rational Group, parent company of online gaming site PokerStars, was reported to be in discussions to buy the Atlantic Club for less than $50 million, spurred on by a bill under debate in New Jersey to legalize online gaming operations by casino owners. A purchase agreement was announced in January 2013, but was terminated in April after Rational missed a deadline for securing a temporary gaming license. On December 20, 2013, it was announced that the Atlantic Club Casino Hotel would close on January 13, 2014. Caesars Entertainment bought the property while Tropicana bought all the slot machines, gaming tables, and player databases in a joint bankruptcy purchase for $23.4 million combined. On May 29, 2014, Caesars Entertainment sold the Atlantic Club to TJM Properties, a Florida development firm that purchased and reopened the former Claridge Casino Hotel in Atlantic City earlier in the year. The reported Atlantic Club purchase price was $13.5 million. The firm planned to either reopen it as a non-gaming property, such as a hotel, or sell it. Future In 2015, redevelopment plans for the shuttered resort were proposed by Pennsylvania-based Endeavor Property Group, calling for a renovation of the existing buildings into a non-gaming resort featuring two indoor water parks. An 81,000-square-foot indoor water park would be built across the street from the Atlantic Club, on the block bordered by Pacific, Atlantic, Boston and Sovereign avenues, currently a surface parking lot used by the resort, as well as a smaller adult-oriented indoor water park fronting the boardwalk. The former casino space would be renovated convention space and a large arcade. The project was approved by the CRDA in July 2015; the CRDA is also planning a \\"Gateway Project\\" adjacent to the site, proposing office and academic redevelopment along Albany Avenue, including the site of the former Atlantic City High School. In March 2017, R & R Development Group agreed to purchase the property with the intention of converting it to a family entertainment center with a waterpark, but the deal fell through two months later because R & R could not obtain financing. In September 2018, Stockton University attempted to purchase the property to expand itself. It planned to keep the parking garage, but demolish the main structure. The deal fell through after TJM declined the sale. Later in the year in November 2018, a development group from New York was in talks to buy The Atlantic Club, but a deal never shaped up. In February 2019, a sale settlement was filed by the property's owner, TJM Properties, however they denied the sale of property. Most recently, in October 2019, the property was sold to Colesseo Atlantic City, Inc. On October 23, 2019, the owner hired a New Jersey based broker. ==Hotel== The Atlantic Club boasted 802 hotel rooms, all newly renovated in 2012.

David Halifax, the aspiring artist, has been granted an all-expense-paid trip by a mysterious and unknown benefactor, called the Levasseur Committee, in order to study painting. Unbeknownst to him, the true purpose behind his presence in Paris is part of an intricate plan in order to allow Halifax to reproduce priceless works of art before they are destroyed by the invading Nazi forces. ==Plot summary== When David Halifax arrives in Paris in 1939, he finds it a remarkable place, although artists are generally frowned upon and seen as idlers. His classes begin in an atelier, where Halifax is surprised to find only two other students, besides himself, sketching a picture of a nude woman posed on a stool. The teacher, a Russian named Alexander Pankratov, presents himself begrudgingly and carries himself around in an aloof and harshly critical manner yet possesses an unquestioned authority over whomever he meets. The other students introduce themselves, and warn Halifax that Pankratov may be a little deranged because of his eccentricities. The woman on the stool they are sketching is named Valya. She is about the only person who Pankratov seems to allow to do as they please. Later, Halifax learns that Valya is the adopted daughter of Pankratov, who was entrusted with her by his best friend during the Russian Revolution of 1917. Pankratov was an officer in the Tsar Nicholas II's White Army, but did not learn of his defeat until many years later. Valya harbors a deep-rooted dislike for Pankratov, yet displays obedience and praises his artistic genius. Halifax quickly tires of Pankratov's repeated insistence in sketching every day, and seeks time to complete his own works. He is successful in having Fleury sell some of his sketches, but is alarmed when he learns that Fleury has lied to the buyers, selling his reproductions as originals. While the fraud is forgotten, Halifax adapts well to Parisian life. Strangely, Pankratov has taken a liking in Halifax's sketches, and comments well on them. Balard and Marie-Claire reveal that Pankratov has never commended their work before. As Halifax falls into the routine of sketching, painting, and dining at the local cafe, there is much talk of the approaching war. He refuses to leave the city, believing that the Germans will never pass the French defense of the Maginot Line. The enemy, however, has maneuvered into the Ardennes Forest, completely bypassing the French line, and quickly pierces into Paris. Pankratov urges Halifax to leave when he still can, but Halifax refuses. One night, he and Fleury are arrested by a policeman named Tombeau on charges of fraud. Tombeau takes them to meet with Pankratov at the police station. Pankratov reveals that he, and the local cafe owner, are the mysterious Levasseur Committee, and that he has brought Halifax to Paris to teach him to forge art. Pankratov reveals that the Germans have burned hundreds of priceless originals during the war so far, and that he and Halifax, with the assistance of Fleury, are to impeccably forge originals, and to trade these to the Germans in return for their original paintings that otherwise would be destroyed. Halifax is shocked, and has no choice but to comply. The Germans arrive, and have seized control of the government. With them comes Dietrich, a ruthless collector for the Nazi government responsible for stockpiling art. A competitor, the ambassador to Paris named Abetz, is also in the process of acquiring art but for personal use. Halifax and Fluery meet with both men, and for several months trade forgeries for original paintings. Dietrich and Abetz detest each other immensely, and when Dietrich finds that Abetz has acquired a very valuable work, has him killed by Tombeau, who is masquerading as a gangster on the inside working for the Germans. For the next few years until the end of the war, Halifax and Fleury deal with solely with Dietrich, who has a French appraiser with him to look at the works. The appraiser can somehow see through the forgeries, but because of the frequent and acrid insults Dietrich throws at him, remains silent. On one instance, however, where Dietrich was given a real original painting as part of the plan to keep suspicion at bay, his appraiser tells him that it is a fraud. Dietrich has Halifax and Fleury arrested and taken to a torture chamber, but spares them when they agree to return the paintings that he had traded for the 'fraud'. Halifax feels bitter irony at seeing the only original labeled as a fake. The war tables start to turn when the Allied Forces invade Normandy. German officers are not as prevalent around Paris, and Dietrich begins to worry. Adolf Hitler has requested a specific original, a Johannes Vermeer painting named The Astronomer. Dietrich agrees to trade sixty originals, with works from such artists as Picasso, for the Astronomer. Halifax and Pankratov forge what was seen as impossible to copy, and deliver the painting on the day that all chaos has broken loose in Paris. Unknown to Halifax, Dietrich killed Fleury because he thought that Halifax had lied. Dietrich runs off with the painting, which never emerged again. He left the keys to a vault in which the sixty originals were hidden. Pankratov finds the only remaining painting that he had created, which was a portrait of Valya as a little girl. He clutches it, but when Tombeau arrives with his gangsters that he had been working with, and tells Halifax and Pankratov to leave the painting and run. The paintings are stolen by the gangsters, and most are never seen again. The story ends with Halifax returning to the United States after the war, and starting a family when he becomes an art teacher. He stays in touch with Pankratov, who dies some years later. Pankratov's sole surviving masterpiece emerges in an art auction, in which Halifax wins the painting in a bidding war with an unknown party. Halifax assumes that it is Dietrich, who has survived the war. ==Characters== *David Halifax – Born in Narragansett, Rhode Island, Halifax is the protagonist and an aspiring artist in Paris during World War II. *Alexander Pankratov - Born in Russia, Pankratov served in the White Army during the Russian Revolution of 1917. Once renowned for his art, Pankratov has been largely forgotten due to all but one of his works being completely obliterated in a fire. He teaches Halifax how to forge works of art to match the color, age, and other elements which make up originals. *Dietrich - Officer of the German Army who seeks original paintings from Halifax and Fleury. He is in competition with the German Ambassador to Paris, who he later has killed. Extremely ruthless and cunning, Dietrich does not stop in his acquisition of paintings, one of which Hitler himself has requested. He is in a love affair with Valya. *Valya Pankratov - Valya was given to Alexander Pankratov during the revolution since her mother was very sick and immobile, forcing her father to entrust Valya with Alexander once the Bolshevik forces were near. *Guillaume Fleury - A French art dealer who sells some of Halifax's work. He works with Halifax and Pankratov on the forgeries. Fleury also has an attraction to Valya, but because of his own poor looks, never obtains the courage to make that attraction known to her. *Tombeau - French policeman who acts as a liaison between Madame Pontier and Halifax. He is a character of dubious morality, as he murders the German ambassador while acting as a gangster working for Dietrich. Although he may have turned on Halifax in the end, he never once puts the lives of Halifax and Pankratov in danger, ensuring their safety throughout the ordeal. *Madame Pontier - Wealthy French art collector who is part of the project of hiding priceless paintings from the Nazis. *Artemis Balard - Student of Pankratov who has an affair with Marie- Claire. He is killed in battle after being forcibly drafted. *Marie-Claire de Boinville - Student of Pankratov who is in love with Balard. She later turns him into the French Army authorities for falsifying his medical records to evade the draft. *Madame La Roche - Landlady of Halifax and Fleury who dislikes painters, however, she later warms to Halifax when he becomes a long- term resident. ==Footnotes== Category:2000 American novels Category:Novels by Paul Watkins Category:Novels set in France Category:Novels about artists Category:Novels set during World War II ","title":"The Forger (Watkins novel)"},{"id":"12392759","text":"Ece Erken (born May 11, 1978) is a Turkish TV-hostess and actress. ==Biography== Ece Erken was born in the city of Samsun, Turkey in 1978.

The term umlaut was originally coined in connection with the study of Germanic languages, as it had occurred prominently in the history of many of them (see Germanic umlaut). While a common English plural is umlauts, the German plural is Umlaute. Umlaut is a form of assimilation, the process of one speech sound becoming more similar to a nearby sound. If a word has two vowels, one far back in the mouth and the other far forward, it takes more effort to pronounce. If the vowels were closer together, it would take less effort. Thus, one way the language may change is that these two vowels get be drawn closer together. In the general sense, umlaut is essentially the same as regressive metaphony. The most commonly seen types of umlaut are the following: *Vowel raising, triggered by a following high vowel (often specifically a high front vowel such as /i/). *Vowel fronting, triggered by a following front vowel (often specifically a high front vowel such as /i/). *Vowel lowering, triggered by a following non-high vowel (often specifically a low vowel such as /a/). *Vowel rounding, triggered by a following rounded vowel (often specifically a high rounded vowel such as /u/). These processes may be named by the vowel that triggers the change (for example, i-mutation, a-mutation, u-mutation, sometimes known as i-umlaut, a-umlaut, u-umlaut). However, processes named in this fashion may not have consistent meanings across language families. All of these processes occurred in the history of the Germanic languages; see Germanic umlaut for more details. I-mutation is the most prominent of the processes, to the extent that it is often referred to simply as \\"umlaut\\".

The Zizhi Tongjian placed their deaths in 655. See Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 200.), was a concubine of Emperor Gaozong of Tang (Li Zhi). She was initially favored by him and bore him a son and two daughters -- Li Sujie and the Princesses Yiyang and Gao'an—but later, after her romantic rival Empress Wang introduced another concubine, Consort Wu (later known as Wu Zetian), to Emperor Gaozong, Emperor Gaozong became enamored with Consort Wu. Empress Wang and Consort Xiao instead joined forces to try to counter Consort Wu, but in 655, Emperor Gaozong deposed both of them on accusations of witchcraft and replaced Empress Wang with Consort Wu. Soon, they were executed on the new Empress Wu's orders. == Background == Little is known about Consort Xiao's background. What is known is that she was already a concubine of Li Zhi when he was crown prince under his father Emperor Taizong, as her son Li Sujie was born in 645, before his ascension in 649. While she was a concubine to the crown prince, she carried the title of Liangdi (良娣). In addition to Li Sujie, she bore two daughters, who were probably older than Li Sujie.That the two princesses were older than Li Sujie could be inferred from the fact that later, when their younger brother by Empress Wu, Li Hong, requested Emperor Gaozong to let them marry, they were described to be already at least 39 years old, and this request was probably made in 671. See Old Book of Tang, vol. 86 and New Book of Tang, vol. 81 . However, Zizhi Tongjian stated that the princesses were \\"over 29\\" at the time, which would still make them older than Li Sujie. See Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 202. It was also said that she was favored by him, more so than his wife Crown Princess Wang. == As imperial consort == In 649, after Emperor Taizong died, Li Zhi took the throne (as Emperor Gaozong). He created Crown Princess Wang empress, and he created Consort Xiao the rank of Shufei, the second highest rank for imperial concubines. She continued to be favored, which drew jealousy from Empress Wang, and Empress Wang's jealousy soon caused both of them to face a different romantic rival. When Emperor Gaozong was crown prince, he had been attracted by the beauty of one of Emperor Taizong's concubines, Consort Wu. After Emperor Taizong's death, all of his concubines who did not bear sons were housed at Ganye Temple (感業寺) to be Buddhist nuns. In either 650 or 651,The modern historian Bo Yang, based on the fact that Empress Wu's oldest son Li Hong was born in 652, fixed the date of this incident as 650, but 651 is also a possibility. See Bo Yang Edition of Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 47. when Emperor Gaozong was visiting Ganye Temple to offer incense to Buddha, when he saw Consort Wu. Both of them wept. When Empress Wang heard this, she, wanting to divert Emperor Gaozong's favor from Consort Xiao, secretly instructed Consort Wu to grow her hair back, while suggesting to Emperor Gaozong that he take her as a concubine. Consort Wu was intelligent and full of machinations, and therefore, when she first returned to the palace, she acted humbly and flattered Empress Wang, who trusted her greatly and recommended her to Emperor Gaozong. Soon, Emperor Gaozong became enamored with Consort Wu. Both Empress Wang and Consort Xiao lost favor, and soon, they realized the seriousness of the situation and joined forces to try to alienate Consort Wu from Emperor Gaozong, but were unsuccessful. In 654, Consort Wu framed Empress Wang for the death of her daughter, and in 655 further accused Empress Wang and her mother Lady Liu of using witchcraft. Emperor Gaozong deposed both Empress Wang and Consort Xiao, reducing them to commoner rank and imprisoning them inside the palace. == Death and aftermath == Six days after Empress Wang's removal, Consort Wu was created empress. Empress Wang and Consort Xiao were put under arrest inside the palace, at a building that had its doors and windows tightly sealed, with only a hole on the wall to deliver food. One day, Emperor Gaozong thought of them and decided to visit them, and when he saw the conditions they were in, he was saddened, calling out, \\"Empress, Shufei, where are you?\\" Empress Wang wept and responded, \\"We have been found guilty and reduced to be maidservants. How can we still be referred to by honored titles?\\" She also begged, \\"If Your Imperial Majesty considered our past relationships and will allow us to again see the light of day, please rename this place 'Huixin Courtyard' [(回心院, meaning \\"the courtyard of a returned heart\\")].\\" Emperor Gaozong was initially receptive, responding, \\"I will do so right away.\\" However, when Empress Wu heard this, she was enraged, and she sent people to cane Empress Wang and Consort Xiao 100 times each and cut off their hands and feet. She then had them put into large wine jars, saying, \\"Let these two witches be drunk to their bones!\\"This account is per the New Book of Tang, which the Zizhi Tongjian accepted, but the Old Book of Tang indicated that they were strangled. Compare New Book of Tang, vol. 76 and Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 200 with Old Book of Tang, vol. 51 . When Empress Wang was informed the orders, she bowed and stated, \\"May His Imperial Majesty live forever, and may Zhaoyi [(昭儀, Empress Wu's title as a concubine, implicitly refusing to acknowledge her as empress)] be favored forever. Dying is within my responsibility.\\" However, Consort Xiao cursed Empress Wu, \\"Wu is a treacherous monster! May it be that I be reincarnated as a cat and she be reincarnated as a mouse, so that I can, for ever and ever, grab her throat.\\" Empress Wang and Consort Xiao suffered for several days inside the wine jars before dying, and Empress Wu had their bodies taken out of the jars and beheaded. (When Empress Wu heard of Consort Xiao's curse, she forbad the palace personnel from keeping cats as pets, but thereafter often dreamed of Empress Wang and Consort Xiao, with scattered hair and bleeding limbs, seeking to kill her. She thereafter initially moved to Penglai Palace (蓬萊宮), but continued to dream of them, and therefore eventually spent most of her time in the eastern capital Luoyang and not in the capital Chang'an, where these events occurred.) Soon after Empress Wang's and Consort Xiao's deaths, at Empress Wu's urging, Emperor Gaozong also had Empress Wang's and her clan's surname changed from Wang (王, a typical surname meaning \\"king\\" or \\"monarch\\") to Mang (蟒, meaning \\"python\\") and Consort Xiao's and her clan's surname changed from Xiao (萧, another typical surname meaning \\"sad\\" or \\"calm\\") to Xiao (梟, meaning \\"owl\\"). Only after Empress Wu's own death in 705 were their clans' proper surnames restored. On the orders of Empress Wu, Both of Consort Xiao's daughters, who by now carried the titles of Princess Yiyang and Princess Gao'an, were put under house arrest inside the palace, and were not allowed to marry. Not until Empress Wu's oldest son, the crown prince Li Hong interceded, probably in 671, were they allowed to marry—and even then, Empress Wu simply found two imperial guards, Quan Yi (權毅) (for Princess Yiyang) and Wang Xu (王勗) (for Princess Gao'an) to marry them immediately. Meanwhile, Li Sujie was allowed to be an imperial prince but continuously drew Empress Wu's hatred, causing him to be demoted and put under close watch a number of times, This situation soon worsened with the rise of Empress Wu in the affairs of the whole country with the illness of Emperor Gaozong, and he was eventually killed on the orders of Empress Wu (who by then was empress dowager and regent) in 690. == Modern Depictions == * Portrayed by Chan Choi Yin in the 1984 Hong-Kong TV series Empress Wu. * Portrayed by Kung Lien Hua in the 1985 Taiwanese TV series The Empress of the Dynasty. * Portrayed by Yu Hui in the 1995 Chinese TV series Wu Zetian. * Portrayed by Jessie Chang in the 2003 Chinese TV series Lady Wu: The First Empress. * Portrayed by Xie Jin Tian in the 2006 Chinese TV series Wu Zi Bei Ge. * Portrayed by Ban Min-jung in 2006-2007 SBS TV series Yeon Gaesomun. * Portrayed by Li Na in the 2011 TV series Secret History of Empress Wu. * Portrayed by Sui Jun Bo in the 2011 Chinese TV series Meng Hui Tang Chao. * Portrayed by Cao Xiwen in the 2011 Chinese TV series Beauty World. * Portrayed by Zhang Xinyu in the 2014 Chinese TV series The Empress of China. * Portrayed by Li Wen Wen (though her character is renamed \\"Consort Xu) in the 2014 Chinese TV series Young Sherlock. * Portrayed by Liu Hai Lan in the 2017 Chinese TV series Legendary Di Renjie. == Notes and references == * Old Book of Tang, vol. 51 . * New Book of Tang, vol. 76 . * Zizhi Tongjian, vols. 199, 200.

It was declared a National Historic Landmark in 1970, primarily for its architecture. and ==History== Richard Snowden originally migrated to America in 1658 from Birmingham, England, where his family had settled for many years after originating in Wales. Richard the immigrant had a son, Richard (1719–1753), who had a son, Richard the \\"iron master\\" (d. 1763).Hammond 1914, p. 101 Richard the iron master acquired much wealth through an iron forge, mining local iron. Richard then had a son, Thomas (1722–1770), who had a son Major Thomas (1751–1803), so called because of his service in the American Revolution. Major Thomas married Anne Ridgely, who was raised at an earlier estate named Montpelier in Fulton, Maryland, and built the Mansion circa 1783. Their son Nicholas Snowden, who had been born at the mansion in 1786, was its next owner, until he died in 1831. (His son Nicholas N. Snowden, also born at the mansion, became a farmer next to Avondale Mill, and died at Manassas while serving in the 1st Maryland Infantry, CSA.) The home then passed to Nicholas' daughter Julianna Maria who married Dr. Theodore Jenkins there in 1835. Dr. Jenkins died in 1866 and upon Mrs. Jenkins' later death, the mansion passed to her children who kept ownership in the family until 1890. The home was later owned by speculative investors W.P. Davis and Martin W. Chollar. In 1895, it was sold to Josephine D. Taylor of New York as a summer home. Its title went to Lewis H. Blakeman of New York in 1900, then to New York writer Edmund H. Pendleton who lived there from 1905 until his death in 1910, having made it his winter home. Pendleton's estate sold the mansion to Otto V. von Schrader in 1911. After a succession of other owners, mansion ownership transferred in 1928 to Breckinridge Long, Undersecretary of State under Franklin D. Roosevelt and United States Ambassador to Italy from 1933 to 1936. Long's daughter Christine L. Willcox, the mansion's last private owner, donated the property to the Maryland-National Capital Park and Planning Commission in 1961. It was shown to the public as part of the U.S. Bicentennial celebrations in 1976. The same year, a barn budgeted to become a public arts center was destroyed by arson. The Mansion was renovated in the 1980s with funds from a state grant. The historic home was opened as a public tourist attraction in 1985, reflecting its ownership by Nicholas Snowden in 1830. The mansion can be rented for conferences and weddings and the grounds serve as a cultural center, hosting special exhibitions and performances. ==Famous visitors== *Abigail Adams *Franklin D.

The paneling in the drawing room conceals a secret doorway leading to a set of stairs. In 1970, the house was set in formal gardens. Three terraces were outlined in boxwood hedges and arranged as an allée. A boxwood maze near the south wing was stated to be more than 200 years old. Most of the boxwood hedges have since been removed.

Musher were among his patrons and he repeatedly reported that his works were eagerly sought after by preachers. He generally published only sermons because he knew that most American Jews would not read his more scholarly works and because \\"many rabbis and sages from other countries write to me that my approach to Aggadah is the only one that can be used to influence the masses and lure them to their Father in heaven\\" (Mesamhai Lev, St. Louis, 1925, pp. 5–6). A vocal opponent of non-Orthodox synagogues, seminaries and rabbis, his sermons contain many polemical statements. He later sent two of his sons to study in Jerusalem and, after visiting the Land of Israel (ca. 1921), he announced that he would soon be immigrating there (Darke be-Kodesh, St. Louis, 1922, pp. 4, 6). Though he was unable to carry out his plans right away (Doresh Tov, St. Louis, 1923, p. 5), he did visit again within a year, this time together with Rabbi Zevi Hirsch Masliansky. He finally settled in Jaffa by the end of the summer of 1923 and he was invited to preach a number of times at the Neveh Tzedek synagogue. A few months later, however, he was compelled to return to Washington because his wife became ill. Attempts to settle in Safed in 1936 and in Jerusalem between 1938 and 1939 failed as well and he returned to America each time. He returned once more a few years later, this time remaining until his death in 1944. He was buried on the Mount of Olives. ==Involvement in Jewish Society== Rabbi Silverstone was a vice president of the Agudath Harabbonim, a director of the Hebrew Sanitarium of Denver and the Hebrew Home for the Aged of Washington, D.C., and a member of B'nai B'rith. He also founded the first Talmud Torah in Washington, D.C. and many of his sermons refer to the poor state of Jewish education. An active Zionist, Silverstone attended the Sixth Zionist Congress in 1903 as a delegate from Belfast. ==Family== Rabbi Silverstone was a grandson of Rabbi Elijah Abramsky, a nephew of Rabbi Chaim Zev Hirsh Braude, the father of Rabbi Dr. Harry Silverstone, a cousin to Rabbi Zelig Reuben Bengis; an in-law of Rabbi Gershom Ravinson of Cleveland, Ohio. ==References== *Goldman, Yosef.

His real name was Jacopo di Arcangelo. The nickname Sellaio derives from the profession of his father, a saddler. According to Vasari, Sellaio was a pupil of Fra Filippo Lippi at the same time as Sandro Botticelli, who became a lasting influence on him. He joined the Florentine painters' confraternity the Compagnia di San Luca in 1460, and by 1472 he was sharing a workshop with Biagio d'Antonio. In 1473 he formed a partnership with Filippo di Giuliano which he maintained until his death in 1493. In 1490 Sellaio and Filippo took on a third partner, Zanobi di Giovanni. Neither Filippo nor Zanobi's extant works have been identified, but the former is sometimes identified with the anonymous painter known as the Master of the Fiesole Epiphany. Today Sellaio is best known for paintings from the fronts of cassoni, or wedding chests. His most famous such commission is the Morelli and Nerli pair of 1472 (now London, Courtauld Institute Gallery), manufactured by the carpenter Zanobi di Domenico and painted in collaboration with Biagio d'Antonio. Sellaio's three panels with the Story of Esther, now in the Uffizi Gallery, Florence, also belonged to a pair of cassoni along with two other panels now in the Museum of Fine Arts, Budapest and the Louvre, Paris. Sellaio produced a large number of devotional panels intended for domestic interiors, including many of the Saint Jerome and Saint John the Baptist. His altarpieces include two panels of the Annunciation for Santa Lucia de' Magnoli, Florence, painted around 1473; a Pietà commissioned in 1483 for the chapel of the Compagnia di San Frediano, called La Brucciata, in the Florentine church of the same name (later at the Kaiser Friedrich Museum, Berlin, and destroyed in 1945); and a Crucifixion, painted in 1490-93 for another chapel in San Frediano, now in the church of seventeenth-century church of San Frediano in Cestello, Florence. Sellaio's son, Arcangelo (1477/78-1531), was also a painter. His works were formerly attributed to the anonymous Master of the Miller Tondo. == Selected works == *1472 – The Morelli-Nerli Cassone, wood cassone decorated with paintings (Courtauld Institute Galleries) *ca 1473 – Annunciation (church of Santa Lucia dei Magnoli, Florence) *ca 1475/80 – Story of Cupid and Psyche, two panels (Fitzwilliam Museum; private collection) *1470s – Madonna and Child with Saints Lucy, Sebastian, John the Baptist and Catherine (Ackland Art Museum) *1480 – Saint John the Baptist, (National Gallery of Art) *1480s – Saint Jerome and Saint Francis (El Paso Museum of Art) *1483-86 – Pietà with Saints Fridian and Jerome (formerly Kaiser Friedrich Museum, Berlin; destroyed in 1945) *1480/85 – Votive Altarpiece: The Trinity, the Virgin, St. John and Donors (The National Museum of Western Art) *ca 1485 – Saint John the Baptist (Museum of Fine Arts) *ca 1485 – Madonna and Child with the Infant, Saint John the Baptist and Attending Angel, oil on panel (Fine Arts Museums of San Francisco) *ca 1485 – The Legend of Brutus and Portia, oil on panel (Fine Arts Museums of San Francisco) *1480s – The Reconciliation of the Romans and Sabines, tempera and gold on panel (Philadelphia Museum of Art) *ca 1485-90 - Death of Eurydice; Eurydice Taken to Hades; Orpheus Playing Among the Animals, three panels (Museum Boijmans Van Beuningen, Rotterdam; Khanenko Museum of Art, Kiev; Wawel Castle, Cracow) *ca 1490 – Scenes from the Story of Esther (Uffizi Gallery; Museum of Fine Arts; Louvre) *1490-93 – Crucifixion with the Virgin and Saints Fridian, Catherine of Alexandria, John the Evangelist, Sebastian, Tobias and the Angel and Lawrence (church of San Frediano in Cestello, Florence). == References  External links == *Sellaio biography at the Web Gallery of Art *Italian Paintings: Florentine School, a collection catalog containing information about Sellaio and his works (see pages: 170-171; MMA #41.100.10).

The island is mostly woodland and cliffs. It marks the entrance to Howe Sound, and the ferry between Horseshoe Bay to Nanaimo regularly passes it. The island borrows a postal code, V7W 1V7, from the wealthiest community in Canada, West Vancouver. However, Passage Island is actually overseen by the Islands Trust and is part of the Greater Vancouver Regional District. It is isolated from West Vancouver by approximately of ocean. Prior to European colonization, the island was home to a Squamish village named Mi'tlmetle'lte. It was named by Captain Vancouver because is lies midway in the passage, Queen Charlotte channel, between Point Atkinson and Bowen Island. In 1893, the island was sold for a dollar an acre by a banker named Keith, and was later bought in the late 1960s by a developer named Phil Matty. \\"No utilities, no garbage trucks, no telephones, no fire stations, no policemen, no industry—just 32 acres of beautiful British Columbia. I escaped to that paradise for a few hours each week to move rocks, saw logs, watch the tide come in and go out—all in the name of therapeutic basket weaving. It was like having my own personal psychiatrist. I loved it. I loved it so much that I bought it.\\" Today the island has 61 lots, almost half of which are developed. Although many lots consist of summer cottages, there are a few year-round homes with full-time residents. The island has views of downtown Vancouver, the University of British Columbia campus, Vancouver Island, and the snow-capped mountains of Howe Sound. There are no developed roads nor vehicles on the island. Most of the homes use solar photovoltaics, with a few complemented by wind turbines for electric power. Propane is used for heating and cooking, and rainwater is captured into cisterns from their roofs. Island residents either tie their boats to mooring buoys and row to shore, or provide their own private docks for island access. Public access onto the island is not provided. The southernmost tip is a small private island, the pinnacle of \\"Passage Island\\".

This status is exhibited through the sociolinguistic behaviours of a mother-tongue speaker. A speaker who exhibits positive vernacular orientation is one who exhibits a preferred status for their mother tongue in such things as patterns of language use, language attitudes, social networks and even levels of language proficiency. Likewise, a speaker who exhibits negative vernacular orientation is one who exhibits a preferred status for a language other than their mother tongue in these areas of sociolinguistic behaviour.

This is a study on vernacular orientation in the Talysh community of the city of Sumgayit in the Republic of Azerbaijan for the purpose of gaining a greater understanding of its causes. Vernacular orientation is described in three areas of sociolinguistic behaviour: patterns of vernacular language use, vernacular language proficiency and frequency of vernacular-speaking individuals in social networks. Data was collected through personal interviews. The questionnaires for these interviews were developed using a qualitative-relational research approach. The description of vernacular orientation takes the form of a criteria-based typology of which an analysis of influential factors is ultimately made.

Toei Animation announced at the Tokyo Anime Fair on March 23, 2006 that an animated film would be produced, and was released in Japanese theaters on September 15, 2007. The film is a reinterpretation of the Clannad storyline which centers on the story arc of the female lead Nagisa Furukawa. It was the final film directed by Dezaki before his death in April 2011. A promotional campaign took to the streets of Akihabara on March 10, 2007 transported in a large black bus with the words painted on the sides. A group of young women cosplaying in the female high school uniform from Clannad emerged from the bus to hand out flyers and pink and white colored thundersticks to passersby to promote the film. ==Plot== Tomoya Okazaki is a male third-year high school student who does not feel at home anymore. He used to play basketball, his distant father works the night shift, and his mother died in an accident when he was a child. He simply goes to school in Hikarizara for no reason and does not have any interest in school activities. One day, Tomoya meets a third-year girl from his school early in the year named Nagisa Furukawa. Nagisa is repeating her last year due to illness most of the previous year, and she does not know what to do. Tomoya suggests she finds something new to do at school, and she comes up with restarting the Drama Club. By the time the sakura trees are done blooming, Nagisa has already started hand-making posters advertising the drama club's reformation, with an old group mascot called \\"The Big Dango Family\\". Tomoya and his good friend Youhei Sunohara, who used to play soccer, help Nagisa with putting them up around the school, but the student council president, Tomoyo Sakagami, and Kyou Fujibayashi, quickly go around using red paint to deface the posters and write 'invalid' on them because of school policy. This angers Youhei greatly and he beats up one of the student council members despite Tomoyo and Kyou's warning; Tomoya also takes a stand for Nagisa. Kouko Ibuki, the teacher who had been the adviser for the drama club before it disbanded, gets involved by telling Nagisa that if she can gather more members then she will talk to the school about reforming the club. Tomoya and Youhei try again by this time making copies of hundreds of posters and putting them all around the school, but no one joins the club. In the end, Nagisa gets Tomoya and Youhei to sign up, and she reassures them that she will not ask them to act on stage. The drama club is reformed, and with a month left until the school festival. Nagisa decides to do a soliloquy based on a dream she has had ever since she was a child; meanwhile, Tomoya and Youhei will work backstage with the music and lights respectively. Nagisa gets to writing the script, and invites Tomoya and Youhei over to her house for dinner, though only Tomoya comes, due to Youhei taking up a part-time job at an electrical company with Yusuke Yoshino; a former musician revealed to be Kouko's fiancé. At Nagisa's house, which turns out to double as a bakery, Tomoya meets her energetic parents Akio and Sanae. Tomoya is challenged to a baseball match with Akio to see if Tomoya's a man worthy for Nagisa, but cannot throw the ball due to an injured shoulder he received from his father in a bad fight, and even gets to stay overnight after being heavily persuaded by Akio. Like Nagisa, Tomoya has also had a recurring dream ever since he was a child. In his dream, he initially is disembodied in an illusionary world where he is the only thing \\"alive\\". He finds a discarded human-sized doll and uses it as a body to travel around the world on an old bicycle. After some searching, he finds a large sakura tree known as the \\"Tree of Promises\\" where he believes he will meet the person he has felt is with him in this illusionary world. When the school festival finally begins, Nagisa reveals that she has not finished the script, but still wants to go on with the play since the story is still within her. Nagisa has her performance in the evening, so in the meantime Nagisa hangs out with Tomoya and Youhei. During lunch, she tells them her story why she wanted to do drama was due to her parents formally having been theater actors, but they both had to give up acting after Nagisa was born. Nagisa wants to do drama so as to continue her parents' dreams in her footsteps. For the play, Sanae gives Nagisa her wedding dress to use as her costume, much to Akio's surprise. Nagisa starts with her monologue without a hitch, and during her recitation Kouko gives stage directions to Tomoya and Youhei via headsets. Gradually, Tomoya comes to realize that the story Nagisa is reciting is the same dream that he has had, and is shocked to find that Nagisa also had the same dream of the illusionary world. At the play's conclusion, Tomoya believes that he and Nagisa were meant to be together and confesses his love to her. Shortly after the festival, Nagisa's health falters once again and she has to take another leave of absence from school, meaning it is not until a year after Tomoya's class graduated that Nagisa is able to graduate high school as well. After this, Tomoya and Nagisa start living together in a small apartment in town while Tomoya is recruited full-time at Yusuke's electrical company as well, Nagisa works part-time as a waitress at a local family restaurant, and Youhei becomes a businessman in Tokyo. Eventually, Nagisa becomes pregnant, but her doctor informs her family and Tomoya that if she gives birth to the child, due to having weak constitution, she may die in the process. After the meeting, they agree on telling Nagisa. Tomoya and Nagisa's parents take her to the beach where she decides the name Ushio for the child. Despite the doctor's warning, she insists that she will be fine. One winter night, Nagisa finally gives birth to a baby girl Ushio and Nagisa dies giving birth. This causes Tomoya to go into deep depression, during which he does not go to work, or even visit his daughter who is now being raised by Nagisa's parents. For the past five years, Tomoya's friends try to get him out of his depression, but Tomoya is very stubborn. Then one rainy night, Tomoya's father Naoyuki Okazaki comes over and tells Tomoya that he is putting Ushio in the same relationship he did when his mother died, which greatly stuns him. Later, Naoyuki requested Tomoya's friends: Youhei, Tomoyo, Kyou, Kouko and her husband Yusuke to take him out on a retreat for a few days in order to break his depression, and they take Tomoya out of his house so fast he does not even know what is going on. Once they tell him on the train, Tomoya is dead set on going back home but Yusuke convinces him to stay. When they arrive at their destination, Tomoya searches for another platform at the station, anticipating this, Akio and Sanae were waiting for him with Ushio. Just as Tomoya begins to walk away, his friends arrive blocking his way, then Tomoya turns around back at Ushio, she runs towards him holding a stuffed dango. She trips midway which makes Tomoya leap out and catch her. Picking her up with them smiling, he is able to see the continuation of his old dream once more, and sees Nagisa under the Tree of Promises smiling lovingly at him and Ushio. ==Production== The film was first announced to be in production at the Tokyo Anime Fair on March 23, 2006 for a planned 2007 release by Toei Animation. The original character design was conceived by Itaru Hinoue, the art director from Key who worked on the visual novel. This design was later used as a template for Megumi Kadonosono who provided the character art for the film adaptation. Kadonosono previously worked on two other animated films released in early 2007: Fashionable Witches Love and Berry: Magic of Happiness as the chief animation director, and the Kiddy Grade film, also providing the character design. The screenplay was written by Makoto Nakamura who had worked on the first Kanon anime television series in 2002, and the Air film in 2005, two other anime adapted from visual novels originally made by Key. Finally, the film was directed by Osamu Dezaki, who has been involved with animation direction since the first Astro Boy anime in 1963, and went on to direct the Air film. ==Media releases== DVDs A set of three DVDs packaged together contained preview footage and promotional material that was released on April 28, 2007, which came bundled with a promotional poster. The main feature was a nearly nine-minute teaser for the film which provided a general overview of the important characters and revealed some of the plot. Another video is a short one-minute-fifteen-second piece compiling scenes from the film that come together as a backdrop to the original version of the song \\"Mag Mell\\" taken from the visual novel's original soundtrack. The last two videos included are short television commercials, one thirty seconds in length, and the second fifteen seconds. The DVD set was only available to those who pre-ordered film tickets. The film was released on DVD in three editions: the Collector's Edition, the Special Edition, and the Regular Edition on March 7, 2008. The Collector's Edition is sold in a specialized box including, with a special illustrated jacket, a picture label, and a deluxe booklet. The Special Edition was similarly released in a box set containing the film DVD, along with the special illustrated jacket and the picture label, but also contained a bonus drama CD, and a bonus DVD. The Regular Edition contained no special features and was sold in a normal DVD case containing only the film DVD. Anime licensor Sentai Filmworks licensed the film and released the film in both English-subtitled and dubbed format in March 2011. Music A maxi single entitled was released on July 14, 2007 by Frontier Works containing the two theme songs to the film arranged by Eufonius. The first track is an arranged version of \\"Mag Mell\\", the opening theme to the original visual novel, sung by Riya. The second track is an original song, again sung by Riya. The final track is an off vocal version of the first track. The music CD was only available to those who pre-ordered film tickets. An image song single by Lia named \\"Yakusoku\\" was released at Comiket 72 on August 17, 2007, but was only given to those who bought film tickets in advance.

He graduated from Wabash College in Crawfordsville in 1842 at the age of 17. In 1845, he graduated from Indiana University in Bloomington, Indiana, with a degree in law. Wilson served in the United States military during the Mexican–American War from June 17, 1846, to June 16, 1847. After he turned to Crawfordsville in 1847, Wilson worked in the law office of Tilghman Howard (later the namesake of one of his sons), and he was admitted to the bar in 1848. Wilson became actively involved in politics in the mid-1850s, and he was a member of the newly formed Republican Party. In 1856, Wilson decided to run for the seat of 8th District Indiana Representative. During the election, Wilson defeated Daniel Wolsey Voorhees, and Wilson officially became a member of Congress on March 4, 1857. During the congressional election of 1858, Wilson was reelected.

A rapid detection of acoustic signals and the omnidirectional feature of the sense of hearing can contribute to the effectiveness of an auditory display even when vision is available. On the other hand, sound output may interfere with other acoustic signals, such as speech communication. This complicates the use of auditory displays for certain applications.

Rabbi Kaplan was well-versed in the Talmud and the poskim as well as in kabbalah and Acharonim. Yet, he refused to render halachic decisions (except for one occasion when it was a matter of life and death) and held the humble position of shammash (sexton) in the Synagogue Chevra Shas. His piety, simplicity of life, and dedication to the community earned him recognition among the Russian Jewry. ==Biography== Rabbi Nachum was born in Baisogala to Uziel Kaplan, a laborer in a whisky distillery, and his wife, Meida. In his youth, he studied under Rabbi Karpl Atlas of Baisogala (grandfather of Rabbi Meir Atlas) and his sons, Binyamin Beinush and Meir. Later he studied at Šiauliai under Rabbi Mordechai Ganker, and afterwards at the yeshiva of Rabbi Chalavna Lapidus, the maggid of Luokė, after which he studied at Vilnius. At age 19, he decided to leave Vilnius in order to study at Ashmyany under Rabbi Avraham Kahana of Horodna (known today as Grodno). After studying for a while at Ashmyany, he went on to study at the Yeshiva of Mir. When he was about twenty years old, he married Itta, the daughter of Yosef Eliezer (a chimney sweep by trade) of Nesvizh, and moved into the latter's home in Nesvizh. Throughout the day, he studied Gemara, halacha, and works of hashkafah such as Chovot HaLevavot and Menoras HaMaor until he committed them to memory. When he was in his early twenties, he decided to leave Nesvizh and traveled to Valozhyn, where he studied at the Volozhin Yeshiva under Rabbi Eliezer Yitzchak Freid. Afterwards, he headed for Kaunas where he studied Gemara and halacha under the rav of the city, Rabbi Menachem Mendel Rabinowitz. He also studied Midrash and Aggadah under Rabbi Eliyahu Ragoler of Slabodka. During this time, he traveled to Torez where he studied the teachings of the Vilna Gaon under a student of Rabbi Chaim of Volozhin. Afterwards, he returned to Nesvizh and a short while later he moved to Horodna. During the almost fifty years that he lived there, he was offered many prominent positions. Yet, he refused opportunities for leadership in public life, choosing instead the position of shammash in the Synagogue Chevra Shas in Horodna, a position he retained for the rest of his life. In the last years of his life, he suffered from a serious spinal disorder, a severe intestinal ailment, swelling of the feet, and other discomforts. Yet, on Simchat Torah, he led the congregation in spirited singing and dancing, clutching a Sefer Torah in one arm while his free hand held his stomach to ease the pain. A Hebrew language biography of Rabbi Nachum was written by Rabbi Yisrael David Miller who knew Rabbi Nachum personally. Rabbi Miller was stricken by the cholera pandemic that struck Horodna in 1872 and firmly believed that Rabbi Nachum's prayers saved his life. Rabbi Nachum died at Grodno on October 25, 1879. Twenty thousand people attended his funeral which took place the next day. His son-in-law was Rabbi Gavriel Zev Margolis. ==References== Category:1811 births Category:1879 deaths Category:People from Grodno Category:Lithuanian Orthodox rabbis Category:Russian Orthodox rabbis Category:19th-century rabbis Category:Date of birth missing ","title":"Nachum Kaplan"},{"id":"12393655","text":"Bennett \\"Benny\\" Marshall (November 6, 1919 \\\\- September 25, 1969) was a ten- time winner of the Alabama Sportswriter of the Year from the National Sportscasters and Sportswriters Association.

They are known as a producer of canned salmon and tuna, and also supply mackerel, sardine, herring, brisling, anchovies and shellfish. ==History== The original company was founded by T. L. Pelling and C. H. Stanley, who created Pelling Stanley and Company in 1857. The company soon specialized in importing canned food, which at the time was a novel product. By 1879, they were importing canned salmon from the John West company in Oregon, USA. Pelling Stanley purchased the rights to use the John West name in 1888. The first shipments of John West Salmon appeared in 1892. By 1924, the three companies, operating separately, were all associated with Unilever: *Angus Watson and Co. *R B Green and Co. *Pelling Stanley and Company By 1964, Unilever had merged the three into one company, John West Foods. Branches were expanded to Australia and Africa in 1974. In 1997, Heinz acquired the brand and the majority of the John West Food company operations, excluding those in Australia, New Zealand and South Africa which continued to be part of Unilever. In June 2003, Simplot Australia bought the John West canned fish business in Australia from Unilever Australasia.http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2003/06/20/1055828492225.html Retrieved 2017-09-04 In March 2006, Heinz sold its European Seafoods business to French-based MW Brands, itself owned by Lehman Brothers banking group, for EUR 425 million. In 2010, Thailand-based seafood processing company Thai Union Group bought MWBrands, becoming the world's largest canned-tuna producer. ==Sustainability issues== John West canned fish John West states that their salmon, mackerel and sardine products are certified to the Marine Stewardship Council's (MSC) standard for a well-managed and sustainable fishery, and that every can in these ranges carries the Marine Stewardship Council logo. John West also states that they do not sell endangered or critically endangered species from the International Union Conservation of Nature Red List, have never sold blue fin tuna, which is the subject of numerous campaigns from NGOs due to its endangered status from overfishing, that all seafood products are caught in accordance with the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS), and are not bought from IUU (Illegal, Unreported, Unregulated) vessels, neither does it buy any fish that has been transshipped at sea, caught by long-line fishing or drift-nets, caught by boats from any flag state which is not a member of the relevant RFMO (Regional Fishing Management Organisation), caught by fishing vessels which do not ban shark finning, or caught by vessels which do not have an EU sanitary agreement. However several of these claims have been disputed by other bodies. In August 2008, John West was assessed by conservation group Greenpeace as selling the least sustainable tinned tuna in the UK in its Tuna League. John West has now moved up the league to 7th place. The company committed to source all of its tuna through a combination of pole and line and purse seine FAD-free (fish aggregation devices) sustainable catch methods by the end of 2016. The first step towards this was the launch of pole and line tuna in September 2011. John West has also been criticised for indiscriminate use of destructive fishing methods leading to the decimation of turtle and shark populations. Greenpeace has also noted that John West failed to show sufficient care in selecting healthier fish stocks. John West partners with the Earth Island Institute, who ensure that all that the fish in its canneries is dolphin safe and caught by the approved methods and has processes in place to ensure it is making responsible choices about fish stocks. ==Traceability and sustainability controversy== John West is the only UK and Ireland canned seafood manufacturer to wholly own a fleet of vessels which ensures it has visibility of its entire fishing supply chain. In October 2011, following the above controversies, the company advertised that its supply chain would be made fully transparent for its consumers by allowing \\"100% tracing\\" by the public of each can of fish to the original boat and location of catch, using a ‘Can Tracker’ on the company's website. The application enables John West consumers to track the exact source of the fish in their can including the ocean and even the boat that made the catch. However, in October 2015, John West was accused by conservation group Greenpeace of not standing by their word, and of having made a \\"deeply misleading\\" and \\"plainly false\\" promise to this effect. Greenpeace asked for volunteers to check the traceability codes on John West cans. It was found that although the website showed tuna only being caught in the Seychelles, Ghana and Portugal, in fact a large number of cans were sourced from canneries owned by John West's parent company Thai Union in the Samut Sakhon region of Thailand. This was not disclosed on the website, and tracing was not provided for such cans; the area's fishing industry is also notorious for human rights abuse and forced and bonded labor on fishing ships, and for the use of indiscriminate and harmful fishing methods. An estimated 98% of John West's tuna was caught using methods harmful to the environment or to other species such as dolphins, according to a second study, with only 2% being sustainable, placing John West last for sustainability of fishing at that time.Tuna doesn’t do what it says on the tin, The Times (London), 14 October 2015 John West described the omission as \\"simply a website limitation\\",John West changes website after Greenpeace accusations over traceability of Thai tuna, Liverpool Echo, 14 October 2015 and stated that \\"Quite simply, there is no longer enough pole and line tuna available to meet global demand ... we have found it extremely difficult to increase the proportion of John West pole and line tuna that we can provide\\".John West accused of breaking its pledge on line-caught, sustainable tuna, The Independent (London), 15 October 2015 The controversy became widely reported in the news, leading to John West changing its website to state that customers wishing to trace a can from Thailand should email the company instead, for further details. ==Bear fight marketing campaign== To increase their UK market share, in November 2000 John West canned salmon started a marketing campaign revolving around a viral video in which what appears to be a bear fights a fisherman for a fresh salmon. The video soon became a huge Internet meme, and by 2006 it was reported to be viewed over 300 million times, making it the sixth most viewed video online. The video was filmed on Invercauld Estate, near Balmoral, on the River Dee in the Scottish Highlands. Directed by Danny Kleinman, created by Paul Silburn and voiced by Tony Clarkin, the video campaign won a number of awards, including: # British Television Advertising Awards - \\"Best Commercial of the Year\\" (2001) # Advertising Creative Circle Awards - \\"Winner\\" (2001) # Intl. Food & Beverage - (Creative Excellence Awards) \\"FAB Award\\" (2001) Campaign Live ranked it at number 1 in their list of the \\"Top 10 Funniest TV Ads of All Time\\" in 2008, and was ranked at number 8 in ITV 1's list of the top 20 adverts of the decade the following year. ==ReferencesExternal links== *John West Foods - main site *John West Foods, Australia *The \\"Man vs Bear For Salmon\\" Video Category:Manufacturing companies based in Liverpool Category:Food brands of the United Kingdom Category:Internet memes Category:Lehman Brothers Category:Canned food Category:Seafood companies of the United Kingdom Category:Fish processing Category:Food and drink companies established in 1857 Category:1857 establishments in England Category:2010 mergers and acquisitions Category:British subsidiaries of foreign companies ","title":"John West Foods"},{"id":"12393739","text":"Shri Sudarshan Akarapu (Telugu:ఆకారపు.సుదర్శన్)(5 March 1954 – 20 July 2011)TDP Leader Sudarshan dies of cardiac arrest Indian Express 21 July 2011. is an Indian politician from Telugu Desam Party.

This section (which in contrast to the rest of the list) had been written in reverse order—beginning with Aminu and ending with Apiashal “altogether ten kings who are ancestors”—and has often been interpreted as the list of ancestors of the Amorite Šamši-Adad I (fl. c. 1809 BCE) who had conquered the city-state of Aššur. The AKL also states that Hayani was the son and successor of Hale.

He was an elder brother of George Young, the rhythm guitarist and founding member of the Easybeats, as well as Malcolm and Angus Young, founding members of the Australian hard rock band AC/DC, and the younger brother of Stephen Young, the father of Stevie Young, who is also a member of AC/DC. ==Background== William Young (born 16 February 1911) and his family lived at 6 Skerryvore Road in the Cranhill district of Glasgow in Scotland. William worked first as a wheel boy in a rope works and then as a machine / saw operator in an asbestos / cement business. William joined the Royal Air Force in 1940, serving in the Second World War as a flight engine mechanic. After the war William worked as a yard man for a builder and then as a postman. His wife Margaret (born 14 July 1913; her maiden name was also Young) was a housewife. The 'big freeze' of 1963 was the worst winter on record in Scotland with snow eight feet deep. A TV advertisement at the same time offered assisted travel for families for a different life in Australia. 15 members of the Young family left Scotland by aeroplane in late June 1963, including fifth son George (6 November 1946 – 22 October 2017) and younger brothers, Malcolm (6 January 1953 – 18 November 2017) and Angus Young (born 31 March 1955). Also aboard were his eldest brother Stephen (24 June 1933 – 1989), his only sister, Margaret Horsburgh (born 2 May 1935) and brother, William Jr (born 15 December 1940). Alex chose to remain in Britain to pursue musical interests. ==Career== When his family emigrated to Sydney, Young was in a band called the Bobby Patrick Big Six and spent some time in Germany. Later, in 1967, Young formed and played bass in the London-based band Grapefruit, initially called \\"the Grapefruit\\", with three former members of Tony Rivers and the Castaways, John Perry, Geoff Swettenham, and Pete Swettenham. Young was signed as songwriter with Apple Music Publishing Ltd. by Terry Doran, managing director of Apple Publishing, friend of the Beatles, and later manager of Grapefruit, during the summer of 1967. The songwriting contract was based on the strength of the song \\"Lullaby for a Lazy Day\\", which John Lennon liked. A tape with this song was found in his personal belongings. Grapefruit received some support from the Beatles and released two albums and several singles during 1968 and 1969. The group was launched by the Beatles with a press conference on 17 January 1968, their first single being \\"Dear Delilah\\". It went to number 21 in the UK singles chart in February 1968. Paul McCartney directed a promo film (never released) for the single \\"Elevator\\". McCartney, John Lennon and George Harrison attended and helped in their recording sessions for the singles, as Grapefruit did not have a producer at the time. However, the group broke up in late 1969; only Young and Perry remained in the music business, each as a session musician. A song written by Young, \\"I'm a Rebel\\", was recorded in September 1976 by his brothers' band AC/DC, but was never released. Young sang lead vocals on the track, with regular AC/DC vocalist Bon Scott on backing vocals. The song was later given to the German group Accept.Dome, Malcolm and Ewing, Jerry: The AC/DC Encyclopaedia. Chrome Dreams, 2008, p. 101 He released another single, \\"Sha- Sha\\"/\\"Universal Party\\", under the name Grapefruit with George Young and Harry Vanda. From 1995 until August 1997, Young worked as a music manager with \\"Proud and Loud Management\\", based in Hamburg. He died of lung cancer in Hamburg-Sasel on 4 August 1997. ==ReferencesExternal links== *An article about Alex Young Category:1938 births Category:1997 deaths Category:Scottish musicians Category:Musicians from Glasgow Alexander Category:Deaths from lung cancer Category:20th-century Scottish musicians Category:Deaths from cancer in Germany Category:People from Cranhill ","title":"Alexander Young (musician)"},{"id":"12393776","text":"Raashid Alvi (), is an Indian politician who served as a member of the Indian Parliament from both the Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha.

The original conference began in 1932, consisting of schools that were larger than most of their counterparts in their local county leagues. The schools were based in Benton, Fountain, Jasper, Newton, Tippecanoe, Warren, and White counties. The forming of the Kankakee Valley Conference the next year caused a slight fluctiation over the next couple of years, as schools realigned themselves within the two leagues, with some schools claiming dual membership. The league folded in 1947, as size disparities and willingness to sponsor some sports (such as football, some schools played 11-man or 8-man football, and others didn't sponsor the sport) led to schools going their separate ways. The second incarnation of the conference began in 1955 with eight schools located in Benton, Carroll, Cass, Newton, and White counties, with largely different members than its first lineup. The MAC had a tumultuous history of membership turnover for much of its history, but had stabilized at 10 members with West Central and Winamac joining in 1980 and 1981, respectively. The only changes over the next 34 years were Rossville and Carroll joining the Hoosier Heartland Conference in 1989 and 1992, respectively, leaving a stable 8 school membership for more than two decades. In 2013, Caston, Pioneer, and Winamac announced that they were leaving the Conference to join with 2 other schools from the Northern State Conference as well as Independent North Judson for the 2015-2016 school year.This touched off an exodus that ended the conference, as West Central joined Caston, Pioneer, and Winamac in the Hoosier North Athletic Conference, while Frontier and Tri-County joined the Hoosier Heartland Conference. South Newton joined the Sangamon Valley Conference of Illinois. North White was the only school that had not been accepted to another conference immediately, though they were accepted as a football-only member of the Hoosier Heartland. The Conference reformed in 2017, with six former schools rejoining. ==Membership== {  style=\\"text- align:center;\\" - ! School ! Location ! Mascot ! Colors ! # / County ! Enrollment !

In 1991 the China External Trade Development Council (CETRA) commissioned design firm Bright & Associates to improve the quality and image of the Made in Taiwan brand.

It is characterised by flora-rich shrubland and heathland on deep, nutrient-poor, acidic, sandy soils, and regular wildfire. Seasonal changes in the water table due to rainfall may create swamps. The name is derived from the Kabi word for the wallum banksia (Banksia aemula). ==Threats== Wallum, as with other coastal ecosystems, is highly threatened by the pressure for coastal development. Threats include clearing of land for residential development and pine plantations, alterations to drainage from adjacent developments, nutrients from fertilizers, changes in fire frequency, pollution from mosquito control sprays, and the introduction of weeds. Species endemic to wallum include some acid frogs – frogs adapted to living and breeding in acidic waters – such as the wallum froglet (Crinia tinnula), wallum rocket frog (Litoria freycineti), and the wallum sedge frog (Litoria olongburensis). In Queensland, the eastern ground parrot appears to be largely restricted to the wallum.

It was held in Chile between November 19 and December 7, 2008. Sixteen teams, comprising representatives from all six confederations, took part in the final competition, in which Chile had a guaranteed place as the host nation. ==Background== On September 15, 2006 FIFA officially announced Chile as the host country. It was the third time Chile organized a football world cup, after the 1962 FIFA World Cup and the 1987 FIFA World Youth Championship, but the first in the women's competition. The decision came as a surprise to Chile, as it had bid in August 2006 to host the 2008 FIFA U-17 Women's World Cup, which was finally granted to New Zealand (Ecuador was unsuccessful in both bids).

He was one of the pioneer figures in xinyao (Singaporean Chinese folk songs) movement in the 1980s and 1990s. ==Biography== Early life Liang grew up in a music-loving household, along with his two younger siblings. His father, a journalist, and his mother, an acupuncturist, were always playing the records of singers like Bai Guang and Zhou Xuan. Liang received his primary and secondary school education at Catholic High School. He started taking piano lessons at the age of 10, and went on to attain a Grade 8 certificate. Liang wrote his first song at the age of 16, and he became more prolific once he started attending Hwa Chong Junior College (now Hwa Chong Institution), often performing with schoolmates in addition to heading the student council and Chinese society drama club. Many of the songs he wrote then, mainly about friendship and camaraderie, are still popular among the school's students today during gatherings, where different singing groups would often perform together. Liang later attended the National University of Singapore, where he was the top student for both his major, Chinese studies, and in the Arts faculty in 1988. He graduated with a Bachelor of Arts with Honours in Chinese Literature in 1989 and a Master of Arts in 1992 from the National University of Singapore. In 1999, he received his Ph.D. in Chinese Studies from the Nanyang Technological University. In 1992, he married Liu Xiu Mei, a former Chinese language teacher of The Chinese High School, whom he met in university. They have no children. Musical and writing career As a singer-songwriter, Liang's first song \\"Sing a Song for Hwa Chong\\" () was written in 1981 after he lost in an inter-school debating competition at Hwa Chong Junior College. His first commercial song, \\"A Song for You\\" () was released in 1984 on the Ocean Butterflies () label. During his xinyao phase from 1986 to 1992, he released five albums, some of which sold as many as 20,000 copies. Among these, Door () was the first Singaporean Mandarin album to be completely composed and written by the same artiste. The song \\"One Step at a Time\\" () sat for six weeks at the top of the charts in 1987, while \\"Love's Refuge\\" () was at the top for 29 weeks in 1986, an unbroken record for a local pop song.Tommy Koh et al. (2006), Singapore: The Encyclopedia, Editions Didier Millet and National Heritage Board, To date, Liang has over 200 musical compositions and songs to his name. Liang's particularly iconic composition is the song \\"Negotiations And Love\\" (). He penned this in the aftermath of the Tiananmen Incident on 4 June 1989, and Taiwanese singer Wen Zhang recorded it. The song became popular in Singapore, Taiwan and mainland China. He has composed television serial theme songs for the then Singapore Broadcasting Corporation, now MediaCorp. Since the 1990s, Liang has also written hits for Cantonese and Mandarin pop stars such as Jacky Cheung, Andy Lau, Leon Lai, Tony Leung, Alex To, Eric Moo, Kit Chan, Joi Chua and Stefanie Sun. In 1996, he wrote and composed the songs for Singapore's first Chinese musical December Rains (). In the following year, Liang wrote the theme song \\"Are You Still There\\" (你是不是还在) for Singapore film Track ().

Today, Liang runs a Chinese language enrichment centre for primary and secondary school students, set up in 1997, with his wife He is also an adjunct associate professor in the Division of Chinese at Nanyang Technological University. Liang is still involved in the music business through writing one to six songs a year. He would offer his work to the singer whom he thinks is most suitable for the tune.

A self-similar phenomenon behaves the same when viewed at different degrees of magnification, or different scales on a dimension (space or time). Self-similar processes can sometimes be described using heavy-tailed distributions, also known as long-tailed distributions. Examples of such processes include traffic processes, such as packet inter- arrival times and burst lengths. Self-similar processes can exhibit long-range dependency. ==Overview== The design of robust and reliable networks and network services has become an increasingly challenging task in today's Internet world. To achieve this goal, understanding the characteristics of Internet traffic plays a more and more critical role. Empirical studies of measured traffic traces have led to the wide recognition of self-similarity in network traffic.. Self-similar Ethernet traffic exhibits dependencies over a long range of time scales. This is to be contrasted with telephone traffic which is Poisson in its arrival and departure process. In traditional Poisson traffic, the short-term fluctuations would average out, and a graph covering a large amount of time would approach a constant value. Heavy-tailed distributions have been observed in many natural phenomena including both physical and sociological phenomena. Mandelbrot established the use of heavy- tailed distributions to model real-world fractal phenomena, e.g. Stock markets, earthquakes, climate, and the weather. Ethernet, WWW, SS7, TCP, FTP, TELNET and VBR video (digitised video of the type that is transmitted over ATM networks) traffic is self-similar. Self-similarity in packetised data networks can be caused by the distribution of file sizes, human interactions and/ or Ethernet dynamics. Self-similar and long-range dependent characteristics in computer networks present a fundamentally different set of problems to people doing analysis and/or design of networks, and many of the previous assumptions upon which systems have been built are no longer valid in the presence of self-similarity. ==The Poisson distribution== Before the heavy-tailed distribution is introduced mathematically, the Poisson process with a memoryless waiting-time distribution, used to model (among many things) traditional telephony networks, is briefly reviewed below. Assuming pure- chance arrivals and pure-chance terminations leads to the following: *The number of call arrivals in a given time has a Poisson distribution, i.e.: :: P(a)= \\\\left ( \\\\frac{\\\\mu^a}{a!} \\\\right )e^{-\\\\mu}, where a is the number of call arrivals in time T, and \\\\mu is the mean number of call arrivals in time T. For this reason, pure-chance traffic is also known as Poisson traffic. *The number of call departures in a given time, also has a Poisson distribution, i.e.: :: P(d)=\\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\lambda^d}{d!}\\\\right)e^{-\\\\lambda}, where d is the number of call departures in time T and \\\\lambda is the mean number of call departures in time T. *The intervals, T, between call arrivals and departures are intervals between independent, identically distributed random events. It can be shown that these intervals have a negative exponential distribution, i.e.: :: P[T \\\\ge \\\\ t]=e^{-t/h},\\\\, where h is the mean holding time (MHT). ==The heavy-tail distribution== A distribution is said to have a heavy tail if : \\\\lim_{x \\\\to \\\\infty} e^{\\\\lambda x}\\\\Pr[X>x] = \\\\infty \\\\quad \\\\mbox{for all } \\\\lambda>0.\\\\, One simple example of a heavy-tailed distribution is the Pareto distribution. ==Modelling self-similar traffic== Since (unlike traditional telephony traffic) packetised traffic exhibits self-similar or fractal characteristics, conventional traffic models do not apply to networks which carry self-similar traffic. With the convergence of voice and data, the future multi-service network will be based on packetised traffic, and models which accurately reflect the nature of self-similar traffic will be required to develop, design and dimension future multi-service networks. Previous analytic work done in Internet studies adopted assumptions such as exponentially- distributed packet inter-arrivals, and conclusions reached under such assumptions may be misleading or incorrect in the presence of heavy-tailed distributions. Deriving mathematical models which accurately represent long- range dependent traffic is a fertile area of research. ==Self-similar stochastic processes modeled by Tweedie distributions== Leland et al have provided a mathematical formalism to describe self-similar stochastic processes. For the sequence of numbers : Y=(Y_i :i=0,1,2,...,N) with mean : \\\\hat{\\\\mu}=\\\\text{E}(Y_i), deviations : y_i = Y_i - \\\\hat{\\\\mu} , variance : \\\\hat{\\\\sigma}^2=\\\\text{E}(y_i^2), and autocorrelation function : r(k)=\\\\text{E}(y_i,y_{i+k})/\\\\text{E}(y_i^2) with lag k, if the autocorrelation of this sequence has the long range behavior : r(k)\\\\sim k^{-d} L(k) as k and where L(k) is a slowly varying function at large values of k, this sequence is called a self-similar process. The method of expanding bins can be used to analyze self-similar processes. Consider a set of equal-sized non-overlapping bins that divides the original sequence of N elements into groups of m equal- sized segments (N/m is integer) so that new reproductive sequences, based on the mean values, can be defined: : Y_i^{(m)}=(Y_{im-m+1}+...+Y_{im})/m. The variance determined from this sequence will scale as the bin size changes such that : \\\\text{var}[Y^{(m)}]=\\\\hat{\\\\sigma}^2 m^{-d} if and only if the autocorrelation has the limiting formTsybakov B & Georganas ND (1997) On self- similar traffic in ATM queues: definitions, overflow probability bound, and cell delay distribution. IEEE/ACM Trans. Netw. 5, 397–409 : \\\\lim_{k \\\\to \\\\infty}r(k)/k^{-d} = (2-d)(1-d)/2. One can also construct a set of corresponding additive sequences : Z_i^{(m)} = mY_i^{(m)}, based on the expanding bins, : Z_i^{(m)}=(Y_{im-m+1}+...+Y_{im}). Provided the autocorrelation function exhibits the same behavior, the additive sequences will obey the relationship : \\\\text{var}[Z_i^{(m)}]=m^2 \\\\text{var}[Y^{(m)}]=(\\\\hat{\\\\sigma}^2 /\\\\hat{\\\\mu}^{2-d})\\\\text{E}[Z_i^{(m)}]^{2-d} Since \\\\hat{\\\\mu} and \\\\hat{\\\\sigma}^2 are constants this relationship constitutes a variance-to-mean power law (Taylor's law), with p=2-d. Tweedie distributions are a special case of exponential dispersion models, a class of models used to describe error distributions for the generalized linear model. These Tweedie distributions are characterized by an inherent scale invariance and thus for any random variable Y that obeys a Tweedie distribution, the variance var(Y) relates to the mean E(Y) by the power law, : \\\\text{var}\\\\,(Y) = a[\\\\text{E}\\\\,(Y)]^p , where a and p are positive constants. The exponent p for the variance to mean power law associated with certain self-similar stochastic processes ranges between 1 and 2 and thus may be modeled in part by a Tweedie compound Poisson–gamma distribution. The additive form of the Tweedie compound Poisson-gamma model has the cumulant generating function (CGF), : K^*_p(s;\\\\theta,\\\\lambda) = \\\\lambda\\\\kappa_p(\\\\theta)[(1+s/\\\\theta)^\\\\alpha-1], where : \\\\kappa_p(\\\\theta) = \\\\dfrac{\\\\alpha-1}{\\\\alpha} \\\\left(\\\\dfrac{\\\\theta}{\\\\alpha-1}\\\\right)^\\\\alpha, is the cumulant function, α is the Tweedie exponent : \\\\alpha=\\\\dfrac{p-2}{p-1}, s is the generating function variable, θ is the canonical parameter and λ is the index parameter. The first and second derivatives of the CGF, with s=0, yields the mean and variance, respectively. One can thus confirm that for the additive models the variance relates to the mean by the power law, : \\\\mathrm{var} (Z)\\\\propto \\\\mathrm{E}(Z)^p. Whereas this Tweedie compound Poisson-gamma CGF will represent the probability density function for certain self-similar stochastic processes, it does not return information regarding the long range correlations inherent to the sequence Y. Nonetheless the Tweedie distributions provide a means understand the possible origins of self-similar stochastic processes for reason of their role as foci for a central limit-like convergence effect known as the Tweedie convergence theorem. In nontechnical terms this theorem tells us that any exponential dispersion model that asymptotically manifests a variance-to-mean power law is required to have a variance function that comes within the domain of attraction of a Tweedie model. The Tweedie convergence theorem can be used to explain the origin of the variance to mean power law, 1/f noise and multifractality, features associated with self-similar processes. ==Network performance== Network performance degrades gradually with increasing self-similarity. The more self- similar the traffic, the longer the queue size. The queue length distribution of self-similar traffic decays more slowly than with Poisson sources. However, long-range dependence implies nothing about its short-term correlations which affect performance in small buffers. Additionally, aggregating streams of self-similar traffic typically intensifies the self-similarity (\\"burstiness\\") rather than smoothing it, compounding the problem. Self-similar traffic exhibits the persistence of clustering which has a negative impact on network performance. *With Poisson traffic (found in conventional telephony networks), clustering occurs in the short term but smooths out over the long term. *With self-similar traffic, the bursty behaviour may itself be bursty, which exacerbates the clustering phenomena, and degrades network performance. Many aspects of network quality of service depend on coping with traffic peaks that might cause network failures, such as *Cell/packet loss and queue overflow *Violation of delay bounds e.g. in video *Worst cases in statistical multiplexing Poisson processes are well-behaved because they are stateless, and peak loading is not sustained, so queues do not fill. With long-range order, peaks last longer and have greater impact: the equilibrium shifts for a while. ==See also== *Long-tail traffic ==ReferencesExternal links== *A site offering numerous links to articles written on the effect of self-similar traffic on network performance.

The Copernicus Center is located at 5216 W. Lawrence Avenue. The former Gateway Theater was designed by architect Mason Rapp of the prestigious firm of Rapp and Rapp, famous for their design of deluxe theaters not only in Chicago (Chicago, Oriental, and Palace Theatres) but throughout the United States. It is the architect's only surviving atmospheric theatre in Chicago. ==History== June 27, 1930 was the opening day for Jefferson Park's new deluxe motion picture palace. Weeklong festivities in the area leading up to the opening were capped off by a gargantuan parade sponsored by area businesses. All the Chicago dailies covered the event, and in fact, the Chicago Herald-Examiner put forth a full page spread proclaiming the new theater as \\"the most acoustically perfect theatre in the world.\\" The reports were not guilty of sensationalism, as the architects indeed had given extra special attention to the acoustics, as talking pictures, a relative newcomer to the entertainment field had found a perfect environment in this new, different theater. The original Grand Hall and Grand Foyer ceilings and walls were designed and hand painted in a maze of connected Greek/Roman scenes of Deities and custom patterns by noted Chicago artist Louis Grell (1887-1960). Because of the new sound films (nicknamed \\"talkies\\"), plans to include a stage for vaudeville and stage shows were abandoned. Instead, a small \\"sound stage\\" was built to the back of the proscenium opening to house the screen and \\"newfangled\\" speakers. If the \\"talkies\\" were just a fad, the sound stage could easily be replaced with a full stage house with the usual complement of dressing rooms, proper rooms, fly space for the scenery and the like. The talking pictures soon became the norm, and, in 1932, all motion picture studios stopped making silent pictures, thus sounding the death knell for vaudeville and stage shows. For over 50 years, the Gateway was the direct-from-the-Loop flagship theater for the prolific Balaban and Katz movie theater chain. For decades, images of such Hollywood stars as Astaire and Rogers, Hepburn and Tracy, Bogart and Bacall, Greta Garbo, Bette Davis, James Stewart, Cary Grant, John Wayne, and hundreds of others graced the screen of the Gateway. The theatre had perhaps its wildest days in 1973 when 45,000 patrons packed the old place weekly for an extended run of The Exorcist. In 1977, the search began for a permanent site to house a Polish Cultural Center in Chicago. In 1979, groundbreaking ceremonies took place at the old Gateway Theater Building located near Milwaukee and Lawrence avenues. Because the Gateway Theater historically was the first movie theater in Chicago built exclusively for the \\"talkies,\\" the Foundation decided to preserve the theater itself while remodeling around it, dividing the original 40-foot entry lobby and constructing three floors of office, meeting room and classroom space for the Cultural Center. This first stage was completed in 1981. In 1985, the \\"Solidarity Tower,\\" with its matching facade, was erected atop the building. The exterior of the building was modified to resemble the historic Royal Castle in Warsaw, Poland. The tower is an exact replica of the clock tower adorning the castle—its spire seen by commuters driving along the Kennedy Expressway. The money was raised through the generosity of individuals and corporations that recognized the significance to the community of this symbol of the struggle for freedom in an oppressed country. That year the Copernicus Foundation took over the administration of the Gateway theatre and opened its doors to the Polish American and other ethnic communities, as well as Jefferson Park civic organizations which it has been serving until the present day. In 1988, the Lake Shore Symphony Orchestra became the official orchestra-in-residence. The orchestra practices weekly and hosts concerts three times a year. ==The Present== Since then, the theater has been cleaned, a thrust stage has been built, and the theater has been used for a wide variety of programs, not only for the Polish community, but also those of other ethnic groups which do not have their own facilities, e.g. East Indian, Spanish, Korean, Philippine, etc., as well as the American community. Musical concerts, plays, athletic competitions, seminars, dance recitals, children's plays, choir competitions, and Candidates' Nights are just some of the many programs presented in the theater. As knowledge of the existence of the theater grew, so did its usage and programs. The Copernicus Center theater is now in use an average of 48 weeks per year, with the heaviest usage during the weekends. The programs have become more sophisticated in nature and serve many more people. The theater seats 1,890. ==Access== The Copernicus Center is located one block west of the Lawrence Avenue exit of the Kennedy Expressway. It is accessible via the Blue Line's Jefferson Park station as well as the Jefferson Park stop on the Metra Union Pacific/Northwest commuter rail line. ==See also== * Balaban and Katz * Theatre in Chicago * History of Chicago * Culture of Chicago * Poles in Chicago * Polonia * Polish-Americans ==ReferencesExternal links== * Jefferson Park Historical Society's article on the Gateway Theatre * Description of the Gateway Theatre * Picture of the 'old' Gateway Exterior * View of the Present Gateway Theatre's Exterior and its historic Wurlitzer Organ * Balaban and Katz Foundation * Balaban and Katz * Louis Grell Foundation Category:Theatres completed in 1930 Category:Cinemas and movie theaters in Chicago Category:Concert halls in Illinois Category:Landmarks in Chicago Category:Music venues in Chicago Category:Theatres in Chicago Category:Polish-American culture in Chicago Category:Atmospheric theatres Category:Arts centers in Illinois ","title":"Copernicus Center (Chicago, Illinois)"},{"id":"12394114","text":"Shantaram Laxman Naik (12 April 1946 – 9 June 2018) was an Indian politician from Indian National Congress party and a former Member of the Parliament of India representing Goa in the Rajya Sabha, the upper house of the Indian Parliament.

It was published by Anchor Books. The book traces the development of what Frank decries as market populism: \\"the idea that markets are a far more democratic form of organization than democratically elected governments.\\" He also discusses many facets of the New Economy, \\"culture studs,\\" and internet brokerages. An excerpt of the book was the cover story of the October 12, 2000 issue of The Nation. ==Summary== Television commercials One topic that Frank devotes considerable page space to is television commercials, especially those for brokerages and mutual funds. He cites many examples of corporations being compared to rock stars, the Civil Rights Movement and the French Revolution and God. Beardstown Ladies Frank discusses the Beardstown Ladies, an informal investment group comprising elderly women from Beardstown, Illinois. He covers their usage by the media to promote the idea (mostly fallacious, in Frank's estimation) that Average Joe Americans were just as good as, if not better than, professionals at picking stocks. ==Reception== It was reviewed in The American Prospect on December 18, 2000, in The New York Times on December 21, 2000 ==ReferencesExternal links== *The book at Thomas Frank's website *Excerpt that appeared in The Nation *Review in The American Prospect *Review in The New York Times Category:2000 non-fiction books Category:Books by Thomas Frank ","title":"One Market Under God"},{"id":"12394263","text":"Pazeh may refer to: *Pazeh people *Pazeh language ","title":"Pazeh"},{"id":"12394267","text":"\\"I Can't Stand Up for Falling Down\\" is a song written by Homer Banks and Allen Jones. Originally recorded by soul duo Sam & Dave in 1967, the song was famously covered by new wave musician Elvis Costello with his backing band the Attractions in 1980 for their album Get Happy!!. ==Original version== \\"I Can't Stand Up for Falling Down\\" was originally recorded by Sam & Dave in 1967. The Sam & Dave version was recorded live, and issued as the B-side to their live cover of Sam Cooke's \\"Soothe Me\\". ==Elvis Costello and the Attractions version== Elvis Costello and the Attractions covered the song in 1980 for the album Get Happy!!. Costello's version was drastically rearranged from the original, turning it from a slow soul ballad into an uptempo Northern soul- style dance track. It was one of three singles taken from the album in the UK. It was supposed to be released on the 2 Tone Records label in the UK, but even though copies were pressed, contractual difficulties eventually halted its release on that label. The single was eventually released on F-Beat Records, which was the charted release. The single was backed by \\"Girls Talk\\" a song Costello originally gave to pub rock musician Dave Edmunds before releasing his version. The Elvis Costello version of the song was a commercial hit in the UK, reaching number four on the charts over a stay of eight weeks. The single also reached number 14 in Ireland. Searchable database Music videos A music video for the song was released in 1980, featuring Costello and the Attractions attempting to dance using Motown steps. Costello later said of the video, \\"We went to one of those proper dance studios with the mirror on the wall and the choreographer was trying to teach us basic Motown backing singer steps. I was drinking and said, 'Well… the lead singer doesn't usually do the moves,' so I did a few steps and left it to the Attractions to do it all. The idea behind those early videos was to make comical little films. Once you started to think, 'I'm remaking The Third Man or Citizen Kane', it lost a little of the charm.\\" In a piece for The Guardian, Costello recalled a scene from the Top of the Pops video for \\"I Can't Stand Up for Falling Down\\", saying, \\"When I arrived to perform 'I Can't Stand Up for Falling Down' [I] was met by what looked like a circus strongman holding a length of stout rope. Our promo man, Spanner, gently persuaded me to don a pantomime harness so I could be hoisted up on a wire and down again, right on cue with the title line from the chorus. ... Two things stood in the way. One was the holes the hooks of the harness would have to punch in my favorite thrift-store trousers, and the other was my fear of heights. A trip to the BBC club took care of the latter: by the time I returned to perform, I wouldn't have cared if I'd been asked to wear harem pants or Bermuda shorts. I was a rubber man, so when the harness returned me to earth, my legs buckled under me. I suspect that the cameraman was already doubled up with laughter, as he completely bungled the shot.\\" Charts - !Chart (1980) !Peak position - - } ==References== Category:1980 singles Category:Sam & Dave songs Category:Elvis Costello songs Category:Songs written by Homer Banks Category:Columbia Records singles Category:Song recordings produced by Nick Lowe Category:1967 songs Category:Songs written by Allen Jones (record producer) ","title":"I Can't Stand Up for Falling Down"},{"id":"12394269","text":"Last Embrace is an EP album by the group Northern Room, released on February 28, 2006.

The film centers on the relationship of Charlie (Burns) and Claudia (Lauren Holly). The film had a limited theatrical release and grossed less than $250,000 domestically from its $5 million budget. ==Plot== Charlie Ryan (Burns) returns to his hometown after failed attempts at unmentioned endeavors in California. It becomes apparent that his mother no longer finds Charlie's Kerouac-like tendencies to be entertaining as one of her first greetings is telling Charlie she's not going to put up with his crap this time. At first Charlie lays low, embarrassed he's returned home empty handed and unaccomplished. Hero to most of his childhood friends, Charlie appears to be the only one who left their small east coast sea-side town after high school. Word does soon travel instigating a visit from one of Charlie's best high school buds. Michael, (Bon Jovi) a thoroughly blue collar kind of guy, is interested in more than just saying hello after all these years. Michael's idea of catching up is letting Charlie know that Claudia and Michael are living together and are planning to be married. Although Charlie tells Michael he is okay with how things have changed, he is shocked and hurt. Claudia (Holly), it turns out, is a waitress in the small-town luncheonette, complete with skirted pink uniforms and is Charlie's high school sweetheart, whom he left behind in the wake of an unwanted pregnancy and abortion. Charlie visits Claudia at work despite his knowledge of her relationship with Michael. Still hurt from Charlie's post-high school departure, she tells Charlie to leave her alone. Stuck there most of her life and as her 30th birthday approaches, Claudia dreams of bigger things, but if afraid to take a chance. Other subplots surrounding the love triangle include Claudia's sister, Kelly (Britton) who still lives at home and laments the absence of quality dating material. An even sadder subplot involves Claudia and Kelly's mother (Danner) who still holds a torch for her husband/father of the girls, even though he has left them. Their mother foolishly and unrealistically maintains that her husband will return, repeating to her daughters that he has done this before and came back. Claudia's best friend (Esposito) is so lonely she is willing to throw herself at the recently singled, bald pizza guy. Making matters worse for Claudia is Michael's desire to get married and settle down, which was discussed before Charlie's return, but is now being sought by Michael in earnest. Beaten down, free-spirit Claudia takes stock of her life and the people around her in the small town and decides she is not ready to be someone's wife, worrying that once she settled for that, it's all she would ever be. Claudia is crushed at her mother's hidden pain and the unrealistic belief that her family will be reunited. Charlie is finally able to wear Claudia down and she leaves work early at the luncheonette to spend the night with him. Feeling nostalgic and giddy, the two declare their love for each other and begin a plan to run away together. During this conversation, Claudia tells Charlie there were complications with her abortion and is likely unable to have children. They drive to a motel, but once they are alone, both become thoughtful and somber at the potential of their future together. Meanwhile, when Claudia doesn't come home, Michael checks all their regular hang-outs, increasingly suspicious after it appears Charlie is also nowhere to be found. When Michael checks with Claudia's best friend's house, he rebuffs her blatant attempt to seduce him. Claudia arrives home early the next morning to Michael sitting at their kitchen table, obviously knowing where she has been and what she has done. He tells her he doesn't deserve to be treated this way and angrily tells her to leave for good. Claudia spends several days of thinking of her life, anguishing over being stuck between Charlie who would offer her excitement, adventure and unpredictability or Michael who would offer her stability, security and a stifling predictability. She consults her mother who has finally come out of her hazy denial after receiving a call from her husband who stated he would not be calling anymore and did not want to be contacted. Her mother tells Claudia to follow her own instincts and make herself happy. In the last scenes, Claudia tells Charlie she has decided not to leave with him and is also not staying with Michael. She tells Charlie she needs to leave by herself and be on her own for a while. She tells Charlie that he of all people should understand that, to which he agrees. He remarks, \\"Good luck. Whatever it is you're looking for, I hope you find it\\". Suitcase in trunk, Claudia is seen driving away alone looking happily uncertain but determined to make herself happy. ==Cast== *Lauren Holly as Claudia *Edward Burns as Charlie *Jon Bon Jovi as Michael *Connie Britton as Kelly *Blythe Danner as Claudia's Mother *Kaili Vernoff as Alice ==Production== Burns said he originally wanted a budget of $12 million to get more shooting days but he was only able to secure $5 million.

At a party in Los Angeles he was introduced to fellow Finn Renny Harlin. The two collaborated on a script about three Americans vacationing in Finland who cross the border into the Soviet Union. They approached Chuck Norris to star and he initially agreed but later had to pull out after the production was delayed due to financing problems. His son Mike Norris took over the lead. Selin and Harlin funded the first part of production themselves and then shopped around with the resulting 20-minute demo reel. Selin was eventually able to secure co-production financing from the U.S. for what became the most expensive film ever produced in Finland. Under the terms of the deal Selin held on to the Finnish distribution rights. However, upon completion in 1986 the film was banned by the Finnish government, fearing that its anti-Soviet slant might damage bilateral relations. Selin and Harlin followed this in 1987 with Wild Force: S.O.P.H.I.A. (a.k.a. I want you to stay) but failed to secure a distributor. In the early 1990s, Selin formed two companies, Harlin & Selin Productions Oy with his old friend Renny Harlin and his own Solar Films. The first project for these two companies in 1993 was Gladiaattorit, the Finnish version of the hit American television series American Gladiators, produced by Selin, directed by Harlin and co-written by the two friends. This was followed in 1994 by a sketch comedy series called Vintiöt starring Santeri Kinnunen and in the same year a feature called Sunset Riders. The movie was a hit with the critics, winning Finnish Movie Awards for its director Aleksi Mäkelä and its star Juha Veijonen but only performed moderately well at the box office. Numerous television and feature productions followed. In 2006, Selin re-teamed with Harlin to produce a biopic of the Finnish President Gustaf Mannerheim, but the budget projection spiraled, far eclipsing American Born, and coupled with problems with the Finnish government, again, the project was put on hold where it remains indefinitely. ==Filmography== *Born American (1985) *Sunset Riders (1994) *Kummeli: Kultakuume (1997) *The Tough Ones (1999) *Restless (2000) *The South (2000) *Me and Morrison (2001) *Bad Boys (2003) *Addiction (2004) *Vares – Private Eye (2004) *Paha maa (2005) *Matti (2006) *Frozen City (2006) *V2 – Dead Angel (2007) *The Home of Dark Butterflies (2008) *Dark Floors (2008) *The Subtenant (2008) *Hellsinki (2009) *The Kiss of Evil (2011) *Imaginaerum (2012) *The Grump (2014) *Wildeye (2015) *Man and a baby (2017) Yösyöttö ==SourcesExternal links== * Official site for Solar Films * Category:1960 births Category:Living people Category:Finnish film producers ","title":"Markus Selin"},{"id":"12394396","text":"Only Seconds is an EP album by the indie rock group Northern Room, released on April 26, 2007.

Villa de San Agustin de Laredo got its name from Laredo, Cantabria, Spain and in honor of Saint Augustine of Hippo. In 1840, Laredo was the capital of the independent Republic of the Rio Grande, set up in rebellion to the dictatorship of Antonio López de Santa Anna and brought back into Mexico by military force. In 1846, during the Mexican–American War the town was occupied by the Texas Rangers. After the war the Treaty of Guadalupe-Hidalgo ceded the land to the United States. A referendum was taken in the town, which voted overwhelmingly to petition the American military government in charge of the area to return the town to Mexico. However, this petition was rejected, and in response the bulk of the population moved over the river into Mexican territory to found the new town of Nuevo Laredo. The origin of name of Laredo is unclear. Some scholars say the name might stem from Glaretum which means \\"sandy, rocky place\\" others state that Laredo stems from Euskara and means \\"beautiful prairies\\".Laredo Origin Laredo Origin Laredo might also stem from Laridae which means gull or it might be made up of two Latin words lar which means home and edo which means birth. ==Economy== The Laredo National Bank is one of the strongest banking institutions in Laredo, Texas Map of the Laredo–Nuevo Laredo area Trade More than 47% of United States international trade headed for Mexico and more than 36% of Mexican international trade crosses through the Laredo–Nuevo Laredo port of entries.Laredo Morning Times \\"National report lists Laredo as largest inland port\\" Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas \\"Southwest Economy \\" This is the reason that the borderplex's economy rotates around commercial and industrial warehousing, import, and export.

Born in Binghamton, New York, he was the brother of major leaguer Scott Coolbaugh. Coolbaugh died after being hit by a line drive while working as a first-base coach in a minor league game. ==Playing career== A 1990 graduate of Theodore Roosevelt High School in San Antonio, Texas, Coolbaugh was drafted by the Toronto Blue Jays in the 16th round (433rd overall) of the 1990 Major League Baseball Draft. Coolbaugh spent 11 seasons in the minor leagues. He broke the Southern League record for runs batted in during a season. Coolbaugh never played for the Blue Jays, but was called up to the major leagues on July 15, 2001, while playing for the Milwaukee Brewers Triple-A affiliate Indianapolis Indians. He played third base with the Milwaukee Brewers in 2001 and the St. Louis Cardinals in 2002. Coolbaugh made 44 career appearances, mainly at third base or as a pinch hitter, hitting .183. In 2003, Coolbaugh traveled to Korea (as had his brother Scott) to play for the Doosan Bears in the KBO League. That year he hit .215 with 10 home runs and 24 RBI in 44 games. In 2004, he set a franchise record by hitting 30 home runs with the New Orleans Zephyrs, an affiliate of the Houston Astros. In 2005, Coolbaugh was with the Astros' farm system and while playing for their Triple-A affiliate, the Round Rock Express, had 27 home runs and 101 runs batted in. The Astros were prepared to bring him up to the major leagues until he suffered a broken bone in his left hand during a game. In 2006, he signed with the Kansas City Royals.

Inside Toronto, Rosemary Sadlier, November 11, 2016 Lucie was then smuggled across the Detroit River to safety in Amherstburg, in Essex County, Upper Canada. Thornton's escape was more difficult because he was heavily guarded, bound and shackled. The day before Thornton was to be returned to Kentucky, Detroit's black community rose up in protest in the Blackburn Riots. A crowd of about 400 men stormed the jail to free him. During the commotion, two individuals called Sleepy Polly and Daddy Walker helped Thornton escape and eventually find safety in Essex County, Upper Canada. The commotion turned into a two-day riot during which the local sheriff was shot and fatally wounded. It was the first race riot in Detroit, resulting in the first Riot Commission to be formed in the United States. While the unrest in Detroit continued, Thornton's supporters procured a horse- cart and conveyed Thornton away from Detroit to the northeast. A posse had formed to pursue Thornton and caught up with the cart about one mile outside of Detroit. Thornton's pursuers then discovered that Thornton had disembarked from the cart shortly after it had arrived in the wilderness outside of Detroit. With help from his rescuers, Thornton was able to circle west and south of Detroit. He boarded a boat near the mouth of River Rouge and crossed the Detroit River into Essex County to join his wife. Once in Essex County, Thornton was jailed briefly while a formal request for his return was issued by the Michigan territorial governor. A reply came from the Lieutenant- Governor of Upper Canada, Major General Sir John Colborne, who refused extradition to the United States, noting that a person could not steal himself\\"Roots of Toronto's black community run deeper than you might think: James\\".Toronto Star, Royson James, Toronto Politics Columnist, November 12, 2016 and that lifetime slavery was too severe a punishment for any crime less than murder. ==Toronto== Thornton eventually reunited with his wife, Lucie, in the newly-incorporated City of Toronto, arriving in 1834, where he worked as a waiter at Osgoode Hall. Though illiterate, he saw the need for a taxi service and so obtained blueprints for a cab from Montreal and commissioned its construction. By 1837, he had it: a red and yellow box cab named \\"The City,\\" drawn by a single horse and able to carry four passengers, with a driver in a box at the front, which he would operate. It became the nucleus of a successful taxicab company.\\"From Thornton Blackburn to Uber: a brief and varied history of Toronto taxis\\". CBC News Joshua Errett, April 9, 2016 Some time in the late 1830s, Thornton made a daring return to Kentucky to bring his mother, Sibby (born in Virginia), back with him to join another son, Alfred, Thornton's brother, who may have arrived in Toronto as early as 1826. The Blackburns continued to be active in anti-slavery and community activities, helping to build the nearby Little Trinity Church, now the oldest-surviving church in Toronto. Thornton participated in the North American Convention of Colored Freemen at St. Lawrence Hall in September 1851, was an associate of anti-slavery leader George Brown, and helped former slaves settle at Toronto and Buxton. Thornton died on February 26, 1890, leaving an estate of $18,000 and six properties, and is buried at Toronto's Necropolis Cemetery. Lucie died five years later, on February 6, 1895. ==Legacy== In 1999, the Historic Sites and Monuments Board of Canada designated the Blackburns \\"Persons of National Historic Significance\\" for their personal struggle for freedom, which was emblematic of so many similar but typically-undocumented cases.Thornton and Lucie Blackburn National Historic Person(s) Directory of Designations of National Historic Significance, Parks Canada, 2005 Also importantly, the Blackburns' situation prompted the articulation of a legal defense against slavery. They were also designated for their contribution to the growth of Toronto, generosity to the less fortunate, and lifelong resistance to slavery. In 2002, plaques in their honour were erected at the site of their excavated house in Toronto, Ontario, and in Louisville, Kentucky. In 1985, an archaeological dig uncovered the foundations of the Thorntons' home,\\"This Public Art in Corktown Gives a Glimpse of Toronto Through the Ages\\". Torontoist, November 3, 2016.

In 2015, a mural near their former home, \\"Site Specific,\\" was installed. It depicts the history of the neighbourhood, and includes the Thorntons' cab. In 2016, a conference centre at George Brown College in Toronto was named for Thornton and Lucie Blackburn, and a mural depicting their story has been painted in the building's downstairs lobby. ==See also== * Buxton National Historic Site and Museum * Blackburn Riots ==ReferencesFurther reading== *A.

In Chinese cities, \\"Zhongshan Road\\" is often one of a city's principal roads. As a result, the road is often very long and divided into numbered sections. In Guangzhou, the Zhongshan Road is separated into eight sections, identified as the First Zhongshan Road to the Eighth Zhongshan Road. In Shanghai, Zhongshan Road stretches around the whole city, the road is divided into numerous sections, identified by a direction and a number, such as the East-1 Zhongshan Road. In some exceptional cases, a \\"Zhongshan Road\\" can have other significance. Zhongshan Road in Shijiazhuang, for example, is named after the Zhongshan state and later commandery, not Sun Yat-sen. ==History== Sun Yat- sen, a leader of the Republican revolution of the early 20th century, was remembered in China with great fervor after his death in 1925, and especially after his Kuomintang party re-unified China in 1928. As a result, numerous monuments were erected in his honor throughout China, and a large number of streets, parks and schools, and even his birth city (Zhongshan, Guangdong) were renamed in his honor. When the Republic of China government took over Taiwan at the end of World War II, the practice of naming streets and parks after Sun, and erecting monuments in his honor, spread to the island as well. Between 1928 and 1949, in a move designed to parallel the adulation of Sun, a number of roads and institutions were named \\"Zhongzheng\\", after Chiang Kai- shek, also known as \\"Jiang Zhongzheng\\", who saw himself as the successor to Sun. In 1949, the People's Republic of China led by the Communist Party of China took control in mainland China. Over the following years, streets and institutions named \\"Zhongzheng\\" were renamed, but Zhongshan Roads were not renamed, and survived \\"revolutionary\\" name changes in the Cultural Revolution. A conventional practice developed where no streets would be named after a political leader, except for Sun Yat-sen. In mainland China today, Sun Yat-sen remains the only modern politician commemorated in road names: no Communist leader, such as Mao Zedong or Deng Xiaoping, shares this privilege. In Taiwan, Zhongshan (more commonly and locally spelled as \\"Jhongshan\\" or \\"Chungshan\\") Roads are as ubiquitous, if not more, compared to mainland China. In recent years, the administrative merging of neighboring towns have sometimes resulted in duplicate Zhongshan Roads within the same locality, and as a result some such roads have been renamed. ==List of Zhongshan Roads== *Zhongshan Road in Nanjing was a ceremonial avenue built for the purpose of conveying Sun Yat- sen' funeral procession to the Sun Yat-sen Mausoleum outside the city. It connects the Zhongshan port and the Zhongshan Gate. In 1933, the road was separated into North Zhongshan Road, Zhongshan Road and East Zhongshan Road. After the Chinese Civil War, Zhongzheng Road (named after Chiang Kai-shek), which was connected to the Zhongshan road, was renamed to South Zhongshan road. *Zhongshan Road in Shanghai is the road marking the boundary of the traditional urban area, and forms an incomplete circle (the Huangpu River serves as part of the boundary). This road was built in the 1930s. The goals of building this road were to prevent the expansion of the foreigner concessions in Shanghai (i.e. the Shanghai International Settlement and French Concession in Shanghai) and to connect the three Chinese urban areas, Nanshi, Zhabei, and Jiangwan together. The Bund is today a section of the Zhongshan Road. *In Guangzhou, the Zhongshan Road is separated into eight sections, identified as the First Zhongshan Road to the Eighth Zhongshan Road. There is another, separate, Zhongshan Avenue, which was an expressway built in 1928. *Zhongshan Road is the main shopping street in Xiamen, and leads to the main ferry terminals. *Zhongshan Road is a major arterial in Taipei. *In Shenyang, the Zhongshan Road, built in early 1930s, is also a main road in the city center, not far from Shenyang Railway Station. *The Zhongshan Roads of Zhonghe District (formerly Zhonghe City) and Yonghe District (formerly Yonghe City) in Taiwan are connected. *Formerly, Zhongshan Road in Beijing was the name of the short street at the northern end of Tiananmen Square, running from West Chang'an Gate, across the front of the Tiananmen gate, to East Chang'an Gate. After the reconstruction of the Square, the road became a section of Chang'an Avenue. *Zhongshan Road in Hangzhou is the major arterial running north–south through the city. Originally called the Imperial Street during the southern Song dynasty, the road was renamed after Sun Yat-sen during the Republican era. *Also known as the Qilou Arcade Streets, Qilou Old Street, and formerly Huanhaifang Road, the Zhongshan Road was the first and one of many roads to be restored in the Bo'ai Road area of Haikou, Hainan ==Roads named after other names of Sun Yat-sen== Two roads in Macau SAR were built in the name of Sun Yat-sen, in honor of Sun, who lived in Macau during his lifetime. One road is called Avenida Dr. Sun Yat-sen (孫逸仙大馬路), located at the southern part of Macau Peninsula. The other road has the same name Avenida Dr. Sun Yat-sen (孫逸仙博士大馬路), located at Taipa Island. While the official Portuguese name of the two roads are the same, the Chinese translations are different. There is also a traffic roundabout, called Rotunda Dr. Sun Yat-sen (孫逸仙博士圓形地) joins two sections of the Avenida Dr. Sun Yat-sen (Taipa) as well as the Avenida de Guimarães (基馬拉斯大馬路). A street in Medan, Indonesia also named in honor of him, named as Jalan Sun Yat-Sen, it is also including a 16th floor hotel nearby named as Citi International Sun Yat-Sen Hotel. Yixian (逸仙), another name of Sun Yat-sen equivalent to the common English version of \\"Yat-sen\\", is also a popular road name. In Shanghai, Yixian Road connects the Inner and Outer Ringroad expressways. ==Literal meaning of characters== The literal meaning of the characters zhong and shan are \\"Central/Middle\\" and \\"Mountain\\"; the name was adopted by Sun Yat-sen while in Japan in the early 1900s.

He later founded the Order of World Scouts, the earliest multinational scouting organisation, and is counted one of the founders of scouting in Italy. As a military officer, he helped expose the murder of several innocent civilians by an officer under his command during the 1916 Easter Rising.Working Class Movement Library: Sir Francis Patrick Fletcher Vane, Bt. In 2016, on the anniversary of the Easter Rising, Sir Francis was commemorated on a postage stamp in Ireland for the strength of character he showed during those troubles. ==Early life== Vane was born at 10 Great George’s Street, Dublin 1861 to an Irish mother and English father. His grandfather was Sir Frederick Fletcher-Vane, Bt. Vane was raised in Sidmouth, Devon, England and educated at Charterhouse School. In 1876, Vane enrolled at the Oxford Military College. ==Military career== After military college, Vane was assigned to the Worcester Militia, Scots Guards and for a stint with the Submarine Mining section of the Royal Engineers over the period of 1883-1888. In 1886, he began residing at Toynbee Hall in East London. That same year he started a 'Working Boys Cadet Corps'. He became a captain in the 26th Middlesex Rifle Volunteers in 1888. While serving in the Second Boer War (1899–1902), he was appointed a magistrate in 1902. He was removed from that position for supposedly being too \\"pro-Boer\\". He wrote \\"The War and One Year After\\" pamphlet in 1903 criticising the British method of war. With his follow up pamphlet, Vane was \\"retired\\" from the military. Ireland At the start of World War I, Vane returned to the Army as a recruiting officer with the rank of Major and was sent to Ireland, attached to the Royal Munster Fusiliers. During the Easter Uprising, Vane distinguished himself for his courageous conduct in handling of abuses by an officer under his command, Captain Bowen-Colthurst, who had ordered three unarmed civilians shot to death, and had himself killed an unarmed teenager. Vane had been directed to take command of Portobello Barracks, Dublin, then garrison for the largely Belfast-recruited Royal Irish Rifles and the Ulster Militia Battalion. On the third day of the Rising, Vane had taken up an observation position in the tower of the Rathmines Town Hall. On returning to barracks he learned that civilian hostages had been taken and later killed there by order of Captain Bowen-Colthurst. They included the well-known pacifist Francis Sheehy- Skeffington and two pro-Union journalists who were misidentified as Nationalists. Bowen-Colthurst had also led a raid against a house allegedly sympathetic to the insurgents, and during this raid he had summarily executed a youth named Coade in the street.\\"Royal Commission on the Arrest and subsequent treatment of Mr. Francis Sheehy Skeffington, Mr. Thomas Dickson, and Mr. Patrick James McIntyre: Report of the Commission\\", presented to both houses of Parliament by command of His Majesty, London: Darling & Son, 1916 (accessed 29 March 2016). Vane ordered these incidents to be reported to the garrison high command and to British high command. But his superiors covered up the crimes, and removed him from command. Thereupon Vane went directly to London and met with Secretary of War Lord Kitchener and with Maurice Bonham Carter, Principal Private Secretary to the Prime Minister, to expose the murders.British House of Commons, Disturbances in Ireland\\", hearing held on 1 August 1916 (accessed 31 March 2016). As a result, Bowen-Colthurst was arrested a week after the uprising, and was charged with murder at a military court-martial held a month after the uprising. The court-martial found Bowen- Colthurst guilty, but insane; he was sent to Broadmoor Hospital for the criminally insane. Nevertheless, Vane's superior Sir John Maxwell filed an adverse report about Vane, resulting in Vane's dismissal from the army sometime prior to August 1916. ==Between military stints== Daily News, Manchester Guardian, Westminster and Truth employed Vane from 1902 to 1904 as a reporter for South Africa. He was the unsuccessful Liberal candidate for Burton in the 1906 United Kingdom general election. Following that he became active in antiwar and suffragette campaigns from 1907-1912. He published two more items: Walks and Peoples in Tuscany (1908) and On Certain Fundamentals (1909). ==Scouting== By 1909, Vane was the Baden-Powell Boy Scouts' London Commissioner. He felt that Scouting should be nonmilitary and, through mediation, reconciled the British Boy Scouts (BBS) with Baden-Powell organisation by having the BBS as an affiliated organisation of the Baden- Powell organisation. The BBS had formed as the Battersea Boy Scouts (BBS) and registered with the Baden-Powell Boy Scout organisation but soon left the Baden-Powell organisation over perceived militarisation and nondemocratic nature of the national headquarters. The BBS had renamed and reconstituted itself as a national organisation. Vane briefly reconciled the two organisations. With Vane pushing for Baden-Powell's organisation to be more democratic, his position was eliminated by Baden-Powell's headquarters staff. In a protest meeting, the London area Scoutmasters voted overwhelming in support of Sir Francis, however Baden-Powell never reinstated him. Members of the National Service League, a pro-military group, were appointed to Baden- Powell's headquarters. On 3 December 1909, Vane accepted the presidency of the British Boy Scouts taking most London area Troops with him. The Quakers' Birmingham and Midland Troops also followed as Vane was key in having Quakers sponsor Scouting Troops.The BBS Story The British Boy Scouts and British Girl Scouts Association. accessed 25 September 2008. Vane got the Boy's Life Brigade (BLB) to join the British Boy Scouts in a loose federation called The National Peace Scouts in February 1910.Other Youth Programs Author Victor M. Alexieff. SOSSI Journal. Vol. 37, No. 9, September 1982 At the merger the BBS had 45,000 Scouts and BLB had 40,000 members. With Vane having an Italian summer home, he was able to launch the Scouting Movement in Italy with the Ragazzi Esploratori Italiani in 1910. In 1911, Vane assisted Augustin Dufresne, a shipowner, to organise a French Scouting organisation.Boy Scout Movement: Internationalism--Order of World Scouts Historic Boys' Uniform website. With the spread of the alternative British Boy Scouts programme throughout the world, Vane informally aligned the various groups as the Legion of World Scouts, the first international organisation, in 1911 then more formally as the Order of World Scouts on 11 November 1911. Vane became the Grand Scout Master of the Order of World Scouts. Vane put his wealth behind the organisations: providing a London headquarters and financed the organisation, even the manufacture of BBS uniforms. This overburdened his finances to the point of having to declare bankruptcy in 1912. Thus the British Boy Scouts lost their headquarters, source of equipment and uniforms and their leader. Vane continued his involvement with the remnant BBS, as he inspected the Troop of the London Commissioner Percy Herbert Pooley in 1915. Vane returned to Italy after World War I to find that the Italian Boy Scouts he founded had been mainly absorbed by the National Scouts Corps (Corpo Nazionale Giovani Esploratori Italiani - CNGEI). Some joined in with the creation of the Catholic Association of Scouts (Associazione Scautistica Cattolica Italiana - ASCI) in 1916, later named AGESCI. He began working with the latter group. He tried to get Baden-Powell to accept the ASCI as a member of the World Organization of the Scout Movement. He also try to get the BBS back together with the Boy Scouts Association. Both of these efforts were without success. In 1927, he left for the United Kingdom as the Fascists quashed the Italian Scouting Movement, in favour of the Opera Nazionale Balilla (ONB), an Italian Fascist youth organisation. Despite a private letter to Sir Francis Vane 24 April 1933, sympathising with Vane’s worries, the Balilla was an organisation that was publicly highly praised by Baden- Powell,The praise was given in an article published in the Daily Telegraph - Jeal, Tim, Baden-Powell, Hutchinson 1989, page 545 as the application of scouting as part of national education. ==Personal life== He succeeded his cousin Sir Henry Ralph Fletcher-Vane as baronet in 1908. His first wife, Anna Oliphant da Costa Ricci, daughter of the Baron Anselmo da Costa Ricci of Portugal, whom he married in 1888, died in 1922. Vane became a Knight Commander of the Order of Christ (Portugal) in 1889. He married his second wife, Kathleen Crosbie in 1927. Sir Francis died in 1934 aged 72, after spending his last year of life in ill health at St Thomas' Hospital in Lambeth.Information supplied by the Reverend Dr Michael Foster from information held in the British Boy Scouts Archive ==Further reading== * Francis Fletcher Vane, Agin the governments: memories and adventures of Sir Francis Fletcher Vane (London, Sampson Low, Marston & Co., Ltd., 1929) ==ReferencesExternal links== *ODNB article by Roger T.

Retrieved April 25, 2015 ==Career== In 1972, Ruffin pioneered self-serve gasoline in Kansas, creating a chain of 60 convenience stores in the Midwest. In 1987, he then used cash from the convenience stores to build his first hotel, a Marriott in Wichita. His businesses also included oil distribution and one of the country's largest manufacturers of hand trucks. In 1994, Ruffin leased his convenience stores to Total, using the money to purchase more hotels. Then, in 1995, Ruffin acquired the Crystal Palace casino resort in the Bahamas. Mortgaging the casino, Ruffin then purchased the New Frontier Hotel and Casino. New Frontier Hotel and Casino Ruffin is best known for his purchase of the New Frontier Hotel and Casino, one of the Las Vegas Strip's venerable properties. When he bought the resort from Margaret Elardi and her family, it had been mired in a longtime strike, the longest running in American history, with employees represented by the Culinary Workers Union, one of the most powerful labor organizations in Las Vegas. Ruffin settled the strike very soon after his purchase in 1998. Soon after, the casino-hotel became known as the New Frontier. In 2005, Ruffin announced plans to demolish the New Frontier and replace it in 2005 with a new resort to be called The Montreaux, but the development never got off the ground. Ruffin sold the New Frontier to El Ad Properties in 2007. The $1.2 billion sale price for the property was the largest per-acre price in The Strip's history. Treasure Island MGM Mirage sold Treasure Island Hotel and Casino (TI) to Ruffin in March of 2009. The negotiated price was $600 million in cash and $175 million in secured notes. Ruffin estimates that to build a casino like Treasure Island from the ground up would cost $2.7 billion. In calendar year 2008, Treasure Island reported $376M in revenue (down from $431M in 2007) and $101M in EBITDA. Ruffin expressed his lack of concern about buying a casino in a down market, because the TI will have very little debt. Ruffin took complete ownership of the hotel and casino resort in the early morning of March 20, 2009. In February 2018 he said he had turned down a \\"huge\\" offer for TI from a Chinese firm, explaining that Strip assets are \\"irreplaceable.\\" \\"There isn't any price they could throw at me that would interest me,\\" he said. \\"Money is not that valuable. Assets are valuable, especially when they are irreplaceable.\\"Prince, Todd; Treasure Island owner stays upbeat on Las Vegas prospects; Las Vegas Review Journal; February 3, 2018; Trump International Tower Ruffin's joint venture with his friend Donald Trump involved a portion of the New Frontier land. The Trump International Hotel and Tower, built immediately adjacent to the Fashion Show Mall, broke ground in July 2005. The tower opened in March 2008, and plans for an identical second tower were announced. Ruffin has a half-interest in the development, having contributed the land for his part of the deal.Who Owns Vegas: Ruffin Companies Circus Circus MGM Resorts International sold Circus Circus Las Vegas to Ruffin in December 2019 for $825 million. The purchase includes the adjacent Slots-A-Fun Casino, the Adventuredome amusement park, and adjacent open space. Ruffin plans to add to the property a swimming pool complex with a wave machine, sand beaches and a lazy river ride. Wichita Greyhound Park Ruffin's company owns Wichita Greyhound Park. On August 7, 2007, Ruffin announced that he would close the track, after a voting referendum to allow slot machines or casino gambling at his dog racing track failed by a narrow margin.Hurst, Laviana; Lefler, Dion: Track; Wichita Eagle; August 7, 2007; The referendum to expand gambling at the dog track was long opposed by Kansas state Senate President Susan Wagle, a Republican who owned bingo parlors with her husband. Wagle said, \\"Those of us who oppose gaming don’t have millions of dollars to fend off Mr. Ruffin every time he wants to push a ballot initiative.\\" Her campaign spokesman wrote that Wagle's change in voting to instead support the 2018 gaming bill came, \\"...after meeting with Mr. Ruffin and other leaders in the Wichita business community and after learning about the uneven tax treatment that had been leveled on the industry.\\" \\"Tax fairness and tax equity is a top concern for Senator Wagle.\\" When interviewed, Ruffin said Wagle would make a good U.S. senator, dismissing the contention that her position change regarding expanded gaming led to his support. Wagle had long opposed expansion of alternate forms of gambling in Kansas. Six months after receiving a contribution of $1,000 to her 2018 state senate campaign from Ruffin, the owner of Kansas racehorse and greyhound tracks, she reversed her position. Since that time, Ruffin has scaled up his support. He gave her $1,000 more for her state senate campaign, then contributed $5,000 more, the maximum allowable in federal campaigns, to her 2020 primary for the U.S. Senate. Asked about the contributions by a McClatchy newspaper reporter, Ruffin became angry, saying, “What are you trying to find out, young man? What are you trying to do?

Trump had flown on Ruffin's private jet to Moscow in 2013 for the Trump-owned Miss Universe Pagaent.https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/19/us/politics/trump-interview- transcript.html At the time Ruffin himself was married to a former Miss Universe, Ukrainian supermodel, Oleksandra Nikolayenko. Trump has since been accused of having engaged with prostitutes at a hotel room during that trip in urolagna-related sexual activities, and that those activities were filmed by Russian agents intended for the blackmailing of Donald Trump (kompromat). Former British intelligence officer, Christopher Steele provided reports of such activities, although they have not been substantiated in any major media outlets. Trump has repeatedly denied having stayed overnight in Moscow for the pageant (and therefore didn't require a hotel room) despite flight records indicating that Ruffin's plane arrived in Moscow on a Friday morning and departed Sunday. On that same trip. Ruffin may also have attended a meeting with Trump, Trump's bodyguard Keith Schiller, and local Russian officials regarding the development of a Trump Tower Moscow, another important aspect of the Trump-Russia Investigation.  Trump Campaign  In 2015, Trump also mentioned Ruffin as a person that he would send as an envoy to China if elected president. Ruffin said later that the remark was a joke. Ruffin loaned Trump his personal 737 BBJ jet to fly to Mexico City to meet with Mexican President Enrique Peña Nieto on August 31, 2016. Ruffin gave $1 million in 2015 to the Make America Great Again PAC, a super PAC supporting the Trump's campaign for the presidency. Ruffin's contribution made up more than half of all of the contributions received by the super PAC ($1.74 million). The super PAC shut down and refunded Ruffin's money after the Washington Post reported on its close association with Trump's campaign. At an event in January 2016, Trump praised Ruffin for making a $1 million donation to veterans' groups. In April 2017, Ruffin said that he talks with Trump every fortnight or so. \\"If something comes up, I’ll call him,\\" Ruffin stated. \\"They’ll always put me through. But I don't call unless it's something important.\\" In May 2017, he lamented that the news media had \\"a vendetta\\" against Trump. \\"I don't know how he can stand it,\\" Ruffin said. \\"Every day it's something new. If he says good morning, they find something wrong with that.\\" He added that Trump was \\"not used to that level of criticism.

The character was introduced into the serial as part of a group of four \\"20 somethings.\\" Saleeba began filming in July and she made her first on-screen appearance on 12 October 2006. Rosetta's storylines included an arranged marriage, a same-sex kiss and pseudocyesis. She departed on 25 April 2008. ==Character creation and casting== Rosetta was created in 2006 along with another three characters as part of a new group of \\"20 somethings\\". Nicky Whelan, Ben Lawson and Christian Clark were cast as Pepper Steiger, Frazer Yeats and Will Griggs respectively. Their introduction was part of the producers attempts to introduce more contemporary characters and to fill the void left by several cast departures. Executive producer Ric Pellizzeri said \\"We've got 15-to-18-year olds and the 35-plus brigade, we've always liked the shenanigans of Toadfish (Ryan Maloney) and friends at No. 30, so we thought, rather than introduce a new family, we'll bring in some new 20-somethings as housemates and fill the middle ground we've been missing.\\" Despite not knowing each other, the characters all share the same house upon their arrivals, which was a first for the series. Former All Saints actress Saleeba was cast as Rosetta and she began filming in July. Saleeba said that it was a \\"bonus\\" joining the show at the same time as the others, as it made the process easier and less intimidating joining an established cast. Rosetta was given immediate family connections within the show in the form of younger sister and already established character Carmella Cammeniti (Natalie Blair). ==Character development== Characterisation Before appearing on-screen Rosetta was described as Carmella's \\"strait-laced older sister\\", \\"a young lawyer and the object of Frazer's affections\\". Network Ten said Rosetta \\"appears to be just your average uptight lawyer. However, scratch the surface of the feisty Italian and you'll find that she can be every bit as passionate as her wayward younger sister Carmella.\\" They commented on the burden of her being the eldest child, which automatically ensured she had to be responsible, they also state that she transformed as a person upon arriving in Ramsay Street, describing her as uptight, but eventually settling down. They add that she is eager to please her parents all the time, saying it was once her sole aim in life. Rosie is also career driven and business minded putting them before a family. Pellizzeri said that Saleeba plays the \\"perfect Neighbours character – a 27-year-old virgin.\\" Audiences felt Rosetta and Carmella were cast well as they looked alike, Blair said they work well together as a unit and Rosetta's presence changes Carmella for the good. Relationships Rosetta's relationship with Frazer is a focal point of her storylining, it has provided the character different plots, including choosing her career over starting a family and her subsequent false pregnancy, of this during an interview with entertainment website Lastbroadcast Salebba stated: \\"Frazer's desperate to start a family, but Rosie feels that her career as a lawyer is more important at this time in her life, it creates a lot of tension between them. But then Rosetta really does fall pregnant, with complicated consequences...\\" One of Rosetta's most notable storylines is a kiss shared with Pepper in the heat of the moment, the characters were portrayed agreeing to forget it ever happened. Australian press branded the kiss as a failed attempt to gain ratings for the serial, also stating it aired practically unnoticed along with a number of would be attention grabbing plots. Describing Rosetta and Frazer's exit storyline, Dan Bennet speaking for Network Ten states: \\"It will be a bittersweet departure for them. They will experience a big tragedy and, on the beck of that, find a sense of new hope.\\" ==Storylines== A lawyer and the older sister of Carmella, Rosetta moves into No. 30 Ramsay Street along with Pepper Steiger, Frazer Yeats and Will Griggs. She had previously lived with her mother Lucia (Maria Mercedes), until she decided to cut herself loose, break up with her fiancé she was not in love with, and move to Erinsborough. Rosetta develops feelings for housemate Will, but did not act upon them out of fear of being rejected; meanwhile, fellow housemate Frazer had hidden feelings for her. Upon finding out Will only had eyes for sister Carmella, Rosetta's feelings for him disappeared. Rosetta has an affair with Paul Robinson (Stefan Dennis) which leads him to leave his new wife Lyn Scully (Janet Andrewartha) on the day of their wedding. The affair does not last, and Rosetta and Frazer begin dating. However, when Frazer confesses to Rosetta that he is really George Brown, the brother of her former fiancé, Johnny Brown, she leaves him and takes comfort with Paul. Upon learning that Paul had an affair with her best friend, Pepper, Rosetta lashes out at him, accusing him of mistreating her friend. Pepper, overwhelmed by Rosetta's act of friendship, spontaneously kisses her before Rosetta kisses her back, unaware that Frazer's brother Ringo (Sam Clark) is watching. Ringo spreads the word, and everyone briefly suspects Rosetta and Pepper are gay. Rosetta reunites with Frazer, who has become wheelchair bound following an accident on a race track. After they sort out their issues and learn more about each other, Rosetta and Frazer get engaged. Frazer surprises everyone by walking on the day of the wedding. After the wedding ceremony the mini bus that is taking residents back to the street crashes leaving many injured, including Carmella and Ringo. Rosetta's boss Tim Collins (Ben Anderson) puts a lot of pressure on her by giving her more opportunities, which conflicts with everyone's increasing expectation that she and Frazer will start a family. After Tim's pressurising puts Toadie in hospital from a panic attack, they decide to quit and start their own partnership, which becomes a success. Though Frazer wants children, they both realise that they are not ready, so they agree to wait. After seeing how difficult it was for Carmella during Chloe's birth, Rosetta is convinced that she will never be able to stand the emotional strain of having children. However, she finds out, much to her distress, that she is pregnant. Frazer tells her that if she cannot raise the baby, he will – as a sole parent. Rosetta promises to try to raise the baby because she wants to save their marriage. Rosetta starts to look forward to having the baby, especially after becoming Chloe's godmother. When Rosetta believes she has lost the baby, a doctor confirms that there was no baby in the first place. They go for another scan and the doctor finds a heartbeat. After this Rosetta and Frazer decide to go to Italy to visit her extended family. Rosetta gives birth to a son, who she and Frazer name Marco, and they settle down in Italy. ==Reception== Saleeba was nominated in the \\"Best Newcomer\\" category at the \\"2007 Inside Soap Awards\\". They following year she and Lawson were nominated for \\"Best Couple\\". Lowculture's Ruth Deller praised Rosetta's relationship with Frazer describing it as a high point for Neighbours and said the serial would be \\"dull\\" without them. She also compared them with past couples saying, \\"Of the more recent additions to the cast [...] two of the most loved have been Frazer and Rosie. Brittle, neurotic, flawed but ultimately sweet Rosie and thoroughly nice and not-unattractive Frazer are one of those Ramsay Street couples that just work, and have been totally right for the show – feeling just as, well, Neighbours-y as pairings such as Madge and Harold, Scott and Charlene and Des and Daphne.\\" TV Scoop called Rosie and Frazer \\"formed, warm, witty characters who have been a genuinely great addition to the street\\". The Birmingham Mail chose Paul confessing his love for Rosetta and her confusion as their \\"pick of the day\\". Natalie Craig writing for The Sydney Morning Herald said Rosetta is like Maria from West Side Story - because she was \\"young, Italian and forced into an engagement with a man she does not desire\\". She jested it made Erinsborough appear like The Bronx. ==References== Category:Fictional lawyers Category:Neighbours characters Category:Television characters introduced in 2006 Category:Female characters in television ","title":"Rosetta Cammeniti"},{"id":"12394804","text":"The Alexandra was an all-wooden bodied electric brougham made by the Phoenix Carriage Co of Birmingham from 1905 to 1906.

The London and West Australian Exploration Company acquired the Sons of Gwalia property on 17 November 1897, and Bewick Moreing & Co launched Sons of Gwalia, Limited on the London Stock Exchange in January 1898. Hoover was appointed Superintendent of the Sons of Gwalia Mine and managed it from May to November 1898 before moving on to China. He was later to become 31st President of the United States (1929–1933). The mine operated continuously until 1963 when it closed and Sons of Gwalia, Limited was liquidated. Geology Gold mineralization occurred in the Mine schist, which was up to 150 m thick. Lenticular ore bodies occurred in this schist, with the eastern limb called the Main Lode dipping 45 degrees to the east, and the western limb called the West Lode dipping 38 degrees to the east, since the surface expression was horseshoe shaped plunging to the south at a 70 degree angle. The Mine schist is bracketed by a hanging wall of basalt and a foot wall of ultramafic rock. Pyrite was the most common of the sulfide minerals in the orebody. The Gwalia lode system was developed down to 1750 m. Third incarnation Sons of Gwalia NL was incorporated in August 1981. It issued its initial public prospectus in 1983 to raise $2.5 million on the Perth Stock Exchange (later the Australian Securities Exchange).How sons of Lalor built, then sank, Sons of Gwalia The Sydney Morning Herald, published: 22 August 2005.

The organisation played a key role in the establishment of the Australian Society of Authors in 1963, a national body and now the main professional organisation in Australia for writers of literary works. As of 2018, the following state- based independent organisations carried the name: Fellowship of Australian Writers NSW Inc. (a continuation of the original), Fellowship of Australian Writers Queensland, Fellowship of Australian Writers Tasmania, Fellowship of Australian Writers (VIC) Inc., and the Fellowship of Australian Writers (WA) Inc., most of which were founded in the 1930s. ==History== Various claims have been made about its origin, but it seems that poet, Mary Gilmore, was encouraged by Roderic Quinn, and helped by Lucy Cassidy (wife of poet R.J. Cassidy), to hold a meeting of writers, at which a president, John Le Gay Brereton was elected.Wilde et al. (1994) It was initially a Sydney-based organisation, but gradually spread to other states, with Victoria and Western Australia being the first. In 1955 a federal council was created, with the national president rotating between the state presidents. Early prominent members include: in New South Wales, Flora Eldershaw, Marjorie Barnard, Frank Dalby Davison, Dymphna Cusack, Miles Franklin and T. Inglis Moore; in Victoria, Nettie Palmer; and in Western Australia, Paul Buddee, Henrietta Drake-Brockman and Katharine Susannah Prichard. The FAW was, with ex-Prime Minister Jim Scullin, largely responsible for a trebling of the Commonwealth Literary Fund's budget in 1939.**Wilde, William H.; Hooton, Joy; and Andrews, Barry The Oxford Companion to Australian Literature Oxford University Press, Melbourne 2nd ed. ==Australian Authors' Week== In 1935 the Fellowship organised an Authors' Week to, in the words of their press release, \\"encourage the development of our national literature, especially by bringing the work of our authors before the general public and schools\\".cited by Dever (1992) p. 101 The week took place from 8 to 13 April and was held at Farmers' Blaxland Galleries. Events included personal appearances by authors, display of Australian books, dramatisations from Australian works, lectures by writers, radio broadcasts and an authors' ball.Dever (1992) p.101 The Week was prompted by a longstanding desire of the Fellowship to strengthen the place of Australian literature in Australian society, and it was believed that a way to do this was to encourage a closer dialogue between authors and their audience. The week was preceded by significant promotion and communication to the community primarily through newspapers and magazines. An editorial written in The Telegraph during the week commented on the popularity of Ion Idriess and suggested that: > Therein is cause to hope that ere long the appreciation for Australian > writings will grow and widen to embrace the works of many others who, with a > growing confidence in ultimate success, are continually and obscurely > working to give Australians a literature which they may call their own.cited > by Dever (1992) p. 105 The events of the week were mostly held during the day and hence primarily reached, or in some cases specifically targeted at, women, children and teachers. Indeed, it was generally accepted that women formed the bulk of the readership. Norman Lindsay, for example, wrote that \\"My personal opinion is that the average woman reads much better stuff than the average man\\".Dever (1992) p. 107 In his Authors' Week talk, Frank Dalby Davison said that \\"many people preferred yelling themselves hoarse at a test match or racecourse to reading a book by a cultured author\\". Overall, the Week was deemed a success, with Marjorie Barnard writing that they'd received \\"a good deal of publicity\\" and were \\"pretty satisfied with the effort\\".Dever (1992) p. 109 ==Awards== Historical The FAW Patricia Weickhardt Award to an Aboriginal Writer was awarded from 1976 to 1991. Winners included David Unaipon (posthumously), Sally Morgan, Oodgeroo Noonuccal and Dick Roughsey In 1999, David Foster and Bruce Pascoe jointly won the FAW Australian Literature Award.

There is a wall plaque with the date 911, but this is certainly a fake as the style of the church and its windows did not appear in Scotland until the late 12th century, which coincides with an account that states it \\"probably dates back to the late 1100s.\\" William Comyn did not inherit the Earldom of Buchan until 1212, so the chapel's construction almost certainly did not begin prior to this date. William Comyn is recorded as giving the chapel \\"a gift of wax\\" on a yearly basis \\"between 1214 and 1233\\" so it must have at least been under construction as early as 1214. The gift \\"derived from bees\\" had a weight of \\"two stones\\" (approx. 10.8 kg)Historically a stone of wax was equal to 12 pounds (not 14 as is standard in today's imperial measurements), so it would likely (but not certainly) have been approximately 10.8 kilograms in modern weight. and was the full amount that Comyn received from \\"Cospatric Macmadethyn\\"... \\"at Whitsunday yearly\\" for the rent of the \\"lands and mill of Stratheyn and Kyndrochet\\".

The monastery is dedicated to the Virgin Mary (The Golden Virgin Mary of Gialia; Greek: Ιερά Μονή Παναγίας Χρυσογιαλιώτισσας, Panayia Chrysogialiotissa). Located in a forest some five kilometers from the coast near the small town of Polis Chrysochous, the ruins were identified, in 1981, by the Georgian scholar Wachtang Djobadze of California State University on the basis of the medieval Georgian accounts. It was not, however, until 2006 that a systematic archaeological research followed after the Georgian and Cypriot governments agreed to jointly investigate the ruins.Excavations at the Georgian Monastery of Gialia (Pafos). The Government of Cyprus Press and Information Office. December 5, 2006. Retrieved on July 23, 2007. It was reported in 2008 that excavation evidence indicated the monastery was commissioned in the late tenth century by Georgian King David III Kuropalates and that renovations were made during the reign of David IV Aghmashenebeli (1089-1125). The monastery is certainly attested in the twelfth century, when it was renovated at the behest of Queen Tamar of Georgia (1184-1213). Ancient Georgian sources report that it was in Georgian ownership until the fourteenth century, and graves and other items uncovered indicate that it was in use between the fourteenth and sixteenth centuries. It was reportedly plundered and destroyed in the sixteenth century, but appears to have been in use as recently as 1935, until final destruction by an earthquake in 1953. Two main structures have been identified: the earlier Virgin church, and the later St. George's church dated probably to the eleventh and twelfth centuries respectively.

Fellner was born in Moravia. Although untrained, his skills and knowledge, gained through experience, made him one of the most sought after architects of his day. In 1745 he settled in Tata, where he lived almost uninterrupted until his death. He played a major role in the development of towns in the area such as Pápa, Eger and Veszprém. Initially working for the Esterhazy family, his growing reputation led to commissions from many others. His first major work was the Roman Catholic Tata Parish Church, which was initially built according to the plans of Franz Anton Pilgram in 1751, but most of it was erected according to Fellner's plans. Nevertheless, he was unable to finish the work and it was left up to Jozsef Grossmann to complete after Fellner's death. It was finally finished in 1783. Statue of Jakab Fellner in Tata In 1764 Bishop Carl Eszterhazy put Fellner in charge of building works and planning in Eger, and this was to become one of the most important periods of his career. His first work for the city was the stairway section of the Bishop's palace and also its chapel in 1766. He also planned the bishop's palace in Veszprém. Fellner completed the Liceum building in Eger which was initially planned by Jozsef Gerl of Vienna. Fellner's last great work was the Parish Church at Pápa in 1773. Fellner received a title in 1773. He died in Tata, and was buried in the crypt of Christchurch Roman Catholic Church which he had built. His apprentice Jozsef Grossmann finished his unfinished projects and also married his widow. In 1940 a statue was raised in his memory in front of the church in Tata. ==Works== *1751–1776 Tata, Esterhazy castle *1751–1783 Tata, RC Parish church *1753 Tatabanya, garden city (kertvaros) *1754 Tata, Calvary Chapel *1754–1758 Cseklészi Castle *1760 Penitent St John, RC Church *1761 Vértesboglár, Parish house Lamberg Castle in Mór *1762–1767 Mór, Lamberg Castle *1763–1769 Eger, Primate's Palace *1765–1780 Eger, Liceum *1765–1776 Veszprém, Bishop's Palace *1766 Eger, Bishop's palace stairwell and Chapel *1767–1770 Tata, Piarist House *1768 Vértesboglár, hotel *1770–1778 Veszprém, old people's home *1773–1775 Veszprém, seminary *1773 Pápa, Eszterházy castle interior remodelling *1774–1776 Eger, \\"Nagypréposti\\" Palace *1774–1783 Papa, Church *1775–1777 Nagyigmánd, RC Church *1777 Gyömrő, St John of Nepomuk RC Church *1777 Borsodszirák, RC Church *1777 Ászár, RC Church *1773 Pápa, RC Church Numerous mills, e.g. at Tata and Miklos, the Nepomucenus, Jozsef, Cifra and Tovaros mills.

Spotless spokesman Peter Jennings has said that the union had refused to withdraw strike notices and negotiate details of an agreement, while the company also claims the lock out was for health and safety reasons. ==Employment Court case== The union took Spotless to the Employment Court, arguing that the lockout was illegal, The lockout was overturned by the court on July 23. Chief Judge Graeme Colgan agreed with the union that Spotless was wrong to ask some employees to make themselves available for work during strike action, which was the basis of the lockout. According to union spokesperson Alastair Duncan \\"More lost hours have been generated by Spotless in this one lockout, than the total lost hours of every other industrial dispute in our public hospitals over the past ten years,\\". The union is currently attempting to claim back lost wages from Spotless, estimated to run to as much as $1 million. The workers returned to work on July 25 and agreed to put further industrial action on hold for at least 48 hours. == Settlement == After the lock out ended Spotless agreed to pay its workers a starting rate of $14.25 an hour, three dollars higher than the minimum wage, and the same wage paid by the three other contractors.

It is a book-length expansion of Weisman's own February 2005 Discover article \\"Earth Without People\\". Written largely as a thought experiment, it outlines, for example, how cities and houses would deteriorate, how long man- made artifacts would last, and how remaining lifeforms would evolve. Weisman concludes that residential neighborhoods would become forests within 500 years, and that radioactive waste, bronze statues, plastics, and Mount Rushmore would be among the longest-lasting evidence of human presence on Earth. The author of four previous books and numerous articles for magazines, Weisman traveled to interview academics, scientists and other authorities. He used quotations from these interviews to explain the effects of the natural environment and to substantiate predictions. The book has been translated and published in many countries. It was successful in the U.S., reaching #6 on the New York Times Best Seller list and #1 on the San Francisco Chronicle Best- Sellers list in September 2007. It ranked #1 on TimePoniewozik, James; Top 10 New TV Series; time.com and Entertainment Weekly's of 2007. ==Background== The idea of exploring the effects of the depopulating of the Earth is an old one, having been a regular trope in science fiction novels for decades. Post- apocalyptic literature in general had often tried to imagine the fate of civilization and its artifacts after the end of humanity. Indeed, an extremely popular 1949 novel, Earth Abides, portrayed the breakdown of urban systems and structures after a pandemic, through the eyes of a survivor, who muses at the end of the first chapter: \\"What would happen to the world and its creatures without man? That he was left to see.\\" The World Without Us applies a more ecological view to Earth Abides. Before writing it, the author, Alan Weisman, had written four books, including, Gaviotas: A Village to Reinvent the World, in 1998, about the eco-village of Gaviotas in Colombia; and An Echo In My Blood, in 1999, about his family's history immigrating from Ukraine to the United States. He has worked as an international journalist for American magazines and newspapers, and at the time of writing the book was an Associate Professor of Journalism and Latin American Studies at the University of Arizona. The position required him to teach only one class in the spring semester, and he was free to travel and conduct research the rest of the year. The idea for The World Without Us was suggested to Weisman in 2004 by Josie Glausiusz, an editor at Discover.Weisman (2007), 277. She had pondered the idea for several years and asked Weisman to write a feature on the subject after she re-read \\"Journey through a Doomed Land\\", an article he published in 1994 in Harper's Magazine about the state of Chernobyl eight years after abandonment. His Discover article, \\"Earth Without People\\", published in the February 2005 issue and re-printed in The Best American Science Writing 2006 anthology, describes how nature has thrived in the abandoned Korean Demilitarized Zone and how nature would overwhelm the built environment of New York City. Using interviews with paleoecologists, the article speculates that megafauna would return and that forest cover, like the Białowieża Forest, would spread over Europe and the eastern United States. The article raises the prospect of failing power plants, chemical plants, dams, and petroleum tanks. To expand this into a book, Weisman's agent found an editor and publisher at St. Martin's Press. Among the 23-page bibliography are two articles he wrote for the Los Angeles Times Magazine (\\"Naked Planet\\" on the Antarctic ozone hole), and \\"The Real Indiana Jones\\" on the Mayan civilization) and one published in the Condé Nast Traveler (\\"Diamond in the Wild\\" on diamond mining encroaching on North America's largest wildlife preserve), as well as Discover's \\"Earth Without People\\".Weisman (2007), 289–311. Additional research saw Weisman travel to England, Cyprus, Turkey, Panama, and Kenya. Interviews with academics quoted in the book include biologist E. O. Wilson on the Korean Demilitarized Zone,Weisman (2007), 129, 189–190. archaeologist William Rathje on plastics in garbage,Weisman (2007), 119–120. forest botanist Oliver Rackham on vegetative cover across Britain,Weisman (2007), 150–151. anthropologist Arthur Demarest on the crash of Mayan civilization,Weisman (2007), 224–229. paleobiologist Douglas Erwin on evolution,Weisman (2007), 229–232. and philosopher Nick Bostrom on Transhumanism.Weisman (2007), 240–244. ==Synopsis== The book is divided into 27 chapters, with a prelude, coda, bibliography and index. Each chapter deals with a new topic, such as the potential fates of plastics, petroleum infrastructure, nuclear facilities, and artworks. It is written from the point of view of a science journalist with explanations and testimonies backing his predictions. There is no unifying narrative, cohesive single-chapter overview, or thesis. Weisman's thought experiment pursues two themes: how nature would react to the disappearance of humans and what legacy humans would leave behind. To foresee how other life could continue without humans, Weisman reports from areas where the natural environment exists with little human intervention, like the Białowieża Forest, the Kingman Reef, and the Palmyra Atoll. He interviews biologist E. O. Wilson and visits with members of the Korean Federation for Environmental Movement at the Korean Demilitarized Zone where few humans have penetrated since 1953.Weisman (2007), 183-188. He tries to conceive how life may evolve by describing the past evolution of pre-historic plants and animals, but notes Douglas Erwin's warning that \\"we can't predict what the world will be 5 million years later by looking at the survivors\\".Weisman (2007), 232. Several chapters are dedicated to megafauna, which Weisman predicts would proliferate. He profiles soil samples from the past 200 years and extrapolates concentrations of heavy metals and foreign substances into a future without industrial inputs. Carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere and implications for climatic change are likewise examined. The abandoned city of Pripyat, near ChernobylWith material from previous articles, Weisman uses the fate of the Mayan civilization to illustrate the possibility of an entrenched society vanishing and how the natural environment quickly conceals evidence.Weisman (2007), 223-8. To demonstrate how vegetation could compromise human built infrastructure, Weisman interviewed hydrologists and employees at the Panama Canal, where constant maintenance is required to keep the jungle vegetation and silt away from the dams.Weisman (2007), 173-178. To illustrate abandoned cities succumbing to nature, Weisman reports from Chernobyl, Ukraine (abandoned in 1986) and Varosha, Cyprus (abandoned in 1974). Weisman finds that their structures crumble as weather does unrepaired damage and other life forms create new habitats. In Turkey, Weisman contrasts the construction practices of the rapidly growing Istanbul, as typical for large cities in less developed countries, with the underground cities in Cappadocia. Due to a large demand for housing in Istanbul much of it was developed quickly with whatever material was available and could collapse in a major earthquake or other natural disaster.Weisman (2007), 103-105. Cappadocian underground cities were built thousands of years ago out of volcanic tuff, and are likely to survive for centuries to come.Weisman (2007), 106-111. Weisman uses New York City as a model to outline how an unmaintained urban area would deconstruct. He explains that sewers would clog, underground streams would flood subway corridors, and soils under roads would erode and cave in. From interviews with members of the Wildlife Conservation SocietyWeisman (2007), 22-24. and the New York Botanical GardensWeisman (2007), 28-32. Weisman predicts that native vegetation would return, spreading from parks and out-surviving invasive species. Without humans to provide food and warmth, rats and cockroaches would die off. An abandoned house in a state of collapse Weisman explains that a common house would begin to fall apart as water eventually leaks into the roof around the flashings, erodes the wood and rusts the nails, leading to sagging walls and eventual collapse. After 500 years, all that would be left would be aluminum dishwasher parts, stainless steel cookware, and plastic handles.Weisman (2007), 18. The longest-lasting evidence on Earth of a human presence would be radioactive materials, ceramics, bronze statues, and Mount Rushmore. In space, the Pioneer plaques, the Voyager Golden Record, and radio waves would outlast the Earth itself.Weisman (2007), 249-254. Breaking from the theme of the natural environment after humans, Weisman considers what could lead to the sudden, complete demise of humans without serious damage to the built and natural environment. That scenario, he concludes, is extremely unlikely. He also considers transhumanism, the Voluntary Human Extinction Movement, the Church of Euthanasia and John A. Leslie's The End of the World: the Science and Ethics of Human Extinction.Weisman (2007), 239-244. Weisman concludes the book considering a new version of the one-child policy. While he admits it is a \\"draconian measure\\",Weisman (2007), 272. he states, \\"The bottom line is that any species that overstretches its resource base suffers a population crash. Limiting our reproduction would be damn hard, but limiting our consumptive instincts may be even harder.\\" He responded to criticism of this saying \\"I knew in advance that I would touch some people's sensitive spots by bringing up the population issue, but I did so because it's been missing too long from the discussion of how we must deal with the situation our economic and demographic growth have driven us too (sic)\\". ==Publication== The American, Canadian, British, French and Japanese book covers. The book was first published on July 10, 2007, as a hardback in the United States by St. Martin's Thomas Dunne Books, in United Kingdom by Virgin Books and in Canada by HarperCollins. The paperback was released in July 2008. It has been translated and published in Denmark by Borgen as Verden uden os, France by Groupe Flammarion as Homo disparitus, in Germany by Piper as Die Welt ohne uns, in Portugal by Estrela Polar as O Mundo Sem Nós, in Italy by Einaudi as Il mondo senza di noi, in Poland by CKA as Świat bez nas, and in Japan by Hayakawa Publishing as Jinrui ga kieta sekai (人類が消えた世界 ; \\"A World where the Human Race has Disappeared\\"). Pete Garceau designed the cover art for the American release, which one critic said was \\"a thick layer of sugar-coated sweetness in an effort to not alarm potential readers. 'Yes, I am a book about the environment. But I'm harmless! No, really!' \\" The Canadian version, designed by Ellen Cipriano, is similar to the American version but with a photo illustration rather than the disarming cartoon illustration. Cover art for the international releases contrast the natural environment with a decaying built environment. Adam Grupper voiced the ten-hour-long, unabridged English language audiobook which was published by Macmillan Audio and BBC Audiobooks, and released simultaneously with the hardcover book. AudioFile gave the audio presentation its Earphones Award, called Grupper's reading sincere and balanced, and wrote, \\"Never veering into sensationalism, always objective and phlegmatic, Grupper takes what could be a depressing topic and makes it a book you just can't stop listening to\\". ==Reception== As the book was released Weisman launched his book tour with stops throughout the United States, Canada and overseas to Lisbon and Brussels. Weisman did television interviews on The Daily Show and The Today Show and radio interviews on Weekend Edition, Talk of the Nation, The Diane Rehm Show, Living on Earth, Marketplace, and As It Happens. Meanwhile, the book debuted on the New York Times Best Seller list for non-fiction hardcovers at #10 on July 29 and spent nine weeks in the top ten, peaking at #6 on August 12 and September 9. In the Canadian market, it spent 10 weeks on The Globe and Mail's non-fiction best seller list, peaking at #3 on August 11. The book reached #1 on the San Francisco Chronicle Best- Sellers list for non-fiction on September 23 and spent 11 weeks on the USA Today's Top 150 Best-Selling Books, peaking at #48.. Requires navigation to October 28, 2007 or The World Without Us entry. Reviewers at the Library Journal recommended the book for all environmental collections and the audiobook for most public and academic library audiobook collections. The book ranked #1 on Time and Entertainment Weekly's top of 2007 and was listed in the Hudson Booksellers' \\"Best Books published in 2007\\". In the Amazon.com \\"Best Books of 2007\\", it placed #4 overall in the United States and #1 in the non- fiction category in Canada. The writing style was positively received as being vivid and well-written, sometimes grim, but with appropriate language. Even an overall negative review by Michael Grunwald in The Washington Post remarked the writing was \\"always lucid, sometimes elegant\\". In The New York Times Book Review Jennifer Schuessler said Weisman has a \\"flirtation with religious language, his occasionally portentous impassivity giving way to the familiar rhetoric of eco-hellfire\\". Janet Maslin of The New York Times found the writing had \\"an arid, plain, what-if style\\" while being \\"strangely uniform in tone\\". On the reporting techniques, Kamiya wrote that \\"[Weisman's] science reporting, at once lucid and full of wonder ... is the heart and soul of this book\\" and that it is \\"written as if by a compassionate and curious observer on another planet\\". The Plain Dealer book editor Karen Long said Weisman \\"uses the precise, unhurried language of a good science writer and shows a knack for unearthing unexpected sources and provocative facts\\". Several critics found the lack of an anthropomorphic point of view hurt the book's relevance. Robert Braile in The Boston Globe wrote that it has \\"no real context ... no rationale for probing this fantasy other than [Weisman's] unsubstantiated premise that people find it fascinating\\". Michael Grunwald in The Washington Post also questioned the premise: \\"Imagining the human footprint on a post-human planet might be fun for dormitory potheads who have already settled the questions of God's existence and Fergie's hotness, but it's not clear why the rest of us need this level of documentary evidence\\". On the other hand, Alanna Mitchell in the Globe and Mail review found relevance in the context of society's passiveness to resource depletion combined with an anthropomorphic vanity. She writes the \\"book [is] designed to help us find the how of survival by shaking us out of our passive dance with death\\". The book's environmental focus was also criticized by some. Christopher Orlet of The American Spectator wrote that it is \\"a prime example of the wrongheaded, extremist views of the Greens\\". Braile agrees that the book could be \\"an environmentalist's nightmare, possibly fueling the cheap shots taken at the green movement ... by critics who say environmentalists care more about nature than people\\". Environmentalist Alex Steffen found the book presents nothing new, but that using the sudden and clean disappearance of humans provides a unique framework, although extremely unlikely and insensitive. Two critics who call the book a \\"Jeremiad\\" ultimately gave it a positive review. The Guardian says \\"we learn during the course of this book, to feel good about the disappearance of humanity from the Earth\\". Other critics hailed the environmental perspective. Chauncey Mabe of the South Florida Sun-Sentinel calls the book \\"one of the most satisfying environmental books of recent memory, one devoid of self-righteousness, alarmism or tiresome doomsaying\\". Tom Spears of the CanWest News Service concludes \\"it's more a portrait of ourselves, taken through an odd lens\\" and \\"[s]ometimes an obituary is the best biography\\". ==Genre== The book is categorized as non-fiction science but some commentators emphasize it may be better described as speculative fiction. The World Without Us is grounded in environmental and science journalism. Like other environmental books, it discusses the impact that the human race has had on the planet. Weisman's thought experiment removes the judgments and sufferings of humans by focusing on a hypothetical post-human world. This approach to the genre, which \\"throw[s] the spotlight on the earth itself\\", was found to be creative and objective. There have been other books that address similar topics, such as Gregory Benford's 1999 book Deep Time: How Humanity Communicates Across Millennia. Science fiction writers such as H. G. Wells (The War of the Worlds, 1898) and John Wyndham (The Day of the Triffids, 1951) had earlier touched upon the possible fate of cities and other man-made structures after the sudden removal of their creators. Similar parallels in the decay of civilization are detailed in 1949 post-apocalyptic science fiction novel by Berkeley English professor George R. Stewart, Earth Abides. Addressing his approach, Weisman said that eliminating the human element eliminated the \\"fear factor\\" that people are doing something wrong or that they will die; it is meant to be read as a fantasy, according to the author. Josie Appleton of Spiked related the book to \\"today's romanticisation of nature\\" in that it linked \\"the decadence and detachment of a modern consumerist society\\" with an ignorance of the efforts required to produce products so easily disposed. Appleton also felt the book countered the \\"Nature knows best\\" notion by highlighting the randomness of natural forces. Weisman's science journalism style uses interviews with academic and professional authorities to substantiate conclusions, while maintaining the \\"cool and dispassionate [tone]...of a scientific observer rather than an activist\\". Weisman said he purposely avoided the activist label: \\"Some of our finest science and nature writers only get read by people who already agree with them. It's nice to get some affirmation for whatever it is you believe is true, even if it's quite sobering, but I wanted to write something that people would read ... without minimizing the significance of what's going on, nor trivializing it, nor oversimplifying it.\\" Richard Fortey compares the book to the works of Jared Diamond, Tim Flannery and E.O. Wilson, and writes that The World Without Us \\"narrowly avoids engendering the gloom-and-doom ennui that tends to engulf the poor reader after reading a catalogue of human rapacity\\". Mark Lynas in the New Statesman noted that \\"whereas most environmental books sag under the weight of their accumulated bad news, The World Without Us seems refreshingly positive\\". Demonstrating the optimism on the grim subject matter Appleton quotes an ecologist from the book saying \\"if the planet can recover from the Permian, it can recover from the human\\". ==In popular culture== * The Earth After Us explores the geological legacy of the human species. * There Will Come Soft Rains, a 1920 poem by Sara Teasdale. * After Man: A Zoology of the Future considers the evolution of life on Earth 50 million years after the extinction of human beings. * The plot of Foundation and Earth by Isaac Asimov (a continuation of his Foundation Trilogy), includes Aurora, a habitable planet which was abandoned by people for thousands of years. That planet, however, was settled by people, and its limited ecology was maintained by them, leading to its deterioration in the absence of human beings. There have been several TV specials relating to the same topic: * Life After People shows what would happen if humans disappeared instantly. * Aftermath: Population Zero is the same as the above, but gives more detail into certain things. * The Future Is Wild, while not seeking to explain our disappearance, shows how life on Earth (without humans) would evolve 5, 100 and 200 million years in the future. The 2009 hip-hop song \\"The High Line\\" by Kinetics & One Love, inspired by The World Without Us, is a pro-green, anti-deforestation song that paints the picture of trees and plants reclaiming the buildings of New York City long after the presence of humans. Like author Alan Weisman, rapper Kinetics uses the High Line railway in Manhattan as an example of nature’s potential for reclamation of manmade structures. The 2013 video game The Last of Us, which takes place twenty years after an apocalyptic event, uses The World Without Us as inspiration for the look of the city settings.Grounded: The Making Of The Last of Us The 2017 video game NieR: Automata, which considers the Earth devoid of humanity for several hundreds of years, draws heavy inspiration from The World Without Us's depictions of cities and former civilisation habitats in its level design. In 2009 20th Century Fox purchased the rights to the book with the intent of creating a motion picture. ==ReferencesExternal links== * Category:2007 non-fiction books Category:2007 in the environment Category:English-language books Category:Environmental non-fiction books Category:Futurology books Category:Human extinction Category:Post-apocalyptic novels Category:Thought experiments ","title":"The World Without Us"},{"id":"12395055","text":"Shri R.

In 2009, she was openly critical of the Left Front rule of the state of Bengal, saying that crimes against women have been growing in the previous 33 years of rule. In 2014, she was part of a group of women who supported an Aam Sabha for the 33% Women's Reservation Bill. She stated that the bill would help \\"empower Indian women socially, economically and politically.\\" Thakur has spoken out on other women's issues, calling for stricter anti-rape provisions in India. Thakur was also a supporter of laws against 'honour killings.' She has responded to comments about implementing dress codes to combat incidents of rape and has been quoted saying, \\"The question is not about the dress code, but the mentality of men. What the girls should wear should be the concern of the girl, her parents and her family only. I don't think there is a need for anyone else to say anything about how a girl should behave.\\" Thakur believes instead, that as more women see rapists being dealt \\"justice,\\" they will be more likely to file cases against assailants. She has previously spoken out about the amount of violent crime against women in Delhi. == References External links== * Detailed Profile in india.gov.in website Category:Indian National Congress politicians from Rajasthan Category:Rajya Sabha members from Rajasthan Category:12th Lok Sabha members Category:1949 births Category:Living people Category:Lok Sabha members from Rajasthan Category:Women in Rajasthan politics Category:20th-century Indian women politicians Category:20th-century Indian politicians Category:People from Ajmer district ","title":"Prabha Thakur"},{"id":"12395075","text":"Title page of La clef des chansonniers, a 1717 collection of vaudevilles A vaudeville is a French satirical poem or song born of the 17th and 18th centuries. Its name is lent to the French theatrical entertainment comédie en vaudeville of the 19th and 20th century. From these vaudeville took its name. The earliest vaudeville was the vau de vire, a Norman song of the 15th century, named after the valley of Vire. During the 16th century emerged a style in urban France called the voix de ville (city voice), whose name may have been a pun on vau de vire, and which was also satirical. The two styles converged and in the 17th and 18th century the term \\"vaudeville\\" came to be used for songs satirizing political and court events. In 1717 a collection was published in Paris of over 300 vaudevilles, entitled La clef des chansonniers, ou recueil des vaudevilles depuis 100 ans et plus [The singers' key, or collection of Vaudevilles from over 100 years], and in 1733 in the same city a club, \\"Le Caveau\\", was founded devoted to singing vaudevilles. Ballard, Jean Baptiste Christophe (d. 1750), Lully, Jean Baptiste (1632-1687) & Charpentier, Marc-Antoine (1643-1704). La clef des chansonniers: ou, Recueil des vaudevilles depuis cent ans & plus, Paris: Ballard, 1717. From these popular but simple airs evolved the comédie en vaudeville, which was itself a precursor of the opéra comique.

The Ten Spot debuted during the summer of 2004, and the column originally consisted of a humorous top ten list devoted to topical happenings in the world of sports. In May, 2007, his column switched to a blog format, and some readers criticized the change in style. McEntegart announced the format change in his April 27 post: \\"The 10 Spot will be transformed starting on Monday into the 10 Spot Blog. The traditional 10 items-a-day format will be replaced with a free-flowing series of blog posts that will be updated throughout the day.\\" Around the same time, the picture that accompanies his column was changed, and many readers clamored for a return of McEntegart's trademark hat. On December 5, 2008, McEntegart announced in his Ten Spot blog that he had been laid off by Sports Illustrated. A native of New York City, McEntegart graduated from Regis High School in 1987. He frequently discussed his favorite hometown sports teams, including the New York Mets and the New York Giants. Pete is also a fan of LSU's football team. McEntegart graduated magna cum laude from Williams College in 1991 and later from the Journalism School of Columbia University. While at Williams, he worked for the Sports Information Department, and in 1991 he received the Frank Deford Award presented \\"annually to the top student Sports Information Assistant at Williams College.\\" Before writing for Sports Illustrated, McEntegart worked in New York City and London for investment banking firm Goldman Sachs. He has also written for newspapers in Virginia and Lafayette, Louisiana. At the latter paper he covered the Louisiana State University athletics program. Additionally, in 2004, McEntegart served for seven months as a juror on the fraud trial of former Tyco International executive Dennis Kozlowski. This prosecution ended in a mistrial. Pete now lives in Los Angeles. == References == Brief Biography from Williams College Sports Information McEntegart, Pete and Mark Gimein. \\"Mistrials and Tribulations\\" Fortune 19 April 2004. http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2007/writers/pete_mcentegart/04/27/ten.spot/index.html http://www.fannation.com/si_blogs/the_10_spot/posts/30121-happy-trails-to- the-10-spot Category:Living people Category:American sportswriters Category:Year of birth missing (living people) ","title":"Pete McEntegart"},{"id":"12395079","text":"Shri Santosh Bagrodia a politician from Indian National Congress was a Member of the Parliament of India representing Rajasthan in the Rajya Sabha, the upper house of the Indian Parliament till 2010.

It is native to eastern and central North America, from Ontario east to New Hampshire and south as far as Florida, Louisiana, and Oklahoma. It is sometimes called gravel root,trumpet weed or feverweed. ==Description== Eutrochium purpureum is a clump-forming herb that grows to tall and about wide. Plants are found in full sun to part shade in mesic to wet soils. Stems are upright, thick, round, and purple, with whorls of leaves at each node. As the plant begins to bloom the stems often bend downward under the weight of the flowers. The leaves grow to long and have a somewhat wrinkled texture. The purplish flowers are produced in large loose, convex shaped compound corymbiform arrays. Plants bloom mid to late summer and attract much activity from insects that feed on the nectar produced by the flowers. ==Taxonomy== This species hybridizes readily with other species of Eutrochium and where this species and those species overlap in distribution the resulting plants can be difficult to resolve to a specific taxon. There are two varieties that differ in the pubescence of the stems and foliage, but many more have been proposed in the past, though most authorities now accept that this is a variable species and population variations integrate. ==Ecology== Many species of butterflies, moths, bees, and flies visit the flowers. It is larval host to the eupatorium borer moth (Carmenta bassiformis), the red groundling moth (Perigea xanthioides), the ruby tiger moth (Phragmatobia fuliginosa), and the three-lined flower moth (Schinia trifascia).The Xerces Society (2016), Gardening for Butterflies: How You Can Attract and Protect Beautiful, Beneficial Insects, Timber Press. The larvae of Calycomyza flavinotum, a leaf miner fly, create blotch-shaped mines on the leaves. ==Cultivation== Eutrochium purpureum is sometimes cultivated and has escaped from cultivation in parts of New Zealand.\\"Botanica.

In the Greek Septuagint version of the bible, and in its Latin translation in the Vulgate, this psalm is Psalm 82 in a slightly different numbering system. The psalm is the last of the Psalms of Asaph, which include Psalms 50 and 73 to 83. It is also the last of the \\"Elohist\\" collection, Psalm 42–83, in which the one of God's titles, Elohim, is mainly used. It is generally seen as a national lament provoked by the threat of an invasion of Israel by its neighbors. ==Analysis== The psalm has been seen by some commentators as being purely cultic in nature. Others have indicated that the specific naming of particular nations indicates that it does refer to a specific historical period, even though the prayer itself would be offered in the Temple in Jerusalem.Black, Matthew, editor. Peake's Commentary on the Bible. Camden, NJ:Thomas Nelson and Sons, 1962. The dating of the composition of the Psalm is debated, but the reference in verse 9 to Assyria is by many sources seen as an indication that the Psalm was written during the time of Assyrian ascendancy, the 9th to 7th centuries BC.The New Jerome Biblical Commentary. Engelwood Cliffs, NJ: Prentice-Hall, 1990. . Others have placed the composition of the psalm between the time of Saul to the age of the Maccabees, suggested by Theodore of Mopsuestia.Barton, John and John Muddiman, editors. The Oxford Bible Commentary. Oxford:Oxford University Press, 2001. . ==Verses== Verse 1 The specific meaning of this verse is disputed. The verb can be translated to refer to either speech (\\"be not silent\\") or motion (\\"be not inactive\\"). The fact that the verse requests the assistance of God three times emphasizes the urgency of the situation and of the people's prayer. Verses 2–5 In the text of the psalm, specifically verses 2 through 5, the speaker makes the assumption that individuals who plot against the nation of Israel must inherently be enemies of God.Farmer, William R., editor. The International Bible Commentary. Collegeville, MN: The Liturgical Press, 1998. . He also ascribes to them the intention of the complete extinction of the people of Israel, as that is the meaning of verse 4, which indicates that the name of Israel will be obliterated or remembered no more. Verses 6–8 These verses provide the names of the ten nations which have evidently formed a coalition against Israel, the Edomites, the Ishmaelites, Moab, the Hagrites, Gebal, Ammon, Amalek, the Philistines, Tyre, and Assyria. Verses 9–12 The narrator goes on to assume that God himself will fight on Israel's side in the upcoming battle, based on the stories contained in the 4th through 8th chapters of the Book of Judges, citing individual actions attributed to God in that book. Verses 13–17 In these verses, the narrator specifically requests that God make the opponents of Israel suffer and experience shame and die in disgrace for opposing Israel, and, by extension, God himself. The specifics mentioned, including chaff, fire and storm, are references to the Sirocco. Verse 18 Psalm 83:18 – The Geneva Bible (1560): God's name Iehouah (in older Latin transcription form), that is Jehovah. In this verse, the narrator states that he wishes God perform these various acts so that all might know that God is the most powerful entity and has sway over all the Earth. This verse, with verse 16, indicates that, although the bulk of the psalm is a prayer for the destruction of the enemies of Israel, there is some positive hope that the enemies of Israel might come to acknowledge the god of Israel. While the King James Version most often translates the tetragrammaton- YHWH (which occurs in the Hebrew scriptures 6,828 times) as \\"LORD\\", this verse has one of the several occurrences in which it is translated as \\"JEHOVAH\\". It is one of the few verses where the phrases \\"whose name is\\" or \\"that is my name\\" are used (Isa 42:8, Jer 33:2, etc.) in the whole Bible. Notably, for these reasons this particular verse in the King James Bible is widely quoted, particularly by Jehovah's Witnesses, as evidence that \\"Jehovah\\" is the personal name of God. . Different translations interpret the verse as follows: {  - ! Translation ! Psalm 83:18 -  ASV  \\"That they may know that thou alone, whose name is JEHOVAH, Art the Most High over all the earth.\\" -  KJV  \\"That men may know that thou, whose name alone is JEHOVAH, art the most high over all the earth.\\" -  NKJV  \\"That they may know that You, whose name alone is the Lord, Are the Most High over all the earth.\\" -  NAB  \\"Show them you alone are the LORD, the Most High over all the earth.\\" (as verse 19) -  NWT  \\"That people may know that you, whose name is JEHOVAH, you alone are the Most High over all the earth.\\" -  REB  \\"So let it be known that you, whose name is the LORD, are alone Most High over all the earth.\\" -  RSV  \\"Let them know that thou alone, whose name is the LORD, art the Most High over all the earth.\\" -  WEB  \\"that they may know that you alone, whose name is YAHWEH, are the Most High over all the earth.\\" -  YLT \\"And they know that Thou – (Thy name [is] JEHOVAH – by Thyself,) [Art] the Most High over all the earth!\\" } * Bibelarchiv-Vegelahn * BibleGateway ==See also== * Ezekiel 38 and 39, a passage that describes a similar war ==References External links == * in Hebrew and English – Mechon-mamre * King James Bible – Wikisource 083 ","title":"Psalm 83"},{"id":"12395265","text":"Shreegopal Vyas (born 15 February 1932) is an Indian politician of the Bharatiya Janata Party and a member of the Parliament of India representing Chhattisgarh in the Rajya Sabha, the upper house of the Parliament.

Described by Willamette Week writer Jason Simms as \\"The missing link between The Wipers and Nirvana,\\" the Obituaries are notable as one of the most successful bands in the Pacific Northwest club scene of the late 1980s. The Obituaries were known for the fiery voice and unpredictable stage presence of vocalist Monica Nelson. Guitarist Rob Landoll anchored the band with his blues-based punk riffs. In addition to being the band's principal songwriters, Nelson and Landoll were the only constant members during the band’s career. ==History== The Obituaries were formed in 1986 by singer Monica Nelson, guitarist Rob Landoll, bassist Laura O'Donnell and drummer Aaron MacMahon. After the addition of bassist John Allan Naylor and drummer Dan Cunneen (Final Warning, Zipgun, Nightcaps), the group quickly gained a reputation in Portland and was soon headlining venues like Satyricon and Pine Street Theatre. The Obituaries released a cassette in late 1986 and a 6-song vinyl EP in 1987 on their own label, Highgate Records. The band had several rhythm section changes. In addition to Cunneen, former drummers include: Dave Triebwasser (Pond) and Rudy Apodaca. John Blender and Regina LaRocca (Oily Bloodmen, Caustic Soda, M99) also played bass for the band. The Obituaries toured throughout the Western U.S. and shared the bill with many notable bands during their career, including: Green River, Mother Love Bone, Sonic Youth, Nick Cave, Alex Chilton, The Gits, Babes In Toyland, The Descendents, Dead Moon, Soundgarden and Nirvana. The band reformed for several shows in 2007 in conjunction with the release of a retrospective CD with Nelson, Landoll, LaRocca, and Mahone. In 2010, The Obituaries released the CD Ghost, a 9-song acoustic set.

The mother of the second incarnation of Wonder Girl, Cassandra Sandsmark and a distinguished academic in the field of archaeology, Helena is also close friends with her daughter's mentor Wonder Woman. ==Fictional character biography== Post Zero Hour Introduction Helena (and her daughter, Cassie/Wonder Girl) are introduced in the revised DC Universe created after the Zero Hour: Crisis in Time storyline. Helena studied archeology at Harvard University under Julia Kapatelis, and was one of her brightest students. After graduation, she participated in several digs around the world, including one in Greece, where she made an important discovery that made her famous in her profession.Wonder Girl (vol. 1) #4, Feb. 2008 On the merits of her work in Greece and a recommendation from Julia, Helena was awarded a job as curator at the Gateway City Museum of Antiquities, the museum with the largest collection of Greek artifacts outside of Greece. She was the youngest archeologist ever to hold such a position. Helena met a man whom she later found out was the Olympian god Zeus. She eventually became pregnant with his demigodess child, but he had disappeared from her life by the time she gave birth to Cassie. Helena had raised Cassie alone without revealing the identity of her father or her divine parentage. Julia sent her friend Wonder Woman to Gateway City, so she could study at the museum. While there, Diana befriended Helena and her daughter. Helena had also entered into a short-lived relationship with Jason Blood, a visiting occultist, though she was unaware of his other side at the time. As Diana attracted more and more attention from enemies, Helena became concerned for her daughter. However, she was surprised when Zeus granted her daughter powers. Her former mate also granted Helena the power to remove Cassie's powers by speaking one word, effectively grounding her when she needed to. When Cassie found out Zeus was her father, the revelation nearly destroyed the relationship between mother and daughter. Around the time Diana left Gateway City, Helena had finally made amends with Cassie and granted her blessing to continue as Wonder Girl with the understanding that she'd be well trained in combat by Artemis. Helena also supervised her daughter's membership in the superhero team Young Justice but openly objected to the fact that Cissie “Arrowette” Jones-King's mother Bonnie encouraged her daughter's participation without regard to the potential dangers. At one point, Helena even judged Bonnie's behavior to be so dangerous that she kept Cissie with her and Cassie in Gateway City. Helena remained there for Cassie in the troubled months that folflowed, adjusting when Wonder Girl's true identity was publicly revealed by the Silver Swan, mending fences when the teen learned that Zeus was her father, and consoling her daughter after her boyfriend Superboy was killed during the Infinite Crisis. During the Amazons Attack incident, Wonder Girl and Supergirl attempted to negotiate an end to the war between the Amazons and the United States but inadvertently made things worse when the president of the United States was killed. Helena was deemed a collaborator by the US government and sent to an internment camp, leading Cassie to mount an attempted rescue. At her mother's insistence that the situation be settled peacefully, Wonder Girl finally departed. In the war's wake, Wonder Girl and her mother were viewed with a wary eye. Leaving the Gateway Museum, Helena took a sabbatical in Greece and used the Gauntlet of Atlas and Sandals of Hermes to keep her safe. They proved invaluable when she was abducted by the Female Furies and an ensorcelled Hercules. When the latter attacked Wonder Girl, Helena astonished her daughter by sending the demigod reeling with one punch powered by the godly gauntlet. The adventure also reunited Helena with her old friend Aristides Demetrios, who was known as The Olympian and had protected Helena during the young archaeologist's pregnancy. Helena later joined fellow archeologists Vijay and Rani Singh for an dig in Mohenjo-Daro, Pakistan. When Vijay and Rani both mysteriously disappeared, Helena called the Teen Titans for help. Upon arriving, the Titans joined Kiran Singh – the brilliantly super-powered Solstice – in the search for her parents. But the team soon found itself trapped in a lost kingdom as they were attacked by the Hindu god King Rankor and his demonic minions. In the most brilliant display of her powers to date, Solstice unleashed a blinding pulse that drove the demons away, liberating Helena and the Singhs from King Rankor's grasp. The New 52 In September 2011, The New 52 rebooted DC's continuity. In this new timeline, Cassie's father is a British super-soldier named Lennox Sandsmark, who turns out to be Wonder Woman's half- brother and himself a demigod son of Zeus. Lennox left the family when Cassie was only four years old,Teen Titans Vol 4 #13 (December 2012) so Helena (again) raised Cassie alone without revealing the identity of her father or her divine parentage. Teenaged Cassie meets Red Robin,Teen Titans (vol. 4) #2 joins the Teen Titans and eventually learns that she is the demigoddess niece of Wonder Woman.Teen Titans Vol 4 #19 (June 2013) ==Other Versions== DC Animated Universe comics Helena Sandsmark appears in Adventures in the DC Universe #01,03,11 and appears in DC Comics Presents: Wonder Woman Adventures #01.

His father Henrik Giergl (1827–1871) was a famous glass artist and among his cousins were Géza Györgyi (hu) (1851–1934) who was an architect and Kálmán Györgyi (hu) (1860–1930) who was an expert on applied arts. == Career == Giergl finished his studies at Budapest Technical University and the Berlin University of the Arts. He also began his career working for the Gropius and Schmieden company in the German capital. Upon his return to Budapest, he came to work under Alajos Hauszmann at the Budapest Technical University. This is the period when he also began to work with the other rising star of the Hauszmann office, Flóris Korb (1860–1930). They both took part in working on major commissions such as the Palace of Justice, New York Palace and the extension to the Buda Palace all in the capital. In 1893 the two established their own partnership, their first major work being the Pesti Hirlap headquarters and also some of the many now demolished pavilions for the 1896 millenary exhibition. They built the twin Klotild Palaces on the approach to the Elizabeth bridge in 1901 and won the competition for the Music Academy building. This building, built between 1904 and 1907, is their major work. Subsequent projects include the Maria street Eye Clinic and Üllői street Wound and General clinics. It is unclear when they finished working together, some sources say 1906, others 1909 or even 1914. Giergl travelled extensively throughout Europe, America and the near and far East.

He was known for having informally confessed in 1985 to the 1983 abduction, rape and murder of 10-year-old Jeanine Nicarico of Naperville, Illinois, which was a highly publicized case. He was already in custody for two other rape/murders, one of an adult woman in 1984 and the other a female child in 1985. He was sentenced to life after pleading guilty to the latter two crimes. Rolando Cruz and Anthony Hernandez, both from Aurora, Illinois, had earlier been indicted in the Nicarico case and were convicted of Nicarico's murder in 1987 and sentenced to death. After appeals and new trials, Hernandez was convicted a third time and sentenced to life in prison. Cruz was acquitted in 1995 after a witness recanted testimony, and new DNA evidence was introduced excluding him from that found at the crime scene. State charges against Hernandez were also dismissed that year and he was freed. In 2000 these two and Stephen Buckley received a settlement for wrongful prosecution from DuPage County. In 2005 Dugan was indicted for Nicarico's murder based on DNA evidence; he pleaded guilty in 2009 and was sentenced to death. After Illinois governor Patrick Quinn signed a new bill to abolish capital punishment in 2011, Dugan's sentence was commuted to life in prison. ==Early life and crimes== Brian Dugan was born in 1956 in Nashua, New Hampshire, the second child of James and Genevieve \\"Jenny\\" Dugan. He has one sister and three brothers. According to his siblings, both parents James and Jenny Dugan were alcoholics. In 1967, the Dugan family moved to Lisle, Illinois. According to Dugan's family, the boy's birth had been traumatic. He began to emerge before the attending physician had arrived. The family claims that, in an effort to delay the infant's birth, a nurse and an intern pushed Brian's head back inside his mother and strapped her legs together. Relatives would later question if this caused Brian to have brain damage; as a youth Brian suffered severe headaches followed by vomiting, for which he took medication until his teens. Brian was also a chronic bed wetter, a condition his adult father also suffered from. Brian showed classic symptoms of psychopathy from an early age. Although he was seen by child specialists, they did not understand the symptoms. At age 8, Brian and a younger brother burned down the family garage. According to his brother, Steven, at age 13 Brian poured gasoline on a cat and lit it on fire. In 1972, Brian ran away to Iowa, and later that year he was arrested on a burglary charge. It was his first arrest. He was later convicted for other crimes including arson, battery, and other burglaries. According to his younger brother Steven Dugan, Brian attempted to molest him in 1972 after a stay in a youth home; Steven suspected Brian may have been sexually assaulted there. In 1974, Dugan attempted to abduct a 10-year-old girl from a train station in Lisle. Charges were brought against him but later dropped. In 1975, he threatened to kill his older sister, Hilary, and to \\"chop up\\" her son, and he vandalized her car. His brother Steven said that Dugan complained of being sexually abused while serving time in the Menard Correctional Center from 1979 until 1982. ==Murders== Jeanine Nicarico On February 25, 1983, 10-year- old Jeanine Nicarico (born July 7, 1972) was abducted in broad daylight from her home in Naperville, Illinois. Suffering from the flu, Jeanine had been home alone while her parents were at work and her sisters were at school. Her body was found two days later, six miles from her home. She was found to have been raped and beaten to death. Rolando Cruz, a 20-year-old gang member from Aurora, became a suspect after offering police false information about the murder in an attempt to claim the $10,000 reward being offered. Soon, police charged Cruz, Alejandro Hernandez, who had accused two others, and Stephen Buckley with the girl's rape and murder despite limited evidence. The three were tried together by prosecutors. Cruz and Hernandez were convicted in 1987 and sentenced to death; the jury deadlocked on Buckley, and he was not retried. Donna Schnorr On July 15, 1984, Dugan noticed Donna Schnorr, a 27-year-old nurse from Geneva, Illinois, in her car at a stoplight. He followed her and ran her off the road with his car. After getting her out of her car, he beat and raped her. Dugan murdered Schnorr by drowning her in a quarry. Melissa Ackerman In May 1985, Dugan went on a crime spree that culminated with the rape and murder of eight-year-old Melissa Ackerman in early June. On May 6, Dugan abducted and raped 21-year-old Sharon Grajek, in North Aurora; she survived the attack. On May 28, Dugan tried but failed to abduct a 19-year-old woman who was walking along the roadway on the west side of Aurora. The following day, he abducted and raped a 16-year-old girl in the same area. On June 2, 1985, Melissa Ackerman and her eight-year-old friend, Opal Horton, were riding their bikes in Somonauk, Illinois when they were confronted by Dugan. He grabbed Opal first and threw her into his car, but the girl managed to escape while Dugan was overpowering Melissa. He raped and killed Ackerman, drowning her in a creek more than 15 miles away. Her body was not found for several weeks. ==Arrest and investigation== Schnorr and Ackerman murders The day following Ackerman's abduction and disappearance, Dugan was arrested at his job. He had come to the attention of the police after a police officer from the neighboring town of Somonauk reported encountering Dugan about the out-of-date vehicle inspection sticker on his car. After reaching help following her escape from Dugan on June 2, Opal Horton gave the police a description of his vehicle. Once Ackerman's body was found, Dugan was charged with her murder. Police had linked him to the crime through physical evidence found in his belongings. To avoid risk of the death penalty at trial, Dugan made a plea deal, pleading guilty to murders of both Melissa Ackerman and Donna Schnorr. Brian offered no real explanation for the crimes, stating: > It might have been for the sex, but I don't understand why. I wish I knew > why I did a lot of things, but I don't.\\" He was sentenced to two life terms in prison. Jeanine Nicarico Dugan had not been a suspect in Jeanine Nicarico's murder. In 1985, after being apprehended for the Ackerman and Schnorr murders, he gave an unofficial confession to the crime in what he said should be a deal to avoid risk of the death penalty if the case went to trial. Prosecutors rejected this demand, so Dugan refused to make an official confession. He did plead guilty to the later murders and was sentenced to life in prison. Dugan later claimed that he confessed in order to take responsibility for the crime and to clear Rolando Cruz and Alejandro Hernandez, who had been indicted for it. Cruz has said that he believes that Dugan's motives were self-serving and had nothing to do with the truth. Cruz was acquitted at his third trial in 1995, after which the State's Attorney also dismissed charges against Hernandez because of discrediting of evidence and testimony that were the basis of his conviction in a third trial. In 1996, seven DuPage County law enforcement officials: three prosecutors and four sheriff's deputies, were tried but acquitted of conspiring to frame Cruz and Hernandez. Advances in DNA forensic testing allowed prosecutors to re-open the Nicarico case against Dugan, as his DNA was found to match that in forensic DNA in semen at the scene. Still in prison, Dugan was indicted in 2005 for the Nicarico murder. In 2009, Dugan pleaded guilty to the murder and was sentenced to death by a jury. Following Illinois's passage in 2011 of a law to abolish the death penalty in the state, Dugan's sentence was commuted to life in prison. He is serving his sentence at the Stateville Correctional Center. ==Possible encounter with John Wayne Gacy== In 2008, the Daily Herald reported that Dugan had claimed, since the 1980s, that in 1972, he had been molested as a juvenile by serial killer John Wayne Gacy. Dugan reportedly encountered a man at a Lisle grocery store who offered him a job. Dugan got in the man's car, and the man took him to a secluded area. There he forced Dugan to model bikini brief underwear and perform oral sex on him. The man gave Dugan $20 and returned him to the grocery store where he had picked up the youth. Dugan claimed that after seeing Gacy's face following Gacy's 1978 arrest, he realized that Gacy was the same man from the grocery store. Gacy prosecutor Terry Sullivan publicly doubted the story. He noted that Dugan did not report the events at the time. He also said that Dugan's account did not match Gacy's typical methods nor was Lisle known as one of Gacy's hunting grounds. However, prosecutor Sullivan said that Dugan did fit the profile of Gacy's victims. ==See also== * List of United States death row inmates * List of serial killers in the United States ==References== Category:American rapists Category:American serial killers Category:Male serial killers Category:American people convicted of murder Category:American murderers of children Category:People convicted of murder by Illinois Category:1956 births Category:American people convicted of theft Category:American prisoners sentenced to death Category:Living people Category:Prisoners sentenced to death by Illinois Category:1983 murders in the United States Category:1984 murders in the United States Category:1985 murders in the United States Category:20th-century American criminals Category:Criminals from New Hampshire Category:Criminals of Chicago Category:American male criminals ","title":"Brian Dugan"},{"id":"12395463","text":"WGCK-FM is a Contemporary Christian-formatted broadcast radio station licensed to Coeburn, Virginia, serving Dickenson and Wise counties in Virginia and Letcher County in Kentucky.

They denied the godhood of the Holy Ghost, hence the Greek name Pneumatomachi or 'Combators against the Spirit' (from πνεῦμα pneuma, spirit + μάχη machē, battle). ==History== Macedonius I, the founder of the Pneumatomachi, was installed into the See of Constantinople by the Arians (342 A.D.), and enthroned by Emperor Constantius II, who had for the second time expelled Paul, the orthodox bishop. He is known in history for his persecution of Novatians and Catholics, as both maintained the consubstantiality of Christ, the Son, with the Father. He not only expelled those who refused to hold communion with him, but also imprisoned some and brought others before the tribunals. In many cases he used torture to compel the unwilling to communicate, forced baptism on unbaptized women and children and destroyed many churches. At last, his cruelty provoked a rebellion of the Novatians at Mantinium, in Paphlagonia, in which four imperial cohorts were defeated and nearly all slain. His disinterment of the body of Emperor Constantine I was looked upon as an indignity to the Protector of the Council of Nicaea, and led to a conflict between Arians and anti-Arians, which filled the church and neighbourhood with carnage. As the disinterment had taken place without imperial sanction, Macedonius fell into disgrace, and Roman Emperor Flavius Julius Constantius caused him to be deposed by the Acacian party and succeeded by Eudoxius in 360. This deposition, however, was not for doctrinal reasons, but on the ground that he had caused much bloodshed and had admitted to communion a deacon guilty of fornication. Macedonius continued for some time to live near Constantinople and cause trouble. He died about 364. It is thought that during these last years he formulated his rejection of the Divinity of the Holy Ghost and founded his sect. His intimacy with Eunomius of Cyzicus makes this probable. Some scholars reject the identification of Macedonians and Pneumatomachians, although that identity is asserted by Socrates, a contemporary historian living at Constantinople. The Council of Nicaea had used all its energies in defending the Homoousion of the Son and with regard to the Spirit had already added the words: \\"We believe in the Holy Ghost\\" without any qualification. Because of the vagueness and hesitancy of statement in some of the early Fathers, the Macedonians were able to justify and propagate their views. The majority of this sect were clearly orthodox on the Consubstantiality of the Son; they had sent a deputation from the Semi- Arian council of Lampsacus (364 A.D.) to Pope Liberius, who after some hesitation acknowledged the soundness of their faith; but with regard to the Third Person, both pope and bishops were satisfied with the phrase: \\"We believe in the Holy Ghost\\". While hiding in the desert during his third exile, Athanasius learned from his friend Serapion of Thumis of Alexandrian believers acknowledging Nicaea, and yet declaring the Holy Ghost a mere creature and a ministering angel (on the strength of Hebrews 1:14). Athanasius wrote at once to Serapion in defence of the Nicene faith, and on his return from exile (362 A.D.) held a council at Alexandria, which resulted in the first formal condemnation of the Pneumatomachi. A synodal letter was sent to the people of Antioch advising them to require of all converts from Arianism a condemnation against \\"those who say that the Holy Spirit is a creature and separate from the essence of Christ. For those who while pretending to cite the faith confessed at Nicaea, venture to blaspheme the Holy Spirit, deny Arianism in words only, while in thought they return to it.\\" Nevertheless, during the following decade the heresy seems to have gone on without being offered almost any resistance except in the Patriarchate of Antioch where at a synod held in 363, Meletius had proclaimed the orthodox faith. In the East, the moving spirit for the repression of the sect was Amphilochius of Iconium, who in 374 besought St. Basil of Caesarea to write a treatise on the true doctrine of the Holy Ghost. This he did, and his treatise is the classical work on the subject (peri tou hagiou II. M. 32). It is that he influenced his brother Gregory of Nyssa to write his treatise against the Macedonians, of which only a part has come down to us and which appears to be based on the words: \\"Lord and life- giver who proceeds from the Father.\\" These words, apparently taken from the Creed of Jerusalem, had been used by St. Epiphanius of Salamis in his \\"Ancoratus\\" when combating the (374 A. D.). Amphilochius of Iconium, as Metropolitan of Lycaonia, wrote in concurrence with his bishops a synodal letter to the bishops of Lycia (another part of Asia Minor), which contains a statement of the orthodox doctrine (377 A. D.). In Constantinople (379) Gregory of Nazianzus pronounced his theological oration on this subject. The West likewise upheld the Catholic teaching in a synod held in Illyria and mentioned by Theodoret (H. E., IV, 8) and by Pope Damasus in his letter to Paulinus of Antioch. The sect was condemned in the First Council of Constantinople, and internal divisions soon led to its demise. Socrates (H. E., V, 24) states that a certain Macedonian presbyter, Eutropius, held conventicles of his own while others followed Bishop Carterius. Eustathius of Sebaste, Sabinus and Eleusius of Cyzicus seem to have been leaders whom the sect repudiated (for Eustathis, see Basil, Ep., CCLXIII, 3). In June 383, Emperor Theodosius I tried by means of a conference to bring the Arian factions to submission. Eleusius handed in his symbol of faith as representing the Macedonians, as he had represented them with Marcianus of Lampsacus at the Ecumenical Council of Constantinople. After this fruitless attempt at reconciliation the Macedonians with other heretics incurred all the severities of the Theodosian code and with a generation disappeared from history. Socrates and Sozomus mention a certain Marathonius, made Bishop of Nicomedia by Macedonius, who obtained such a leading position in the sect that they were often styled after him Marathonians. Through St. Jerome, St. Augustine, St. Damasus and Rufinus, the name Macedonians became the customary designation in the West. No writings of Macedonius are extant, but Pneumatomachian writings are mentioned by Didymus the Blind, who wrote an excellent treatise on the Holy Ghost in thirty-six chapters (translated into Latin by St. Jerome at the command of Pope Damasus), and who refers in his later work (379) on the Trinity (II, 7, 8, 10) to some \\"Brief Expositions\\" of Macedonian doctrines which he possessed. ==Beliefs== The Pneumatomachi (from Greek for “spirit\\" and \\"fighters”, combining as \\"Combators against the Spirit\\") are also known as the Macedonians. Church sources ascribe Bishop Macedonius I as the founder.John Arendzen Pneumatomachi. Article in Catholic Encyclopedia (1913), Charles Herbermann, (editor) . Robert Appleton Company. s:Catholic Encyclopedia (1913)/PneumatomachiMichael Pomazansky. Orthodox dogmatic theology, Part I. God in Himself-2. The dogma of the Holy Trinity -The equality of honor and the Divinity of the Holy Spirit. from which is quoted: \\"However, the chief of the heretics who distorted the apostolic teaching concerning the Holy Spirit was Macedonius, who occupied the cathedra of Constantinople as archbishop in the 4th century and found followers for himself among former Arians and Semi- Arians. He called the Holy Spirit a creation of the Son, and a servant of the Father and the Son. Accusers of his heresy were Fathers of the Church like Sts. Basil the Great, Gregory the Theologian, Athanasius the Great, Gregory of Nyssa, Ambrose, Amphilocius, Diodores of Tarsus, and others, who wrote works against the heretics. The false teaching of Macedonius was refuted first in a series of local councils and finally at the Second Ecumenical Council . In preserving Orthodoxy, the Second Ecumenical Council completed the Nicaean Symbol of Faith with these words: “And in the Holy Spirit, the Lord, the Giver of Life, Who proceedeth from the Father, Who with the Father and the Son is equally worshipped and glorified, Who spake by the Prophets,” as well as those articles of the Creed which follow this in the Nicaean-Constantinopolitan Symbol of Faith\\". The writings of Macedonius himself, as well as the Pneumatomachi, have all been lost, and what is asserted regarding their doctrine comes from polemic refutations by church leaders, who regarded them as a heretical sect. Macedonius more fully developed his theological views toward the end of his life including during a brief retirement before his death,Wace, Henry; Piercy, William C., eds. Dictionary of Christian Biography and Literature to the End of the Sixth Century (1911, third edition) London: John Murray. possibly before the sect fully emerged. Pneumatomachian doctrine was embraced by Eleusius and Marathonius, the latter a major protagonist, and it gained traction in Constantinople, Thrace, Bithynia, and the Hellespont. Under the Emperor Julian, 361 to 363 A.D., who personally rejected Christianity in favor of Neoplatonic paganism, and who sought to return the Roman Empire to its original religious eclecticism, the Pneumatomachi had enough power to declare their independence from both Arians and orthodox. Pneumatomachi beliefs were distinct from, but in some regards reminiscent of, Arianism.Elwell, Walter A. ed. Evangelical Dictionary of Theology, 2ed. Grand Rapids: Baker Academic (2001) pp.291. Church commentators assert that they denied the divinity of the Holy Spirit, and regarded the substance of Jesus Christ as being of \\"similar substance\\" (homoiousios)Philostorgius, recorded in Photius.

The Macedonians supported the Homoiousian creeds of Antioch and Seleucia and condemned the Homoian creeds of Ariminum and Constantinople,Socrates Scholasticus. Church History, book 2, chapter 45 and book 3, chapter 10. and they called new synods to gain support for their views and condemn their opponents.Socrates Scholasticus. Church History, book 3, chapter 10. The Pneumatomachi were denounced in 374 by Pope Damasus I. In 381 A.D., the Pneumatomachian concept that the Holy Spirit was a creation of the Son, and a servant of the Father and the Son, prompted the First Council of Constantinople (also termed the Second Ecumenical Council) to add, “And in the Holy Spirit, the Lord, the Giver of Life, Who proceedeth from the Father, Who with the Father and the Son is equally worshipped and glorified, Who spake by the Prophets,” into the Nicene Creed. As a result of the Second Ecumenical Council, homoousios has become the accepted definition of Orthodox Christianity. Thereafter, the Macedonians were suppressed by the emperor Theodosius I. Three prominent 4th-century saints, Athanasius of Alexandria, Basil of Caesarea, and Basil’s younger brother Gregory of Nyssa, wrote polemics against Macedonianism (Letters to Serapion, On the Holy Spirit,On the Holy Spirit and On the Holy Spirit respectively). ==Notable Macedonians== * Macedonius, bishop of Constantinople (342-346 and 351-360)Socrates Scholasticus.

These mentions date back to the times of Grand Duchy of Lithuania or perhaps even earlier.F.D. Klimchuk, About ethnolinguistic history of Left Bank of Dnieper (in connection to the ethnogenesis of Goriuns). Published in \\"Goriuns: history, language, culture\\" Proceedings of International scientific conference, (Institute of Linguistics, Russian Academy of Sciences, February 13, 2004) The Russian language in Ukraine has primarily come to exist in that country through two channels: the migration of ethnic Russians into what later became Ukraine and through the adoption of the Russian language as a language of communication by Ukrainians. ==Russian migration== The first waves of Russian settlers onto what became Ukrainian territory came in the late 16th century to the area known as Slobozhanschyna or Sloboda Ukraina, in what is now northeastern Ukraine. This territory was settled after being abandoned by the Tatars. Russian settlers however were outnumbered by Ukrainian settlers who were escaping harsh exploitative conditions in the west.Display Page More Russian speakers appeared in the northern, central and eastern territories that are now Ukraine during the late 17th century, following the Cossack Rebellion (1648–1657) which Bohdan Khmelnytsky led against Poland. The Khmelnytsky Uprising led to a massive movement of Ukrainian settlers to the Slobozhanschyna region, which converted it from a sparsely inhabited frontier area to one of the major populated regions of the Tsardom of Russia. Following the Pereyaslav Rada of 1654 the parts which were under the Cossack Hetmanate (a predecessor of modern Ukraine entered the Russian Tsardom. This brought significant, but still small, wave of Russian settlers into what is now central Ukraine (primarily several thousand soldiers stationed in garrisons, out of a population of approximately 1.2 million non-Russians). Beginning in the late 18th century, large numbers of Russians settled in newly acquired lands in what is now southern Ukraine, a region then known as Novorossiya (\\"New Russia\\"). These lands had been largely empty prior to the 18th century due to the threat of Crimean Tatar raids, but once Russia had eliminated the Tatar state as a threat, Russian nobles were granted large tracts of fertile land that was worked by newly arrived peasants, most of whom were ethnic Ukrainians but many of whom were Russians. The 19th century saw a dramatic increase in the urban Russian population in Novorossiya and other parts which are now Ukraine, as ethnic Russian settlers moved into and populated the newly industrialised and growing towns. At the beginning of the 20th century, Russians were the largest ethnic group in almost all large cities within Ukraine's modern borders, including the following: Kiev (54.2%), Kharkiv (63.1%), Odessa (49.09%), Mykolaiv (66.33%), Mariupol (63.22%), Luhansk, (68.16%), Kherson (47.21%), Melitopol (42.8%), Yekaterinoslav (current Dnipro), (41.78%), Yelisavetgrad (current Kropyvnytskyi) (34.64%), Simferopol (45.64%), Yalta (66.17%), Kerch (57.8%), Sevastopol (63.46%).Дністрянський М.С. Етнополітична географія України. Лівів Літопис, видавництво ЛНУ імені Івана Франка, 2006, page 342 The Ukrainian migrants who settled in these cities entered a Russian-speaking milieu (particularly with Russian-speaking administration) and needed to adopt the Russian language. ==Adoption of Russian language== With the gradual urbanization of Society in the late 19th century, Ukrainian migrants from rural areas who settled in the cities entered a Russian-speaking milieu. With all State educational instruction and cultural establishments using Russian many Ukrainians were forced to use the Russian language. The Russian government promoted the spread of the Russian language among the native Ukrainian population by actively suppressing the Ukrainian language. Alarmed by the threat of Ukrainian separatism implied by a growing number of school textbooks teaching the Ukrainian language, the Russian Minister of Internal Affairs Pyotr Valuev in 1863 issued a secret decree that banned the publication of religious texts and educational texts written in the Ukrainian language. This ban was expanded by Tsar Alexander II who issued the Ems Ukaz in 1876. All Ukrainian language books and song lyrics were banned, as was the importation of such works. Furthermore, Ukrainian-language public performances, plays, and lectures were forbidden. In 1881, the decree was amended to allow the publishing of lyrics and dictionaries, and the performances of some plays in the Ukrainian language with local officials' approval. Ukrainian-only troupes were forbidden. While officially, there was no state language in the Soviet Union, Russian was in practice in a privileged position. The Ukrainian language was often frowned upon or quietly discouraged, which led to the gradual decline in its usage. In independent Ukraine, although Russian is not an official language of the country, it continues to hold a privileged position and is widely spoken, in particular in regions of Ukraine where Soviet Russification policies were the strongest, notably most of the urban areas of the east and south. In 1994 a referendum took place in the Donetsk Oblast and the Luhansk Oblast, with around 90% supporting the Russian language gaining status of an official language alongside Ukrainian, and for the Russian language to be an official language on a regional level; however, the referendum was annulled by the Kiev government.http://thekievtimes.ua/society/372400-donbass-zabytyj- referendum-1994.html ==References== Ukraine Category:Languages of Ukraine Category:Slavic language histories Category:Social history of Ukraine ","title":"History of the Russian language in Ukraine"},{"id":"12395508","text":"Babar Ali (; born 30 June 1975) is a Pakistani film and television actor.

About five minutes into the interview, Trudeau stated: \\"Well, there are a lot of bleeding hearts around who just don't like to see people with helmets and guns.

Ralfe's persistence was condemned by CBC managers who accused him of being too aggressive during a time of national crisis. Peter Trueman, executive producer of national television news wrote a message to Ralfe on an open, inter-office teleprinter link. It said that Ralfe's questioning of Trudeau violated every journalistic standard that Trueman had ever heard of. Trueman ordered severe cuts to the video tape to eliminate Ralfe's most argumentative questions. He also insisted that a formal reprimand to be placed on Ralfe's employment file. In his 1980 book, Trueman wrote that he regretted his actions. Ralfe was a reporter for CTV when in 1973 he exploited a loophole in Canadian law that allowed surreptitious recording under certain circumstances. He placed a recording device in the New Democratic Party caucus room at Parliament Hill then confronted party leader David Lewis with an audio tape of a meeting in that room. The report earned CTV a Michener Award the following year. Canadian law was later changed to further restrict such recordings. Ralfe was born in Shanghai, China in 1938 and returned to Canada with his parents before the Japanese invaded China. Ralfe graduated from Bedford Park Public School and Lawrence Park Collegiate Institute, then to Carleton University for journalism. He died on 27 October 2000, his 62nd birthday, in Ottawa, after suffering a heart attack two weeks before. He worked as a consultant at that time. ==ReferencesExternal links== * CTV.ca News article * CBC.ca News article Category:Canadian television journalists Category:1938 births Category:2000 deaths Category:People from Shanghai Category:People from Toronto Category:Carleton University alumni ","title":"Tim Ralfe"},{"id":"12395535","text":"Flóris Korb (born as Flóris Nándor Korb, Kecskemét, 7 April 1860 – Budapest, 16 September 1930) was a Hungarian architect.Korb Flóris, Hungarian Electronic Library, retrieved 12 May 2012 ==Career== After finishing his studies in Berlin, he returned to Budapest to work under Alajos Hauszmann for fourteen years, during which time he took part in designing the New York Palace.

The title's a play-on-words of the phrase \\"Puss in Boots\\", and is similar to Cruise Cat (1952), from the Hanna-Barbera era. ==Plot== A ship is loading a crate of cheese, according to the stamps on the outside in Spanish, French and English. The smell drifts into a mousehole, where Jerry, sleeping with a sailor's hat on, is woken up by the smell. The smell seems to have a life of its own, as it drags backwards and takes a sleeping Jerry with it. The yellow stream opens one of Jerry's eyes to reveal he is dreaming of cheese, and then bops Jerry on the head. Jerry opens his eyes and sees the crate of cheese. Jerry salutes the stream, wakes himself up, and runs toward it, but soon runs into the stream holding out a \\"hand\\". It points out that Tom is guarding the boarding ramp. Jerry slumps until he sees Tom salute the captain ascending the ramp. Jerry goes into his hole and takes out duplicate clothes. Tom is puzzled to see a second captain, but all the same must salute as Jerry- captain prances up the steps. As soon as Jerry is up on the ramp, Tom investigates the situation. He notices the captain is moving slow, there is a broom where his head should be, and then spots the body of the mouse poking out from under the uniform. He immediately thinks that Jerry has gone stupid. Tom smirks and pushes the ramp aside such that Jerry falls into the water. Only the captain's hat is seen for a few seconds, and then a shark pops out of the water and almost eats him. Jerry turns white and frantically runs into his hole and shuts the door. Tom is laughing himself silly until he sees the real captain falling off the edge of the ship because the ramp has moved. Since there is no time, Tom dashes over and holds his hands up, ready to catch the falling officer, but he only squashes Tom through a hole in the wood. The shark then pops out and attacks Tom, but Tom pushes himself through the pier and escapes. Tom's head is stuck in the board's hole, but he's safe. Jerry then proceeds to twist the board like a helicopter propeller and Tom lifts off. Tom stops the board's rotation and unravels his neck, and then frees himself from the board. Tom sighs in relief until he sees that he's falling. He grabs the board again and uses it to fly like a glider. He dives after Jerry, and when Jerry spots him, Tom chases him into a vent pipe. However, Tom is squeezed through the hole in his board and bounces around through the pipe. Tom crawls through shorter widths of pipe in order to catch Jerry, and when the chase exits the plumbing, Tom is compressed into a cylinder with legs barely a centimeter wide, forming himself in some kind of a walking stick. When Tom realizes this, he takes a deep breath and uncompresses himself, briefly looking like a more monstrous feline in the process. Tom grabs a large hose and dashes after Jerry. Jerry has opened the crate of cheese and is munching away when Tom thrusts the hose in his face. Jerry braces for the deluge, but when Tom opens the valve, nothing comes out because it isn't turned on. Tom rattles the hose cluelessly and Jerry turns it on. The stream of water and the hose blast Tom around randomly until the hose forms a rocket and Tom blasts off into the stratosphere. An astronaut doing a spacewalk from the Gemini spacecraft waves at him. Tom waves back and points the hose upward, and then soon sees he's about to fall. He then stops the water flow, but this causes the hose to inflate. Tom grins innocently and then the hose bursts. He falls down and panics, but Jerry throws a lifesaver ring. Tom falls down, confident he will be saved; however, this was an elaborate trap. Jerry whistles and the shark pops out, confused, but then sees Tom and swallows him. Soon, however, the shark cannot stomach him, and spits him out, as misfortune would have it, into the ship's furnace. Tom screams out in pain as he runs out with his tail on fire. Tom knows that the shark is waiting in the water, but as the fire on his tail grows larger, Tom has no choice. Tom falls in and the shark chases him through the water and out of sight. Jerry takes his place as a \\"guard\\" of the ship. He blows a whistle, salutes the captain, and does the dance jig to the audience. ==Crew== *Animation: Ben Washam, Ken Harris, Don Towsley, Tom Ray & Dick Thompson *Layouts: Don Morgan *Backgrounds: Philip DeGuard *Vocal Effects: Mel Blanc & William Hanna *Story: Bob Ogle *Music: Carl Brandt *Design Consultant: Maurice Noble *Production Supervised by Les Goldman *Produced by Chuck Jones *Directed by Abe Levitow ==External links== * * Category:1966 animated films Category:1966 films Category:1966 short films Category:Films directed by Abe Levitow Category:Tom and Jerry short films Category:1960s American animated films Category:American films Category:1966 comedy films Category:Films without speech Category:Films set on ships Category:American animated short films Category:Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer short films Category:Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer animated short films ","title":"Puss 'n' Boats"},{"id":"12395631","text":"André Salifou (born 1942Page on Salifou's book L'empereur des menteurs et autres contes du pays haoussa .) is a Nigerien politician, diplomat, and professor.

As usual in the Valencian pilota, it's a handball game where players stand in front of each other. The differences with the main variant are the unusual court and the unique ball used. Despite the name, it has no relation with another Valencian pilota variant, the Galotxa. == Court == The court, called galotxeta (hence the name of this modality), is a 4 walled room, 20m long and 3 m wide. In the middle there's a 1 m high net, it's not tense at all, so its height is a bit shorter on the center. The court is so divided in two sides: the \\"traure' and the \\"rest\\". On the rest side, at its right end of the net, there's an 80 cm high flat stone (the \\"tamboret\\") used to bounce on it the ball in the service of every doubles game. On the traure side there's a rectangle on the ground next to the left wall, that's where the ball must first bounce after the service of every doubles game. In the case of playing singles the ball must be bounced on a point into that rectangle of the traure. Also, the walls at the end of every side are called \\"frontons\\". The rest frontó is high so every ball returns to the court, but the traure frontó is only 1.5 m high, so public may watch the game in the gallery behind it. In case the ball is sent over the traure wall, the player on the traure must bounce it on the wall and strike the ball on the air (if it already bounced on the ground) or after a first bounce (if it didn't bounce at all). At the ground of those two frontons there's a 45° bevel, the \\"tamborí\\", it allows to raise up low balls with quick and unexpected bouncings. As for now, all those elements are common to the main Valencian pilota court, the trinquet, being the main difference the size (smaller) and the lack of stairs for the spectators to seat along the left wall. But a unique trait of the \\"galotxetes\\" are the \\"caixonets\\" (\\"small drawers\\"), they are a kind of open doors on every corner. They are used as a direct point place for the sender. Until recently, this modality was played in the whole comarca of Vinalopó Mitjà, but actually there are court for this modality only in the \\"Centro Deportivo de Monòver\\", El Pinós and La Romana, and those last two are not covered. However, the oldest court is in Abdet (Marina Baixa), dated from 1772. == Rules == Galotxetes may be played singles (1 vs. 1) or doubles (2 vs. 2), being the only difference the place to serve from (the point on the traure if singles, and the tamboret if doubles). The rules are simple, and common to many other handballs: The ball must be struck with the hand and sent to the other side without touching the net, once there it must be sent back after a first bounce on the ground or in the air. The ball may bounce on the walls or on the tamborí as if they were \\"air\\". The quinze is won when the opponent cannot throw back the ball, be it because the ball bounces twice on the ground, the ball touches the ball, or the ball is sent to the caixonet. The scoring system follows the usual scoring system in Valencian pilota: a number of points (commonly, 12) divided in four quinzes: 15, 30, val and joc. == Ball == The ball used to play galotxetes is different from any other ball used in the Valencian pilota modalities. This one is a hand-made ball of clothing covered by sticking plaster. Its diameter is 7 cm and weighs 60 grams.

He shared a studio with his wife, Judith Leyster, also a genre painter, as well as a portraitist and painter of still-life. Both Molenaer and Leyster may have been pupils of Frans Hals. ==Biography== Molenaer was born and died in Haarlem. He achieved a style close to Hals' early on in his career, but later developed a style like that of Dutch genre painter, Adriaen van Ostade. His genre works often depicted players of music, such as his The Music Makers (Museum of Fine Arts, Budapest), The Duet (Seattle Art Museum), or Family Making Music (Frans Hals Museum). He also depicted Taverns and the activities of card games or games of the times such as La main chaude, or in Dutch, ', which literally means clapping hands.

The common names in New Zealand are coastal maire or broad-leaved maire. On Norfolk Island, the common name is ironwood. The species name apetala refers to the lack of petals on the flowers. ==Distribution== In New Zealand N. apetala grows on the North Island mainland on rocky headlands around Whangarei Heads and at the Bay of Islands. It is also found on northern offshore islands including the Hen and Chickens Islands, Great Barrier Island, Little Barrier Island, and the Poor Knights Islands. It tends to be rare on islands with rats. On Norfolk Island, it is common on Mt Pitt, and in forested areas generally, but is less common elsewhere. ==Description== Foliage and olive-like fruit of Nestegis apetala Nestegis apetala is shrub or tree up to 6 m tall, with smooth, shiny dark green leaves 4.5 to 12 cm long and 1.5 to 4 cm wide. Juvenile leaves are larger, up to 14 cm long by 8.5 cm wide. The leaves are often wavy, and are borne on leaf stems about 10 mm long. The flowers of N. apetala arise in racemes of up to 21 flowers growing from the leaf axils or directly from the branchlets. The individual flowers are each about 2.5 mm in diameter, and lack petals. The fruit is a drupe 9 mm long, red or yellow, less commonly purple when ripe. The New Zealand Plant Conservation Network lists the plant as 'Not Threatened'. ==Threats== Young plant of Nestegis apetala grown for sale in New ZealandThe fruit and seeds of N. apetala are palatable to rats. Research in New Zealand has shown that the eating of the seeds by kiore (Pacific rats) substantially reduces the population of the tree. Kiore were introduced by Māori sometime in the last 1,000 years and became widespread on the three main islands, and reached many of the offshore islands. At present, Coastal maire is quite a rare tree on the mainland, but this research indicates that it is probable that before the introduction of kiore, it would have been a much more common component of the coastal forests of the northern North Island. Seedlings or saplings of N. apetala are uncommon or rare on off-shore islands such as Hen Island and Lady Alice Island where kiore are present, and abundant on islands such as Tawhiti-rahi and Aorangi in the Poor Knights group where they are absent. Three years after the eradication of kiore from Cuvier Island, seedlings of N. apetala became common near mature trees. However, the scarcity of fruiting trees on modified islands slows seed dispersal and population recovery. (Campbell et al., 1999:282-4). ==Cultivation and uses== Nestegis apetala is an attractive small tree noted for its hard timber. The berries are eaten by birds. In New Zealand it is available from specialist nurseries. ==NotesReferences== * Salmon J T, The Native Trees of New Zealand, AH & AW Reed, Wellington, New Zealand, 1973. * * * apetala Category:Trees of New Zealand Category:Flora of Norfolk Island Category:Trees of Australia Category:Lamiales of Australia ","title":"Nestegis apetala"},{"id":"12395731","text":"Parliamentary elections were held in Madagascar on 23 September 2007, with the vote to be repeated in two constituencies on 14 November 2007.\\"Élections communales le 12 décembre 2007 : vers une abstention accrue ?\\", Temoignages, October 25, 2007 . 637 candidates contested the election, in which the 127 seats in the National Assembly were at stake.Gregoire Pourtier, \\"Madagascans choose new leaders\\", AFP (IOL), September 24, 2007 . ==Background== In Toliara Province on 20 July 2007, President Marc Ravalomanana announced he would soon dissolve the National Assembly, leading to an early parliamentary election.\\"President makes unexpected announcement\\", AFP (IOL), 20 July 2007.\\"Madagascan National Assembly to be dissolved\\", Xinhua (People's Daily Online), 25 July 2007.

But I found real pleasure in playing Jean Bikoko, Médjo Me Nsom and Dikoumé Bernard, and to finger the guitar strings like them in an unusual way. The assiko musicians and dancers have a special knowledge and a particular technique. I liked their style of music because it was different. But I was just as interested in classical technique as in that of the forest guitarists.\\" In 1990, Kristo Numpuby got back into the music he had somewhat left behind. \\"After finishing high school in Douala, I went to the University of Yaoundé, before heading off to Paris in 1986. I wanted to be a TV director. There were such beautiful posters in the metro and TV ads that left you breathless \\"Generation Mitterrand, Citroen cars, Dim stockings... I was completely subjugated. There were advertising schools everywhere. I got a technical qualification and then for four years, I was an advert wonder kid. This is how I wound up in the studio to oversee the recording of adverts that I was responsible for. We had a problem finding musicians. I reacted quickly, and Morning Limbé, a blues piece composed in 1982, became the soundtrack.\\" Eventually, music replaced advertising. Kristo began hanging out in recording and rehearsal studios, and became a studio bass player. \\"In December 94, I was touring in Ghana with an African star for the Panafest. At the hotel, I ran into Stevie Wonder. I had about 20 of his records at home. When we finished talking, he asked me if I had some work of mine he could listen to. I had nothing to show him what I had been doing musically. That's when I understood that I had to record my compositions.\\" In his first two albums \\"Assiko City\\" (Night & Day, 1997) and \\"An Sol Mè\\" (Night & Day, 2001), Kristo varies in style from sharp traditional African rhythms to the folk sounds of African-Americans, played on acoustic instruments. On stage, accompanied by a percussionist/bottle player and two other musicians, he is one of those artists who excites and surprises his audience at every concert. Kristo also recorded with drummer Denis Tchangou (Mory Kanté, Papa Wemba ...) an album entirely devoted to the chanson legend Georges Brassens. The result is \\"Brassens in Africa\\" (Lon Yes/Mosaic Music), an album that illustrates the beauty of cultural crossovers but also a warm tribute to the French poet on African rhythms. == Discography == * Assiko City (1997, Lon Yes/Night & Day) * An Sol Mè (2001, Lon Yes/Night & Day) * Brassens en Afrique (2007, Lon Yes/Mosaic Music) == References External links== * Official Website * MySpace Category:Cameroonian guitarists Category:Living people Category:Year of birth missing (living people) ","title":"Kristo Numpuby"},{"id":"12395773","text":"Shri Silvius Condpan, a politician from the Indian National Congress party, was a Member of the Parliament of India representing Assam in the Rajya Sabha, the upper house of the Indian Parliament.

It is a close relative of grains of paradise, obtained from the closely related species, Aframomum melegueta. Unlike grains of paradise, which are generally sold as only the seeds of the plant, alligator pepper is sold as the entire pod containing the seeds (in the same manner to another close relative, black cardamom). The plants which provide alligator pepper are herbaceous perennial flowering plants of the ginger family (Zingiberaceae), native to swampy habitats along the West African coast. Once the pod is open and the seeds are revealed, the reason for this spice's common English name becomes apparent as the seeds have a papery skin enclosing them and the bumps of the seeds within this skin is reminiscent of an alligator's back. As mbongo spice, the seeds of alligator pepper are often sold as the grains isolated from the pod and with the outer skin removed. Mbongo spice is most commonly either A. danielli or A. citratum, and has a more floral aroma than A. exscapum (which is the commonest source of the entire pod). It is a common ingredient in West African cuisine, where it imparts both pungency and a spicy aroma to soups and stews. ==Use in cuisine== Even in West Africa, alligator pepper is an expensive spice, so is used sparingly. Often, a single whole pod is pounded in a pestle and mortar before half of it is added (along with black pepper) as a flavouring to West African soups or boiled rice. The spice can also be substituted in any recipe using grains of paradise or black cardamom to provide a hotter and more pungent flavour. When babies are born in Yoruba culture, they are given a small taste of alligator pepper (atare) shortly after birth as part of the routine baby- welcoming process, and it is also used as an ingredient at traditional meet- and-greets. In Igboland, alligator pepper, ósè ọ́jị́ with kola nuts are used in naming ceremonies, as presentation to visiting guests, and for other social events with the kola nut rite. The Igbo present and eat the alligator pepper together with kola nuts. In virtually every Igbo ceremony, alligator peppers and kola nuts are presented to guests at the top of the agenda and prior to any other food or entertainment. Prayers and libations are made together with kola nuts and alligator pepper. ==References== *Celtnet Spice Guide (accessed July 21, 2007) *Gernot Katzer's spice dictionary (accessed July 22, 2007) Category:African cuisine Category:Spices Category:Peppers Category:Aframomum ","title":"Alligator pepper"},{"id":"12395900","text":"WKQY is a Contemporary Christian and Religious-formatted broadcast radio station licensed to Tazewell, Virginia, serving Tazewell and Richlands in Virginia and Welch in West Virginia.

Critics allege that its foundation is meant to weaken opposition parties and is driven by the ruling party. This sentiment, however, seems to be driven by the ruling party themselves as Kem Sokha has long been a very vocal critic of the ruling CPP party. At the time of its foundation, the party claimed to have between 200,000 and 500,000 members nationwide. Human Rights Party is the first party in Cambodia to adopt the check and balance system, changing the culture of one-man-ruling parties, which most parties in Cambodia adopt. It is also the first party in Cambodia to have its major leaders elected in its convention. Its popularity has been dramatically increasing in Cambodia, especially in the countryside. In the July 2008 parliamentary elections, the ruling party won a landslide majority and the Human Rights Party took third place.

It is the album's only song written entirely by drummer Roger Taylor. ==History== Taylor played the guitars in the original demo, but they were later rerecorded by May on his Red Special and Taylor also doubled on electric guitar in addition to drums.\\"A Night At The Opera \\". Queen songs. Retrieved 15 April 2018 The lead vocals were performed by Taylor on the studio version and all released live versions.I'm In Love With My Car UltimateQueen Retrieved 27 August 2011 The revving sounds at the conclusion of the song were a recording of Taylor's then current car, an Alfa Romeo. The lyrics were inspired by one of the band's roadies, Johnathan Harris, whose Triumph TR4 was evidently the \\"love of his life\\".Mark Blake, Is This the Real Life?: The Untold Story of Queen (Da Capo Press, 2013), . Excerpts available at Google Books. The song is dedicated to him, with the liner notes mentioning, \\"Dedicated to Johnathan Harris, boy racer to the end\\". When it came down to releasing the album's first single, Taylor was so fond of his song that he urged Freddie Mercury (author of the first single, \\"Bohemian Rhapsody\\") to allow it to be the B-side and locked himself in a cupboard until Mercury agreed. This decision would later become the cause of much internal friction in the band, in that while it was only the B-side, it generated an equal amount of publishing royalties for Taylor as the main single did for Mercury simply because it was the B-side to \\"Bohemian Rhapsody\\". The song was often played live during the 1977–81 period. Taylor sang it from the drums while Mercury played piano and provided backing vocals. During the News of the World Tour, Mercury would often sing the chorus lines with Taylor. The song was used in a 2004 advertisement for Jaguar.\\"Queen Prepares To 'Rock' Again\\", Billboard, 16 July 2004. The song's title is used as a running joke in the 2018 Queen biopic Bohemian Rhapsody, starting with an argument between Taylor (Ben Hardy) and May (Gwilym Lee) over the song's lyrical content. Later in the film, EMI executive Ray Foster (Mike Myers) suggests to have it or \\"You're My Best Friend\\" released as the first single to A Night at the Opera instead of \\"Bohemian Rhapsody\\". Shortly afterwards, on Kenny Everett's radio show, Freddie Mercury hands the single to the eponymous host, who then reads out \\"I'm In Love With My Car\\" rather than Bohemian Rhapsody, which is then correctly played on air. The song was also featured in Amazon Prime's 2019 series, Good Omens. ==Reception== Music writer Tom Reynolds described the song as \\"seriously, one of the greatest and most passionate love songs I've heard during the last thirty-plus years\\".Tom Reynolds, Touch Me, I'm Sick: The 52 Creepiest Love Songs You've Ever Heard (Chicago Review Press, 2008), , p. 249.

Each sector had a sector commander I.e. Division Commanders who directed the military operation further coordinated through several sub-sectors under sub-sector commanders who fought along with their troops and civilian resistance fighters. Most of the Sector Commanders and quite a number of sub sector commanders remained in security under Indian BSF border camps such as Wing Commander Bashar, Major Shafiullah, Major Mir Shawkat Ali. ==History== Bangladesh Sector Commanders Conference The history of the Bangladesh war of Independence dates back to April 1971 when it began its inception with the title of Bangladesh Forces during the first Bangladesh Sector Commanders Conference held in the week of July 11–17, 1971. It was at this conference during which time BD Forces was organized and formed for the independence struggle. It was significant in the light of its official creation and formation as Bangladesh Forces, its command structuring, sector reorganization, reinforcement and appointing war commanders was its principal focus. This conference was presided over by the Prime Minister of Bangladesh, Tajuddin Ahmed, and Colonel M.A.G. Osmani, during which General Muhammad Ataul Gani Osmani was reinstated from retirement to active duty into the Bangladesh Forces as its senior most official. Colonel M.A.G. Osmani had thereby been appointed Commander in Chief of all Bangladesh Forces with Lt. Col M. A. Rab as Chief of Army Staff. Principal participants of this conference was Squadron Leader M. Hamidullah Khan, Major Ziaur Rahman, Wing Commander M Khademul Bashar, Major M. A. Jalil, Captain Haider, Lt. Col. M A Rab. Structure The Bangladesh Forces was organized for the war in 1971 into in 11 divisions (sectors) and later 3 indep brigades were christened, under BDF HQ situated at 8 Theatre Road, Calcutta, West Bengal. Bangladesh interim provincial government of July 11, 1971 appointed Col. M A G Osmani as Commander in Chief. Lt. Col Rab was appointed as Chief of Bangladesh Army Staff. In this meeting, Bangladesh was divided into Eleven Divisions(Sectors) under BDF Commanders. BDF Commanders of the sectors directed the guerrilla warfare. For better efficiency in military operations each of the BFF sectors were divided into a number of sub-sectors. On November 21, 1971 Bangladesh Forces under Indian Army formed an allied command in which India took surrender of Pakistani forces on December 16, 1971. The table below provides a list of the BDF sectors along with the area under each of them, the names of the BDF commanders of 11 sectors and sub-sectors. The 10th BDF Sector was directly placed under Commander in Chief and included the Naval Commandos and C-in-C's special force. These commandos were later absorbed into the Bangladesh Navy. BDF Commanders directed the guerrilla warfare against West Pakistani forces. Indian participation The Bangladesh Forces (BDF) received assistance from the Indian authorities soon after hostilities started. On November 21, 1971, The Indian Army entered Bangladesh through air and land. The Pakistani forces morally broken and militarily devastated by the BD Forces, agreed to a cease fire without defiance in about one and a half weeks, on December 16, 1971. The cease fire was switched to a surrender document by the Indian government which the Commanding General of the Pakistan Army Eastern Command signed reluctantly. Victory was declared by the Indian authorities and all prisoners of war including combat material were taken to India. Bangladesh Forces were ordered for complete sector close down and demobilization on January 29 by end of March 1972 under the direction of General M.A.G Osmani in final Sector Commanders Conference held at the old Police HQ at 27 Old Mintu Road, Dhaka.

Leading Global Leader Shaping Digital Future Ravi Shankar Prasad is spearheading the Digital India program as Minister for Electronics and Information Technology since May 2014. Recently UK based think tank Apolitical adjudged him as one of the top twenty leaders in the list of 100 most influential people in Digital Government 2018. He is the only Indian to be featured in the top twenty. He was one of the first leaders in the world who had openly supported the cause of net-neutrality and as a Minister in charge of digital affairs in India declined Facebook the permission to operate Free Basics in India. He is also known to have taken a tough stand against misuse of social media for destabilising democracy and fomenting violence in society. Led by Ravi Shankar Prasad, Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology sent legal notices to both Facebook and Cambridge Analytica. Unsatisfied with their responses, he ordered the criminal investigation in this data theft episode by India's apex crime investigation body, the Central Bureau of Investigation. When incidents of mob violence were reported in a few parts of India by viral circulation of fake messages on Whatsapp, he took a firm stand against Whatsapp and demanded technological solutions to curb the problem of fake messages leading to violence. While responding to a debate in the Indian Parliament he openly supported the role of social media in giving a means of expression to ordinary people that they are happily using to question the politicians and media editors, he warned the social media platforms against any misuse of the platform for encouraging violence and terror. Responding to the legal notice served by Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology, Whatsapp took several steps such as mentioning the word forwarded on every message that was forwarded by a user. Whatsapp has also restricted the number of forwarded messages to a maximum of five. Besides these stern regulatory measures that were taken under the leadership of Ravi Shankar Prasad, he is also known for promoting digital development in the rural areas of India by creating a network of 300,000 village level digital entrepreneurs who are operating digital service delivery kiosks known as the Common Service Centers across India.

He followed his father in his ventures from a very early age, and at fifteen he was count of Bettona. Later, in the course of the Italian Wars, he served the Republic of Venice, capturing Lodi and Cremona. In 1527 he was able to obtain the seignory of Perugia, after eliminating his brother and his uncle. During the War of the League of Cognac, Malatesta left Perugia to Philibert of Orange, chief of the Imperial army in Italy, to assume the defence of the Republic of Florence. A secret agreement with Pope Clement VII and the Imperials stated that he would receive the city back after his condotta for Florence ended. His treason was revealed on 3 August 1530, at the Battle of Gavinana, in which the Florentine force under Francesco Ferrucci was destroyed by the Imperial army. Ferrucci's exclamation: \\"Ahi traditor Malatesta!\\" has remained famous. Baglioni was thus able to return to Perugia on 20 September.

The prohibition applies to all educational institutions, including public and private schools and kindergartens, universities and all types of \\"cram\\" schools.Taiwan Progress Report , Global Initiative to End All Corporal Punishment of Children, June 2007. The amendment followed years of campaigning by child rights organizations such as the Humanistic Education Foundation, as well as the government's commitment in August 2005 to work towards the elimination of all corporal punishment in public education. Contributing to the amendment was also a public debate generated by corporal punishment case in October 2005 which attracted widespread media attention. The case involved a teacher repeatedly hitting a student with a wooden stick on the hands and backside for failing to hand in homework. The amendment banning corporal punishment had the support of President Chen Shui-bian and Prime Minister Frank Hsieh and was passed by a wide margin in the Legislative Yuan. Guan Bi-ling, a legislator from the Democratic Progressive Party declared that, Corporal punishment in Taiwanese schools had been banned even before the legal amendment of 2006, but this was a government regulation rather than a formal law. Prevalence Before the legal ban, corporal punishment on students of both genders had been widespread and equal in Taiwanese educational institutions; the government regulation against it was largely ignored. A 2004 poll found that corporal punishment was administered in 93.5% of schools. {  + Percentage of students who have experienced corporal punishment ! 1999 ! 2000 ! 2001 ! 2004 ! 2005 -  83.4%  74.2%  70.9%  69.4%  65.1% - colspan=\\"5\\" align=\\"center\\" Source: Humanistic Education Foundation } Despite its being illegal since January 2007, a nationwide survey conducted in April and May 2007 found that 52.8% of students reported receiving corporal punishment, lower than in previous years but still constituting a majority. However, physical beatings or spankings of students declined from 51% in 2005 to 27.3% in 2007, accompanied by a rise in indirect forms of physical punishment, such as being forced to stand up for an extended period of time, which increased from 9.7% in 2005 to 35% in 2007. The Humanistic Education Foundation has conducted a yearly poll to ascertain the percentage of students affected by corporal punishment in Taiwanese schools. A nationwide survey carried out in September and October 2012 found that corporal punishment is still imposed in 90% of elementary and junior-high schools around the nation. This suggests that the ban has been partially effective; while a majority of students continued to be subject to corporal punishment, its use was slowly declining. ==Penal system== Corporal punishment is illegal as a disciplinary measure in penal institutions. In 1909, when Formosa (as Taiwan was then known) was part of the Empire of Japan, the local government introduced judicial flogging for native Formosan Chinese criminals, which was carried out with a cane. This penalty was regarded as a substitute for imprisonment, and applied to males aged between 16 and 60. In 1997 the Taiwanese authorities said they would consider calls for the introduction of judicial caning on the lines of practice in Singapore to deter crime. In March 2007, a member of the Democratic Progressive Party called for the caning of sex offenders, (archived at www.corpun.com) but this idea was rejected by the Ministry of Justice. ==See also== *Human rights in the Republic of China ==Notes== Category:Corporal punishments Category:Education in Taiwan ","title":"Corporal punishment in Taiwan"},{"id":"12396080","text":"The Nuttall Baronetcy, of Chasefield in the Parish of Bowdon in the County of Chester, is a title in the Baronetage of the United Kingdom.

The laws derived from these texts comprise the origin of many of today’s judicial systems. ==Program content == Undergraduate programs conferring this degree involve studying the legal principles and concepts of Jewish Law, covering civil, criminal and matrimonial law. The course also includes the study of applicable tort, property and contract law. Furthermore, the program also covers legal jurisprudence, judicial systems – including the validity of witnesses and judges – and dispute resolution. A large part of the curriculum focuses on textual analysis, principles of logic, game theory, probability calculus, and critical reasoning. Many programs emphasize the cosmopolitan implications of the principal content areas, thus preparing graduates to assume leadership and professional positions in a wide array of professional and academic fields. Almost all the studied texts are in Aramaic or Hebrew, and the program requires a working knowledge of both languages to facilitate the understanding and examination of these sources. In many institutions, this degree is a prerequisite to the study for Semicha, Rabbinic Ordination. At accredited institutions this degree requires 120 credit hours of study. Examples of case studies An example of a specific case studied is that of an agricultural business with annual tax obligations, wanting to pay its tithe early, using estimation to evaluate the required amount. Legal discussion is based around the issue of interest charged if the amount proves too high, and extra benefit if the approximated figure falls below that for this year's crop. Obviously, such cases have clear parallels to those arising in the English legal system. An additional illustration of the use these ancient concepts in modern-day use is the precedent in Haley v London Electricity Board,http://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKHL/1964/3.html holding liable the owner of such holes or public dangers that may cause injury to unaware passers-by. In Jewish law this concept is known as “pits in public thoroughfares” and has wide-reaching tort implications. ==Accreditation and recognition== The Association of Advanced Rabbinical and Talmudic Schools (AARTS) and the Association of Institutions of Jewish Studies (AIJS) are specifically recognized to accredit Talmudic degrees. In North America, five entities that accredit religious schools in particular are recognized by the United States Department of Education and four (excluding AIJS, which is a new accreditor) by the Council for Higher Education Accreditation: * Association for Biblical Higher Education (ABHE) * Association of Advanced Rabbinical and Talmudic Schools (AARTS) * Association of Institutions of Jewish Studies (AIJS) * Association of Theological Schools in the United States and Canada (ATS) * Transnational Association of Christian Colleges and Schools (TRACS) Since all these accreditors meet United States Department of Educationhttp://www2.ed.gov/admins/finaid/accred/accreditation_pg10.html \\"United States Department of Education\\" recognition criteria, and most the Council for Higher Education Accreditation http://www.chea.org/Directories/faith.asp \\"Council for Higher Education Accreditation\\" as well, their standards correspond to those of regional accreditors.

In China it is common where it occurs, whereas in Myanmar and Thailand it is considered to be uncommon to rare. The species is widespread and there are no major threats, but it is potentially threatened by habitat loss. In China it is collected for local consumption, but at present this is not a major threat. ==Behavior== When disturbed, it produces a distress call that is a loud scream lasting 6 to 10 seconds long.Daengsri, Siriwat and Worapot Boonkhuamdee. 2008.

Buit in 1828, it was the home of Elkanah Watson (1758-1842), a businessman and diplomat best known for founding and promoting the idea of agricultural fairs. This house, still a private residence, was his home until his death. It was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1964. ==Description and history== The Elkanah Watson House stands overlooking Lake Champlain to the east, at the southwest corner of Lake and South Streets in the village of Port Kent. It is a basically square two-story masonry structure, built out of ashlar granite. It is covered by a truncated hip roof with a square belvedere at its center. Its front facade is five bays wide, with the center three sheltered by a two-story projecting portico with round columns supporting a pedimented gable. There are distinctive round windows on the ground floor in the outer bays. A porte-cochere of similar design but only a single story in height projects from the center of the south facade. and The house was built in 1828 to a design by Sheldon & Merritt. It was constructed under the supervision of Charles Watson as the residence of his father, Elkanah Watson. It was the centerpiece of Watson's 5,000-acre property on the lake, of which pieces were later sold off for development. He occupied the house in May 1828 and also operated a farm on his property. The house was later the residence of Winslow C. Watson, one of his sons and a historian who completed Elkanah's autobiography. Elkanah Watson is buried in the family cemetery located near the house. Most outbuildings from the time the property was a working farm have been removed. House facing east, with porch wrapping to the south, 1963 Elkanah Watson was a Revolutionary-era diplomat, banker and businessman, and an early promoter of canals in New York State. He is best known as the founder of the agricultural fair, which he developed to stimulate competition and best practices. He developed this idea while living in Pittsfield, Massachusetts, out of an incident where he tethered two merino sheep to a tree on the town common. The then-unusual animals drew a great deal of attention, prompting Watson to develop the idea of a broader fair, at which animals could be exhibited, and agricultural methods and practices could be shared. The first fair was held in Pittsfield in 1810. ==See also== *List of National Historic Landmarks in New York *National Register of Historic Places listings in Essex County, New York ==ReferencesFurther reading== *Men and the Times of the Revolution; or Memoirs of Elkanah Watson, 1777-1842, edited by Winslow C.

It is endemic to Malaysia and only known from its type locality, a small cave near the top of Gunung Kajang (=Mount Kajang), on Tioman Island, a small island located 32 km off the east coast of Peninsular Malaysia. ==Description== The type series consists of two adult males measuring in snout–vent length—a relatively large size for the genus Leptolalax (now Leptobrachella). The type locality is a cave, and the type specimens were observed calling near the edge of a pond in the cave. Some tadpoles were collected from the same pond and assumed to represent the same species. There is also an earlier collection of tadpoles from a lower altitude on the same mountain that are morphologically similar to the ones at the type locality but that differ in colouration; they might represent another species. ==Biogeography== Tioman Island was connected with Peninsular Malaysia as late as the Pleistocene. However, Grismer et al. considered it unlikely that Leptolalax kajangensis could have dispersed over flat, low-lying landscape to Gunung Kajang; instead, they suggest that the presence of this species on Tioman Island represents much older vicariance, that is, the species (or its ancestors) would have reached Tioman Island when it was still part of a larger mountainous landscape. ==ReferencesExternal links== *Amphibian and Reptiles of Peninsular Malaysia - Leptolalax kajangensis kajangensis Category:Amphibians of Malaysia Category:Endemic fauna of Malaysia Category:Amphibians described in 2004 Category:Taxonomy articles created by Polbot ","title":"Leptobrachella kajangensis"},{"id":"12396269","text":"Leptobrachella liui, also known as Fujian Asian toad or Fujian metacarpal- tubercled toad, is a frog species in the family Megophryidae.

The specific name tuberosa is derived from the Latin tuberosus, meaning \\"full of protuberances\\". ==Description== Adult males measure and adult females, based on a single specimen, about in snout–vent length. The overall appearance is stocky. The snout is obtusely pointed, rounded or truncate in profile. The tympanum is obscured by skin. The finger and toe tips are blunt; the toes have basal webbing. Skin is dorsally covered by many small tubercles of various sizes. In preserved specimens, the dorsum is dark grey or black with obscure light speckling that becomes heavier low on the sides. The venter is white with thin black lines. The limbs have darker crossbars. ==Habitat and conservation== Leptobrachella tuberosa inhabits montane primary forests at elevations of above sea level. It is associated with rocky streams and herbaceous riparian vegetation. One male was observed calling from vegetation one metre above the ground by a cascading stream. This species presumably deposits its eggs in streams where the tadpoles will later develop. Leptobrachella tuberosa has mostly been observed in undisturbed forest.

It is mostly found near a fresh water supply when it can lay its eggs or in dense underbrush, leaf litter, or other fallen object covering the ground. The climate of the ecoregion is tropical wet, with temperature and rainfall modified by the elevation, which reaches up to 2,700 meters.

The area also experiences rainy seasons and frequent monsoons. June–October is the areas monsoon/rainy season, while in December–May there are \\"trade winds\\" which bring little rainfall, making it harder for the frog to find suitably wet places to breed. ==Diet== The Mindanao horned frog's diet is affected by its homeland in the forests of Mindanao. It will eat most of the insects found in Mindanao, it will also consume snails, spiders, worms, and occasionally frogs that are smaller than itself.Mindanao horned frog (Megophrys stejnegeri) . arkive.org ==Threats== The Mindanao horned frog is currently listed as vulnerable on the endangered species scale because its distribution is rather fragmented; it covers an area of less than 20,000 km2 and is continuously shrinking due to deforestation. The frog's major threat is presented by humans. The loss of the frogs habitat in the lowland forest, due to logging, is causing the frogs to compete for food, water and space. Also the pollution caused by the agricultural and mine-tailing of humans in the area is causing the mountain streams and rivers to become polluted leaving fewer places for frogs to produce and rear their young. There are many other animal species living on and around the island of Mindanao. There are over thirty-four bird species native to the area, of which more than half, such as the Mindanao scops owl, the Philippine eagle-owl, and the blue-capped kingfisher, prey on the Mindanao horned frog.

It is bordered by Daws Road (north), South Road (west), Cashel Street (east) and Mill Terrace (south). The suburb is located within the City of Mitcham local government authority. St Marys Park is one of the largest reserves within the suburb and was originally the training ground of the South Adelaide Football Club. ==History== St Marys was first farmed in the 1830s by the Daw and Ayliffe families. They were later joined by Herschel Babbage, Robert Torrens and Captain William O’Halloran. Prior to the 1850s, the suburb was named St Marys-on-the-Sturt as, apart from farmhouses and the St Marys Church of England, there were no buildings in the area from Daws Rd to the Sturt River until various shops were established on the northern side of the church. The suburb was an important wheat growing area for Adelaide until the northern areas of the colony came under cultivation when some of the St Marys properties were replanted with almonds, grape vines and olives. Daw subdivided the frontage of his property as St Marys Village and built a house on the corner of what is now South Road and Daws Road. In 1852, he sold the house and several hundred acres to Babbage. After Babbage's own home burnt down in 1875, he built a mansion that was known as \\"Babbage’s castle.\\" Babbage built the mansion using a new building material, reinforced concrete, however he used salty water and the mansion immediately began to crumble. The family left the estate in 1896. A two-story hotel on the corner of South and Ayliffes Road, the Lady MacDonald Hotel was licensed in 1857. As a result of a spelling error by the sign writer, the hotel displayed the name Lady MacDonnell, an error that persisted for over 70 years. In 1909 the hotel became a temperance hotel and went into decline. In the 1930s it was sold as a home to Ted Grindell, the local council \\"garbo\\" until the ruins were demolished in 1966 and replaced with a car dealership. During the Great Depression, the Babbage ruins provided shelter for a number of homeless families. In 1936 the Babbage estate was subdivided by William Brookman Watson as Castle Estate with the blocks being sold to visiting Royal Navy sailors as souvenirs of the British Empire. Watson himself moved into John Daw's corner house and on his death the property was purchased by Dr Hugh LLoyd who had a nearby surgery on South Road in Clovelly Park which later became the Clovelly Park Community Health Centre. The increasing use of motor vehicles in the 1920s led to the subdivision of several farms in the area into the estates of St Marys Park, Castle Estate, Clovelly Gardens and South Road Estate. The Great Depression of the 1930s followed by World War II stifled land sales and by 1949 only 25 people were living in the estates. The land set aside for Kiley Reserve in the subdivision of Clovelly Gardens had already been used by the Darlington Motorcycle Club since 1920 for races and in 1930 the remainder of the subdivision was converted to a trotting track. In the 1940s the South Australian Housing Trust then bought the unsold blocks in St Marys to provide low cost housing for workers. Kiley Reserve was later acquired by the State Government for the South Road Primary School which was built in 1951. By 1960, the South Australian Housing Trust had built nearly 400 homes in St Marys. Construction of the Chrysler vehicle manufacturing plant in Tonsley Park in 1963 led to many support industries being developed in St Marys. An unofficial Post Office was opened on South Road on 16 May 1927 but was discontinued in 1952 when postal services were taken over by a shop at 18 Quinlan Avenue. A purpose built Post Office center was built on South Road St Marys in 1964 with postal services continuing at the shop until 1975 when they were transferred to the South Road office. The South Road office was renamed St Marys South in 1967 and closed in 1976. A Clovelly Park office opened in 1950, was renamed St Marys in 1967 and closed in 1991. In 1964 the Watiparinga Creek was covered as part of the South West Drainage Scheme. A stone bridge built in the 1850s at the northern end of Ragless reserve, which allowed South Road traffic to pass over the creek, was buried when South Road was widened in 1965 and still exists beneath the road today. Springfield Creek also ran through the suburb and was the cause of substantial flooding during heavy rains. In the 1970s the creek was replaced by drainage pipes and covered. St Marys Anglican Church In 1841, John Daw donated one acre of his farm for the establishment of the St Marys Church of England. Erected on the present site of the St Marys Fire Station, by 1847 the Stringybark building had deteriorated at which time a stone church was built on a new site 250 m to the south. The original church building continued in use as a school until 1928. The first person interred at the new cemetery was James Penn, a descendant of William Penn. The church and cemetery were consecrated by Bishop Augustus Short in 1849. The name of the St Marys Church of England was changed to St Marys Anglican Church in 1981. St Marys Baptist Church The Baptist Union granted a fellowship to the St Marys Baptist Congregation in 1953 with their first church being an iron and timber building relocated from Underdale to a site in St Marys. The current church was constructed adjacent to the original structure in 1965. The church operated a community kindergarten from 1953 to 1981. South Road Primary School South Road Primary School was opened in 1951 on land set aside for Kiley reserve in the subdivision of Clovelly Gardens which was never developed. A Junior Primary School was established adjacent to the Primary School in 1954. Due to declining enrollments as the suburb aged, the Junior Primary School site and buildings were sold to the Edwardstown Baptist Church in 1980 with the children accommodated in the Primary School buildings. The Primary School was closed in 1997 and the school grounds and oval were sold to the Edwardstown Baptist Church who financed the purchase through the sale of blocks of land in Kiley Court the following year. St Bernadette’s Primary School St Bernadette's Catholic Primary School was opened in 1952 and staffed by Dominican nuns. The school has been a target of arsonists with major arson attacks in 1990, 1997 and 2000. The four gum trees along the boundary of the St Bernadette's oval are the remnant of a double row of gum trees planted along South Road in the 1880s to counter over-clearing of the suburb. St Marys Park St Marys Park was opened in 1929 as the South Road Recreation Ground. Although they would use Adelaide Oval as their home ground, the South Adelaide Football Club established their clubrooms and conducted training here. In 1969 upgrading began to bring the oval to SANFL standards and the oval was officially made the club's home ground although home games would continue to be held at Adelaide Oval. In 1971 the ground was officially re-opened as Panther Park with an exhibition match between South Adelaide and the 1970 VFL premiers, Carlton. In 1973, South Adelaide built new clubrooms on nearby South Road. The club moved to a new home in Noarlunga in 1995 on completion of the Noarlunga Oval and in 1997 Panther Park was renamed St Marys Park. ==Points of interest== *Ayliffes Road was originally the driveway from South Road to the Ayliffe property in Pasadena. *Benjamin Street was named by Benjamin Babbage himself in 1869 and the street's gum trees are all that remain of the native trees planted by Babbage on his estate. *The olive tree in the front yard of No. 6 Donald Street was once part of an orchard planted by Babbage in the 1860s. *The large gum tree on the corner of The Crescent and Auricchio Avenue is a remnant of the original vegetation in St Marys. *Auricchio Avenue was named after Mario Auricchio, a local developer who established the Vittorio Veneto Club in the 1930s as an apolitical alternative venue to the Fascio Italian Club which served the local fascist community. *The junction of St Marys Street and Mingbool Avenue is wider than normal due to the drainage works of Springfield Creek beneath it. ==Sources== St Marys Walk City of Mitcham 2009 ==References== Category:Suburbs of Adelaide ","title":"St Marys, South Australia"},{"id":"12396377","text":"Oreolalax lichuanensis (Lichuan lazy toad or Lichuan toothed toad) is a species of amphibian in the family Megophryidae.

Most of them are people who became the first members of Kamina's Team Gurren. The plot of Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann is divided into two main story arcs, separated by a seven-year timeskip. After the timeskip, most characters pass through important changes in their appearances and/or personalities, and some of them have their own unique roles in the overall story. ==Simon== Personal Gunmen *Lagann *Gurren Lagann *Arc-Gurren Lagann *Super Galaxy Gurren Lagann *Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann *Tengen Toppa Lagann (movie only) *Super Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann (movie only) The series protagonist, Simon (pronounced as SEE-mohn) originally started off as a boy in the beginning of the story who suffered from low self-esteem due to his lack of parents (who were both killed in a cave-in) and a fear of earthquakes. Though physically underdeveloped for his age and ignored by adults and snubbed by girls, Simon is a valued digger in Giha Village. Simon is eventually befriended by Kamina, whose inspirational speeches start to give him enough confidence to muster his courage and take action in bouts of intense determination. Finding Lagann during his dig, Simon joins Kamina in going to the surface where he develops a crush on Yoko before learning she has feelings for Kamina. When Kamina died during the formation of Team Dai-Gurren, Simon is thrown into a maddened and pervasive depression, driving him to be overly aggressive in combat while isolating himself among the Team. But Simon's meeting with Nia helps him come to a revelation about his own nature, leading to him discarding his fears and doubts as he takes over Kamina's role as Team Dai-Gurren's leader. In the second half of the series, Simon has grown into a young man who bears an uncanny resemblance to Kamina, but is able to exercise caution when necessary. Simon planned to marry Nia until the Anti-Spiral Race uses her to begin their attack on Earth. This results with Simon being sent to jail by the government to ease the people, later breaking free with Viral's help to take back Cathedral Terra as he leads Team Dai-Gurren to save Nia and destroy the Anti- Spiral. Managing to marry Nia before she fades away, Simon gives Lagann's key to Gimmy as he leaves his friends to wander the planet under a low-profile as a nameless vagrant, stating that, \\"there are others more fit to travel down the tunnels I dug\\". In the epilogue, the old man that Simon has become watches his former comrades setting out to contact other races throughout the galaxy to help prevent the Spiral Nemesis and ensure the safety of the universe. ==Kamina== : Personal Gunmen: *Gurren *Gurren Lagann is a young man from Giha, a subterranean village, who dreams of leaving the underground and going to the surface, a place which he alone believes he saw as a child with his father. His father went on, but Kamina was too hesitant to join him. As a result, Kamina swore that he would one day return to the surface and rejoin his father. Possessing a seemingly arrogant personality, Kamina is very passionate about his goals and will pursue them without a trace of fear, hesitation, or sometimes sense. This attitude often manifests itself in dramatic speeches which have the power to rally all those who hear them to his call. As his first act of notoriety, Kamina forms \\"Team Gurren\\" and convinces his \\"blood- brother,\\" Simon, to help him with his plan to drill through the roof of the village and get to the world above. However, the plan fails. Kamina willingly takes the blame for disrupting the peace and is jailed by the village chief. At night, Simon breaks him out to show him an extraordinary artifact he unearthed, only to be interrupted by a large Gunmen that crashes through the village's ceiling. A young girl sharpshooter named Yoko descends from the surface and ends up joining Kamina (now carrying a nodachi that he stole from the village chief) and Simon as they pilot the newly unearthed Gunmen Kamina names \\"Lagann\\". Together, they defeat the invading Gunmen and reach the surface in the process. After the trio breaks through, they meet many enemies and friends as they continue forward. Kamina eventually gets his own Gunmen, which he names \\"Gurren\\". During a fight, Kamina discovers a skeleton that turns out to be his own father. After burying him, Kamina takes his father's tattered cloak and a small piece breaks off at the end. Simon grabs this piece and ties it around his arm, signifying their bond. The once two-member \\"Team Gurren\\" expands to the size of an entire resistance force aiming to overthrow the Beastman Empire. Kamina leads this force and names it \\"Team Dai-Gurren\\". Kamina's largest battle involves the capture of one of the enemy’s moving fortresses belonging to one of the Four Divine Generals, Thymilph. The mission is a success, but not without cost. Heavily wounded, Kamina combines with Simon to form Gurren Lagann and defeats the Beastman General with his signature move: \\"Giga Drill Breaker.\\" Kamina dies in the cockpit, leaving Simon with this: \\"Listen up, Simon, and don't forget. Believe in yourself. Not in the me who believes in you. Not in the you who believes in me. You should believe in yourself!\\" These words are long remembered after his death, giving Simon the confidence to uphold his destiny as the \\"one whose drill will pierce the heavens.\\" Also, Kamina's signature pose, in which he sticks his index finger up into the air, along with his catchphrase, is mirrored by several characters during the show as a tribute to him and as a symbol of confidence in Team Dai-Gurren. Kamina is buried in the battlefield where he died, his nodachi stabbed into the ground and his cloak tied to its sheath. After the fall of the Beastman Empire, a new city is built from the ruins of the former capital, Teppelin, and is named \\"Kamina City.\\" A huge statue of Kamina stands at the center of the city in his honor. However, the monument is destroyed after the citizens discover the truth about the Human Annihilation System and revolt against the government. Kamina died in episode 8 and reappeared in episode 26, although in completely different character. Simon, under the influence of the Anti-Spirals, witnesses visions of a false childhood where Kamina eggs Simon on to drill into banks and jewelry shops to steal valuables for him. He is shown groveling at the feet of beastmen on top of a hill, begging for his life and urging Simon to do the same. Simon reaches for his Core Drill and finds it missing. Then the true Kamina appears, wearing his cloak and holding his nodachi, and asks Simon if he lost his Drill. Kamina then reminds Simon that his drill is his soul, that Kamina and his fallen comrades will live on in him, and that he is the one whose drill will pierce the heavens. Simon is reminded of what he is fighting for: for the sake of Nia and for the fate of the Spiral Universe. This breaks the Alternate Multiverse Labyrinth, allowing Simon to reassemble Team Dai-Gurren and face the Anti- Spirals for the final time. ==Yoko Littner== Personal Gunmen: *Yoko M Tank (movie only) *Space Dayakkaiser (anime only) *Space Yoko W Tank (movie only) *Tengen Toppa Yoko W Tank (movie only) , the series' lead female character, is a young woman from the village of Littner. She has considerable combat experience even before her chance meeting with Kamina and Simon. In Episode 1 a gunman crashes through the roof of Giha village and prepares to attack the populace when Yoko, who has been tracking the Gunmen, rappels down a cliff whilst firing her electromagnetic rifle. Her solo attack disables the Gunmen, giving Kamina and the villagers time to seek safety. Kamina, however, chooses instead to make advances at Yoko and initially diminishes her combat qualifications on the grounds of being a woman, yet acknowledges \\"that lady's spunk\\". She decides to accompany Simon and Kamina on their quest. Despite their constant banter Yoko soon becomes infatuated with Kamina. She is also the object of Simon's naive crush until he discovers the two kissing. Yoko is stated to be the same age as Simon, but it is heavily implied that her home- town measures time differently, as all humans live underground and might have a differing number of days in a year. She is very mature for her age and is the most rational member of the group. Those traits helped her to cope with Kamina's death although she remained affected by it. After the war of liberation, in which she plays a major role, Yoko eschews taking part in politics at Kamina City. Desiring to distance herself from her warrior past, she takes the name Yomako and moves to remote Koreha Island. There, she accepts the job of teacher at that island's elementary school. However, after learning of events occurring at Kamina City, and being attacked by two gunmen she temporarily leaves the island and breaks into Rinkane Jail to release Simon. After leaving the prison with Boota, Simon and Viral, she joins other members of Team Dai-Gurren and pilots the Dayakkaiser to pursue the war against the Anti-Spirals. In the epilogue an older Yoko is seen at the same school mentioned earlier, but in the role of principal. ==Nia Teppelin== Personal Gunmen: *Tengen Toppa Solvernia (movie only) is a mysterious young girl found sleeping in a capsule in the middle of a dump site by Simon when he was still distraught over Kamina's death. Later revealed to be Lord Genome's daughter, she learns the harsh reason why her father left her to die. She had no prior contact with humans except her father, though she is very curious, pure and innocent. Despite early misgivings from her lineage, she is quickly accepted by Team Dai-Gurren, much to the initial irking of Yoko, who later becomes a close friend of hers.Gainax (2007). Tengen Toppa Gurren-Lagann anime, Episode 12 During her journey, she develops a strong empathy for Simon and joins him in the final confrontation against her father. Seven years after the war with the Beastmen, Nia receives a marriage proposal from Simon. She refuses at first, after her bubbly contrived logic causes her to misunderstand his words, but after receiving counseling from Kiyoh and Kiyal, she decides to accept. However, when the population limit is reached, the Anti-Spiral data awakens within her and permanently converts her into an Anti-Spiral virtual lifeform, serving as the Anti Spirals' emissary in charge of Earth's Human Extermination System. But in spite of her emotionless persona and being a step ahead of Team Dai-Gurren, Simon points out to Nia that all her actions and appearances before him were in fact the act of her true feelings of her former self, who urges Simon to keep fighting, allowing Nia to have the strength to return to her former self while ending the Human Extermination. However, she is transported back to the Anti-Spiral homeworld so the data on Team Dai Gurren can be extracted from her for analysis, with Simon vowing to rescue her. Although she is saved, the Anti-Spiral's death makes Nia fade away because her existence as a program is dependent on the Anti-Spiral Race. She lasts long enough to be wed to Simon before vanishing, leaving behind only her ring. In the epilogue, which takes place 20 years later, a memorial site is seen in her honor, located adjacent to Kamina's burial ground. She has a running gag of rambling on incoherently due to her lack of knowledge of regular customs, with one example being her cell phone away message stating, \\"I am not here right now, well it is not that I am not here it is just I cannot reach my cellphone right now. Also, please try calling my house than my cell...\\". Despite Simon describing it as making her nearly impossible to understand, he also notes she always spoke warmly and kindly. ==Viral== Personal Gunmen: *Enki *Enkidu *Enkidudu *Tengen Toppa Enkidurga (movie only) (pronounced \\"Veer-ral\\") is a member of the Human Eradication Army, who regards Kamina as a strong rival since losing his Enki's helmet to the newly created Gurren Lagann. Though being among the more humanoid of the Beastmen, his DNA contains aspects of tiger genetics. He is extremely loyal to Lordgenome and the four supreme generals, and he does his best to serve them. He has a personal Gunmen called Enki while under General Thymilph, which mainly utilizes swords and a powerful head-mounted laser (Named in the manga as the Enki Sun Attack). After Kamina's death, he continues to fight Gurren Lagann to regain his honor, thinking that Kamina is still alive. However, upon learning the truth, a shocked Viral focuses his frustrations on Simon before refusing to kill him on Cytomander's orders when he holds Yoko hostage. Brought before Lordgenome, Viral learns the truth of the Beastmens' lifespans before receiving the gift of immortality. Though he believed it was so he can kill Simon with no fear of death in his new Gunmen Enkidudu, Lordgenome reveals that the immortality was to ensure that he had an eternal witness of the Spiral King's power. But Lordgenome dies in the battle and an astonished Viral disappears as Dekabutsu collapses around him. Years later, having protected some humans who wished to remain underground, Viral resurfaces and causes an uproar with Enkidudu, calling Simon out to fight him. He is later taken into custody by the Grapeals, placed in the same prison Simon later ends up as a scapegoat for the Anti-Spirals' appearance. Becoming a reformed villain of sorts, Viral pilots Gurren during the battle against the Anti-Spirals and seemingly gains his own Spiral Energy from being exposed to Simon's, seen in his Core Drill in the series and Tengen Toppa Enkidurga in the movie. It is also shown that his deepest desire is to get married and have children, but he cannot do so as Beastmen lack the spiral energy necessary for reproduction. In the epilogue, he becomes the captain of the Super Galaxy Dai-Gurren and an emissary for Earth. ==Rossiu Adai== is a boy from another underground village, Adai, in which the people worship the Gunmen as gods. A modest but intelligent person, he's the apprentice of his father, the village elder who governs Adai and performs its ritualistic method of dealing with over population by having people draw sticks with the winners sent up to the surface to die, Rossiu's mother being among those chosen. But when Gimmy and Darry were selected to leave the village, Rossiu is horrified to learn his father rigged it as they are orphans and decides to go with the twins and, thus joining Team Gurren. Before he leaves, the village elder gives him a book that seems to withhold some secrets from humanity's past, with the task to find someone able to read it, as no one in his village can decipher its contents. After joining Team Gurren, he is often teased by Kamina, who calls him \\"Forehead Boy\\". After Kamina's death, Rossiu temporarily begins piloting Gurren in his place. After the end of the war, Rossiu became Simon's second-in-command, always trying to make him act more serious about his duties as the ruler of Kamina City. However, in spite of his time with Team Dai-Gurren, Rossiu became a lot like his father and took Lordgenome's last words seriously, leading a secret project to access Lordgenome's memories and learn the history behind him and the Anti-Spirals. However, when the Anti-Spiralized Nia causes a riot across the city, with an angry mob formed against Team Dai-Gurren, Rossiu decides to use Simon as a scapegoat and overthrows him. Though he was the one who placed him in prison with the death penalty, keeping up a cold heartless facade in public, Rossiu lamented his actions in secret from all except Kinon. From there, Rossiu and his subordinates prepared a contingency plan by having the rest of the people to take shelter in the underground villages, assumed to be safe by the government, with a select few to board the excavated Arc-Gurren. However, when Leeron showed him that no life form, in the surface or underground, would survive the impact, which would render the planet completely uninhabitable for one year, Rossiu decided to change his plans, by filling the rest with animals and livestock, ensuring a chance of survival of them, and abandoning the rest of mankind. Earth was then attacked earlier than expected, and he had to escape with only half the expected refugees on board of the Arc-Gurren.Gainax (2007). Tengen Toppa Gurren-Lagann anime, Episode 20, and Episode 21, 2'54 However, Rossiu's plans were once again foiled by the Anti-Spirals who had already set a large force awaiting to ambush the Arc- Gurren in space. Just when he was about to lose hope, Simon and the rest of Team Dai-Gurren came to his aid. One week after the Human Extermination System was stopped, Rossiu left a farewell message and set for Adai where he intended to commit suicide after settling things with his father, revealing that he was never able to decipher the book; the best theory he has is that someone had filled the book with gibberish as a prank and the two share a laugh. However, Kinon found the message and Simon rushed with her in Gurren Lagann to stop him, with Simon beating some sense into him and giving Rossiu the strength to keep living just like Kamina had done for Simon. Rossiu takes the duty of watching out for Kamina City, while Simon and the rest of Team Dai-Gurren depart from Earth to the Anti-Spirals' homeworld, having Kinon and Guinble assist him. After the final battle against the Anti-Spirals, Rossiu was the priest for Simon and Nia's wedding, and in the epilogue, he is seen still holding the position of commander-in-chief, as Simon did not reclaim it and wonders if he did a good enough job as a leader or if Simon would have done better. ==Kittan Bachika== : Personal Gunmen: *King Kittan *King Kittan Deluxe *Space King Kittan is the oldest of the Black Siblings. During his first encounter with Team Gurren, he mistakenly confuses Kamina for a Beastman. This is reconciled, when it is discovered that Kamina is piloting the Gunmen, Gurren. Shortly after, the two teams (the Black Siblings and Team Gurren) come into contact with the sixteen-headed enemy Gunmen, whom the Black Siblings had crossed paths with earlier. After the eventual defeat of the enemy Gunmen, the two teams part ways. (In the manga, they meet up with Kamina and co at the same time Viral makes his entrance.) Kittan eventually parted ways with his sisters, who join up the Team Gurren soon after, before returning to aid Team Gurren against Thymilph in his own acquired Gunman, King Kittan, and with others inspired by Kamina who obtained Gunmen of their own they have captured and customized. This event consequently leads to the formation of Team Dai- Gurren. As a result of the death of Kamina, Kittan temporarily takes over as the leader (though self-proclaimed) of the team, but after Simon recovers from his depression over Kamina's death, Kittan transfers the control of leadership to him. After the war, Kittan became the Chief of the Legal Affairs Bureau in Kamina City, but starts to resent Rossiu when he sentences Simon to death and then allow his sister Kinon to wear an explosive-equipped vest to accompany Simon in the case he attempts to escape. Though he eventually understands the position Rossiu was in, Kittan resigns after discovering about Rossiu's plan to evacuate Earth using the Arc-Gurren, along a small fraction of the human population, and abandoning the rest to die, when the moon falls. Before leaving, he demanded Rossiu to return the Core Drill he took from Simon and rushed on his Gunman to deliver it back to him. In episode 25, Kittan meets his demise by protecting the other members of Team Dai-Gurren. Super Galaxy Dai-Gurren, unable to escape the incredibly dense space sea produced by the Death Spiral Machine, is ordered by Simon to move towards the center of the sea, where the Machine rests surrounded by a powerful shield. After the ship's weapons fail to get anywhere near the shield, Kittan offers to take the Space King Kittan on a mission to destroy the shield and fire spiral-based missiles at the core of the Death Spiral Machine, but not before stealing a kiss from Yoko, and apologizing for \\"[his] selfishness\\". Though he successfully breaks through the shield, the Space King Kittan is crushed by the immense gravity of the space sea, leaving Team Dai-Gurren shocked at what they think is the death of Kittan. However, the original King Kittan, wielding one of the drills that broke off from the Gurren-Lagann when it was attempting to transform Super Galaxy Dai-Gurren into humanoid form, flies towards the Machine's core, screaming his final speech. Kittan awakens his own Spiral Energy, melding the drill to his King Kittan, and performing his own variation of the Giga Drill Breaker (King Kittan Giga Drill Break) to destroy the Death Spiral Machine. The resulting explosion engulfs and kills Kittan, who acknowledges his interest in Spiral energy before his demise, but also frees the Super Galaxy Dai-Gurren from the space sea, allowing Simon to transform it into Super Galaxy Gurren-Lagann and fulfill Kittan's dying wish. In the epilogue, a memorial site, in the form of a sword, is seen in his honor right alongside Kamina, Nia, and the other members of Team Dai-Gurren who gave their lives in the war with the Anti-Spirals. In the movie, there is a brief scene after the final battle where Kittan's siblings mourn their brother's death, with his memorial marker still placed alongside Kamina. ==Boota== : The unofficial mascot of Team Dai-Gurren, is a small pig-mole from Giha village, whom Simon keeps as a pet. Boota is characterized by his sunglasses and star pattern surrounding his tail. No matter how many years pass, Boota's physical appearance does not change much. Although he can only say \\"BOOTTA!\\" (hence the name), he can understand humans, and even has near-human intelligence. His favorite spots to stay are between Yoko's breasts or on Simon's shoulder. He has ripped off his tail and consequently the tip of his rear end as an emergency food supply for Kamina and Simon so as to provide energy to the starving duo during a crucial fight, and also has served as a morale figure to Yoko, when she first hesitated at piloting Gurren in place of Kamina. He too was thrown in prison along with Simon, and even had his own pair of miniature handcuffs. When Simon and Viral broke out of jail, Boota loyally ran to Simon's shoulder. However, upon seeing Yoko again, he hastily jumped in her cleavage once more. Boota proved his true value to Team Dai-Gurren in episode 25, when he asked Viral for entry into Gurren's cockpit and from there, released a massive surge of Spiral Energy to aid a worn-out Simon in his task to power up Super Galaxy Dai-Gurren. Lordgenome stated that this occurred not only because humans aren't the only beings capable of generating Spiral Energy, but it also may be a reaction from Boota, being frequently exposed to Simon's Spiral Energy. In episode 26, Boota stands to protect Lordgenome from the Anti-Spiral trying to attack him, and when their Spiral Energy resonates, he is transformed into an anthropomorphic humanoid. His attacks are laced with Spiral Energy. Curiously, his \\"human form\\" appears in the prologue of the first episode. The glasses Boota has in his humanoid form look similar to the glasses Nono wears in her Buster Machine No. 7 form in the anime Diebuster. Unfortunately, this transformation allows the Anti-Spiral to trap Boota in the Multiverse Labyrinth; when he was freed by Simon, the transformation was undone. In the epilogue, he is seen wandering the world alongside an aged Simon. ==Leeron Littner== : , nicknamed \\"Ron\\", is the village mechanic of Littner, who is able to repair and scavenge the various Gunmen he and his group encounter. Quite knowledgeable, rather flamboyant, and homosexual, Leeron was the first one to join Kamina, Simon, and Yoko on their quest to defeat the Beastmen. He has become the main technician for Team Dai-Gurren, as well as being in charge of coordination and communication between the Gunmen during battle from Dai-Gurren. His ability to learn and adapt is incredibly great, seeing as he once mentioned that he didn't even know how to read before becoming a mechanic. In part 1, upon first meeting Kamina and Simon, Leeron acts extremely flirtatious around the two newcomers, using a rather graphic array of phrases when around them. Kamina reacts to Leeron with threats, drawing his nodachi and cursing him. Simon for the most part doesn't mind, but still regarded him with concern. Later in the series, Leeron pulls off of his attempts to proposition the boys, resulting in a more cordial relationship, and many times Simon praises Leeron for his work. At several points in part 3, Leeron makes flirtatious advances of a kind on both Gimmy and Viral, resulting in both of them leaping out of his immediate vicinity. This happens 3 times in the case of Gimmy and once with Viral. Viral reacted the same way Kamina did, drawing his cleaver and cursing him. It is speculated that it was \\"breaking\\" Viral in, that he had become the character that had once been his biggest rival, Kamina. After the war, Leeron became the Chief of the Science Bureau of Kamina City, and his team even succeeded in launching a rocket to the moon in order to investigate it and confirm the veracity of Lordgenome's ominous prophecy. Throughout the series, Leeron never seemed to age (except for a brief appearance in the epilogue, where his normally green hair appears to be somewhat greyer). ==Antagonists== Beastmen Kingdom Beastmen are a \\"species\\" of humanoids that act as the primary antagonists for Parts I and II of the anime series Tengen Toppa Gurren-Lagann. They are the product of an ideal blending of human and animal genes, intentionally flawed hybrids with a human intelligence and form but great diversity in size, shape, and limbs. Their animal features can be almost anything: marine, amphibian, mammal, bird, or sometimes an entirely unrecognizable type of animal. Lordgenome originally engineered the Beastmen as soldiers against the Anti-Spirals, because the substitution of animal genes distorted the shape of human spiral DNA and rendered them invisible to detection. However, doing so came at the cost of evolutionary potential, for Beastmen lack Spiral Energy and thus cannot pilot Gunmen without the use of solar-powered batteries. Furthermore, their bodies deteriorate at an accelerated rate and their cell lines weaken overtime, thus forcing Lordgenome to deep freeze unborn specimens who are in a constant state of regeneration. Following the extinction of the Spiral Warriors at the hands of the Anti-Spirals, Lordgenome retreated to Earth and recommissioned his Beastmen to act as population control. Piloting towering Gunmen, the Beastmen patrolled the planet's surface and used their superior technology to kill any human who trespassed above ground, preventing the human population from ever growing large enough to be detected by the Anti-Spirals. Lordgenome divided his forces into the four branches of the \\"Human Eradication Army\\", each led by one of his four Supreme Generals, responsible for monitoring a distinct cardinal direction of the planet's surface. Each of the four \\"Supreme Generals\\" is a representation of one of the four classical elements: earth, air, fire and water. After Lordgenome's death, the Beastmen armies were disbanded and all Gunmen were scrapped. Many Beastmen living within Teppelin itself survived its collapse, and were persuaded by Nia Teppelin to accept peace with the human victors and were integrated into Kamina City's society without prejudice. On the outskirts of civilization, liberated Beastmen warlords continued to wage campaigns against human settlements, so battles between the New Government and Beastmen erupted over time. Seven years following the Battle of Teppelin, few if any of these resistance forces remained, most having been eliminated by Grapearl Squadrons. Thymilph : is the first of the Spiral King's Four Supreme Generals introduced in the story, representing the classical element of fire. He is Viral's initial superior officer and the commander of the Human Eradication Army Eastern Branch, which he monitors from the deck of the land battleship, the Dai- Gunzan. He is good friends with Adiane, though Guame insinuates a closer relationship. He is a skilled tactician and proud warrior, and was ultimately killed when Kamina and Simon destroyed his personal Gunmen, the Byakou, with the Giga Drill Breaker. Thymilph appears as a stout but large, well-built imposing armored warrior with gorilla features. He also resembles Triple Seven from Dead Leaves. He is impressively strong, almost always seen as in the company of a large iron hammer he presumably uses in close-quarter combat. A seasoned and confident war veteran, Thymilph has a high respect for caution and shrewdness, but like Viral, possesses a warrior's code of honor. Guame implies that Thymilph was idolized by many Beastmen throughout the Beastmen Empire. Thymilph's name is based on the DNA chemical thymine and the elemental Sylph. His Gunmen, Byakou, is based on the mythical White Tiger, Byakko. Adiane : is the second of the Spiral King's Four Supreme Generals, and the only female general among their number. She is a representation of the classical element of water. She is good friends with her fellow General, Thymilph, though Guame jokes that they had a closer relationship. She implies this friendship was strong because both Guame and General Cytomander treat her as an inferior because of her gender, while Thymilph respected her as a warrior. After Thymilph's death, Adiane is stunned and vows revenge, volunteering to attack the Team Dai-Gurren when given the opportunity by Lordgenome. Though she refused his aid as she blamed him for Thymilph's death, Adiane recruits Viral after he saved her from being crushed by the Dai-Gurren after an attempt to execute Nia once she learns Lordgenome abandoned her. But because of her boasting and staking of her pride on the task, Adiane refuses to return to Teppelin until she destroys Team Dai-Gurren, using the sea to her advantage when the Dai-Gurren crosses it on its way to Teppelin. Having Viral pilot her Dai-Gunkai to drag the Dai-Gurren into the cold depths, Adiane engages in personal combat with the Gurren-Lagann in her Sayrune to ensure no interference. But the plan fails and Adiane attempts to take Nia hostage until Yoko disables the Sayrune's shoulder, leaving it opened to close-range fire from the Dai-Gurren's artillery cannons and killing Adiane instantly in the explosion. Adiane looks almost completely human, though she has a long, thick scorpion tail and a snake eye. She wears an eyepatch over her left eye and dresses in a loose fitting dress and heels. She is intensely hot and impulsive, often letting her anger get the better of her and land her in sticky situations or taking out her frustrations on Viral. Despite this impetuous disposition, she is extremely skilled, and is able to battle five powerful Gunmen at once outside of her natural element of water. Adiane's name is based on the DNA chemical adenine and the elemental Undine. Her Gunmen, Sayrune, is based on the mythical Azure Dragon, Seiryū. Cytomander : is one of the Spiral King's Four Supreme Generals and the commander of Teppelin's aerial forces and owner of the flying battleship, Dai-Gunten. Cytomander is the embodiment of the classical element of air or wind. After Adiane's death, Cytomander personally goes after Team Dai-Gurren in Dai- Gunten, but is forced to retreat after Gurren Lagann hijacks one of his fighters to give itself wings and causes his battleship to suffer massive damage. A month after that, on the 6th day of Team Dai-Gurren's assault on Teppelin, a maddened Cytomander leads a two-pronged attack with Guame in the Dai-Gundo, only to lose his life when his Gunman, Shuzack, is rammed by the Dai-Gurren as it sinks the Dai-Gunten. Cytomander's name is based on the DNA chemical cytosine and the elemental Salamander. His Gunmen, Shuzack, is based on the mythical Vermilion Bird, Suzaku. Guame : is one of the Spiral King's Four Supreme Generals, who specialises in ground combat. Guame is the representation of the classical element of earth. His appearance is like that of a crocodile and armadillo and the oldest of the four generals, revealed in the parallel works to be originally an animal-like figure seen by Lordgenome's side as a parallel to Boota, living as long as or almost as long as the Spiral King has. In episode nine, he, along with the two other generals, reported the death of Thymilph to the Spiral King. He gives off the impression of one with a perverted mind and showed why when he made snide comments about the relationship between Thymilph and Adiane. Guame appears to merely respect the Spiral King, unlike the other Beastmen, who worship him as a god. When questioned by Cytomander after he boldly asked the king to let him go after Team Dai-Gurren, Guame explains his relation to King of being ages old (he later referred to Cytomander as a \\"pup of two-hundred-years age\\", implying that he is significantly older than Cytomander, enough for 200 years to seem like nothing). Succeeding in capturing the Dai-Gurren's crew, Guame had Nia brought to him and reveals to her the truth he thought on why she was abandoned while attempting to offer to spare her life if she accepts to be leader of the \\"Beauty Village\\" where the Spiral King gets his consorts from. But Nia refused and Guame was forced to retreat when Team Dai-Gurren escaped and fought back. A month after that, on the 6th day of Team Dai-Gurren's assault on Tepplin, Guame joins Cytomander in a two-pronged attack with both their battleships. After the Dai-Gunten is sunk, Guame uses Teppelin's power supply to have the Dai-Gundo create a massive tornado, in order to destroy Team Dai-Gurren and their reinforcements, but his plans are ruined when the Gurren-Lagann tunnels underneath the fortress to impale it with its drill, running Guame through in the process as the Dai-Gundo explodes. It is revealed in the Parallel Works 8 video that Guame was once Lord Genome's animal companion, fulfilling a role similar to Boota. Guame's name is based on the DNA chemical guanine and the elemental Gnome. His Gunmen, Gember, is based on the mythical Black Tortoise, Genbu. Lordgenome Personal Gunmen: *Lazengann *Dekabutsu *Unnamed Daigun, later named Arc-Gurren by Rossiu (flashbacks; Parallel Works 8) *Cathedral Terra (flashbacks; Parallel Works 8) is the main antagonist of the first story arc. He is known as the \\"Spiral King\\", a cruel and ruthless tyrant who has employed the Beastmen to systemically eradicate all humankind on the planet's surface for over a thousand years. He commands his armies from Teppelin, a gigantic funnel-shaped fortress which is actually a massive gunman in hibernation. He is typically a very somber character, but can throw himself into a frenzy during a battle, displaying superhuman feats of strength, agility, and endurance, to the point where he can easily hold his own against Lagann. In the past, Lordgenome was a child with an affinity toward animals, until he found a gunman similar to Lagann and battled the Anti-Spirals when they invaded his world. He became one of the four distinguished Spiral Generals, who commanded legions of Spiral Warriors charged with ensuring peace and order throughout the Milky Way Galaxy. The battle eventually became hopeless as their numbers dwindled, and the Anti-Spirals finally appeared directly to Lordgenome, spiritually and mentally breaking him by killing everyone on board the Cathedral Terra before using Lazengann to transform Cathedral Terra into Cathedral Lazengann and wipe out his entire fleet. Soon after, the Cathedral Terra was converted by the Anti-Spirals into a defense mechanism, and Lordgenome used his Beastmen in an effort to drive the population underground and keep them to a bare minimum. He also created \\"Beauty Village,\\" a village made up of girls abducted from other villages, in order to stop the birth of an Anti-Spiral scout. He had a number of children with the women of the village over the centuries, and he killed all of them after they became self-aware. However, Lordgenome's plans go awry when Team Dai-Gurren is formed, and he is eventually forced to fight Gurren Lagann in Lazengann to put an end to the human resistance. Lordgenome is fatally injured by Simon as a result, cryptically prophesying the Anti- Spirals' return before he falls off of Tepellin. Seven years later Lordgenome's brain is recovered by Rossiu, and regenerated into a head that serves as a \\"bio-computer\\" to provide the group access to all of his knowledge. He eventually regains his self-awareness and his personality from before being driven mad, and helps in the fight against the Anti-Spirals, even completely regenerating and sacrificing himself during the final battle so Team Dai-Gurren can win. Lordgenome's name is based on Lord, a feudal superior, and Genome, an organism's hereditary DNA. Anti-Spiral The is the true main antagonist of Tengen Toppa Gurren-Lagann, and the main antagonist of the second story arc. He is both the leader and collective mental manifestation of the , a mysterious group of beings that long ago realized the danger of Spiral Nemesis. In order to combat it, they found the means to halt their own evolution by purging themselves of Spiral Power, trapping themselves in a state of suspended animation as their collective consciousness took form to purge the universe of all Spiral Life.Gainax (2007). Tengen Toppa Gurren-Lagann anime, Episode 27. \\"We Anti-Spirals were once a Spiral race like yourselves. But when we learned that the evolution of Spiral Power would lead to the destruction of the universe, we annihilated all those who possessed the power of the Spiral, and drove the few surviving life forms to the far corners of the universe. We halted our own evolution and locked ourselves away into this isolated dimension! On our homeworld we sealed away our bodies and any hope of evolution! This form is the symbol of our determination!\\". He first appears as a disembodied voice in episode twenty four, but is formally introduced in episode twenty six. His physical form is a chaos of arbitrary human concepts fluctuating on a black silhouette, with cartoonish gestures and exaggerated expressions. His near-infinite spiral energy gives the Anti-Spiral extensive, almost supernatural powers, which manifest in the form of purple energy. With these abilities, he is able to manipulate or even break physical and chemical laws (going as far as altering probability), which he does regularly both offensively and as a form of intimidation. The Anti-Spiral has the mannerisms of a scientist, suggesting he had a hand in both the creation of Anti-Spiral technology and the decision to undergo the millennia-long battle against the universe's spiral beings.Gainax (2007). Tengen Toppa Gurren-Lagann anime, Episode 26. \\"It wouldn't be appropriate to do an incomplete analysis\\". The Anti-Spiral is very proud and holds deep contempt for Spiral beings, frustrated that in spite of his efforts, there are Spiral beings who still resist the limiting of their populations and continue to defy the resolution of his race and their ideology. The Anti-Spiral is depicted as being omniscient and omnipresent on a multiversal level, having complete control over every dimension Team Dai- Gurren encounters, having knowledge of everything they are doing, and at one point trapping them in a Multiverse Labyrinth of \\"infinite possibilities\\". Thousands of years before the events in Tengen Toppa Gurren-Lagann take place, the Anti-Spiral defeated Lordgenome's army of Spiral warriors, and overwhelmed Lordgenome's mind by explaining the nature of Spiral Nemesis to him, causing him to accept the Anti-Spiral's conditions for allowing the continuation of the human race. These were the instillation of an Anti-Spiral factor within humanity's genetic code that would activate once Earth reached Spiral Energy Level 2, with the total human population at one million, converting its one host into an Anti-Spiral \\"virtual program\\" that would carry out the mission to end all life on Earth in order to prevent Spiral Nemesis. When this failsafe eventually occurs, Nia becomes the Anti-Spirals' messenger, executing the \\"Human Extermination System\\", which is soon revealed to be the moon itself, spiraling out of its orbit to collide with the planet and kill all life upon it. Simon stops the collision by activating the moon, revealing the gigantic battleship Cathedral Terra, and Nia, having recovered part of her former self, states that the battle is far from over: mankind's survival of the Extermination has fated it to face the true might of the Anti-Spiral. Team Dai-Gurren gain possession of the Cathedral Terra and rename it to the Super Galaxy Dai-Gurren, and use its systems to pinpoint Nia's whereabouts via Simon's deep connection with her in order to battle the Anti-Spiral at the source. However, before their arrival, the Anti-Spiral sets a decoy signal between the 10th and 11th dimensions to lure them into the Galactic Spiral Abyss, which they barely escape thanks to the sacrifice of Kittan. But once overcoming the Anti Spiral's second trap, Team Dai-Gurren rescues Nia and defeats the Anti-Spirals, with their avatar \\"killed\\" by Simon. In the series, Simon achieves this with help from Nia in Lagann while in the movie, Simon fights the Anti-Spiral before using his own blood to create a drill to land the killing blow. The Anti-Spiral refuses to accept that his race was wrong to restrict spiral energy, but with his last breath, he asks Simon if Earth will now assume the responsibility of protecting the universe. ==Secondary characters== Team Gurren/Team Dai-Gurren Team Gurren was first created by Kamina in Giha Village. However, at that time, it was made up of a few boys from the village, as well as Simon and Kamina, who tried various attempts at getting to the surface. After a failed attempt to reach the surface, the other three boys blamed Kamina for the incident to avoid punishment, which resulted in Kamina disowning them from Team Gurren. Simon and Kamina (accompanied by Yoko) later reached the surface, and traveled to Littner Village. There, Kamina stole a Gunmen from a Beastmen, and left to find the Gunmen base, along with Yoko and Leeron as the newest members of Team Gurren. Along the way, Team Gurren met the Black Siblings, but they refused to join. Later on, Rossiu, Gimmy and Darry from Aday Village joined Team Gurren, and it made its way to a local hot springs resort. There, the Team Gurren met the female members of the Black Siblings once again. The resort turned out to be a Beastmen-run Gunmen, and so the Black Siblings and Team Gurren worked together to defeat them, acquiring the mysterious Old Coco as a new member during the chaos. After the incident, Viral and the Dai-Gunzan met Team Gurren and Gurren Lagann fought the fortress Gunmen. Simon and Kamina were almost defeated by the Dai-Gunzan, but were rescued by Dayakka in his personalized Gunmen. The rest of Team Gurren were rescued from a group of Gunmen by Kittan, the eldest Black Siblings, who also had a custom Gunmen. Simon was able to trick the Dai-Gunzan and collapse it into the bottom of a gorge, and returned to find that people had heard of Kamina stealing a Gunmen, copied him, and assembled to join Team Gurren, now renamed Team Dai-Gurren due to their abundance of new members. They later managed to steal the Dai-Gunzan, at the price of Kamina's death, and it became the new base of operations for the team. Led by Simon, they decided to go to Teppelin and defeat the Spiral King. From that point on, many others have joined Team Dai-Gurren, including Nia, and a large force of humans, who saw Simon's success in defeating Divine General Guame, joined their offensive against Teppelin. The symbol of Team Dai-Gurren is a flaming red skull with Kamina's signature red sunglasses. However, after the timeskip, most members wear a simple 5-pointed star, as they have become key members of the Earth's new government. High-ranked members wear two stars in their chest, and Simon, being the commander-in-chief, wears three. Rossiu also wears a large one on his back in the epilogue shaped similar to Simon's glasses; it could be an indicator of rank (he's president) or possibly the government's official logo. Dayakka Littner : Personal Gunmen: *Dayakkaiser *Tengen Toppa Dai-Gurren (movie only) is the former leader of Littner Village, abandoning his post, when most of Littner joined Team Dai-Gurren. His Gunmen is the Dayakkaiser, but after the seizure of Dai-Gunzan, he acted as the captain of Dai-Gurren during battles, while Kiyoh piloted the Dayakkaiser in his stead. After the timeskip, we discover that Dayakka is appointed the Minister of Food Affairs for Kamina City, and he and Kiyoh have married and expecting a child. With the threat of the Anti-Spirals, Dayakka resigns his post and returns to his duties in Team Dai-Gurren. Gimmy Adai : Personal Gunmen: *Grapearl (Blue) *Space Grapearl (Blue) *Tengen Toppa Grapearl (movie only) *Gurren Lagann (epilogue) is a boy from Aday Village, who used to be cared for by Rossiu. His name seems to be similar to the Japanese word for 'right' (右 migi). When three new children were born into the village, the population exceeded its limit of 50, which mandated that two people be removed and sent to the surface. Since Gimmy and Darry had no parents, the village elder chose them to leave the village, however, Rossiu decided to go with them. The pair of twins have a very good bond with each other, and were often left to their own devices around Dai-Gurren, except when they were with older girls, such as Yoko or Nia. After the timeskip, Gimmy and Darry become important Grapearl pilots, often fighting together. Gimmy tends to be more impulsive and reckless, which sometimes puts the duo in trouble. Throughout the series, he's shown to fear Leeron, running in terror in the first portion, and later to continue to distance himself at the first sign of Leeron's \\"flirtation\\". After Nia vanished, Simon hands down Lagann's Core Drill to Gimmy and in the epilogue, he is seen alongside Darry, not only as commanders of the Grapearl squad, but as the new pilots of Gurren Lagann. Darry Adai : Personal Gunmen: *Grapearl (Pink) *Space Grapearl (Pink) *Tengen Toppa Grapearl (movie only) *Gurren Lagann (epilogue) is a girl from Aday Village, who used to be cared for by Rossiu. She is Gimmy's twin sister and has a good bond with him. Her name seems to be similar to the Japanese word for 'left' (左 hidari). As a young girl, she was shy and quiet and used to cling to a plush doll, which she carried with her at all times. After the timeskip, however, she is much more confident and has left her old personality behind. As a Grapearl pilot, she is careful, calm and perceptive, and puts more thought and planning into her actions than Gimmy. In the epilogue, she is seen alongside Gimmy, not only as commanders of the Grapearl squad, but as the new pilots of Gurren Lagann. Kiyoh Bachika : Personal Gunmen: *Dayakkaiser (anime only) (born ) is the oldest of Kittan’s younger sisters. In episode six, when fighting her way out of an enemy Gunmen, she is shown to possess good combat ability. She was helping out in Dai-Gurren's control room until episode 13, when she starts aiding in the frontlines, piloting Dayakka's Dayakkaiser Gunmen, which she begins to use when Dayakka begins to command aboard Dai-Gurren. In the Parallel Work \\"Kittan Zero\\" she is shown wielding two yoyo like weapons. After the timeskip, we discover that Kiyoh and Dayakka have married, and Kiyoh gives birth to a daughter, whom she names Anne. Anne happens to be the newborn that makes the human population reach one million, and as soon as she is born, the Human Extermination System begins. In the manga she, Kittan, and her other sisters appear earlier in the story (during Team Gurren's time in Littner Village) and explains to Simon that their home village, Bachika, was destroyed by Viral. Kinon Bachika : is the second oldest of Kittan’s younger sisters. After Team Dai-Gurren’s capture of Dai-Gunzan, she takes up a position within its control tower, monitoring the radar. She seems to be the calmest and smartest member of the Black Siblings. After the time-skip, she becomes one of Rossiu's main supporters. After Simon offered himself to protect the city using Gurren Lagann, even after being sentenced to death, Kinon volunteered to pilot Gurren and rig herself with bombs inside its cockpit, claiming that she would detonate them, killing her and Simon in the process, in case of him making an attempt to escape. Later, it is revealed that Kinon's resolve to follow Rossiu, despite betraying Simon and ordering his execution, was not only the fruit of her feelings for him, but because she was also witnessing how difficult it was for Rossiu to do it, and the fact that he didn't do it for personal gains, but because the circumstances forced him to it. After stopping Rossiu from committing suicide with Simon's help, she stays on Earth to aid him on the administration of Kamina City, while Simon and rest of Team Dai-Gurren head off to face the Anti-Spirals. Kiyal Bachika : Personal Gunmen: *Kiyalunga is the youngest of the Black Siblings. Just like Kiyoh, she was helping out in Dai- Gurren's control room until episode 13, when she starts aiding in the frontlines piloting a customized Gunmen, Kiyalunga (named after herself), which can transform into a shield and lance that are wielded by Kittan's Gunmen, King Kittan. After the time skip, she lives with Dayakka and Kiyoh. Old Coco : is a mysterious, silent old man who leads Team Gurren to the hot springs resort in episode six. Although he tricks the group into entering the Beastmen's trap, he helps Kamina later on by letting him onto the Beastmen Gunmen. He then gets caught up with Team Dai-Gurren, and now follows it around, although nobody seems to notice him. He seems to be incredibly hard to notice, to the point of saving Nia in episode eleven, and disappearing again before anyone realises he is gone. The timeskip reveals that he is in fact a Beastmen who was in charge of taking care of Nia, and continued to do so after she was no longer the princess of Teppelin. Old Coco's voice is only heard once in the last episode, when he greets Nia after she returns home, and gives her the wedding dress he made. Zorthy Kanai : Personal Gunmen: *Sozoshin *Space Sozoshin *Tengen Toppa Sozoshin (movie only) appears at the end of episode seven as a new addition to Team Dai-Gurren. His most recognisable quality is his smoking habit, which is unique to every other character in the series. The name of his Gunmen is the Sozoshin. Zorthy is killed during the first deep space battle versus the Anti-Spirals. However, in the movie version, his death is avoided. In the epilogue, a memorial site, in the form of a sword, is seen in his honor right alongside Kamina and the other members of Team Dai-Gurren. Iraak Coega : Personal Gunmen: *Ainzer *Space Ainzer *Tengen Toppa Ainzer (movie only) is a member of Team Dai- Gurren. He pilots a Gunmen that serves Yoko as a mobile rifle platform. Together, they assaulted Dai-Gunzan with the rest of the Team Gurren. The name of his Gunmen is Ainzer. Iraak is killed during the first deep space battle versus the Anti-Spirals, after he and Kidd attempted to avenge Zorthy. In the Manga, he and Kidd are a duo calling themselves \\"The Whirlwind brothers\\". In Gurren Gakuhen he was one of Kittan's Gang. In the epilogue, a memorial site, in the form of a sword, is seen in his honor right alongside Kamina and the other members of Team Dai-Gurren. However, in the movie version, his death is avoided. Kidd Coega : Personal Gunmen: *Kidd Knuckle *Space Kidd Knuckle *Tengen Toppa Kidd Knuckle (movie only) is another new member of Team Dai-Gurren. His Gunmen utilizes two pistols to attack enemies, the Kid Knuckle. Kid is killed during the first deep space battle versus the Anti- Spirals, when he and Iraak attempt to avenge Zorthy's death. However, in the movie version, his death is avoided. Kid's post-timeskip design bears a striking resemblance to Lupin III. In the epilogue, a memorial site, in the form of a sword, is seen in his honor right alongside Kamina and the other members of Team Dai-Gurren. In the Manga, he and his brother Ailaac form the \\"Whirlwind Brothers\\", also called \\"Tornadoe Brothers\\" by Kamina. He is one of the Bancho in Kittans gang in Gurren Gakuhen. Jorgun and Balinbow Bakusa :Balinbow :Jorgun Personal Gunmen: *Twin Boukun *Space Twin Boukun *Tengen Toppa Twin Boukun (movie only) and are the towering, twin brothers of Team Dai-Gurren, piloting the two-faced Gunmen, Twin Boukun. The two are always hyped and normally speak in manly grunts and monosyllabic phrases. They sport differently coloured sunglasses, which can be used to tell one brother from the other—Jorgun wears red shades, while Balinbow sports blue ones. After the timeskip, the two were appointed Directors of the Public Affairs Department, in which they were responsible for the human population count. Jorgun and Balinbow are killed in the first deep space battle versus the Anti- Spirals, after saving Gimmy and Darry's lives. However, in the movie version, both of them survived while the above event of their deaths did not happen. In the epilogue, a memorial site, in the form of a sword, is seen in their honor right alongside Kamina and the other members of Team Dai-Gurren. Makken Jokin : Personal Gunmen: *Moshogun *Space Moshogun *Tengen Toppa Moshogun (movie only) is a fairly silent man who is an important part of Team Dai- Gurren, but has rarely spoken or gotten much screen time whatsoever. He has his own Gunmen, Moshogun, which is based on an ancient samurai. After the timeskip, Makken is married to Leite with three children. Sadly, he is killed in the first deep space battle versus the Anti-Spirals, after sacrificing himself to stop a large Anti-Spiral missile from destroying the Super Galaxy Dai-Gurren. In the epilogue, a memorial site, in the form of a sword, is seen in his honor right alongside Kamina and the other members of Team Dai-Gurren. However, in the movie version, his death is avoided. Attenborough Cortitch : is a hyperactive, impulsive, trigger-happy man, who is the gunner of Dai-Gurren's control team. He tends to fire at enemies or move Dai- Gurren without warning. This is humorously employed by Attenborogh hammering the fire buttons repeatedly, screaming at the top of his lungs (\\"FIRE!\\" or \\"FIRE EVERYTHING!\\" normally). After the timeskip, he joins Leeron's science team and still appears to have his hyperactive nature. After Team Dai-Gurren moved to Super Galaxy Dai-Gurren, he assumed the same position he had before at the weapons control. Curiously, this trait became one of Tengen Toppa Gurren-Lagann's attacks. It was discovered that he joined Team Dai-Gurren by having \\"snuck into some bozo's luggage\\". Tetsukan Littner : is a member of the control team for Dai-Gurren. He is in charge of monitoring the condition of the ship. After the timeskip, he becomes a part of Leeron's science team. Also due to being attracted to the fast-food restaurants that were built in the new city he became obese. In the \\"alternate universe\\" scenes in Episode 26, Tetsukan is seen sleeping in a bed with Cybela, implying that the two are involved in a relationship, or that one (or both) of them desire to be. In the epilogue, he is seen working under Viral's command alongside Cybela. Gabal Docker : is Team Dai-Gurren's helmsman, in charge of Dai-Gurren's steering and maneuvering. Leite Jokin is the chief engineer of Team Dai-Gurren and Leeron's direct subordinate. She is a skilled and ingenious mechanic, an ideal work partner for the naturally gifted Leeron. Her central duties revolve around maintaining Dai-Gurren's spiral engine, which appears less technologically sophisticated in Fortress-class Gunmen thus requiring additional fuel beyond spiral energy.Gainax (2007). Tengen Toppa Gurren-Lagann anime, Episode 14. Shot of objects being shuffled into the engine. Her personal trademarks are her lab coat and a cigarette she holds in her mouth. In Part III, Leite's role in the story is expanded from a virtual background character to an important member of the supporting cast. She is married to Makken, who she affectionately calls \\"Oto-chan\\" or \\"Daddy\\", and the two have three children. Leite and Makken operate a small business servicing mechanical equipment and automotive vehicles, though on occasion they get contracts to develop weapons from the New Government. She and Makken have great faith in Simon and his capacity as a decision maker; their loyalty to him urges them to resist Rossiu by rebuilding the scrapped Gunmen of Team Dai- Gurren, refitting them with spiral weaponry capable of damaging Mugann.Gainax (2007). Tengen Toppa Gurren-Lagann anime, Episode 20. \\"We developed this barrier bullet from a government contract\\".Gainax (2007). Tengen Toppa Gurren- Lagann anime, Episode 20. \\"We repaired 'em.\\". Leite also refits Gurren Lagann's power pack to allow it to reach escape velocity, but opts out of the Battle of Earth to stay with her children on the surface.Gainax (2007). Tengen Toppa Gurren-Lagann anime, Episode 22. When Team Dai-Gurren is reformed, she assumes her old post as engineer of the gang's flagship, the Super Galaxy Dai- Gurren. She eventually ends up as one of the fourteen pilots of Tengen Toppa Gurren-Lagann, battling Grand Zamboa to both avenge Makken's death at the hands of Anti-Spiral Kantai and for the freedom of the entire galaxy. In Anti- Spiral's parallel world illusion, her desired job appears to be an elementary school teacher, together with Lordgenome as principal. Government Most of Team Dai-Gurren have become part of the government, mostly as heads of departments managing the city, or parts of the military. However, there are some new characters not seen before the timeskip, mainly found in Rossiu's Intelligence team. Guinble Kite , along with Kinon, seems to be one of the more important members of Rossiu's intelligence team. He and Kinon often accompany Rossiu, and stayed with him on Earth to watch out for the city while the rest of Team Dai-Gurren headed into space for their final battle against the Anti-Spirals. Cybela Coutaud is mainly seen at a computer, where she can communicate with Grapearls or do analysis tasks. Later, she joins Team Dai-Gurren, assuming a position at Super Galaxy Dai-Gurren's bridge. In the epilogue, she is seen still working there, now under Viral's command. Her name is an anagram of \\"shirabe\\", which means \\"to search\\". == References == Category:Lists of anime and manga characters ja:天元突破グレンラガンの登場人物#主要人物 ","title":"List of Gurren Lagann characters"},{"id":"12396406","text":"Oreolalax rhodostigmatus (Guizhou lazy toad or red-spotted toothed toad) is a species of amphibian in the family Megophryidae.

He is the founder of Pasmanda Muslim Mahaz, concerned with fighting discrimination against lower- caste and Dalit Muslims. He was a two-time Member of the Parliament of India for Bihar in the Rajya Sabha, representing Janata Dal (United), until his expulsion from the party in September 2017 for opposing the party leadership decision to break from the Mahagathbandan and instead partner with BJP. ==Early life and journalism career== Anwar was born in 1954 into a weaver family in Dumraon, Bihar. His father was a mill worker, involved in trade union activism via the Communist Party of India affiliated All India Trade Union Congress. This influenced Anwar into becoming involved in leftist politics as a high-school student and became a card-carrying member of the CPI. Anwar became the chief reporter for CPI's Hindi newspaper, Janashakti, seeking to document and publicize the state of the poor under feudalism and the fight against caste and class oppression. Anwar, however became disillusioned with Communism as he felt it was also dominated by upper caste leaders who were themselves prone to casteism. In his view, CPI's focusing solely on class and ignoring caste perpetuates caste-based hierarchy. He stopped being a member of CPI after 20 years. He continued his journalism work with Navbharat Times, Jansatta and then Swatantra Bharat, still focusing on caste oppression amongst both Hindus and Muslims. He broke stories on how there were separate barracks and kitchens for Police officers of different castes in Patna and how people of upper castes would receive fake Backward Caste certificates to obtain government jobs. In 1996, Anwar won the KK Birla Foundation fellowship for journalism to study the lives of Dalit and backward caste Muslims in Bihar. This reporting led to a book titled Masavat ki Jang (Fight for Equality) == Pasmanda activism== In 1998, Anwar formed the Pasmanda Muslim Mahaz (PMM) to serve as an umbrella organization fighting to deliver rights to Dalit and backward Muslims. Anwar's argument, as stated in Masavat ki Jang is that Indian Muslims are not a homogenous community and existing organizations only serve upper-caste Muslims. The book details the monopolization by upper-caste 'Ashraf' leaders of civil society organizations such as madrasas and personal law boards, representative institutions (Parliament and State Assemblies) and departments, ministries and institutions that claim to work for Muslims (minority affairs, Waqf boards, Urdu academies, AMU, Jamia Millia Islamia, etc). He also documents the caste-based violence and discrimination against Dalit and backward Pasmanda (Persian for those who have fallen behind) Muslims. Anwar's key demands were - # Reservation in government jobs and educational institutions to enable the rise of an educated leadership # Inclusion of Dalit Muslims and Christians in the list of Scheduled Castes as was done for Sikh and Neo-Buddhist Dalits in 1950, to allow these groups to fight elections in reserved constituencies # Social reform initiatives to encourage inter-caste marriages. In the 1990s and early 2000s, Muslims in Bihar had electorally consolidated behind Laloo Prasad Yadav's Rashtriya Janata Dal. In the lead up to the 2005 legislative elections, Anwar's PMM and other Pasmanda leaders heavily criticized Laloo's tenure and the lack of progress made by Pasmanda muslims therein. Anwar threw his support behind Nitish Kumar's JD(U)-BJP alliance. and helped Kumar and his alliance to victory. In power, Kumar implemented policies reserving seats in local bodies as well as educational scholarships for backward Muslims. This This helped breach Yadav's hold on Muslim voters and drove a portion of the Muslim voter base to Kumar. Anwar's endorsement of Nitish Kumar and drew heavy criticism from Muslim organizations including from within the Pasmanda Muslim Mahaz because of Kumar's alliance with the Hindu-nationalist BJP. Anwar defended his decision by stating Kumar was not a Hindu nationalist. Organizations similar to PMM in other states like Maharashtra have increasingly focused on social and economic improvement among backward Muslims with initiatives to address landlessness, lack of education, poverty, and unemployment. PMM has continued to focus on political goals such as reservations. This has attracted criticism as reservations only benefit urban educated people, whereas the large majority of Pasmanda Muslims in Bihar and rural, landless and uneducated. ==Political career== Anwar was elected to the Rajya Sabha as a member of Janata Dal (United) and served two terms until his expulsion from the party in September 2017. He was suspended from his party for attending a meeting of opposition parties called by Indian National Congress President Sonia Gandhi. As a result, he was expelled from Rajya Sabha. Anwar had strongly opposed the party leadership decision to break from the Mahagathbandan and instead partner with BJP. Later he became the founding member of Loktantrik Janata Dal along with Sharad Yadav parting ways from Janata Dal (United), due to its alliance with Bharatiya Janata Party in Bihar.Newly-launched LJD calls Oppn parties to unite against BJP ==ReferencesExternal links== * Profile on Rajya Sabha website Category:Indian Muslims Category:Janata Dal politicians Category:Loktantrik Janata Dal politicians Category:Janata Dal (United) politicians Category:Rajya Sabha members from Bihar Category:1954 births Category:Living people ","title":"Ali Anwar"},{"id":"12396481","text":"Scutiger pingwuensis is a species of toad in the family Megophryidae known commonly as the Pingwu lazy toad and the Pingwu alpine toad.Frost, D.

It is located in north industrial zone of Ashdod near the mouth of the Lakhish River, close to the port of Ashdod and the Ashdod Oil Refineries which provided the plant with fuel oil prior to its conversion to use natural gas. The power station is also close to the sea since its cooling system uses sea water. Like other significant power stations in Israel, Eshkol Power Station belongs to Israel Electric Corporation. It is the third biggest power plant in Israel in terms of production ability, providing 7.3 percent of electricity production by IEC. The power station was named after Levi Eshkol, former Prime Minister of Israel. ==History== In 1953, following an Israeli Government decision, surveyors and designers arrived at the desolate dunes to choose a site to build a new power station in the south of the country. Its builders lived in the regional settlements Rehovot and Gedera. The building of the Eshkol power station was completed in 1958 and included 3 units: 2 units of 50 MW, and one unit of 45 MW. Between 1975 and 1977 a total of four 228 MW fuel oil driven thermal generation units in two blocks came online, making the station Israel’s largest power plant at the time. These were converted in 2004 to dual fuel operation using natural gas. At the same time two combined-cycle natural gas turbines were also added to the site with a total capacity of 770 MW. == Electricity generation == Eshkol Power Station in 1963 Originally steam only, today Eshkol is multi unit power station.

Hitotsubashi ICS was the first \\"professional graduate school\\" (formerly \\"specialized graduate school\\") established in Japan. The school was founded by Harvard Business School professor Hirotaka Takeuchi, its first dean, in 1998, and admitted students in 2000. ICS is housed in the National Center of Sciences and located at Chiyoda Campus, the birthplace of Hitotsubashi University, Chiyoda, Tokyo. ==Programs== With the aim to become a Center for Excellence, Business education at Hitotsubashi ICS is committed to develop global leaders. Hitotsubashi ICS has three programs: International Business Strategy (MBA and DBA), and an EMBA.  MBA Program The first full-time MBA program offered by a Japanese national university taught entirely in English. Students can apply for either a one year program or a two year program. Hitotsubashi ICS' students have access to Japan's real business network, as well as to the Global Network for Advanced Management. Hitotsubashi ICS was recently ranked as the No. 1 Business School in Japan by QS Rankings. EMBA Program the EMBA is 1-year, all-English language, part-time program with blended learning, combining online and in classroom sessions. Students of the EMBA program have access to Hitotsubashi ICS' local and global networks to explore both the strengths and weaknesses of the Japanese and the Western management practices. The EMBA class also takes three one-week immersion trips outside Japan to experience the world’s diversity of business opportunities, in emerging economies, for example, or driven by technological disruption.http://www.nikkei.com/article/DGKKASDZ23HGW_R30C16A8MM0000/  DBA Program The school offers a flexible DBA degree, which is completed over three years or more and can be done while working.  == Teaching Staff == * Ikujiro Nonaka (Professor Emeritus) * Hirotaka Takeuchi (Founding Dean) * Kazuo Ichijo (Dean) * Ryuji Yasuda * Sherman Abe * Saburo Kobayashi * Norihiko Shimizu * Hiroshi Ono * James Kondo * Shingo Oue * Tish Robinson * Kangyong Sun * Jesper Edman * Kentaro Koga * Michael Korver * Hiroshi Kanno * Emi Osono * Erica Okada * Tomonori Ito * Ken Kusunoki * Takashi Nawa * Yoshinori Fujikawa * Satoshi Akutsu ==Porter Prize== The Porter Prize was established to bestow recognition on Japanese companies that have achieved and maintained superior profitability in a particular industry by implementing unique strategies based on innovations in products, processes, and ways of managing. The name of the award is derived from Professor Michael E. Porter of Harvard University, a leading authority on strategy with a longstanding interest in Japan. Professor Porter's relationship with Hitotsubashi University dates back to the early 1980s, when he conducted joint research on Japan with a Hitotsubashi team as part of a larger study, which was published in Professor Porter's 1990 book, \\"The Competitive Advantage of Nations\\". Professor Porter's book, \\"Can Japan Compete?\\", which also involved joint research with Hitotsubashi, challenges long-held views about the sources of Japan's economic miracle and offers a new approach to competing based on strategy as the path for the future. The book, which was selected as one of the top three non- fiction books of 2000 by The Economist, was co-authored by Hirotaka Takeuchi of Hitotsubashi University. Professor Porter has had a relationship with Hitotsubashi University for almost 20 years. He was invited to be the keynote speaker at the opening ceremony of its newly established Graduate School of International Corporate Strategy (ICS) in 2000. The Professor made two trips to Tokyo on behalf of Hitotsubashi University that year, once in April at the opening of ICS' evening programs taught in Japanese and in October at the opening of its day-time programs taught entirely in English. Professor Porter has donated his time for these speeches and for many other joint efforts over the years. The Graduate School of International Corporate Strategy at Hitotsubashi University proposed to establish a new prize in appreciation of Professor Porter's generosity and in support of his lifelong dedication to the development of the theory and practice of competitive strategy. ==Alliances and Partnerships== BEST Alliance Hitotsubashi ICS is one of the three founding member institutions of the BEST Alliance program (BEST = BEijing, Seoul, Tokyo), which is sponsored by the governments of China, South Korea and Japan to encourage trilateral exchange of students and increased cooperation in higher education in East Asia. The BEST Alliance grant will support activities associated with the BEST Business School Alliance between Hitotsubashi ICS, Peking University’s Guanghua School of Management and Seoul National University’s Graduate School of Business. The students who participate in the double degree program will spend their 1st year in their home institution, and 2nd year in the host institution (6 months in the case of SNU). Upon completion, the students will receive an MBA degree from both institutions. Global Network for Advanced Management Hitotsubashi ICS is a member of the Global Network for Advanced Management (GNAM), which is a collaboration of graduate schools of business that seeks to foster intellectual ties among business schools, students and deans.

The species ranges from east Africa to Japan, inhabiting much if the southern Asian and Indonesian coastlines. Its morphology is very similar to other species within the genus Sillago, with a long, compressed body and silvery overall colour. It can be distinguished from its relatives by colour patterns and particularly swim bladder morphology, which helps define most species of Sillago. S aeolus is a benthic predator, consuming a variety of crustaceans and polychaetes. As with most members of the smelt whiting family, it is important to small coastal fisheries in various areas of its range. ==Taxonomy and naming== The oriental trumpeter whiting is one of 29 species in the genus Sillago, which is one of three divisions of the smelt whiting family Sillaginidae. The smelt- whitings are Perciformes in the suborder Percoidei. The oriental trumpeter whiting was first officially identified and named Sillago aeolus by Jordan and Evermann in 1902 from the holotype collected in Taiwan, after a number of taxonomists had misidentified the species as Sillago macrolepis (Bleeker) or Sillago maculata (Quoy & Gaimard, 1824). S. aeolus has a number of common names in different countries, with the most common, oriental trumpeter whiting derived from the fact the species has a similar colour and pattern to the Trumpeter whiting, Sillago maculata. Other names commonly applied to S. aeolus include Hoshi-gisu (Japan), Ebi (Malaysia), Oso-so (Philippines) and 'Asuhos'. ==Description== As with most of the genus Sillago, the oriental trumpeter whiting has a slightly compressed, elongate body tapering toward the terminal mouth, reaching a maximum overall length of 30 cm. The body is covered in small ctenoid scales extending to the cheek and head. The first dorsal fin has 11 spines and the second dorsal fin has 1 leading spine with 18 to 20 soft rays posterior. The anal fin is similar to the second dorsal fin, but has 2 spines with 17 to 19 (usually 18) soft rays posterior to the spines. Other distinguishing features include 67 to 72 lateral line scales and a total of 34 vertebrae. Swim bladder morphology is the most effective way to distinguish it between related species S. maculata and S. burrus. The swim bladder has three anterolateral extensions; not four and it differs from S. maculata in lacking well developed anterolateral extensions reaching to the level of the vent. The colour of the oriental trumpeter whiting is similar to both S. burrus and S. maculata, having blotches that are like oblique bars, but the most posterior mid-lateral dark brown blotch is elongate and reaches caudal flexure. The blotches are not connected as in S. maculata. The belly is silvery to grey coloured. ==Distribution and habitat== The oriental trumpeter whiting has a wide distribution, inhabiting many areas of the Indo-Pacific region. The westernmost sighting of the species was in Delagoa Bay, South Africa, with its range extending up the east African coast and to the West Indies, but it has never been recorded near the Indian mainland. The species is most prolific in the South East Asian region, with positive identifications from Singapore, Hong Kong, Philippines, Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia, Taiwan and up to Japan. S. aeolus has also never been recorded in New Guinea or Australia. The habitat of the oriental trumpeter whiting is largely unknown, but it's known to live in inshore coastal waters, commonly in embayments on silty bottoms in water depths from 0 - 60m depth. Juveniles often enter the surf zone of beaches, mixing with juveniles from other species of Sillago. ==Biology== The diet of S. aeolus changes as the fish progresses from a juvenile to an adult. Juveniles primarily eat small zooplankton, such as calanoid copepods while adults tend to consume larger benthic prey, such as polychaetes, shrimps, and crabs. Examination of the gut of adults has shown the latter three items were the most important prey, together constituting more than 70% of stomach contents by volume. There does not appear to be any seasonal shift in diet in either juveniles or adults of the species. Oriental trumpeter whiting are reproductively mature at around 130mm in 50% of fish, with the minimum a length of 113mm in males and 109mm in females. They are multiple spawners, that spawn continuously throughout the year with peaks in reproduction that appear to vary geographically. Studies in Thailand indicate the peak is between July and December, while studies in Japan show a peak in February to May. Otolith studies show both females and males attained 60% and 91% of individuals at maturity respectively at the end of their first year of life. The attainment of large size by the end of the first year of life is of considerable advantage, since many individuals do not survive until the end of their second year. ==Relationship to humans== Throughout the oriental trumpeter whiting's range, it is often caught in trawls and is of minor importance to local fisheries. The flesh spoils easily and is not as highly rated as other sillaginids. It is a commercial fish in Southern Japan, where most of the fish are caught by gill net for local consumption. As opposed to most areas, the species is well known for its delicate texture in Japan. ==ReferencesExternal links== *S. aeolus at Fishbase Category:Sillago Category:Fish described in 1902 ","title":"Oriental trumpeter whiting"},{"id":"12396814","text":"Sérgio Rodrigo Penteado Dias known as Serginho (little Sérgio) (born 25 September 1980), is a Brazilian footballer who (as of April 2011) plays for Volta Redonda as a right back. ==Biography== Born in Campinas, São Paulo state, Serginho spent most of his career in Brazilian state leagues, especially inside São Paulo state.

He is a former federal chairman of the Family First Party. Before entering politics, he worked in the housing industry, owning several businesses, and at one stage serving as president of the Housing Industry Association. Day was the Liberal Party of Australia candidate for the federal seat of Makin at the 2007 election and planned to be the Liberal candidate at the 2008 Mayo by-election but failed to gain preselection which resulted in his resignation from the Liberals. Day immediately joined the Family First Party and was their candidate for the by-election and their first Senate candidate on the South Australian ticket at the 2010 election and 2013 election. On his fourth attempt to enter federal parliament in 2013, Day was elected to the Senate from a 3.8 per cent primary vote for the South Australian Family First Party and took office on 1 July 2014.Family First wins Senate spot in SA – NineMSN. Retrieved 19 May 2014. Despite a further decline in the Family First South Australian Senate vote to 2.9 per cent he was re- elected at the 2016 double dissolution election. Elected to the 12th and final South Australian Senate spot, Day's term was due to expire on 30 June 2019. Following the liquidation of Home Australia Group, Day announced his intention to resign from the Senate. However, he stated that a potential new investor had expressed interest in the business, that there was too much important work for the Family First Senate seat to be vacant for even one day and that therefore he would not resign before the year's end. However, Day resigned on 1 November 2016 after stating that the investor had backed out. On 5 April 2017 the High Court held that Day's re-election to the Senate in July 2016 was invalid, since he'd had an \\"indirect pecuniary interest\\" in an agreement with the Commonwealth since at least February 2016. As a result, he had not been eligible to sit as a Senator from at least February 2016 onward by reason of section 44(v) of the Constitution..Re Day [No 2]: ==Early life== Day was born in Manchester, UK, on 5 July 1952. He came to Australia as a child in 1963. Day attended Gilles Plains High School and the University of South Australia. ==Career== Day's career started in the South Australian public service at the Materials and Research Laboratories of the former Highways Department, now part of the Department of Planning, Transport and Infrastructure. He qualified as a science technician after studying at the SA Institute of Technology (now UniSA). After six years he resigned and started in the building industry. He was a founder of Homestead Homes and Home Australia, which now also owns Collier Homes in Western Australia, Newstart Homes in Queensland, Ashford Homes in Victoria and Huxley Homes in New South Wales. These are all major constructors of new houses in their respective states. He is the founder of Oz Homes Foundation, and is managing director of Home Australia.Loyal Lib quits over Mayo: The Australian 28/7/2008 article by Jamie Walker in The Australian 28 July 2008, accessed 17 September 2010 Day's business activities have made him a millionaire. Both Huxley Homes and Day himself have been fined for not complying with rectification orders. Huxley Homes has built many thousands of homes in NSW however twenty-five customers claimed they were in dispute with Huxley Homes and were taking legal action against the company for substandard or unfinished work. Huxley Homes denied the allegations saying they would vigorously defend any legal action. Day is the sole director of Ashford Homes, which is also facing action over unpaid money to creditors. In September 2016, The Australian newspaper raised concerns of how Day contributed $380,000 to Family First in 2012–13 while his businesses appeared to be facing financial difficulties. He is a past president of the Housing Industry Association, the trade association which represents the residential housing industry in Australia. Day was the long-time secretary of the New Right-influenced\\"New Right or Old Wrong?

Nicholls Society and a founder of Independent Contractors of Australia (ICA) – a front group campaigning for labour market deregulation in Australia. According to John Stone of the H. R. Nicholls Society, \\"one of the most active members of that Association (ICA), Mr Bob Day, has been a member of the [H.R. Nicholls] Society's Board of Management almost from the outset. I do not think he will contradict me if I say that he has taken the ethos of the Society into the work of the Association.\\" Day was also a former board member of the Centre for Independent Studies – a libertarian Australian think tank. Day was appointed an Officer of the Order of Australia for service to the housing industry and to social welfare, on Australia Day 2003. Day is a board member of the North East Development Agency, having been president for almost a decade, and of North East Vocational College in Adelaide. In his community service role, Day has planted several thousand trees for farmers and land owners across South Australia. He undertook a roadside planting, irrigation and re-vegetation program along North East Road including a local school. Day was elected federal chairman of the Family First Party in 2008. On the day of Senator Cory Bernardi's resignation from the Liberal Party to form a new party, Day confirmed that he was collaborating with Bernardi but would not say whether he would join the new party; Family First stated that Day had resigned from its executive and believed that he had left the party. Day formally filed bankruptcy papers and was declared bankrupt in April 2017. He was discharged from bankruptcy on 3 July 2020 [AFSA Registry]. ==Election candidacies== 2007 federal election Upon the resignation of incumbent Trish Draper, Day was preselected as the candidate in the Division of Makin for the Liberal Party of Australia at the 2007 federal election, one of the three marginal seats in South Australia lost to the Australian Labor Party. On a record two- party vote of 57.7 percent to Labor from a record two-party swing of 8.6 percent in Makin at the time, the seat became the safest of the 23 Labor won from the coalition at the election. 2008 Mayo by-election Day decided to run as a Family First Party candidate at the 2008 Mayo by-election but was unsuccessful. He had joined Family First immediately prior to the by-election, after resigning his 20-year membership of the Liberal Party, accusing the party of a \\"manipulated\\" process which saw former Howard government advisor chiefly for WorkChoices, Jamie Briggs, gain Liberal preselection at the expense of others including Day. Although endorsed by former deputy Liberal Leader and former Treasurer Peter Costello, the Liberal preselection process saw Day obtain just 10 of 271 votes. Labor did not contest the safe Liberal seat, and on a two-party vote of 57 percent at the previous election, the Liberals retained the seat in the by-election with 53 percent of the two- candidate vote against the Australian Greens on 47 percent. Family First and Day received 11.4 percent of the primary vote, picking up a swing of 7.4 percent, coming fourth out of eleven candidates, behind the Liberals on 41.3 percent, the Greens on 21.4 percent and independent Diane Bell on 16.3 percent. 2010 federal election Day was first on the South Australian Family First Party ticket for the Australian Senate at the 2010 federal election but was unsuccessful. Previously, the 2007 result (where independent Nick Xenophon polled 15 percent) saw the Family First Party in South Australia suffer a 1.09 percent swing, finishing with a statewide primary vote of 2.89 percent. After preferences, a candidate needs 14.3 percent of the vote (a quota) to gain election. Some commentators claimed Day had a \\"strong chance of taking one of the last two South Australian Senate seats\\", citing \\"effective preferences from nine smaller parties\\". Other commentators rated Day a \\"slim\\" chance, citing campaign and financial troubles with the Family First Party. The 2010 result saw Day and Family First receive a swing of 1.19 percent to finish on 4.08 percent of the vote, compared with the party's lower house vote of 4.96 percent, receiving a swing of 0.91 percent. This was well short of a quota, with Liberal Party former MP David Fawcett projected by the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) to win the last of the six South Australian Senate seats up for election. Progression of the count temporarily gave Day a 512-vote lead, with Day being listed by the ABC as the provisional sixth South Australian Senator. However further progression of the count put Fawcett back in the lead by several thousand votes and went on to win the sixth and final South Australian Senate seat.\\"Senate Results – South Australia\\" 2010 federal election: ABC News, accessed 11 September 2010South Australian Senators have been decided media release Australian Electoral Commission 15 September 2010, accessed 15 September 2010\\"Family First misses out on Senate seat in South Australia\\" The Australian 15 September 2010, accessed 15 September 2010 In the 2009/10 financial year Day made two loans totalling $405,000 to the Family First Party. 2013 federal election Day ran as a Family First Party South Australia Senate candidate at the 2013 federal election and was successful, taking the fifth available South Australian seat. The South Australian Senate Family First vote was 3.8 percent (down 0.3 percent), getting to the 14.3 percent quota from 19 group voting ticket party preferences: Australian Independents Party, Australian Stable Population Party, Liberal Democratic Party, Smokers' Rights Party, No Carbon Tax Climate Sceptics, Building Australia Party, Rise Up Australia Party, Katter's Australian Party, One Nation, Australian Fishing and Lifestyle Party, Australian Christians, Shooters and Fishers, Australian Motoring Enthusiast Party, Democratic Labour Party, Animal Justice Party, Australian Greens, Palmer United Party, HEMP Party, Australian Labor Party.2013 SA Senate results and preference flows: ABC The nationwide Family First Senate vote was 1.1 percent (down 1.0 percent). Day assumed his seat on 1 July 2014. Glenn Druery and the Minor Party Alliance Glenn Druery's Minor Party Alliance was behind the 2013 federal election preference deal successes with candidate elections on 0.2 percent (Sports Party), 0.5 percent (Motoring Enthusiasts Party) and 3.8 percent (Family First Party). Druery was on the payroll of the Shooters and Fishers Party and assisted in organising preference meetings and negotiating preference flows between parties. Druery had also received regular payments from the Family First Party and the Fishing and Lifestyle Party. 2016 federal election As Family First's sole incumbent, Day was successful at the 2016 federal election, despite having unsuccessfully mounted a High Court challenge against newly implemented Senate voting reforms which included the removal of group voting tickets, a feature which was crucial to the election of Day at the previous election. Though the South Australian Senate Family First vote was reduced to just 2.9 percent (down 0.9 percent), as the election was a double dissolution, the quota to be elected was halved. Day got to the 7.7 percent quota largely from Liberal preferences when the Liberal's 5th candidate Sean Edwards was eliminated from the count, largely due to the fact the Liberal how-to-vote card recommended to direct their first preference to Family First. Electing only six Senators per state at a non-double dissolution election, the 12th and last spot in South Australia at this election came down to a race between Day and Labor's 4th candidate Anne McEwen. McEwen solidly led Day for the overwhelming majority of the count, until count 445 of a total 457. However upon Edwards and then One Nation candidate Steven Burgess being eliminated at count 445 and 455 respectively, leaving only McEwen and Day remaining, Day had collected enough preferences to overtake and narrowly defeat McEwen − by a couple of thousand preference votes. The nationwide Family First Senate vote was 1.4 percent (up 0.3 percent). Elected to the 12th and final South Australian Senate spot, Day was elected to a three-year term which was due to expire on 30 June 2019. ==Business Collapse== Liquidation of Home Australia Group On 17 October 2016, administrators McGrathNicol were called in to liquidate the Home Australia Group, a building company founded and managed by Day. The group operated under different names in five states: Homestead Homes in South Australia, Collier Homes in Western Australia, Newstart Homes in Queensland, Ashford Homes in Victoria, and Huxley Homes in New South Wales. At the time of the liquidation, construction was halted on over 200 houses being built by the company. All homes were covered by Home Owners Warranty insurance. Day released a statement on the same day, stating that he had stepped away from the company when elected in 2013, but had returned in 2015 because of what he called \\"poor management decisions\\" in his absence. Seeking to sell the business, or find an equity partner to recapitalise, a contract was signed with a Philippines-based capital resource company to purchase a 75 per cent stake in the group, however the money was not transferred and Day claimed the transfer documents were fraudulent. He also announced his intention to resign from the Senate. In an interview with the ABC, Day said that under the circumstances, it would be \\"untenable to stay in parliament\\". However, Day did not immediately resign on the day of the announcement. This gave Family First time to identify a replacement senator, and meant that Day could vote on contentious legislation such as the Australian Building and Construction Commission bill that had been one of the triggers for the double dissolution in 2016. Day later stated that he would not leave the Senate before year's end as there would not be time to install a replacement senator. On 1 November 2016, Day announced he had tendered his immediate resignation to the President of the Australian Senate. In a statement, Day said \\"while a number of offers for various parts of the Home Australia business have been received, the major investor who has been examining the group's portfolio of assets over the past fortnight, has decided not to proceed. Accordingly, I have today tendered my resignation to the president of the Senate effective immediately. It has been an honour and a privilege to serve as a senator for South Australia and I am sorry it has ended this way.\\" Constitutional validity of election Shortly after Day's resignation, the government announced that it would move in the Senate to refer the validity of Day's election in July 2016 to the High Court. The government believed Day had potentially violated section 44(v) of the Constitution, which provides that a person who \\"has any direct or indirect pecuniary interest in any agreement with the Public Service of the Commonwealth\\" is ineligible to serve in either houseand it follows that they are also ineligible to be nominated for election to either house. The complaint centred around Day's Commonwealth-funded electorate office, which was located in a building formerly owned by Day and leased to the Commonwealth. In 2013, Day sold the building to a trust of which his family's business trust was a beneficiary. The rental payments from the Commonwealth were to be paid into an account controlled by Day. The High Court, sitting as the Court of Disputed Returns, convened a preliminary hearing before Gordon J, whose judgment delivered on 27 January 2017 made numerous findings of fact.Re Day [2017] HCA 2 (Gordon J). The case was heard on 7 February by a full court of the High Court, which delivered its judgment on 5 April. The Court found that, since at least 26 February 2016–the day that the building's owner first directed that the rental payments go to Day's bank account–Day had had an \\"indirect pecuniary interest\\" in an agreement with the Commonwealth, and thus was in violation of section 44(v). At least three judges were prepared to say that the violation dated to 1 December 2015, when the Commonwealth initially entered into a lease agreement with the building's owner. This was despite the fact that Commonwealth public servants advised Finance Minister Mathias Cormann that it was open to him and that it would not be a conflict to make rental payments under the lease from 1 March forward (Hansard 7 November 2016). \\"The issue\\", he said, \\"was not a concern to the department at that point in time”. The High Court, however, found otherwise. It held that Day was ineligible to serve in the Senate as of 26 February 2016, and he was therefore ineligible to nominate for the federal election of 2 July 2016. The Court declared Day's seat vacant and ordered that a special recount of South Australian ballot papers be held in order to determine his replacement. Both Day and the Attorney-General envisaged that Day's replacement would be the other person on the Family First list in that election, Lucy Gichuhi, and the Court agreed. The Australian Labor Party lodged a challenge, claiming that Gichuhi might still be a citizen of Kenya, hence ineligible under Constitution section 44(i) as a citizen of a \\"foreign power\\". On 19 April 2017 a full court of the High Court found that the objection had not been made out and declared Gichuhi elected.The court consisted of Justice Gordon, who had been deputed to approve the recount, and Justice Nettle; two Justices are the minimum necessary to constitute a full court of the High Court: Judiciary Act 1903 (Cth) section 19. In May 2017, Day and the also disqualified Rod Culleton were informed by the Commonwealth Department of Finance and by the Senate that payments received by them and in relation to them when they were sitting although unqualified were a debt to the Commonwealth, which should be repaid. Media estimated Day's debt, for the period between 26 February 2016 and his resignation in November, at nearly $130,000. Special Minister of State Scott Ryan indicated that they could apply for the debts to be waived. Day's application for waiver was accepted. Family First legacy The Family First Party was generally considered to be part of the Christian right. Though it had no formal affiliation with any particular religious organisation, Family First was strongly linked to the Pentecostal church in South Australia, and nationally from smaller Christian denominations. Family First in South Australia was viewed as an infusion of ex-Liberals via Robert Brokenshire and Day. Originally advocating a moral and family values agenda, Day, who would become Family First's major donor, later reoriented Family First to begin to emphasise issues such as industrial relations reform, free speech and smaller government, which brought Family First closer to Cory Bernardi's Australian Conservatives. Family First and their two state incumbents merged into Bernardi's Conservatives in April 2017. ==Political views== Day's political views are set forth on his website nationbuild.com Day is a supporter of the Monarchy of Australia. He does not believe in anthropogenic climate change and opposes policies to reduce atmospheric carbon dioxide.

He has expressed his admiration for Houston's approach to zoning. He says they have none, yet there is a vibrant economy and housing prices are low.

Industrial relations Day strongly supports independent contracting as an alternative to the traditional employment relationship. He was the first president (2001-5) of Independent Contractors Australia, which was formed in 1999 \\"with the objective of protecting the rights of independent contractors in Australia to be treated fairly, justly and equitably and to be allowed to work free from intimidation or harassment from bureaucrats, the Australian Taxation Office, political parties, unions and others\\". On the website of the Family First Party he stated: \\"independent contracting offers people a real choice between traditional employment ... and ... arrangements which suit the parties themselves rather than one-size-fits- all, out-dated arrangements which have the added involvement of heavy-handed, self-interested third parties.\\"'\\"Contract Bridge\\" : Independent Contracting- A Solution to Australia's 64bn Employment Problem' essay by Bob Day on the website of Family First – South Australia, accessed 17 September 2010; discontinued, as of 18 May 2017 As a Liberal, Day had taken a position that WorkChoices, an industrial relations reform enacted in 2005 by the Liberal government of John Howard, did not deregulate the industrial relations system far enough. When he left the party and joined Family First, he supported the party platform which opposed WorkChoices. This position was viewed as a contradiction by Australian political journalist Phillip Coorey, Chief Political Correspondent of The Sydney Morning Herald\\"Phillip Coorey\\" website of The Sydney Morning Herald, accessed 14 September 2010 who wrote in 2008: > In 2002, as secretary of H.R.

Day has denied that the contractors were employees. \\"These guys were very sophisticated.

They sculpted statues representing the fight of gods and giants. The terrace is decorated with a rare collection of vases made by Bombelli, also active in Slavkov u Brna, at Slavkov-Austerlitz castle (close to Brno). The central axis of the garden projects towards the spires of the St. Vitus Cathedral in the Prague Castle. == Decoration == Abraham and Izaak Godijn The palace's main room is decorated with a magnificent baroque Habsburg's apotheosis. Many mythological elements are presented in this trompe-l'œil decoration. It was realised by the brothers Abraham and Izaak Godijn, painters from Antwerp who commenced their work at the castle in 1690. The paintings are considered to be among the best examples of Baroque fresco painting in Northern Europe. The fresco's use illusionist effects and narrate in a triumphalist way the history of the Habsburg Dynasty. The design follows the Baroque schema of architectural symbolism whereby the ceiling depicts the celestial world and the walls the terrestrial world. The ceiling is decorated with celestial beings that were said to protect the Habsburg territories. Underneath the curved surfaces below the ceiling, angels and putti are floating before trompe-l'œil architecture showing scenes from Habsburg history. The walls depict the terrestrial world with one of the scenes on the shorter walls celebrating the victory of Leopold I, Holy Roman Emperor over the Turks. In one scene we see the trompe-l'œil effect of a Turk falling down with his arms outstretched while his shadow is reflected on the painting (see illustration). The longer wall holds statues or busts of the Habsburg rulers in grisaille.Wiener Jahrbuch für Kunstgeschichte, Böhlau Verlag Wien, 1996, p. 114 The fresco programme achieved a sophisticated and complex synthesis of fictionalist painting of architecture and lively figural scenes.Mojmír Horyna, Pavel Zahradník, Pavel Preiss, Czernin Palace in Prague, Opus, 2001, p. 149 Francesco Marchetti and his son Giovanni realised most of the other paintings in the castle. == Recent history == The palace was bought in 1922 by the Czechoslovak state, which started a restoration in the seventies. Since this period the palace has been hosting an exhibition of Czech paintings of the 19th century: Josef Čermák, Václav Brožík, Julius Mařák, Antonin Chittussi, Jan Preisler, Mikoláš Aleš. ==See also== * List of Baroque residences ==NotesExternal links== * Category:Castles in Prague Category:Palaces in Prague Category:Baroque palaces Category:Baroque architecture in the Czech Republic Category:1691 establishments in the Holy Roman Empire Category:Buildings and structures completed in 1691 ","title":"Troja Palace"},{"id":"12396936","text":"The 1951 Coupe de France Final was a football match held at Stade Olympique Yves-du-Manoir, Colombes on May 6, 1951, that saw RC Strasbourg defeat US Valenciennes-Anzin 3–0 thanks to goals by René Bihel, Raymond Krug and André Nagy. ==Match details== { style=font-size:90% cellspacing=0 cellpadding=0 colspan=4 - !width=25 !!width=25 - GK   Lucien Schaeffer - DF   René Hauss - DF   René Démaret - DF   Raymond Krug - DF   Michel Wawrzyniak  (c) - MF   Alexandre Vanags - MF   Claude Battistella - FW   André Nagy - FW   René Bihel - FW   Michel Jacques - FW   Edmond Haan - colspan=3Manager: - colspan=4 Charles Nicolas Assistant Referees: Fourth Official: } { style=\\"font-size: 90%\\" cellspacing=\\"0\\" cellpadding=\\"0\\" align=center colspan=4 - !width=25 !!width=25 - GK   Félix Witkowski  (c) - DF   Antoine Pazur - DF   Marcel Gaillard - DF   Grégoire Izidorczyk - DF   Simon Blaszczyk - MF   Emile Wassmer - MF   Emile Vrand - FW   Marius Rozé - FW   Juan Carlos Verdeal - FW   Marcel Létugeon - FW   Pierre Goffart - colspan=3Manager: - colspan=4 Henri Pérus } ==See also== *Coupe de France 1950-1951 ==External links== *Coupe de France results at Rec.Sport.Soccer Statistics Foundation *Report on French federation site Coupe 1951 Coupe De France Final 1951 Coupe De France Final 1951 Category:Sport in Hauts-de-Seine Category:May 1951 sports events Category:1951 in Paris ","title":"1951 Coupe de France Final"},{"id":"12396941","text":"Robyn Loau (; born 20 October 1972) is an Australian singer, songwriter and actress.

It is a feature in particular of the English summer. Country house opera is usually initiated by private enthusiasts, and relies almost exclusively upon private funding. This distinguishes it from the UK's state subsidised opera companies which, like most opera houses around the world, are based in city centres. Black tie is often de rigueur, in contrast with the Royal Opera House in London and other city operas where casual clothing is often acceptable. The performances of country house opera are generally planned to provide a leisurely and elegant experience, with time for picnics on the lawns or a full meal during the often-lengthy interval, and often start in the late afternoon: :\\"The English have always liked picnicking in the summer and if you can throw in a bit of entertainment, then that's even better\\" said a former manager at the Sydney Opera House, attributing the popularity of country house opera in England to \\"the wonderful adventurous spirit of the British.... The British like to go out and find a new place. No one in Australia would go out if they had to take a picnic and it was going to rain.\\"Marylyn Abbott, quoted in \\"Country House Opera\\" , Country Life, 17 June 2004 on countrylife.co.uk The most important landmark in country house opera was the opening of Glyndebourne Opera House in 1934. The Glyndebourne Festival Opera company has gradually expanded so that it now has a 1,200-seat theatre and it has become one of the most prominent opera companies in the United Kingdom, performing both at its home venue and on tour. While other companies, which put on a regular summer season often include works from the standard repertoire, some specialise in particular composers or particular periods.

The country opera house tradition has inspired opera performances in similar settings outside England, such as Stålboga Summer Opera in Sweden.

They are commonly known as bright-eyed or skeleton frogs. They show typical 'tree frog' traits, and are a good example of convergent evolution with morphologically similar species in the families Hylidae and Rhacophoridae, among others. This genus can only be found on Madagascar and Mayotte Island (Comoros). ==Taxonomy== The genus Boophis was described by Johann Jakob von Tschudi in 1838. It was originally considered a member of the African-Asian family Rhacophoridae, but was moved to the family Mantellidae in 2001, into its own subfamily, Boophinae Vences & Glaw, 2001. ==Morphology== Boophis are arboreal frogs, exhibiting many traits that define 'tree frogs', such as expanded toe discs, long hindlimbs, and large eyes. Boophis are especially characterised by bright colouration of the iris, which is typically intricately patterned towards its inside, and often green or blue, but occasionally also red, purple, or yellow in the outer iris area. This has led to the vernacular name of bright-eyed frogs for the genus. Many species of Boophis have almost translucent skin, allowing bones and internal organs to be observed as in the unrelated glass frogs (Centrolenidae) of the tropical Americas.

It is endemic to northern Madagascar and is known from two locations, Montagne d'Ambre and the vicinity of Tsaratanana. There is also a recent from near Bemanevika. The specific name blommersae honours Rose Marie Antoinette Blommers-Schlösser, a Dutch herpetologist and entomologist. ==Description== Adult males measure in snout–vent length. The fingers have some webbing while the toes are more extensively webbed. Skin is dorsally smooth. Dorsal colouration is highly variable: uniformly light brown, brown with a large dark hourglass pattern, or brown with lichen-like yellow or pink spots. The throat is transparent with a green shade, while the belly is centrally silvery white and laterally transparent. The iris is light brown to grey, with some reddish- brown colour and greenish yellow periphery. The legs have rather indistinct dark crossbands. The finger and the toe tips are greenish. ==Habitat and conservation== Boophis blommersae occurs in humid rainforest at elevations of above sea level. The tadpoles develop in streams. It is a very common species but tolerates only slight habitat modification — it is threatened by habitat loss caused by subsistence agriculture, timber extraction, charcoal manufacture, the spread of eucalyptus, and expanding human settlements. However, it occurs in the well-managed Montagne d'Ambre National Park and the Tsaratanana Reserve, and in the planned Bemanevika protected area. ==References== blommersae Category:Endemic frogs of Madagascar Category:Amphibians described in 1994 Category:Taxa named by Frank Glaw Category:Taxa named by Miguel Vences Category:Taxonomy articles created by Polbot ","title":"Boophis blommersae"},{"id":"12397004","text":"Boophis boehmei is a species of frog in the family Mantellidae.

The school has two campuses Coolock and St Mary’s. The Coolock campus is located in the outer Bendigo suburb of Junortoun and provides education for Years 7–9. The St Mary’s campus located in the heart of Bendigo provides education for Years 10-12, including the Victorian Certificate of Education (VCE) and Victorian Certificate of Applied Learning (VCAL). Catherine McAuley College is governed by the Institute of Sisters of Mercy of Australia and Papua New Guinea. In 2018, the school was renamed from Catholic College Bendigo (CCB), signifying the end to the Sisters of Mercy and the Marist Brothers governance partnership formed in 1983. The partnership was dissolved in January 2013 and in 2015 the Marist Brothers opened Marist College Bendigo a co-educational school (Prep to Year 12). ==History== There are two central founders of Catholic College Bendigo. The Sisters of Mercy arrived in Bendigo in 1876 and set up a day and boarding school for girls - St Mary's Convent - on Wright Street (now the Coolock site). The Marist Brothers arrived in Bendigo in 1893 and established their own college for boys. The founders of these orders, Marcellin Champagnat and Catherine McAuley, are considered the founders of Catholic College Bendigo. In 1955, the site at La Valla was opened for boarding boys as St Vincent's College. Due to declining boarders the school opened to day pupils in 1972. In 1983, the two schools run by the Mercy Sisters and the Marist brothers combined, to make a co- educational school. It was also renamed Catholic College Bendigo. By 1988, the school had two sites - La Valla and Coolock, which are the current two sites. A process of refurbishment has been running since the late 1990s — in 1998, the Junortoun quadrangle was refurbished. In 2004, Wright Street, which runs through Coolock, was bought by the school and closed, which led to a large refurbishment of the area to face the road. In 2005, the Coolock arts building was refurbished. In 2006, work on a new technology building at La Valla began. It was completed in 2007. In 2008, the Marian Centre at Coolock was opened. It features a new music block and theatre, as well as a large gym with two basketball courts. This gym is the venue for whole school assemblies—a 2008 initiative to bring the two sites closer together. There was a major transition to a vertical pastoral care system in 2009. Prior to 2009, Catholic College Bendigo had four houses - Marcellin (blue), Backhaus (yellow), McAuley (green) and Crane (red). The new system comprises six houses, with homegroups now aligned into houses. The new houses of the college are Vincent (yellow), Backhaus (purple), McAuley (blue), MacKillop (green), Jaara (orange) and Champagnat (maroon). Coolock also changed their homeroom model to a vertical housegroup system. At Coolock, each house now has six Years 10 to 12 housegroups. At La Valla, each house has two Year 7 housegroups, two Year 8 housegroups and two Year 9 housegroups. The total number of housegroups across the college is 64. There are also two further housegroups, bringing the total to 66. In 2017 the La Valla site changed its homeroom to vertical, so it could bring the Years 7, 8, and 9 together. In 2018 the College was renamed to Catherine McAuley College after the founder of the Sisters of Mercy, Catherine McAuley. At this time both campuses were also renamed to reflect the history of the Mercy sisters and the College - with the then La Valla in Junortoun becoming Coolock, reflecting a location where Catherine McAuley undertook work, and the then Coolock becoming St Mary's, the name of the College prior to 1983. CCB is a member of the Catholic All Schools Sports Association (CAS). Each year the college puts on a production, displaying the theatrical talents of Year 9 students. ==Buildings==  St Mary's  Mercy Building - three floors. On the ground floor is general reception, staff room, office of Senior Leader and office of the deputy principal of Coolock. On the first floor, there are staff offices, the finance office, the office of the Director of Catholic Identity and the principal's office. On the second floor, there is the publications office, alumni office and the office of the Director of Teaching and Learning. Kelly Building - two floors. On the ground floor, there are four general classrooms. On the first floor, there are three computer rooms and IT staff offices. All Vincent homegroups are held in this building. Ursula Frayne Building - science block, two floors. All McAuley homegroups are held in this building. Champagnat Arts Building - arts block, with general classrooms, language classrooms and, on the first floor, art, media, visual communication, textiles and photography rooms, as well as art offices reside. Champagnat and MacKillop homegroups are held here. Library - general library, with two research areas, an information lab, a non-fiction section, a fiction section and a reading area, as well as a silent study room and library offices. Backhaus Building - two floors, classrooms on both floors and two staff offices on the first floor. All Backhaus homegroups are held here. Coolock House - two floors, with careers office, staff offices and general classrooms. Jaara homegroups are held here. Marian Centre - music room, stage, theatre, music and PE offices, practice rooms, foyer. Gym with two basketball courts, a weights room, and two classrooms. Four portable classrooms are also installed. ==College prayer== The College's prayer was updated in 2018 upon its name change to Catherine McAuley College. Loving God, We ask you to bless Catherine McAuley College and challenge us to act in the spirit of Catherine. May we inspire all in our community to be learners impelled to thrive and to serve; Guide our community to live our Mercy Values and the Gospel message of Jesus Christ.

Mukunda's higher education began at Delhi University where he was granted a B.Sc. (Hon) degree in 1953. For his Ph.D. he studied at University of Rochester with E. C. G. Sudarshan and graduated in 1964. Mukunda’s thesis dealt with Hamiltonian mechanics, symmetry groups and elementary particles.Narasimhaigar Mukunda (1964) Studies in Hamiltonian theories of relativistic interacting particles, and in the application of symmetry groups to elementary particle physics, Seventh supplement to Checklist of Doctors’ Theses from University of Rochester He also studied group theory at Princeton University with Valentine Bargmann, including topological groups and Lie theory. He was a post-doctoral fellow at Syracuse University before he returned to India. In 1967 he became a Fellow at Tata Institute of Fundamental Research. In 1969 he transferred to IISc, Bangalore. From 1972 to 2001 he served a professor at the Center for Theoretical Studies. Using the notes from Bargmann's lectures, Mukunda contributed chapters on Lie groups to Classical Dynamics: a modern perspective that he authored with Sudarshan in 1974. The expression of symmetries on physics rests largely on Lie groups, and his later works exploit these classical groups for physical theory. Mukunda was particularly impressed by W. R. Hamilton's \\"theory of turns\\" (versors), and worked to extend the use of turns in Sp(2), SU(1,1) and the Lorentz group. In 1989 Mukunda, Rajiah Simon and Sudarshan published \\"Hamilton’s theory of turns and a new geometrical representation for polarization optics\\" which developed the coset space SU(2)/U(1) = S3/S1 as an alternative to the Poincaré sphere in the description of light polarization. Mukunda is an honorary professor at IISER Mohali and IISER Thiruvananthapuram. He is also the Distinguished associate of Ramakrishna Mission Vivekananda Educational and Research Institute.Faculty at Ramakrishna Mission He was awarded the Shanti Swarup Bhatnagar Award for work in Nonlinear and Quantum Optics in 1980 In 2016 Mukunda gave the Fifteenth Memorial V.G.

It is endemic to Madagascar where it is widespread on the high plateau of central Madagascar. Records elsewhere are uncertain and many of them represent misidentifications. It is the only Malagasy frog where females are known to be vocal. ==Etymology== The specific name goudotii honours Jules Prosper Goudot, a French collector active in Madagascar during the first half of the 19th century. ==Description== Males measure and females typically in snout–vent length, but they may grow as large as SVL. Colouration is variable, from almost entirely blackish to yellowish with black spots. Venter is yellowish or orange and may have blackish spots. The iris copper turquoise periphery. The tympanum is distinct. Males have nuptial pads and a subgular vocal sac. Both males and females are vocal. Calls include irregularly emitted moaning notes, emitted during day and night. ==Habitat and conservation== Boophis goudotii is a common species that can be found in rainforests, fields, and disturbed stream sides near slow-moving or stagnant water. Its elevational range is above sea level. They are poor climbers but are sometimes found in trees. Breeding takes place in both permanent and temporary bodies of slow-moving or stagnant water. While the forest habitat of this species is receding, it tolerates a broad range of habitats. It is also collected for human consumption, but not at levels that would pose a threat. ==References== goudotii Category:Endemic frogs of Madagascar Category:Amphibians described in 1838 Category:Taxa named by Johann Jakob von Tschudi Category:Taxonomy articles created by Polbot ","title":"Boophis goudotii"},{"id":"12397058","text":"Boophis guibei, sometimes known as the warty bright-eyed frog, is a species of frog in the family Mantellidae.

The site is located north of the Arctic Circle and from the northeast end of Kangerlussuaq Fjord, formerly known by its Danish name Søndre Strømfjord. The base is approximately west-northwest of Ravneklippen and east of Sisimiut. Following World War II, the base was briefly returned to Danish control between 9 October 1950 and 20 July 1951. The 1951 Greenland bases treaty led to the return of Sondrestrom to American control. The base was turned over to the Greenland government in 1992 and is now a civilian community (Kangerlussuaq) and airport (Kangerlussuaq Airport), although the USAF operates a small Air National Guard detachment in the former base. ==History== Names * Established on 20 October 1941 and named Bluie West Eight (BW-8); codenamed \\"Bodkin\\" in communications. : Renamed: Sondrestromfjord Army Air Base, 1945 : Renamed: Sondrestromfjord Air Base, 25 October 1947 : Renamed: Sondrestrom Air Base, 10 January 1952 Base operating units * 417th Base HQ & Air Base Squadron, 26 September 1942 * 1385th Army Air Force Base Unit, 1 October 1945 * 1004th Air Base Squadron (redesignated: 1234th Air Base Squadron, 1 October 1948), 1 June 1948 * Greenland Base Command, 21 June 1949 – 9 October 1950 * 6621st Air Base Squadron, 20 July 1951 * 6621st Air Base Group, 25 September 1955 * 4084th Air Base Group, 1 April 1957 * 4684th Air Base Group, 1 July 1960 – 1 June 1992 * 1015th Air Base Squadron, a subordinate unit to the 1012th Air Base Group at Thule, was the unit designation from at least March 85 to closing in September 92 * 2004th Airways & Air Communications Squadron(AACS)(MATS) Major commands to which assigned * First United States Army, 15 January 1941 * Eastern Defense Command (U.S. Army), 12 December 1942 * Air Transport Command, 1 January 1946 * Military Air Transport Service, 1 April 1948 * Northeast Air Command, 1–9 October 1950; 20 July 1951 * Strategic Air Command, 1 April 1957 * Air Defense (redesignated: Aerospace Defense) Command, 15 January 1968 * Strategic Air Command, 1 December 1979 – 30 June 1983 * Air Force Space Command from 1 July 1983 to September 92 closing Founding and construction Following the fall of Denmark to Germany in World War II, responsibility for the security of Greenland passed to the American military under the terms of a 9 April 1941 treaty with the defected Danish ambassador in Washington. Military leaders responded by building several bases in Greenland, the largest of which were Bluie West One in Narsarsuaq in southern Greenland and Bluie West Eight along the Kangerlussuaq fjord. The site of BW-8 had already been contemplated for an airfield, and Professor William Hobbs of the University of Michigan had operated a meteorological station there in 1927–28. That station was named Mount Evans, while the supporting base camp at the site of the present seaport was named Camp Lloyd. A 1,500 foot long dirt airstrip eight miles east was prepared for the expected aircraft of Atlantic flyers Bert Hassell and Parker Cramer. They, however, ran out of fuel and walked the remaining distance to Sondrestrom. The location at the bottom of Sondrestromfjord is about as far from the coast as one can get on land in Greenland, and though the climate is severe, it is much more favorable for aviation than the coast. The approaches are clear, although the runway has a slope. During August 1940, the U.S. Coast Guard Cutter supported an aerial survey commanded by Army Captain Julius K. Lacey. From Lacey's Curtiss SOC-4, numerous photographs were obtained of promising runway alignments in the area. From 6 to 11 May 1941, the South Greenland Survey Expedition led by Lieutenant Commander William E. Sinton further examined the area from the , which now carried the same SOC-4 for aerial surveys. Charts and plans were drawn up in expectation of a major construction expedition that fall. The expedition also charted seaplane operating sites at Monroe Bay (Tatsip Ata) and Angujartorfik downfjords from Sondrestrom. Bluie West-8 was founded on 7 October 1941 by a 31-man expedition commanded by Captain (later Colonel) Bernt Balchen of the United States Army Air Forces (USAAF). A major sealift followed. The airport was ready for operation in the spring of 1942. A road of about ten miles length connected the airfield site with the port location (Camp Lloyd) farther down the fjord. Seasonal access for ships is during late summer and early autumn, but during the early days the fjord ice was broken for a much longer period. To identify and guide the approach to BW-8, an auxiliary station was placed at Cruncher Island, also known as Simiutak, at the entrance to Sondrestromfjord. This station, operational 4 September 1942, provided meteorological reports, radio communications, radio beacon and lights for air and sea traffic. It was known as BW-9. Operations BW-8 was intended as a link in a northern air ferry route known to U.S. planners as the Crimson Route, but it transpired that few aircraft were ferried to Europe through it. Instead, the base earned its keep as an alternate field, a radio and weather reporting station, and as a departure point for search-and-rescue operations elsewhere in Greenland. During the two years Colonel Balchen was in command, he led numerous expeditions throughout the island, primarily in rescue operations for downed aircrew. As a reliever for the Greenland Command headquarters base in Narsarsuaq, Bluie West One, BW-8 was by late 1942 assisted by small fields at Bluie East Two in East Greenland, and Teague Field on the west coast about midways between BW-8 and BW-1. The Danish government briefly controlled the base in 1950, but following a renewed base treaty (also resulting in the construction of Thule Air Base), the United States reopened BW-8 under the name of Sondrestrom Air Base on 27 April 1951. Sondrestrom AB then became instrumental in the airlift to build Thule AB, although it had little function of its own, and rarely had permanently stationed aircraft. However, the base also served to support air refueling tankers, and trans-Atlantic ferry flights for short-ranged jet fighters continued to transit in the post-war period. When the Distant Early Warning Line was constructed in the late 1950s and early 1960s, Sondrestrom AB received a new lease on life. It assisted especially in the building of the four radar stations spanning Greenland (DYE-1 through 4). Passenger airplane at Sondrestrom Air Base in August 1974 In the mid-1950s, Scandinavian Airlines System (SAS) began using the base as a refueling station on their then-new \\"Polar route\\" between Scandinavia and the United States. In 1956, SAS was operating three round trip flights a week with Douglas DC-6B propliners on a routing of Copenhagen – Sondrestrom – Winnipeg – Los Angeles.http://www.timetableimages.com, Jan. 1, 1956 SAS system timetable This use fell off in the 1960s as airliners gained greater range. However, in the 1970s Boeing 707 jetliners operated by Dan-Air between the United Kingdom and Vancouver stopped to refuel. The base also became the hub of Greenland air traffic and was the destination for almost all regular air service from and to Copenhagen. The United States Air Force continued to use the base for occasional traffic, and in particular for the yearly resupply of the DYE stations. It was also a center for seasonal scientific activity. Following the fall of the Soviet Union and the abandonment of the DYE stations in 1991, the usefulness of the base was greatly diminished. The last US Air Force personnel left the base on 30 September 1992. It then became Kangerlussuaq airport, still the main hub for Greenland air travel. ==Rocket launches== Since 1971, rockets such as the Nike Apache, Petrel, Nike Tomahawk, Black Brant, Terrier Malemute, Taurus Orion, and Taurus Nike Tomahawk TNT have been launched from a site close to Kangerlussuaq (specifically, at ) for examination of the upper atmosphere.Sonde Stromfjord Launch Log  Launch list  {  - !

It featured a three-dimensional board, representing an Egyptian pyramid, with two consecutively smaller playing areas above the bottom board. The aim of the game was to reach the top of the fictional Pyramid of Khonsu, accessible only from the top tiered board, complete the tasks within and obtain the mythical Elixir of Life. In addition to traps, creatures and treasures found by exploring the board, there was the Mummy itself, which moved around the board. The Mummy's movement was controlled by the players, by a bidding system. Encountering the Mummy was generally detrimental to the player's chances of winning the game. == Gameplay == In games with more than one player, each player initially drew five cards from a universal deck and six points of Tana Leaf counters. The deck contained a variety of movement cards, Monsters, Hazards and Discoveries. After rolling a 12 sided die to determine who started the game, play began with moving the Mummy. Players secretly bids any number of Tana Leaves - the winner of the bid could move the Mummy one space. In the event of a tie, the Mummy is not moved. The Mummy starts in one of four fixed locations on the bottom board. If the Mummy entered a space containing a character's piece, the controlling player chooses whether to inflict damage to the character or steal a Discovery. After this, the Mummy restarted play from one of its starting locations. On a player's turn, they had one of three choices: Pass, Heal or Move. Passing allowed the player to discard any number of cards in his hand for the listed number of Tana Leaves on the discarded cards. The player then redrew up to his hand of five cards. Healing swaps ten Tana Leaves for regaining one Life, up to a maximum of three. Movement allowed the character to move. They played a movement card from their hand, then moved the character in one of the permitted compass directions or ascend/descend a board level according to the movement card. Each other player then was permitted to a play a movement card and move the active player's character one space in the permitted direction. Ascending the pyramid was only possible if the appropriate square existed on the board above the piece's current location. Players could not move into spaces containing other players or the Mummy. After Movement, the player then explored his current location. Some board spaces had numbers printed on them, indicating the number of encounters faced. Each player was then allowed to play a Hazard, a Creature or Discovery card from their hand, until the number of encounters was reached, or a maximum of one card of each type, whichever was lower. Hazards represented traps or other devices intended to protect the pyramid from intruders. These usually required testing a character's ability score. Testing a character's attribute was done by rolling the die then comparing to the character's listed attribute. If the die roll was equal to or lower than the attribute, the test was successful. Creatures represented the pyramid's guardians or other (hostile) treasure hunters. The player had a choice of how to deal with the creature, Attacking, Trickery or Retreating. Each option involved rolling the die and adding the appropriate attribute score, then comparing to the creature's relevant attribute plus a die roll. A successful Attack defeated the creature, while a Retreat moved the character back a number of squares. Trickery had a graded success level - just beating the creature caused it to be discarded, while beating the creature by a large margin allowed the player to use the creature as a single use bodyguard against other creatures. Discoveries are useful items that have been found. These can range from items that add to the character's attributes, or ways of defeating Hazards and Creatures. After the player's action, each player then redrew cards to return their hand to five, then play passed clockwise. Once all players had a turn, the Mummy was moved and play resumed from the first player.  Victory  To win, a player had to enter the Chamber of Osiris and test three character specific attributes. If all three tests were passed, then the player won the game. The Chamber of Osiris was only accessible from specific locations on the top tiered board and the character had to be in possession of the special Key of Osiris Discovery.  Characters  Each of the four characters included in the game had different attributes, such as Egyptology, strength and fortune, to represent their strengths and weaknesses. In addition, each character had 4 lives, which could be removed by Hazards, Creatures or the Mummy. Loss of all 4 lives resulted in the player being eliminated from the game. Each character had an illustration and some flavour text on their sheets, explaining their motivations: Marlow Hammett - It all started back in San Francisco with a stolen black bird and a dame in trouble. Since then it's been getting weirder by the day. All this stuff about pyramids and eternal life is just so much mumbo-jumbo in his book, but Hammett was hired to get the Elixir, and Hammett always delivers... Rev Luther Kirkegard - Kirkegard has travelled to Egypt to defend the divine and natural laws of life and death. The Elixir must be destroyed and the forbidden knowledge of the ancients must be prevented from corrupting the living! Professor Nayland Cushing - Cushing is a world-famous explorer whose journeys into the unknown have enthralled newspaper readers for over twenty years. Now, at the pinnacle of his career, he faces his greatest challenge. He must find the Elixir and preserve it for scientific study. It must not fall into evil hands! Lt-Gen The Earl of Carmarthen - The Earl has fought everywhere from Africa to India, and has seen things that would send a lesser man mad. Now retired from the army, he travels in search of the mysterious and unusual - like the Elixir. If he could get it, his idiot of a son wouldn't get the title and estates for a long, long time... White Dwarf published a number of additional characters in issue 102.  Solo rules  The game also included solo rules. Playing this way involved rolling the die for the Mummy's movement and the separation of the playing deck into separate movement and Hazard/Creature/Discovery cards. The victory and loss conditions remained the same. == References == *Curse of the Mummy's Tomb rule book *Curse of the Mummy's Tomb Mummy's Tome reference guide == Notes External links== * Category:Board games introduced in 1988 Category:Games Workshop games Category:Horror board games ","title":"Curse of the Mummy's Tomb (board game)"},{"id":"12397106","text":"juvenile, Ranomafana NP Boophis madagascariensis is a species of frog in the family Mantellidae.

The species was first formally described by George Albert Boulenger in 1888, who penned the species' binomial after Richard Baron, an English botanist and missionary to Madagascar, who collected and studied the species. == Distribution, habitat, and conservation status == Like other species in Mantellidae, this taxon is endemic to Madagascar. This family is estimated to have colonized the island of Madagascar 76–87 million years ago, evolving in insular seclusion, and adaptively radiating in geographic range and number of species on the island. Mantellidae are phylogenetically related to Asiatic frogs, and therefore probably represent a dispersal event from Asia. This is one of approximately 220 frog species (including 15 in Mantella) endemic only to Madagascar. It has a moderately-large elongated geographic range in East-Central Madagascar, inland from the east coast, and spanning north to south, from Fierenana south to Andringitra. Its natural habitats are subtropical or tropical moist lowland forest, subtropical or tropical moist montane forest, rivers, and degraded former forest. It typically prefers residing at elevations between 600-1200 meters above sea level. Although it has been classified as a Least Concern species by the IUCN as of 2016, due to its relatively wide distribution, population trends are technically unknown, and it may be threatened by several sources of habitat loss. These include anthropogenic encroachment from commercialization and industrialization, timber and logging operations, and agriculture. It appears in CITES Appendix II. == Description == Though only 28–32 mm in length at maturity, this species is one of the largest in the 16-species genus, dwarfed only by some individuals of Mantella viridis. Related Mantella species typically range from 18–31 mm in morphology for adult individuals. Mantella frogs generally exhibit sexual dimorphism, with the females (28–32 mm) of this species being slightly larger than the males (24–28 mm). This difference in size becomes prominent after approximately 10–12 months of age. Variegated golden frog (Mantella baroni) 2.jpgDorsal view Variegated golden frog (Mantella baroni) ventral Ranomafana.jpgVentral view Most individuals in this species display specific unique characteristics that distinguish them from other Mantella species, such as a \\"light rostral line above the eyes\\" and \\"tiger-like markings on the hind limbs\\" of \\"orange with irregular black stripes\\", as seen in the images above. However, a wide variety of phenotypes exist, which manifest in front limb colors ranging from light greens to vibrant oranges and yellows, and are sometimes mistaken or imported into the international marketplace as Mantella cowanii. Moreover, the \\"front limbs and femurs are yellow to greenish in appearance, with this coloration continuing up the flanks into a large, rounded flank blotch\\", which mirrors the commonplace appearance of the species Mantella madagascariensis, known as the painted mantella. These blotches \\"contrast with the black dorsum and striking orange and black legs\\" in both species, making it difficult for distributors, vendors, herpetologists, breeders, collectors, and pet owners to acquire the correct species. The easiest way to differentiate the two species is to note the \\"sky-blue, horseshoe-shaped marking\\" present on the throat of the painted mantella, as well as the lack of \\"flashmarks on the lower hindlimbs\\" on the Baron's mantella. Due to their similar appearance, the Baron's mantella is sometimes informally called a \\"painted mantella\\" as well, despite the painted mantella being a distinct species altogether. File:Mantellidae - Mantella madagascariensis.JPGMantella madagascariensis File:Mantella baroni01.jpgMantella baroni File:Mantella pulchra01.jpgMantella pulchra As seen in the pictures above, M. baroni demonstrates strong aposomatic features on their front limbs, hind limbs, and rostral line. Similar aposomatic features – such as bright colorations, striking color differentials, and otherwise unconventional patterning – are common to all 16 species of Mantella, to varying levels of veracity (some species of Mantella have weaker toxicity and primarily use bright colors as a form of mimicry). Despite resembling the similarly-small poison dart frogs of Latin America, which also communicate their toxicity to potential predators through aposematism, Mantella species like the Baron's mantella are only distant taxonomic relatives. The existence of these similarities between these two families is an example of convergent evolution. == Activity and reproduction == Male M. baroni emit \\"intense sequences of short, single-click notes during the day\\" in order to assert their territory or attract females for mating. Females can lay up to 130 unpigmented eggs in a single clutch, and almost always do so near a source of water, into which the resulting tadpoles get washed by rainwater. == Diet, predation, and toxicology == Mantella baroni is a very active forager and can consume a greater number of prey (consisting of large arthropods) than any other Mantella species, consisting of large arthropods. While most frog species are nocturnal, the Mantella baroni is a diurnal hunter. Its diet consists mainly of ants, while also consuming a number of other types of arthropods like beetles, spiders, and mites. Ingesting mites allows them to secrete high pharmacologically-active alkaloid concentrations in their skin, making them toxic to predators, with their bright colors serving as a warning sign that ingestion could be dangerous and induce sickness. The intensity of this alkaloid concentration can flux both temporally and geographically, but careless human handling is always discouraged. Human activity may influence the level of Mantella toxicity by polluting the environment, killing its sources of food and limiting an otherwise diversified diet, so remote populations may be more potent. ==References External links == * * * 'Mantella baroni at AmphibiaWeb baroni Category:Endemic frogs of Madagascar Category:Amphibians described in 1888 Category:Taxa named by George Albert Boulenger Category:Taxonomy articles created by Polbot ","title":"Mantella baroni"},{"id":"12397226","text":"The Pointe of View Winery is a winery located in the north-central part of North Dakota, United States half a mile south of Burlington, in the Minot area.

Built at the end of the nineteenth century for a local industrialist, it has been named a historic site. As the president of the Favorite Stove and Range Company, William K. Boal headed Piqua's largest industrial employer during the Gilded Age and early twentieth century. He and his wife arranged for the construction of the house at Arrowston in 1887, but it was only home to them for about a decade: Mrs. Boal was deeply shaken by the death of one of their sons and no longer desired to live in their mansion, and they moved to a residence in central Piqua in 1898. Later owners expanded the property in 1929, creating a large estate around the house: the newly expanded property included the construction of a lake and canal, as well as extensive other landscape architecture. No major changes have been made to the landscaping since 1929.Owen, Lorrie K., ed. Dictionary of Ohio Historic Places. Vol. 2. St. Clair Shores: Somerset, 1999, 1003. Arrowston's main house is a three- story building in the Georgian Revival style of architecture. Numerous Neoclassical influences are obvious, ranging from grand themes to small details: the careful symmetry of the whole design, its size in comparison to its surroundings, and the hip roof are typical of the style, as are details such as its ornate cornice, the pilasters, and the conventional double-hung windows. Both weatherboarding and brick are employed in the walls, which rest on a stone foundation and support a tiled roof. Multiple dormers rise from the walls: the eaves at the bottom of the roof extend past the walls, which in some points are extended above the roof, causing the latter to appear notched. Numerous windows are equipped with shutters, while the roof is gabled. Large chimneys form the highest points of the house., Ohio Historical Society, 2007. Accessed 2014-02-23. Today, Arrowston is surrounded by modern subdivisions, but its extensive landscaping distinguish it easily from the newer neighborhoods around it. Its design is significant to the point that it has been given federal historic site status, being listed on the National Register of Historic Places in early 1980 because of its architecture; besides the house, the designation embraces seven outbuildings and a pair of related structures. It is one of four National Register-listed locations in Piqua, along with the Fort Piqua Hotel, the Piqua High School, and the Piqua-Caldwell Historic District. ==References== Category:Houses completed in 1887 Category:Houses in Miami County, Ohio Category:National Register of Historic Places in Miami County, Ohio Category:Colonial Revival architecture in Ohio Category:Houses on the National Register of Historic Places in Ohio Category:Wooden houses in the United States ","title":"Arrowston"},{"id":"12397241","text":"The Cowan's mantella (Mantella cowanii) is a species of frog in the family Mantellidae.

Both are locally common, but endangered due to habitat loss and over-collected for the pet trade. ==Habitat and behavior== The blue-legged mantella is diurnal and belongs to the M. betsileo species group. Its preferred habitats are sun-exposed such as temporary rocky streams and inside rocky canyons. Their reproduction season is from September to December. The eggs are either hung on the walls of canyons or laid under rocks. They are then flooded by water and complete their development in temporary pools.

The back and top of the head are yellow, contrasted by blue legs, and black flanks and sides of the head. The underside is black with blue spots. There are individual and locality based variations, with some having darker and greyer legs or, in the far north of its range, a reddish lower back (contrasting with the yellow upper back and top of head). Those with a red lower back and grey legs have sometimes been called the \\"blushing mantella\\" or \\"sunrise mantella\\". In the south of the species' range, individuals commonly have some brown to the legs, approaching the appearance of the brown mantella (M. betsileo), and some are genetically in between the two species, but their taxonomic position is still unresolved.

Sex in the blue-legged mantella can be determined by the size of the body (females averaging noticeably larger than males), a horseshoe-shaped blue spot located on the lower jaw in males, and by the vocal signals that are specifically emitted only by males. ==ReferencesSources== * Raxworthy, C. & Glaw, F. 2004.

She co-presented the Inauguration of Mary McAleese as the 8th President of Ireland from Dublin Castle with fellow broadcaster Tomás Ó Ceallaigh for the station. In 2003 she was asked by RTÉ to present a bilingual current affairs programme - Seachtain - a weekly on-location broadcast focusing on regional issues. Shortly afterwards she was appointed Anchor of Nuacht RTÉ. She continued to present Seachtain for a number of years. In 2006 she began to present various other radio and television news bulletins for the national broadcaster and has presented all the main news bulletins including Six One, News on Two and Nine O'Clock since then. More recently, she presented a special live tribute to the writer and musician Maidhc Dainín Ó Sé following his death in 2013. In 2015 Nic Gearailt presented Nuacht RTÉ from Westminster during the British General Election. In the lead- up to the 2016 Irish General Election, she presented live outside broadcasts from Galway, Kerry and Taoiseach Enda Kenny's constituency of Mayo for Nuacht RTÉ. == Other work == Nic Gearailt held off the challenge from Mícheál Ó Muircheartaigh, RTÉ's Mr GAA, to win the inaugural RTÉ Personalities' GAA Prediction League title. Nic Gearailt has also been voted Kerry Woman of the Year by RSVP readers and was voted as one of the RTÉ Guide's Top 5 most liked presenters. She acts as MC at charity and cultural events from time to time. ==Personal life== Nic Gearailt married her fellow news presenter Ailbhe Ó Monacháin (from Gaoth Dobhair, County Donegal, in Ulster) in December 2007.Grá mór saying 'I Do' as Gaeilge.

It was intended to add a strategic layer to Warhammer Fantasy Battle giving rise to campaigns where the results of one battle would affect later battles, although the game included simple point based rules if the players did not have Warhammer Fantasy Battle or were unwilling to play out each battle.Mighty Empires Rules Booklet, 1990, p.14 == Gameplay ==  Setup  Prior to starting, the game map has to be assembled. The board consists of separate map hexagons representing coastal, highland and plains terrain, which are to be placed together to form a unique playing field. There are specific rules as to how the map tiles can be placed in order to maintain a sense of realism about the geography. For example, a river should continue until it terminates in a coastal, lake or swamp tile, rather than terminating abruptly by a blocking mountain or plains tile. Players then chose starting positions (certain map hexes are designated as \\"capital spots\\") and then roll a six-sided die to see what settlements already exist in the map hexes immediately surrounding their capital. The points worth of starting armies are then determined, either randomly (a number of dice rolled according to the number of settlements in that player's realm) or based on the players' available models. These are then divided into army banners and placed anywhere in the player's realm. Play is then commenced.  Campaign Season  Each year was split into the spring equinox, 6 summer months, autumn equinox and winter. Spells could be cast during the equinoxes which could have significant effects on the campaign season. The spells available between the spring and autumn equinoxes differ. During each summer month, the active player first calculates subsistence costs for each army. Subsistence represents the food and supplies an army would require and can be taken by foraging from the currently occupied map tile. Any shortfall must be made by baggage the army carries, else it can suffer troop loss. Each army then scouted in the direction they wished to move to. If the tile was unexplored, the contents of the tile was determined by rolling on tile type specific scouting charts. Depending on the results, the army could encounter a friendly settlement, an independent settlement, nothing at all or a random event. In the case of a settlement, it was permanently added to the map by placing the appropriate piece in the tile. The army could then move into the map tile if desired, provided there was no blocking terrain. Since a scouting roll was required every time an army wished to move, it was possible that the army could head in the wrong direction or not move at all, even if the target tile had been previously explored. In the event that a hostile settlement or an opposing army was encountered, a battle was then fought. The battle could be determined by Warhammer Fantasy Battle rules, or by a simple points based system.Mighty Empires Rules Booklet, 1990, p.51 In the case of sieges, the conflict could also be played out using Warhammer Siege rules. After any battles had been fought, an army could raze the map tile, rendering it useless for further subsistence for a period of time, and then reorganise any armies in the same tile, including their baggage. The next player then took their turn, following the same procedure. After all players took their turn, the next month began, with a random player starting first for that month. After all 6 months had been completed, the autumn equinox spells were cast, then the winter season procedure began. During the winter season, revenue (taxes) was collected, new units could be recruited, diplomacy and espionage could be performed and new settlements constructed. The game turn then restarted with the spring equinox. Simple rules for naval warfare were also included, although the later released Man o' War system could ostensibly be substituted. == Additional rules == Expanded rules for difference race's subsistence were included, for example orcs and goblins suffered double penalties for shortfalls as the smaller individuals were eaten, while Skaven could only subsist from razed tiles. A random name generator for several races was also included. White Dwarf published additional rules for buildings (such as Wizard towers and bridges), massive siege units and printed additional map tiles. == 2007 Edition == This game was re-released in 2007 with new plastic pieces with a scaled down version of the rules, to be used to drive a campaign of miniature battles. == References == Category:Board games introduced in 1990 Category:Games Workshop games Category:Warhammer Fantasy ","title":"Mighty Empires"},{"id":"12397385","text":"Gephyromantis decaryi, commonly known as Decary's Madagascar frog, is a species of frog in the family Mantellidae.

The name Markandeshwar is associated with Maharishi Markandeya, a great devotee of Shiva. ==History== The Shahabad Markanda town lies on the banks of the river Markanda river, Haryana, a tributary of the Ghaggar, and a part of the ancient Vedic Saraswati River basin system. The river derives its name from Maharishi Markandeya as well and several ancient ashramas of Rishi Markandeya can be seen along the banks of the river in the neighboring districts. ==Markandeshwar Mahadev Temple== The walls of the Markandeshwar Mahadev temple carry a scene depicting Lord Shiva saving Rishi Markandeya from Yamraj, the Hindu God of death. ==Story of Maharishi Markandeya== Markandeya was an exemplary son, who was destined to die at the age of 16. He grew up to be a great devotee of Shiva and on the day of his destined death he continued his worship of Shiva in His form of Shivalingam. The messengers of Yama, the God of death were unable to take away his life because of his great devotion and continual worship of Shiva. Finally, Yama came himself to take Markandeya's life away and sprung his noose around the young sage's neck. By mistake, the noose landed around the Shivalingam and out of it, Shiva emerged in all his fury attacking Yama for his act of aggression. After defeating Yama in battle to the point of death, Shiva then revived him, under the condition that the young Markandeya would live forever. Thus, the Maha Mrityunjaya Stotra is attributed to Maharishi Markandeya.Maha Mrityunjaya Stotram The Markandeya Purana comprises a dialogue between Markandeya and a sage called Jaimini and a number of chapters in the Bhagavata Purana are dedicated to his conversations and prayers.Srimad Bhagavatam, Canto 12, Chapter 8: Markandeya's Prayers to Nara-Narayana Rishi Maharishi Markandeya is also mentioned in the Mahabharata. ==Legend of the temple== The Markandeshwar Mahadev temple is supposed to be the place where the young Markandeya was praying to Shiva in order to win over his destiny. This is where Shiva fought with Yama and blessed Maharishi Markandeya with the boon of immortality. The original temple dated back to pre-Mahabharat times and was founded in the third millennium B.C. The current structure is more recent and dates back to the early 20th century. ==Days to visit== Pilgrims turn out to visit the Markandeshwar Mahadev temple in large numbers on Sundays and during the month of Shravan, which roughly corresponds to the months of July–August in the Julian calendar. The temple can be reached very easily and it is located 20 kilometers south of Ambala on the Ambala-Delhi section of the famous Grand Trunk Road.

At the age of twenty, he married Khadijah, daughter of Pesantren Siwalan Panji leader. One year later, they went to Mecca. After seven months, his wife was dead and also his son, Abdullah two months later. In 1899, he founded Pesantren Tebuireng, which later became the largest pesantren in Java in the early 20th century. The pesantren also became the center for the reform of traditional Islamic teaching. On 31 January 1926 he and several traditional Islamic leaders founded Nahdatul Ulama (Awakening of Ulamas). During the Japanese occupation era, he was arrested, several months later he was released and became Head of Religious Affairs. He died suddenly on 25 July 1947 due to hypertension, after hearing news that Dutch troops were winning a battle in Malang. ==Personal life== He married seven times and all of his wives were daughters of ulama.

Münzenberg spent most of his career with Alemannia Aachen (1927–1951) but also had spells with SV Werder Bremen and LSV Hamburg as a Wartime Guest Player. On the national level he played for Germany (41 matches, no goals), and was a participant at the 1934 and 1938 FIFA World Cups. Münzenberg was a member of the Breslau Eleven that beat Denmark 8–0 in Breslau in 1937 and went on to win 10 out 11 games played during that year. Münzenberg was considered to be one of the best and most athletic German defensive players of the 1930s. He started his career as a center half, a role in which the physically strong Münzenberg excelled, being one of the best headers of the ball of his time. After Germany had played at Wembley against England in 1935, the English press praised 'Steely' Münzenberg for his combination of toughness and technical ability, claiming that he played more 'English' than the English themselves. His reputation was one of athleticism and tremendous commitment. The first time Münzenberg made international football headlines, was after the 1934 World Cup third place game, when he marked the Czech goalgetter Josef Bican. By 1936, Münzenberg had been converted from center half to left back, another role in which excelled. The full back pairing of Paul Janes and Münzenberg became one of the best of the late-1930s in Europe. After he retired from football, Münzenberg became an architect. He died in 1986 only hours after having watched the World Cup semi final in which West Germany beat France 2–0.

This species used to constitute the monotypic genus Altigius, but molecular phylogenetic analyses have shown it to be close relative of the then-monotypic Hamptophryne, and the two genera have been merged. ==Etymology== The generic name Altigius honors Ronald Altig, specialist in amphibian larvae. The specific name alios is derived from the Latin words ala for \\"wing\\" and os for \\"mouth\\" and refers to the large, scalloped oral flaps pendant over the mouth of the tadpole. ==Description== The species description is based on a single adult male and series of tadpoles, one of them reared past metamorphosis. The adult male measures in snout–vent length. The head is broad but much narrower than body. The snout is rounded. The eyes are small. Skin is shagreen, and the occipital fold is complete. The fingers and toes have rounded tips and narrow fringes. Webbing is basal between the fingers and more developed between the toes. The dorsum is tan and mottled with dark brown. The venter is black with bluish-white flecks. The tadpoles grow to in length. The body and tail are dark chocolate brown. There is a creamy-tan middorsal stripe running from the snout to the tail. Two large, pendant flaps enclose the mouth dorsally and are presumably used for feeding. ==Habitat and conservation== Natural habitats of Hamptophryne alios are tropical moist lowland forests in association with temporary swamps and permanent waterbodies.

'Ander' Kupfer was one of the best half backs in the history of German football and is the only player to have played Germany's last international game before the end of World War II (played in 1942) and the first one after the war (in 1950). Kupfer became famous in German football as a left-footed right half and together with his Schweinfurt club colleague Albin Kitzinger formed the best half back duo in German football. Playing between the two- halves was center half Ludwig Goldbrunner and this trio was considered the best assembly of halves during the time Germany played the 2-3-5 system.Bitter, Jürgen. Deutschlands Fußball Nationalspieler, Sportverlag, 1997, p. 272. Kupfer was a player that fascinated the crowds with his elegant ways of playing. He was a master of kicking the ball with just moving his ankle joint. In 1938 he was called up to play for the Europe XI against England at Highbury Stadium on the occasion of the 75th anniversary of the Football Association. He finished his active career in 1954 after having played in over 650 games for 1. FC Schweinfurt 05. In his 1978 book Fussball, Helmut Schön characterised Kupfer as follows: As an outside half he was a player who certainly would be a regular in our midfield today. I would have been glad if we could have had a player like him in our ranks in Argentina. When he played behind me, with his hardness, deftness and pace, I felt absolutely safe upfront. Kupfer's left foot was stronger than his right; when he moved with the ball from the right side to the center, he played diagonal passes with his left foot towards the right wing, which tore apart the defense. An exceptionally gifted player. Kupfer was the last member of the Breslau Elf to die, in 2001. == Honours ==  Club  * Gauliga Bayern ** Champion: (2) 1938–39, 1941–42 ** Runner-up: (2) 1936–37, 1942–43 * Tschammerpokal ** Semi-finalist: 1936  Individual  * Europe XI selection: 1938 == Trivia == Alongside with Sepp Herberger and Fritz Walter, in 1942 Kupfer acted in the Robert A.

The dorsum bears a pattern of irregular dark brown spots on a gray- brown background. The legs are long. The tympanum is small and inconspicuous. The fingers and toes are unwebbed and have well-developed terminal discs. ==Habitat and conservation== Its natural habitats are lowland tropical forests. It is a leaf-litter species that breeds in soil cavities. It is a reasonably common species and although it can suffer locally from habitat loss, it also occurs in remote areas with little human influence, and is therefore not considered threatened. ==References== guttata Category:Amphibians of Papua New Guinea Category:Endemic fauna of Papua New Guinea Category:Taxa named by Richard G.

The snout is tapering to a sharply rounded tip but is rounded and slightly projecting in profile. The eyes are large. The tympanic annulus is obscure; a weak postorbital- supratympanic fold is present. The legs are short. The finger tips are flattened and disc-like, but only the disc of the third finger is broader than the penultimate phalanx; discs have somewhat broader discs. No webbing is present. The dorsum is light brown with obscure, small, darker markings and a dark mark above the cloacal opening. The snout is gray above, almost white on its tip. The chin and chest are dark brown with small light spots, in contrast to the pale abdomen irregularly spotted with brown. ==Habitat and conservation== The holotype was collected from Kosarek at above sea level. No further information on its habitat is available, but it presumably occurs in rainforest and has direct development (i.e, there is no free-living larval stage). Sufficient data to assess conservation status of this species are lacking. Threats to it are poorly known, but not much forest is left in the area of the type locality. ==References== kosarek Category:Amphibians of Western New Guinea Category:Endemic fauna of New Guinea Category:Endemic fauna of Indonesia Category:Amphibians described in 2000 Category:Taxa named by Richard G.

It is the only species in the monotypic genus Balebreviceps and endemic to the Bale Mountains of Ethiopia. Its natural habitats are tree heath (Erica arborea) woodland near the timberline as well as partly cleared mixed forest further down. Despite its entire range being within the Bale Mountains National Park, it is threatened by habitat loss and deterioration (deforestation) caused by cattle grazing, firewood collection, fencing, and settlement development. == Description == Balebreviceps hillmani is a stout bodied frog. They are most commonly referred to as the Bale Mountains tree frog or the Ethiopian short-headed frog. They have a smooth ventral side, except their throat, while their dorsal side is thick and pitted. The throat of this species is wrinkly. They have short but muscular legs and their toes lack webbing and have a reduced fifth toe. The males lack vocal sacs and the females lack auditory apparatuses, causing them to be unaware of airborne vibrations.Largen, M.J. and Drewes, R.C. (1989) A new genus and species of brevicipitine frog (Amphibia, Anura, Microhylidae) from high altitude in the mountains of Ethiopia. Tropical Zoology, 2(1): 13-30. A unique feature of this tree frog is their structured palate. They are purple or brown in color with a pair of yellow/golden stripes. == Geographic range and population == The Bale Mountains tree frog is native and endemic to Ethiopia, specifically to Harenna in the Bale Mountains. The current population is continuing to decline since the late 1980s. There is also a decline specifically in the number of mature individuals. The population size is very low and this species is critically endangered. == Habitat == This species is known to live in one woodland, Erica arborea. They are found under logs, boulders, compost, and mosses growing on branches. There has been a continuous decline in the quality of their habitat. Their environment is humid and has a wet season from March until October. The tree frog is normally found above ground, but also fits into small crevices.Largen, M.J. (2001) Catalogue of the amphibians of Ethiopia, including a key for their identification. Tropical Zoology, 14: 307-402. == Breeding == This species lives an entire terrestrial life cycle. This species is believed to build a terrestrial nest to lay its eggs. The eggs do not undergo an aquatic larval stage, and instead they hatch as smaller versions of the adults. == Threats == The major threats to this species are habitat degradation, deforestation, and human encroachment. The degradation is mainly due to the growing human population, and the deforestation is due to the collection of firewood. The growth in population leads to overgrazing and agricultural development. A fungus, the Chytrid, has been found in this species, but no effects are known. When threatened, this species appears larger to its competition. The frog stretches its limbs, stands raised, and inflates his body with air. Predators and desiccation are minimal threats because the frogs are found at such high elevations and moist environments. == Conservation actions == Their habitat is a protected area and has a conservation program, but lacks management. There needs to be an improvement in management in order to protect the habitats from exploitation. The population should also be monitored since it is a critically endangered species whose population is declining continuously. Climate change and diseases should also be monitored to prevent future problems.Gascon, C., Collins, J.P. Moore, R.D., Church, D.R., McKay, J.E. and Mendelson III, J.R.

Coloration is dark brown or mud-brown, speckled with black or with obscure darker brown markings. Sometimes they can be uniform dark brown, or have a broad mud-brown vertebral stripe. Males call at night from beneath the surface of the soil. The call is a rapid series of 4–9 boops. ==Habitat and conservation== Its natural habitats are primary or secondary lowland rainforests and cloudforests, and have been found at altitudes up to above sea level. It is a fossorial species that can be moderately common several centimeters beneath the soil surface. Development is presumably direct (i.e, there is no free-living larval stage). The species is not facing major threats. It is utilized on Tagula for magic purposes—to provide fertility to land if planted—but the level of utilization is likely too low to constitute a major threat. ==References== exsul Category:Amphibians of Papua New Guinea Category:Endemic fauna of Papua New Guinea Category:Amphibians described in 1963 Category:Taxa named by Richard G.

It is found in Southern Africa, in Angola, Namibia, Botswana, Zambia, Zimbabwe, South Africa, Eswatini, and Mozambique. ==Description== The common rain frog lives underground, only emerging to feed and mate after a rain, usually at nighttime. Its body is stout and globular, with a grumpy face. The color of this species is either day or night brown, with rows of lighter tan orange patches, with blue borders. It also has the short, stout limbs typical of most burrowing frogs and toads. However, its back feet are like spades and are able to dig up to 20 inches below underground. If attacked, the frog inflates and lodges itself firmly inside of the burrow. These beautiful little creatures can be caught gently and easily by hand in the rain. Once on your palm, they inflate, and if tilted slightly, they spread out their fore- and hindlegs to keep from sliding. They also walk, rather than hop, quite quickly. The females are also much larger than males. Since the male cannot grip the female during mating because of the size difference, the female secretes a kind of glue from her back to keep the mating pair together. The stuck-together pair burrow backwards into the soil until they reach a moist spot. Once a suitable spot is reached, the female lays her eggs. The eggs hatch directly into froglets instead of tadpoles. They are 1½ to 2¼ inches long (3 to 6 centimeters). The common rain frog inhabits temperate forests and open grasslands of southeast Africa. They are a terrestrial species. These frogs only breed in the rainy season. The population of this species is stable, and listed as \\"locally common\\". == Diet== The common rain frog eats insects and termites. Babies often eat caterpillars. First, the adult smacks the bug's head, and this is called dapping. Then they locate the insect. After locating, they use their sticky tongues to lap up the insect. ==References== Category:Breviceps Category:Frogs of Africa Category:Amphibians of Angola Category:Amphibians of Botswana Category:Amphibians of Eswatini Category:Amphibians of Mozambique Category:Amphibians of Namibia Category:Amphibians of South Africa Category:Amphibians of Zambia Category:Amphibians of Zimbabwe Category:Taxa named by Wilhelm Peters Category:Amphibians described in 1882 Category:Taxonomy articles created by Polbot ","title":"Breviceps adspersus"},{"id":"12397857","text":"Bilbo's rain frog (Breviceps bagginsi) is an amphibian species in the family Brevicipitidae, endemic to South Africa. It was named after Bilbo Baggins, because the scientist who discovered it used to read The Hobbit to his children. Its natural habitats are temperate grassland and edges of wood plantations. The species, threatened by habitat loss, is listed as Near Threatened in the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species. == Description == Breviceps bagginsi is a mycrohylid (narrow-mouthed) frog from the family of Brevicipitidae discovered in the year 2003. The body size of male individuals varies from 20–25.9 mm and females measure approximately 28.7 mm in length. With its highly truncated snout it is well adapted to its burrowing lifestyle. They have a characteristic tympanic membrane and their pupil is horizontally ecliptic. The dorsum of Breviceps bagginsi has a medium to dark brown, fairly granular skin texture with darkly pigmented tubercles, each containing openings of 2-6 dermal glands. The ventrum is smooth and of light color. From the eye to the origin of the arm Breviceps bagginsi have a black stripe. They have a lighter bar between the eyes and a white stripe from the lower eyelid to the mouth. The sides of the body are brown with a few white spreckles. As all species from Brevicipitidae, Breviceps bagginsi lack sphenethmoids. == Distribution, habitat and ecology == Breviceps bagginsi only occur in South Africa. They live on edges of wood plantations in Kwazulu-Natal midlands of southeastern South Africa, along the mist belt from Boston in the west to Melmoth, in the north-east and down to the coast at Mkambati. They occur in an elevation range of 25–1400 m ASL (meters above sea level). The Mkambati area is protected due to its biodiversity and therefore high conservation value. The Breviceps bagginsi population in this area lives in undisturbed grasslands. == Behavior == As a member of the genus Breviceps, Breviceps bagginsi shows sexual dimorphism. The males are much smaller than the females. Unlike other frogs Breviceps males have very short limbs relative to their body size. Therefore, they are not able to amplex the females while the process of mating, but with an adhesive secretion they can adhere to the body of the female. Their advertisement call has two different call bouts, both at a frequency of 2552 Hz. Breeding occurs in subterranean nests. Offspring hatches fully developed from eggs directly. == Status == On the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species Breviceps bagginsi was listed as data deficient until 2010. In 2017 it was relisted as Near Threatened because of the small area of occurrence (11'000 km2) and the declining area of occupancy, which is only 10% of the occurrence (1'100 km2). Although their occupancy is declining, their occurrence remains the same. Furthermore, Breviceps bagginsi live in extremely fragmented subpopulations and the quality of their habitat is decreasing due to sylviculture and construction and maintenance of roads. Subpopulation sizes are around 20-30 individuals. Distances between subpopulations are too long to allow dissemination within one generation. ==References== Category:Breviceps Category:Endemic amphibians of South Africa Category:Amphibians described in 2003 Category:Taxonomy articles created by Polbot ","title":"Bilbo's rain frog"},{"id":"12397859","text":"Breviceps fichus is a species of frog in the family Brevicipitidae.

The center of the district and the oldest building is the 1850 courthouse designed in the popular Italianate style so prevalent in the Victorian era. The courthouse was once the only building in this group, but the increasing population and confined spaces forced the county to develop the area into a judicial and administrative campus. Ashtabula County was settled around 1796 and was part of the Connecticut Western Reserve of the Northwest Territory. The county was officially established by the Ohio General Assembly in 1807 with the county seat located in Jefferson. A courthouse was constructed around the same time and was completed in 1811. The building was two stories high and was a simple brick structure. This building lasted until 1836 when it was razed for the construction of a new courthouse. The second courthouse was designed by architect Willis Smith from Kinsman. The structure is basically the same in appearance as the courthouse still standing. A fire burnt some of the structure in 1850 and it was rebuilt mostly true to the original design, although the dormers piercing the roofline were removed. It was around this time that the row house known as Lawyers Row was built. The growing population soon demanded a more spacious courthouse and instead of demolishing the 1850 courthouse, a new one was built to house the probate court in 1870, while the county courts and administration remained in the old courthouse. In 1960 the county was again faced with the challenge of providing more room for the county government. The county decided on building a new structure. This new courthouse is a glass and masonry building with a Justice Center addition built in the 1970s. ==Buildings== The district contains 4 contributing buildings: Old Courthouse The courthouse is located at the corner of North Chestnut and West Jefferson Streets and was completed in 1850. The building was built on the framework of an earlier courthouse from 1836 which was destroyed by a fire. The courthouse is designed in the Italianate style and is built with red brick and stone. Long rectangle windows with white trim dot the walls. The hipped roof contains several dormers for extra light to the top floor. A tower projects from the facade on Jefferson Street and houses the entrance framed by four columns with exaggerated bulbous bases. The tower is crowned with a decorative cap consisting of spires and a mansard roof. The courthouse once housed all of the county offices but after several additions the courthouse houses the county administrative offices. The County Commissioners now use old Probate Courtroom for an office and hearing room. New Courthouse An addition is located behind the courthouse and was built in 1960 by architects Kujala and Koski. The building is built with red brick with white window and door trim matching the original courthouse. This building is now considered as the official county courthouse. Justice Center Justice Center Around the same time the International style Justice Center was also constructed on the property. The Justice Center houses the police departments and sheriff offices. The building is also built with red brick with white door and window trim, with a projected entrance tower. The tower is three stories and is topped with an arched roof with large rectangular windows to illuminate the entrance bay below. Large glass walls connect the entrance projection to the rest of the building. The flat roof is hidden behind a solid balustrade. Lawyers Row A long building rests beside the old courthouse and divides the property in half. This building is known as Lawyers Row and resembles a train station. The building is white painted wood construction with large windows and deep overhanging eaves with brackets. A \\"boardwalk\\" spans the entire length of the building connecting the offices together. ==Historic uses== *Professional *CourthouseThrane, Susan W., County Courthouses of Ohio, Indiana University Press, Indianapolis, Indiana 2000 ==See also== * Benjamin Wade ==ReferencesFurther reading== *Thrane, Susan W., County Courthouses of Ohio, Indiana University Press, Indianapolis, Indiana 2000 *Marzulli, Lawrence J., The Development of Ohio's Counties and Their Historic Courthouses, Gray Printing Company, Fostoria, Ohio 1983 *Stebbins, Clair, Ohio's Court Houses, Ohio State Bar Association, Columbus, Ohio 1980 ==External links== *Official Website Category:Courthouses on the National Register of Historic Places in Ohio Category:Historic districts on the National Register of Historic Places in Ohio Category:County courthouses in Ohio Category:Buildings and structures in Ashtabula County, Ohio Category:National Register of Historic Places in Ashtabula County, Ohio ","title":"Ashtabula County Courthouse Group"},{"id":"12397953","text":"Metalink was an Israeli-based hi-tech company specializing in silicon solutions for wireless and wireline broadband communications.

It was listed in the National Register on August 8, 1983. ==History== The first light marking Ashtabula's harbor was built in 1836, a short hexagonal wooden tower standing on a wooden crib just off the eastern pier. This used the oil lamps typical of the time and remained in service until replaced by a new tower on the west pier, a pyramidal tower with clapboard sides. This change was prompted by changes in the harbor configuration. The new light was equipped with a fourth-order Fresnel lens, exhibiting a red light. Keepers lived in a frame house in town. This tower was moved in 1882 but remained in service. In 1905 the Ashtabula River mouth was widened and breakwater constructed, prompting construction of the third light, the structure that exists today. This building was originally placed 1750 feet SSE of its present location, but was moved and enlarged in 1915, placed on a concrete crib at the end of the north breakwater. The new house, built of steel and iron plate, afforded living quarters for the keepers. At the same time a new fourth-order lens was mounted in the tower. The old light was by this time left standing by itself, sixty feet from shore. The new light's exposed position made it vulnerable to various assaults. In 1927 it was struck by a steamship, shifting it six inches off its base. The following year, however, a more famous incident occurred. An ice storm completely encased the light, trapping the keepers inside. After two days they managed to thaw the front door sufficiently to get it open, only to have to tunnel to through some five feet of ice in order to escape. The light was the last Great Lakes light to be manned, and was finally automated in 1973. The original keeper's house was deeded to the city in the same year, but returned to federal ownership in 1976 due to a lack of funds to complete a plan to convert the building to a museum. In 1982 the building again passed into private hands and was opened in 1984 as the Ashtabula Marine Museum. The lighthouse itself continued in service, even as the breakwater was extended past it. The Fresnel lens was replaced with a modern beacon and given to the museum in 1995. Cleveland resident Jim Woodward, one of only four men in the U.S. who can properly be called “lampists,” (one who is qualified to repair and restore the classical Fresnel lighthouse lenses) restored the lens. He is the only one of the four who apprenticed under a lampist in the old United States Lighthouse Service. D'Entremont, Jeremy (03/2006) 109-year-old Ashtabula Lens Restored by Lampist Jim Woodward. Lighthouse Digest. In 2003 a society was formed to take possession of the light under the National Historic Lighthouse Preservation Act, and they applied for the light when it was offered in the following year. They assumed control of the light in 2007 and began a program of restoration with the intent of making the lighthouse available for public tours. In May 2008 they received a grant to allow them to construct a floating dock, necessary since all access to the light is by water. The Society has in fact acquired the light.Ashtabula Lighthouse Preservation and Restoration Society. == References Further reading== * Oleszewski, Wes.

Comprising a commercial section near the city's Lake Erie waterfront, the district includes buildings constructed largely in the late nineteenth century, at which time Ashtabula was a flourishing port city. Most of the buildings in the district were constructed between 1865 and 1878, although occasional buildings were erected in the early 1900s. The district's area has long been commercial; from its earliest years, the street running through the district was known as Bridge Street, because it terminates at a bridge spanning the Ashtabula River. Until it became part of the city of Ashtabula in the 1870s, Ashtabula Harbour was a separate municipality (it lies two miles north of the city's downtown), and Bridge Street its commercial sector.Owen, Lorrie K., ed.

Designs include examples of the Italianate, Queen Anne, and Neoclassical styles, while the construction materials are primarily brick with occasional frame structures. The Ashtabula Harbour Commercial District was designated in 1975 and listed on the National Register of Historic Places at the same time, qualifying both because of its historically significant architecture and because of its place in area history; it gained this designation largely because it retains its late nineteenth-century appearance as a flourishing harbor's business district. Seventy-five contributing properties are located within the district's boundaries. In 1978, the city government created the Ashtabula Harbor Historical District, a substantially larger area including numerous residential streets as well as the federally designated commercial street. Since 2010, the city district's boundaries have extended from the river bridge to Lake Avenue and from Morton Drive along the river to the Walnut Beach Park on the lake.

As the connecting point between the two modes of transportation, its train station was a central part of the life of the village and of the surrounding Harrison Township. In 1876, the short- lived Scioto Valley Railway erected a new station in Ashville; its construction helped to make the newly founded village the most important community in northern Pickaway County. After a century of use, the depot was closed in 1976.

The depot was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1980, qualifying because of its historic architecture and its important place in local history; among the reasons it qualified was its status as the only extant train station built by the Scioto Valley Railway.

One of several agricultural buildings associated with the hospital, it has been named a historic site. The Athens State Hospital was founded in 1874, pursuant to legislation enacted seven years prior. Within three years, the hospital was contracting with a local blacksmith to buy milk from his dairy, but by the early twentieth century, this arrangement had proven inconvenient, and in 1912 the hospital bought the farm associated with the dairy operation. Two years later, the present cow barn was erected near the old farmhouse. This was a time of expansion for the hospital complex, which retains numerous buildings from the beginning of the twentieth century; like much of the rest of the hospital, the cow barn displays Colonial Revival architectural influences, unlike the substantially older farmhouse next door.Owen, Lorrie K., ed. Dictionary of Ohio Historic Places. Vol. 2. St. Clair Shores: Somerset, 1999, 40. The barn itself is a linear concrete building with some shingles on the walls, a concrete foundation, and a slate-covered gambrel roof. Three towers are placed on the roofline, while dormer windows pierce the lower part of the roof at regular intervals. A prominent entryway is set in the middle of the long side of the building, with six window-filled bays to each side., Ohio Historical Society, 2007. Accessed 2014-02-24. In 1978, the old cow barn was listed on the National Register of Historic Places, qualifying both because of its place in local history and because of its historically significant architecture. Two years later, much of the state hospital complex was designated a historic district and listed on the Register, but the cow barn was not included, as it lies away from the rest of the complex.Rock, Lois J.

It was built in 1841 and incorporates elements of both the Federal and Greek Revival styles and stands over tall. The church has had a continuous congregation that was founded in 1818 and continues to meet today as a non-denominational church. The building has undergone several renovations and repairs through the years. ==History== The congregation was organized on March 20, 1818 by Reverend Caleb Pitkin, William Hanford, and Joseph Treat and was placed under the see of the Grand River Presbytery with 11 members attending the charter service. 22 new members were added the following year and meetings were held in the home of a parishioner. In 1822, a small brick church was constructed near the current church site. The congregation continued to meet there until it was decided to build a larger building in the fall of 1836. Construction began in 1838 and the completed structure was dedicated on November 7, 1841. On November 14, 1841, Reverend E. C. Sharp preached his first sermon in the new building. After the death of Reverend Sharp, the congregation voted to leave the Cleveland Portage Presbytery on May 20, 1870. A new constitution was drafted in 1871 which made it a Congregational church. The name became \\"The Congregational Church of Christ in Atwater\\". In 1877, the church underwent repairs, at the cost of $1,548.01, and was re-dedicated and in 1896, plaster began falling from the interior dome so a flat ceiling was assembled. In 1920, the basement was refurbished to make it suitable for meetings and other functions. At the same time, electric lights were installed in the sanctuary, replacing the 16 oil lamps which hung from the ceiling. When the renovations were completed, a festival was held which was attended by at least 1000 people from as far away as Fort Wayne, Indiana. In 1933, the church was repainted by M. C. Hall. A year later chimes were installed. Another renovation was begun in 1944. The dome was restored and electric lights were fitted in a circle around the dome. A re-dedication service was held 10 years later on June 6, 1954. A new roof was installed in 1964 and the steeple was repaired in 1967. In 1980, a new asphalt shingle roof was installed. In 2001, another restoration was initiated. Beginning in 2005, the church underwent a major renovation which was completed in 2007. Funding for the restoration was made available through a large donation from the estate of former pastor Fred Hofer. == Historic uses == *Religious structure == References External links== *Atwater Congregational Church official website Category:Churches on the National Register of Historic Places in Ohio Category:Churches in Portage County, Ohio Category:National Register of Historic Places in Portage County, Ohio ","title":"Atwater Congregational Church"},{"id":"12398066","text":"Sheikh Khabir Uddin Ahmed, a politician from Communist Party of India (Marxist), is a Member of the Parliament of India representing West Bengal in the Rajya Sabha, the upper house of the Parliament. ==External links== * Profile on Rajya Sabha website Category:Communist Party of India (Marxist) politicians from West Bengal Category:Rajya Sabha members from West Bengal Category:Living people Category:Year of birth missing (living people) ","title":"Sheikh Khabir Uddin Ahmed"},{"id":"12398075","text":"The Auglaize County Courthouse is located between West Mechanic, Willipie, West Pearl and Perry Streets in downtown Wapakoneta, Ohio, United States. Completed in 1894, it is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. ==History== Auglaize County was formed in 1848 and Wapakoneta was chosen by the voters as the county seat. This caused many bad feelings from St. Marys, the other choice for the county seat, as they had already planned an area for the courthouse along appropriately named Court Street. The county's first courthouse was the Methodist Episcopal church. A frame building completed in 1834, it was used by the county in exchange for the free provision of a pulpit for the congregation.McMurray, William J., ed. History of Auglaize County Ohio. Vol. 1. Indianapolis: Historical Publishing Company, 1923, 325. Until the county's first permanent courthouse was built in 1854, the courts rotated around the city's various churches, and the local government officials used rented rooms in buildings throughout Wapakoneta. The first purpose-built courthouse was a Greek Revival style structure of red brick and white trim window and door frames. Two Corinthian columns framed the entrance and supported a pedimented roof above. A rectangular drum rose above the roof which contained corinthian column supports and was capped with a dome with a spire. A larger courthouse was needed and the county constructed a new courthouse in 1894. The courthouse was built with bonds authorized by the Ohio General Assembly, but changes to the plans more than doubled the cost. Renovation subtly changed the interior, such as an elevator, but the courthouse remains true to its original plans. ==Exterior== The current courthouse was constructed from 1893 to 1894 by the architectural firm Kremer & Hart. The building is built with local stone and has a rusticated base with smooth stone from the second floor up. The first floor has square windows in groups of three and blends into the second floor. The second floor is the main floor and is illuminated by large rectangular windows. The entrance is a projection on the eastern facade and is reached by a flight of stairs, three large arches support a balcony above. The balcony contains four Corinthian columns supporting the gabled roof above. The other entrances are also reached by a flight of stairs to a covered porch with supportive Corinthian columns and a balcony with a balustrade. A frieze separates the second floor from the third. Large arched windows light the third floor with a decorative frieze beneath the roof. The roof rises at various points to support a square drum with a central octagonal tower with a balustrade surrounding the base. Large arched windows are surrounded by Corinthian pilasters that support a decorative frieze and a four-face clock facing the cardinal points. The tower is capped by a dome with a central spire. The tower was once graced with a statue of Justice overlooking the main entrance to the east. The community of St. Marys found this offensive, as they had the back of Justice to them and raised money to have her turned to the north. The statue was slowly deteriorating to a point where it had to be removed due to safety reasons. The only parts salvaged from the original Justice were the head, right hand, and sword. In 1994, in time for the centennial of the courthouse, the Auglaize County Historical Society raised money to restore the statue through a project called \\"Copper Pennies for a Copper Lady\\" which raised over $25,000. The statue now stands in the Great Hall facing north, holding a sword in her right hand and the balances of justice in her left. The base of the pedestal contains a time capsule to be opened in 2094, one item being the names of the donors for the restoration of the statue. ==ReferencesFurther reading== *Thrane, Susan W., County Courthouses of Ohio, Indiana University Press, Indianapolis, Indiana 2000 *Marzulli, Lawrence J., The Development of Ohio's Counties and Their Historic Courthouses, Gray Printing Company, Fostoria, Ohio 1983 *Stebbins, Clair, Ohio's Court Houses, Ohio State Bar Association, Columbus, Ohio 1980 ==External links== *Official county website *History of the Auglaize County Courthouse Category:National Register of Historic Places in Auglaize County, Ohio Category:Government buildings completed in 1894 Category:County courthouses in Ohio Category:Courthouses on the National Register of Historic Places in Ohio Category:Buildings and structures in Wapakoneta, Ohio Category:Clock towers in Ohio Category:1894 establishments in Ohio ","title":"Auglaize County Courthouse"},{"id":"12398080","text":"Mohammed Amin (15 April 1928 - 12 February 2018) was an Indian politician from the Communist Party of India (Marxist), the largest communist party in India. He was a Vice President of the Centre of Indian Trade Unions. He was a member of the Parliament of India representing West Bengal in the Rajya Sabha, the upper house of the Indian Parliament from 1988-1994. He was also the All India General Secretary of the Centre of Indian Trade Unions, the workers union politically affiliated to the Communist Party of India (Marxist). == Early life == He was born to an Urdu-speaking family at Shibpur in April 1928. His grandfather Abdur Rehman hailed from Varanasi District and was an farmer, who had left for Karachi and had then settled at Shibpur. Amin's father was brought up by a vindictive step-mother. Amin's mother hailed from Bhagalpur District. When Amin was 8 years, he was one of two boys in his neighbourhood who survived an epidemic of smallpox. He had no formal education. He became a jute mill worker in 1942 at a time when Calcutta was experiencing regular bombardments during the World War II. His wage was then Rs. 7 and 13 annah per 1100 yards of jute. He worked entire day, and had some English education at a night school. He became a member of the Bengal Jute Mill Mazdoor Union at that time. After the end of World War II in 1945, he left his job and joined politics. ==Career==  Introduction to politics  In 1946 when he was only 18, he had earned the membership of Communist Party of India on the same day along with Chandra Roy. On 29 July 1946, he attended a huge rally at Maidan on the call of Bengal Provincial Trade Union Congress (BPTUC), a state wing of All India Trade Union Congress (AITUC), on a day when a successful strike was organised under the call of BPTUC. He had also experienced the riots of Calcutta in 1946-47 till independence. He had married in March 1948. His father-in-law died to cholera after 6 months, and after another 6 months his mother died to tetanus.  Riots of 1950, migration to East Pakistan, imprisonment & return to India  On 29 March, Alambazar of Kolkata experienced another bloody riot following massive influx of refugees from East Pakistan after 1950 Barisal Riots. Within hours of an attack on a Bengali Hindu by a Muslim whose family was slaughtered by Hindus on previous night, riots spread and around 5000 Muslims had taken refuge on the roof of Baranagar jute mill. Ten Muslims were murdered including a woman. At that point, the Communist Party of India (CPI) leadership had instructed the party members to move to East Pakistan. On 7 April, Amin along with his family boarded a special train from Dakshineswar towards Gede via Ranaghat and then reached Darshana by walking 12 km across the border. From there, they took a train to reach Parbatipur in Dinajpur district. They had stayed as refugee in Dinajpur till October 1950, and had even organised a mass rally there and was subsequently warned by police. He came back to India, but was again re- instructed by his party in March 1951 to organise the party at Saidpur in East Pakistan. In September, he was arrested in Badarganj for being a Communist under Section 7/3, Public Safety Act. On 12 November 1953 he was released from Rangpur jail after 20 months of detention. He returned to Titagarh immediately. He was made a member of Titagarh Local Committee of the CPI. He started movement with the Beedi Mazdoor Union at Titagarh and then as the organiser at a jute mill at Khardaha. While organising trade union in Britannia Engineering Ltd. in Titagarh, he was assisted by Suren Dhar Chowdhury, Sunil Roy, Dr. Girijamohon Chatterjee (an influential MBBS doctor). In 1957 assembly elections, Amin was entrusted by his party to Bhatpara and ensured that CPI's candidate Sitaram Gupta defeated Indian National Congress candidate by 240 votes. In 1962 assembly elections, Suren Dhar Chowdhury was the CPI's candidate & he lost the elections by around 2000 votes to Krishnakant Shukla who became MLA for 3rd time. In 1964, when the communist party split, Amin joined the newly formed Communist Party of India (Marxist) CPI(M) with most of the workers though Suren Dhar Chowdhury and Sunil Roy stayed loyal to the CPI.  Introduction to legislative politics  In 1967 assembly elections, Amin was made the CPI(M) candidate at Titagarh and though Promode Dasgupta campaigned for him, yet Amin lost the election due to cross- voting between the Communists. Suren Dhar Chowdhury, the CPI's candidate got 11000 votes, Amin got 17400 & Indian National Congress candidate Krishnakant Shukla won by 700 votes. On the request of Dasgupta, Amin left his job of Rs. 1000 salary & became a party whole-timer. In 1969, Amin won the assembly elections from Titagarh and in February 1970, he was made the Minister of Transport to the United Front government led by Ajoy Mukherjee. After 13 months of the 1969 assembly elections, the government was disbanded and in the 1971 assembly elections, Amin won beating horrific semi-fascist terror as administration had turned deaf & dumb. His residence was bombarded. In 1971, in the West Bengal State Conference of CPI(M) at Midnapore, he was elected as a member of the West Bengal State Committee. 1972 assembly elections in West Bengal can be described as a farce and a mockery of democracy as terror of unforeseen proportions were unleashed. Amin lost elections by 40,000 votes and Jyoti Basu lost by 50,000 votes. Amin kept his family at Ranchi and returned to Calcutta. Kishan Mazdoor, the Urdu weekly of CPI(M) resumed its publication under his patronage. He brought back his family to Calcutta. In 1969 8th party congress at Cochin, he was a delegate. In 1977 assembly elections, CPI(M) won with a sweeping majority and formed the Left Front government led by Jyoti Basu. Amin was re-elected from Titagarh defeating municipal Chairman Gangaprasad Show by a margin of 13000. Amin the Minister of Transport in this 1st Left Front government. As a minister, he had sold an eight-seated helicopter owned by the West Bengal Govt, and with that money bought double- decker buses to improve public transport in Calcutta. He gave permit to several new routes for SBSTC, private bus, minibus & long-route buses. He had also successfully implemented the launch & steamer service in the Hooghly Riverways whose initiative was taken in his early stint during the United Front government. As an MLA, he made sure that the state government acquisitioned the Britannia Engg. Ltd. at Titagarh and re-instate all its workers with less than 58 years age. The Kennison Jute Mill at Titagarh was also acquisitioned by the Govt. of India after it was shut down by the Bard & Co. In 1982 assembly elections, Amin was however defeated at Titagarh by 132 votes. In the same year, he was co-opted into the Central Committee of the party. In 12th party congress at Calcutta in 1985, he was elected as a member of the Central Committee along with Anil Biswas, Biman Bose and Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee. In 1984 parliament elections, he was launched as a candidate from Barrackpore (Lok Sabha constituency). However, he lost as Indian National Congress gained sympathy votes following the assassination of Prime Minister Indira Gandhi. He lost assembly elections from Titagarh again in 1987 as Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi declared that if Congress wins at Titagarh, he would ensure that all the closed mills & factories would be re-opened. In 1988, he was nominated as a candidate by his party into the Rajya Sabha and remained as an MP till 1994, and re-located to New Delhi. In 1996, Amin was made a CPI(M) candidate from Garden Reach, a constituency which has deluded the Left Front candidate thrice in a row. Amin won the seat by a whopping 14,000 votes and was made a Minister of Minorities Affairs & Development. After Rekha Bera, the Minister of Employment & E.S.I died, Amin was given additional charge of that ministry. In 1998, Amin was made a Secretariat member of CPI(M) West Bengal State Committee. In 2001 assembly elections, Amin was re-elected from Garden Reach by a margin of 32,000 votes. He was made a Minister of Labour to the 6th Left Front government led by Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee as his predecessor Shanti Ghatak became ill before the elections, and died soon after. In 2005, his wife Moimunnisa died. In 2006 assembly elections, though Left Front increased the seats & votes, yet Amin lost surprisingly from Garden Reach. In 2007, he was elected General Secretary of the Centre of Indian Trade Unions from the 12th Conference at Bangalore held from 17–21 January. M. K. Pandhe was re-elected as the President. In March 2010, at the 13th Conference of Centre of Indian Trade Unions, Amin was succeeded by Tapan Sen as the General Secretary as Amin was becoming increasingly ill. Amin was made the Vice President. At the 2012, in the 20th party congress at Kozhikode (4 April-9 April), he was made a Special Invitee to the Central Committee. ==Death== He died on February 12, 2018 at the age of 89 at his home in Kolkata. ==References== Category:Communist Party of India (Marxist) politicians from West Bengal Category:Rajya Sabha members from West Bengal Category:West Bengal MLAs 1969–1971 Category:West Bengal MLAs 1971–1972 Category:West Bengal MLAs 1972–1977 Category:West Bengal MLAs 1977–1982 Category:Indian Muslims Category:1928 births Category:2018 deaths Category:Trade unionists from West Bengal ","title":"Mohammed Amin (politician)"},{"id":"12398081","text":"Wolfgang Peters (8 January 1929 – 22 September 2003) was a German football player.

At the time of crisis of Islam, his books successfully bring out some very important issues regarding its relevance in today's world, and discuss at length its concordance with different phenomena in the world history and how this religion evolved through such events. ==Political career== Chairman, ( i) Murshidabad District Central Co-operative Bank,1991–94, (ii) West Bengal State Co-operative Bank,1994–98, (iii) National Federation of State Co- operative Bank,1996-98 (iv) West Bengal Small Industries Development Corporation (WBSIDC)2004-2009, 1998- 99 Member, Twelfth Lok Sabha Oct. 1999- Feb. 2004 Member, Thirteenth Lok Sabha April 2006 Elected to Rajya Sabha June - Aug. 2006 Member, Committee on Science and Technology, Environment and Forests Aug. 2006- May 2009 Member, Committee on Commerce June 2007-May 2009 and Aug. 2009 onwards Member, Committee on Finance June 2007 onwards Member, Court of the Aligarh Muslim University Sept. 2006- May 2009 Member, Consultative Committee for the Ministry of Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises Sept. 2006- Dec. 2010 Member, Committee on Petitions Sept. 2006 onwards Member, Committee on Members of Parliament Local Area Development Scheme (MPLADS) Jan. 2007-June 2007 Member, Sub-Committee for Special Economic Zones of the Committee on Commerce Aug. 2009 onwards Member, National Monitoring Committee for Minorities' Education Member, Consultative Committee for the Ministry of Textiles April 2010 onwards Chief Whip, CPI (M) Group December 2010 onwards Member, Committee on Government Assurances.

Adults grow up to 45 mm in length. It was the first African frog species to be scientifically described by Carl Linnaeus in 1758, under the name Rana gibbosa. It is the most common and largest of rain frogs. ==Distribution and habitat== At Cape Town The species is endemic to South Africa, where it occurs in the far southwestern Cape, in Cape Town and northwards as far as Citrusdal. In this area it inhabits Mediterranean- type shrubby vegetation, known as fynbos, renosterveld, pastureland on farms, rural gardens, and even urban areas. It seems to adapt well to suburban gardens, but like most frog species it is vulnerable to herbicide poisons and domestic pets.South African Frog Re-assessment Group (SA-FRoG), IUCN SSC Amphibian Specialist Group, 2010. Breviceps gibbosus. In: IUCN 2012. IUCN Red List of Threatened Species. Version 2012.2. ==Ecology== The Cape rain frog lives underground and usually emerges just before rains (whence it got its common name). It may also be seen in misty or damp conditions. Its burrowing provides a role in aerating soil in the southwestern Cape. It feeds on worms and small insects. When alarmed, it increases its apparent size by swallowing air; hence the species is given the Afrikaans common name of blaasoppie. As burrowing frogs, they have thick, muscular legs, which enable them to burrow for shelter. This species does not require open water to breed; in fact, it cannot swim and will drown if placed in water. ==Breeding== During mating season, males call from beneath vegetation or from their burrows so that the females can locate them. Since he is too small to get a firm grip on the female, she secretes a sticky liquid that glues him to her back. Fertilisation takes place in a burrow that the female has dug where groups of approximately 22 eggs are laid. They lay fertile eggs and jelly capsules, which provide moisture for the developing froglets. The females will remain burrowed near the eggs until they become young froglets without undergoing the tadpole stage. ==Conservation== Then species is currently classified as near threatened by the IUCN. The main threats consist of ongoing habitat loss in the diminishing fynbos biomes, through the expansion of urban sprawl and agriculture. ==References== Category:Breviceps Category:Endemic amphibians of South Africa Category:Amphibians described in 1758 Category:Taxa named by Carl Linnaeus Category:Taxonomy articles created by Polbot ","title":"Cape rain frog"},{"id":"12398141","text":"The desert rain frog, web-footed rain frog, or Boulenger's short-headed frog (Breviceps macrops) is a species of frog in the family Brevicipitidae. It is found in Namibia and South Africa. Its natural habitat is the narrow strip of sandy shores between the sea and the sand dunes. It is threatened by habitat loss by such factors as mining and tourism. ==Description== The desert rain frog is a small, plump species with bulging eyes, a short snout, short limbs, spade-like feet and webbed toes. On the underside it has a transparent area of skin through which its internal organs can be seen. The size of this frog can span between . Its colour is yellowish-brown and often has sand adhering to its skin. It also has an unusual high-pitched cry similar to that of a squeaky toy. Unlike most other species of frogs, it develops directly from the egg into adults without passing through the tadpole stage. It has a stout body, with small legs, which makes it unable to hop or leap – instead, it walks around on the sand. The frog does not require water in its habitat to survive. The frog possesses comparatively large bulging eyes. ==Habitat== The desert rain frog is mostly found on a small coastal strip of land about wide between the African countries of Namibia and South Africa. The small area of sand dunes often gets a lot of fog, which supplies moisture in an otherwise arid and dry region. ==Behavior== The desert rain frog is nocturnal, spending the day in a burrow which is dug to a depth of where the sand is moist. It emerges on both foggy and clear nights and wanders about over the surface of the dunes. Its footprints are distinctive and are often found around patches of dung where it is presumed to feed on moths, beetles and insect larvae. It digs its way into the sand in the morning, and its presence in a locality can be deduced from the little pile of loose sand dislodged by its burrowing activities. Breeding is by direct development of eggs laid in its burrow, and there is no aqueous tadpole stage. It produces a high-pitched squeaking sound when provoked. ==Status== The frog's total habitat range is smaller than and is fragmented and the number of individual frogs seems to be decreasing. It is threatened by habitat loss caused by opencast diamond mining and road construction, as well as increased human settlement. ==ReferencesExternal links== * Category:Breviceps Category:Frogs of Africa Category:Amphibians of Namibia Category:Amphibians of South Africa Category:Amphibians described in 1907 Category:Taxa named by George Albert Boulenger Category:Viral videos Category:Taxonomy articles created by Polbot ","title":"Desert rain frog"},{"id":"12398145","text":"Shahzada Muhammad Hideyat Afza (1809-21 March 1878), the 23rd head of the Mughal Dynasty, was born in Delhi in the reign of Akbar Shah II, the son of Mirza Muhammad Shuja'at Afza Bahadur(c.1750-1833).

Its natural habitats are dry savanna, moist savanna, temperate shrubland, subtropical or tropical dry shrubland, temperate grassland, subtropical or tropical dry lowland grassland, subtropical or tropical high-altitude grassland, arable land, pasture land and rural gardens. Young Breviceps mossambicus from Mount Sheba, close to Pilgrims Rest in Mpumulanga, South Africa ==Description== The Mozambique rain frog is a sturdy animal, stout with short legs and a blunt snout. Females grow to a snout-to-vent length of about . The dorsal surface is greyish-brown speckled with darker colour. A dark streak joins the eye and the front leg, passing over the tympanum. The belly is white with dark blotches and in males, the throat is brown. The feet are unwebbed and the outer two toes are much smaller than the other ones. This species could be confused with Callulina kreffti but that species is more arboreal in habit and has square- ended toepads to assist it in climbing trees. Another frog that is very similar in appearance is Breviceps fichus but the calls of the two species are markedly different. ==Distribution and habitat== The Mozambique rain frog has a widespread distribution in southern and central Africa. Its range extends from the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Tanzania in the north to the Republic of South Africa in the south. Its natural habitats are savannah, bushy country and open woodland, especially the moister parts of these. It is found in the lowlands and on the lower slopes in mountainous areas up to a height of above sea level. It is an adaptable species and seems to be able to cope with habitat degradation. ==Biology== In dry weather the Mozambique rain frog conceals itself under rocks or in hidden places among tree roots. It feeds on small invertebrates. After substantial rainfall, swarms of winged termites occur and these frogs emerge in large numbers to feed on them. The Mozambique rain frog lays a small clutch of about twenty-two yolk-rich eggs in a spherical chamber under leaf litter or a grass tussock. Each egg is about in diameter and about double this size including the capsule. The embryos take six to eight weeks to develop inside the eggs into young froglets. There is no tadpole stage or need for a body of water in which to reproduce. The female often provides some level of parental care by staying near the clutch but outside the sealed chamber. ==Status== The IUCN Red List of Threatened Species lists the Mozambique rain frog as being of \\"Least Concern\\". This is because it has a wide range, occurs in a variety of habitats and is able to move to new locations if disturbed in its original habitat. ==References== Category:Breviceps Category:Amphibians described in 1854 Category:Taxonomy articles created by Polbot ","title":"Mozambique rain frog"},{"id":"12398155","text":"The Namaqua rain frog or Namaqua short-headed frog (Breviceps namaquensis) is a species of frogs in the family Brevicipitidae.

The Namaqua rain frog has a squat, round body with a short, narrow head which has relatively large eyes, a flat face and narrow mouth. The limbs are short and stumpy and the fingers and toes lack webbing and adhesive discs. The upper body surface is brown with lighter brown to cream patches on the back and sides. These patches are occasionally fused together and may include irregular pairs of paravertebral patches. The underside is mainly smooth and white, but the skin is translucent in parts, and the throat area may be granular with dark markings around the jaw line. ==Behaviour== When disturbed, these frogs have the ability to inflate their bodies dramatically and squeak as a defence mechanism to deter predators. Breeding activity has been recorded in winter, spring and summer. They spend most of their time underground, surfacing after the rains to feed on insects. Its eggs are laid in underground chambers and are covered in a thick, viscous, jelly-like substance. Once the eggs hit tadpole stage, the jelly softens into a fluid in which they live until they fully metamorphose into frogs (absorbing nutrients from the egg yolk as they grow). ==Habitat and conservation== It is a fossorial frog that inhabits scrub-covered sandy areas in the succulent karroo biome. Development is direct (i.e, there is no free- living larval stage) and does require an aquatic habitat. It is a locally abundant frog, but it can experience some habitat loss because of agricultural expansion in the south of its range. It is present in several protected areas. ==References== Category:Breviceps Category:Frogs of Africa Category:Amphibians of Namibia Category:Amphibians of South Africa Category:Amphibians described in 1926 Category:Taxonomy articles created by Polbot ","title":"Namaqua rain frog"},{"id":"12398160","text":"Arjun Kumar Sengupta (10 June 1937 – 26 September 2010) was an Indian economist.

In addition to being a Parliamentarian, he was one of India's most noted economists, and led a multifaceted career as an academician and economic policy administrator. ==Life and career== Arjun Sengupta was born in Kolkata in 1937. After finishing his schooling at Mitra Institution in Bhawanipur, Kolkata, he graduated from the Presidency College, then affiliated with the University of Calcutta. At Presidency College, he was a member of the All- India Students' Federation, a radical student organisation affiliated with the Communist Party of India, then undivided. He later received a doctorate in Economics from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology under advisor Robert Solow, at the age of 27. His career included eminent posts such as Special Secretary to the Prime Minister of India, Indira Gandhi (1981–1984), Executive Director and Special Adviser to the managing director of the International Monetary Fund (1985–1990), India's Ambassador to the European Union (1990–1993), Member Secretary of the Planning Commission (1993–1998), and Member of Parliament, Rajya Sabha (2005 until his death).

Delivering the Arjun Sengupta Memorial Lecture organised by the Indian Society of Labour Economics on 16 December 2010, Prabhat Patnaik described Sengupta as an \\"iconoclast\\" and lauded the many roles he played \\"in his long and distinguished career.\\" On 26 March 2013, Sengupta was honoured posthumously by the Government of Bangladesh for his contribution to the Bangladesh Liberation War. Arjun Sengupta circa 1963 ==Government and politics== Arjun Sengupta joined the Government of India in the early 1970s, assisting top policymakers such as P.N. Dhar and Sukhomoy Chakravarty build an alliance with the nascent state of Bangladesh. Later in the 1970s, he worked in Commerce Ministry under then Commerce Minister, Pranab Mukherjee. In his stint at the Prime Minister's Office in the early 1980s, Sengupta was reportedly unhappy about India's 1982 loan from the International Monetary Fund (IMF), and wanted more to be done for agriculture and small farmers. At this time, he also steered two important groups: the Narsimham Committee, which created the architecture of disbanding quantitative controls and replacing them with tariff and fiscal steps, and also the Sengupta Committee on public sector reform. Sengupta was a proponent of the need for an arms-length relationship with the political authority in public sector units (PSUs). However, while Sengupta was a market reformer, his vision was different than what was in currency at the time in the international financial institutions. Yoginder Alagh, a former Union Minister and Sengupta's longtime colleague and friend, said that the reforms championed by Sengupta at the time \\"were our own, not big bang IMF/World Bank reform initiatives.\\" Upon his return to India in 1993 (from the US, where he was with the IMF, and Brussels, where he was posted as India's Ambassador to the EC), Sengupta was appointed Member Secretary of the Planning Commission, under then Deputy chairman, Pranab Mukherjee. According to veteran journalist Rajesh Mahapatra, Mukherjee had become the rallying point for those in the Congress party that were critical of the market reform policies of then Finance Minister, Manmohan Singh.Rajesh Mahapatra, \\"A Man Who Could Never Become a Minister,\\" The Hindustan Times, 12 October 2010 As Member Secretary of the Planning Commission, Sengupta brought together a group of left-wing economists to prepare a critical mid-term appraisal that highlighted the downside of economic liberalisation. With this act, Mahapatra said, \\"Sengupta ended up on the wrong side of history. The finance ministry prevailed over Prime Minister Narasimha Rao to stop the mid-term appraisal from being printed in its original form.\\"Rajesh Mahapatra, \\"A Man Who Could Never Become a Minister,\\" The Hindustan Times, 12 October 2010 In the same article, Mahapatra alleges that Sengupta was subsequently denied many posts for which he was a candidate, including Governor of the Reserve Bank of India, which went to Dr. Bimal Jalan in 1997, and Deputy Chairman of the Planning Commission, which went to Dr. Montek Singh Ahluwalia in 2004. Another veteran journalist and TV personality, Paranjoy Guha Thakurta, remembered Sengupta in a similar fashion. According to Guha Thakurta, Sengupta's critical stance towards \\"the neo-liberal school of economic thought subscribed to by Manmohan Singh\\" and refusal to \\"cultivate political godfathers\\" meant that he would be \\"one Finance Minister India never had.\\" In a published tribute to Sengupta in The Asian Age, his daughter, Mitu Sengupta, described him as \\"a strong, principled and self-made man, a visionary and true egalitarian,\\" and someone \\"who could be neither bullied nor bought.\\" ==Work as Chairman of the National Commission for Enterprises in the Unorganized Sector== Upon his death, various published tributes to Dr. Arjun Sengupta indicated that his most significant contribution was the final report he produced as the head of the National Commission for Enterprises in the Unorganized Sector (NCEUS), a cabinet-rank position that he held from 2005–2009. This report, released in April 2009, revealed that, despite many years of economic growth, 77% of India's population continues to live on less than $2 per day (currently around Rs. 120/day), and that as much as 86% of India's workforce is in the unorganised sector. The report also revealed that the vast majority of India's 'Poor and Vulnerable' are Muslim or lower caste, and thus in addition to poverty, also suffer from social discrimination. According to the report: \\"These groups emerge as a sort of a coalition of socially discriminated, educationally deprived and economically destitute\\" while \\"less than one fourth\\" of India's population is enjoying the fruits of high economic growth. Under Sengupta's Chairmanship, the NCEUS produced a total of ten reports in addition to submitting a number of proposals and working papers on selected issues, such as the global economic crisis, the informal economy, Special Economic Zones, and street vendors. Critical of existing government policy, the NCEUS pointed out that although enormous funds had been allocated and spent on social development programs, the benefits largely bypassed the poorest of the poor. It suggested designing special schemes for the vulnerable sections of Indian society through better targeting and social engineering. The commission's recommendations on social security resulted in the enactment of the Unorganized Workers Social Security Act, 2008. Recalling Dr. Sengupta's contribution to identifying the cross-linkages between extreme poverty and the downtrodden, C. Rangarajan, Chairman of the Prime Minister's Economic Advisory Council, said: \\"He had a good understanding of social problems and was deeply involved in finding solutions for people at the bottom of the population pile.\\" Another of Sengupta's admirers, the Vice- President of India, Mohammad Hamid Ansari, said that the \\"Sengupta report on the unorganised sector is a guiding force to provide minimum social security for all unorganised workers.\\" Arjun Sengupta at the UN Delegates' Restaurant in Geneva April 2010 ==Work on the Rights-Based Approach to Development== In 1999, Arjun Sengupta became the Independent Expert on the Right to Development (RTD) for the United Nations Commission on Human Rights. He produced six reports on the Right to development between 1999 and 2004. These reports elaborated on the 'Declaration of the Right to Development' adopted by the UN in 1986 (the US cast the lone dissenting vote). He also wrote a number of academic papers on the subject, and with the support of Harvard University, implemented two large projects in South Asia. In his subsequent role as the UN's Independent Expert on Human Rights and Extreme Poverty, he wrote as many as six reports, including a mission report on extreme poverty in the United States. Sengupta founded the Centre for Development and Human Rights (CDHR), a non-profit organisation that has produced numerous papers, reports and volumes on the rights-based approach to development, including an edited volume, Reflections on the Right to Development, produced in 2005. According to Ravi Srivastava, Professor of Economics and Jawaharlal Nehru University, \\"Sengupta's contributions to the right to development constitute... a very significant contribution to the ongoing debate in India on the rights-based approach.\\"Ravi Srivastava, \\"Making the Case for a Rights-Based Approach,\\" Economic and Political Weekly, 16 October 2010: . Srivastava says that Sengupta's reports provide a \\"formidable basis\\" for arguing that positive rights and collective rights are possible. Sengupta argued that the enforceability of collective rights via the implementation of development programs was possible even without their being converted into legal rights (though he recognised that justiciability did remain a superior course of action). The right to development was linked to a path of development in which national governments were obliged to ensure that human rights were progressively realised. But international organisations were also seen as having an important role. In a seminal article published in India's Economic and Political Weekly in 2001, Sengupta argued that: \\"When development is seen as a human right, it obligates the authorities, both nationally and internationally, to fulfill their duties in delivering (or in human rights language, promoting, securing, and protecting) that right in a country. The adoption of appropriate policies follows from that obligation. Nationally, the government must do everything, or must be seen as doing everything to fulfill the claims of a human right. If the right to food, education, health are regarded as components of a human right to development, the state has to accept the primary responsibility of delivering the right either on its own or in collaboration with others. It has to adopt the appropriate policies and provide for the required resources to facilitate such delivery because meeting the obligation of human rights would have a primary claim on all the resources — physical, financial and institutional — that it can command.\\" Arjun Sengupta, \\"Right to Development as a Human Right,\\" Economic and Political Weekly, 7 July 2001 () ==Further reading== * ==References== Category:Rajya Sabha members from West Bengal Category:1937 births Category:2010 deaths Category:University of Calcutta alumni Category:Members of the Planning Commission of India Category:United Nations special rapporteurs Category:Indian officials of the United Nations ","title":"Arjun Kumar Sengupta"},{"id":"12398161","text":"Breviceps poweri, the Power's rain frog or Power's short-headed frog, is a species of frog in the family Brevicipitidae.

Counterpart theory still presupposes possible worlds, but differs in certain important respects from the Kripkean view. The form of the theory most commonly cited was developed by David Lewis, first in a paper and later in his book On the Plurality of Worlds. ==Differences from the Kripkean view== Counterpart theory (hereafter \\"CT\\"), as formulated by Lewis, requires that individuals exist in only one world. The standard account of possible worlds assumes that a modal statement about an individual (e.g., \\"it is possible that x is y\\") means that there is a possible world, W, where the individual x has the property y; in this case there is only one individual, x, at issue. On the contrary, counterpart theory supposes that this statement is really saying that there is a possible world, W, wherein exists an individual that is not x itself, but rather a distinct individual 'x' different from but nonetheless similar to x. So, when I state that I might have been a banker (rather than a philosopher) according to counterpart theory I am saying not that I exist in another possible world where I am a banker, but rather my counterpart does. Nevertheless, this statement about my counterpart is still held to ground the truth of the statement that I might have been a banker. The requirement that any individual exist in only one world is to avoid what Lewis termed the \\"problem of accidental intrinsics\\" which (he held) would require a single individual to both have and simultaneously not have particular properties. In its formalization, counterpart theoretic formalization of modal discourse also departs from the standard formulation by eschewing use of modality operators (Necessarily, Possibly) in favor of quantifiers that range over worlds and 'counterparts' of individuals in those worlds. Lewis put forth a set of primitive predicates and a number of axioms governing CT and a scheme for translating standard modal claims in the language of quantified modal logic into his CT. In addition to interpreting modal claims about objects and possible worlds, CT can also be applied to the identity of a single object at different points in time. The view that an object can retain its identity over time is often called endurantism, and it claims that objects are ‘wholly present’ at different moments (see the counterpart relation, below). An opposing view is that any object in time is made up of temporal parts or is perduring. Lewis' view on possible worlds is sometimes called modal realism.  The basics  The possibilities that CT is supposed to describe are “ways a world might be” (Lewis 1986:86) or more exactly: : (1) absolutely every way that a world could possibly be is a way that some world is, and : (2) absolutely every way that a part of a world could possibly be is a way that some part of some world is. (Lewis 1986:86.) Add also the following “principle of recombination,” which Lewis describes this way: “patching together parts of different possible worlds yields another possible world […]. can coexist with anything else, […] provided they occupy distinct spatiotemporal positions.” (Lewis 1986:87-88). But these possibilities should be restricted by CT. ==The counterpart relation== The counterpart relation (hereafter C-relation) differs from the notion of identity. Identity is a reflexive, symmetric, and transitive relation. The counterpart relation is only a similarity relation; it needn’t be transitive or symmetric. The C-relation is also known as genidentity (Carnap 1967), I-relation (Lewis 1983), and the unity relation (Perry 1975). If identity is shared between objects in different possible worlds then the same object can be said to exist in different possible worlds (a trans-world object, that is, a series of objects sharing a single identity).  Parthood relation  An important part of the way Lewis’s worlds deliver possibilities is the use of the parthood relation. This gives some neat formal machinery, mereology. This is an axiomatic system that uses formal logic to describe the relationship between parts and wholes, and between parts within a whole. Especially important, and most reasonable, according to Lewis, is the strongest form that accepts the existence of mereological sums or the thesis of unrestricted mereological composition (Lewis 1986:211-213). == The formal theory == As a formal theory, counterpart theory can be used to translate sentences into modal quantificational logic. Sentences that seem to be quantifying over possible individuals should be translated into CT. (Explicit primitives and axioms have not yet been stated for the temporal or spatial use of CT.) Let CT be stated in quantificational logic and contain the following primitives: : Wx (x is a possible world) : Ixy (x is in possible world y) : Ax (x is actual) : Cxy (x is a counterpart of y) We have the following axioms (taken from Lewis 1968): : A1. Ixy → Wy : (Nothing is in anything except a world) : A2. Ixy ∧ Ixz → y=z : (Nothing is in two worlds) : A3. Cxy → ∃zIxz : (Whatever is a counterpart is in a world) : A4. Cxy → ∃zIyz : (Whatever has a counterpart is in a world) : A5. Ixy ∧ Izy ∧ Cxz → x=z : (Nothing is a counterpart of anything else in its world) : A6. Ixy → Cxx : (Anything in a world is a counterpart of itself) : A7. ∃x (Wx ∧ ∀y (Iyx ↔ Ay)) : (Some world contains all and only actual things) : A8. ∃xAx : (Something is actual) It is an uncontroversial assumption to assume that the primitives and the axioms A1 through A8 make the standard counterpart system.  Comments on the axioms  *A1 excludes individuals that exist in no world at all. The way an individual is in a world is by being a part of that world, so the basic relation is mereological. *A2 excludes individuals that exist in more than one possible world. But because David Lewis accepts the existence of arbitrary mereological sums there are individuals that exist in several possible worlds, but they are not possible individuals because none of them have the property of being actual. And that is because it is not possible for such a whole to be actual. *A3 and A4 make counterparts worldbound, excluding an individual that has a non-worldbound counterpart. *A5 and A6 restrict the use of the CT-relation so that it is used within a possible world when and only when it is stood in by an entity to itself. *A7 and A8 make one possible world the unique actual world.  Principles that are not accepted in normal CT  : R1 Cxy → Cyx : (Symmetry of the counterpart relation) : R2 Cxy ∧ Cyz → Cxz : (Transitivity of the counterpart relation) : R3 Cy1x ∧ Cy2x ∧ Iy1w1 ∧ Iy2w2 ∧ y1≠y2 → w1≠w2 : (Nothing in any world has more than one counterpart in any other world) : R4 Cyx1 ∧ Cyx2 ∧ Ix1w1 ∧ Ix2w2 ∧ x1≠x2 → w1≠w2 : (No two things in any world have a common counterpart in any other world) : R5 Ww1 ∧ Ww2 ∧ Ixw1 → ∃y (Iyw2 ∧ Cxy) : (For any two worlds, anything in one is a counterpart of something in the other) : R6 Ww1 ∧ Ww2 ∧ Ixw1 → ∃y (Iyw2 ∧ Cyx) : (For any two worlds, anything in one has some counterpart in the other) == Motivations for counterpart theory == CT can be applied to the relationship between identical objects in different worlds or at different times. Depending on the subject, there are different reasons for accepting CT as a description of the relation between different entities.  In possible worlds  David Lewis defended Modal realism. This is the view that a possible world is a concrete, maximal connected spatio-temporal region. The actual world is one of the possible worlds; it is also concrete. Because a single concrete object demands spatio-temporal connectedness, a possible concrete object can only exist in one possible world. Still, we say true things like: It is possible that Hubert Humphrey won the 1968 US presidential election. How is it true? Humphrey has a counterpart in another possible world that wins the 1968 election in that world. Lewis also argues against three other alternatives that might be compatible with possibilism: overlapping individuals, trans- world individuals, and haecceity. Some philosophers, such as Peter van Inwagen (1985), see no problem with identity within a world . Lewis seems to share this attitude. He says: :\\"… like the Holy Roman Empire, it is badly named. […] In the first place we should bear in mind that Trans-World Airlines is an intercontinental, but not as yet an interplanetary carrier. More important, we should not suppose that we have here any problem with identity. :We never have. Identity is utterly simple and unproblematic. Everything is identical to itself; nothing is ever identical to anything else except itself. There is never any problem about what makes something identical to itself; nothing can ever fail to be. And there is never any problem about what makes two things identical; two things never can be identical. :There might be a problem about how to define identity to someone sufficiently lacking in conceptual resources — we note that it won't suffice to teach him certain rules of inference — but since such unfortunates are rare, even among philosophers, we needn't worry much if their condition is incurable. :We do state plenty of genuine problems in terms of identity. But we needn't state them so.” (Lewis 1986:192-193) Overlapping individuals An overlapping individual has a part in the actual world and a part in another world. Because identity is not problematic, we get overlapping individuals by having overlapping worlds. Two worlds overlap if they share a common part. But some properties of overlapping objects are, for Lewis, troublesome (Lewis 1986:199-210). The problem is with an object’s accidental intrinsic properties, such as shape and weight, which supervene on its parts. Humphrey could have the property of having six fingers on his left hand. How does he do that? It can’t be true that Humphrey has both the property of having six fingers and five fingers on his left hand. What we might say is that he has five fingers at this world and six fingers at that world. But how should these modifiers be understood? According to McDaniel (2004), if Lewis is right, the defender of overlapping individuals has to accept genuine contradictions or defend the view that every object has all its properties essentially. How can you be one year older than you are? One way is to say that there is a possible world where you exist. Another way is for you to have a counterpart in that possible world, who has the property of being one year older than you.  Trans-world individuals  Take Humphrey: if he is a trans-world individual he is the mereological sum of all of the possible Humphreys in the different worlds. He is like a road that goes through different regions. There are parts that overlap, but we can also say that there is a northern part that is connected to the southern part and that the road is the mereological sum of these parts. The same thing with Humphrey. One part of him is in one world, another part in another world. :\\"It is possible for something to exist iff it is possible for the whole to exist. That is, iff there is a world at which the whole of it exists. That is, iff there is a world such that quantifying only over parts of that world, the whole of it exists. That is, iff the whole of it is among the parts of some world. That is, iff it is part of some world – and hence not a trans-world individual. Parts of worlds are possible individuals; trans-world individuals are therefore impossible individuals.\\"  Haecceity  A haecceity or individual essence is a property that only a single object instantiates. Ordinary properties, if one accepts the existence of universals, can be exemplified by more than one object at a time. Another way to explain a haecceity is to distinguish between suchness and thisness, where thisness has a more demonstrative character. David Lewis gives the following definition of a haecceitistic difference: “two worlds differ in what they represent de re concerning some individual, but do not differ qualitatively in any way.” (Lewis 1986:221.) CT does not require distinct worlds for distinct possibilities – “a single world may provide many possibilities, since many possible individuals inhabit it” (Lewis 1986:230). CT can satisfy multiple counterparts in one possible world. Temporal parts Perdurantism is the view that material objects are not wholly present at any single instant of time; instead, some temporal parts is said to be present. Sometimes, especially in the theory of relativity as it is expressed by Minkowski, the path traced by an object through spacetime. According to Ted Sider, “Temporal parts theory is the claim that time is like space in one particular respect, namely, with respect to parts.”Sider, et al. (2008) Contemporary Debates in Metaphysics, \\"Temporal Parts\\". Sider associates endurantism with a C-relation between temporal parts. (See also: The argument from temporary intrinsics). Sider defends a revised way of counting. Instead of counting individual objects, timeline slices or the temporal parts of an object are used. Sider discusses an example of counting road segments instead of roads simpliciter. (Sider 2001:188-192). (Compare with Lewis 1993.) Sider argues that, even if we knew that some material object would go through some fission and split into two, \\"we would not say\\" that there are two objects located at the same spacetime region. (Sider 2001:189) How can one predicate temporal properties of these momentary temporal parts? It is here that the C-relation comes in play. Sider proposed the sentence: \\"Ted was once a boy.\\" The truth condition of this sentence is that \\"there exists some person stage x prior to the time of utterance, such that x is a boy, and x bears the temporal counterpart relation to Ted.\\" (Sider 2001:193) == Counterpart theory and the necessity of identity == Kripke's three lectures on proper names and identity, (1980), raised the issues of how we should interpret statements about identity. Take the statement that the Evening Star is identical to the Morning Star. Both are the planet Venus. This seems to be an a posteriori identity statement. We discover that the names designate the same thing. The traditional view, since Kant, has been that statements or propositions that are necessarily true are a priori. But in the end of the sixties Saul Kripke and Ruth Barcan Marcus offered proof for the necessary truth of identity statements. Here is the Kripke's version (Kripke 1971): : (1) ∀x \\\\Box(x = x) [Necessity of self- identity] : (2) ∀x∀y [x = y → → Py)] [Leibniz law] : (3) ∀x∀y [x = y → (\\\\Box(x = x) → \\\\Box(x = y))] [From (1) and (2)] : (4) ∀x∀y [x = y → \\\\Box(x = y)] [From the following principle A → B → C ⇒ A → C and (3)] If the proof is correct the distinction between the a priori/a posteriori and necessary/contingent becomes less clear. The same applies if identity statements are necessarily true anyway. (For some interesting comments on the proof, see Lowe 2002.) The statement that for instance “Water is identical to H2O” is (then) a statement that is necessarily true but a posteriori. If CT is the correct account of modal properties we still can keep the intuition that identity statements are contingent and a priori because counterpart theory understands the modal operator in a different way than standard modal logic. The relationship between CT and essentialism is of interest. (Essentialism, the necessity of identity, and rigid designators form an important troika of mutual interdependence.) According to David Lewis, claims about an object's essential properties can be true or false depending on context (in Chapter 4.5 in 1986 he calls against constancy, because an absolute conception of essences is constant over the logical space of possibilities). He writes: : But if I ask how things would be if Saul Kripke had come from no sperm and egg but had been brought by a stork, that makes equally good sense. I create a context that makes my question make sense, and to do so it has to be a context that makes origins not be essential. (Lewis 1986:252.) == Counterpart theory and rigid designators == Kripke interpreted proper names as rigid designators where a rigid designator picks out the same object in every possible world (Kripke 1980). For someone who accepts contingent identity statements the following semantic problem occurs (semantic because we deal with de dicto necessity) (Rea 1997:xxxvii). Take a scenario that is mentioned in the paradox of coincidence. A statue (call it “Statue”) is made by melding two pieces of clay together. Those two pieces are called “Clay”. Statue and Clay seem to be identical, they exist at the same time, and we could incinerate them at the same time. The following seems true: :(7) Necessarily, if Statue exists then Statue is identical to Statue. But, :(8) Necessarily, if Statue exists then Statue is identical to Clay is false, because it seems possible that Statue could have been made out of two different pieces of clay, and thus its identity to Clay is not necessary. Counterpart theory, qua-identity, and individual concepts can offer solutions to this problem.  Arguments for inconstancy  Ted Sider gives roughly the following argument (Sider 2001:223). There is inconstancy if a proposition about the essence of an object is true in one context and false in another. C-relation is a similarity relation. What is similar in one dimension is not similar in another dimension. Therefore, the C-relation can have the same difference and express inconstant judgements about essences. David Lewis offers another argument. The paradox of coincidence can be solved if we accept inconstancy. We can then say that it is possible for a dishpan and a piece of plastic to coincide, in some context. That context can then be described using CT. Sider makes the point that David Lewis feels he was forced to defend CT, due to modal realism. Sider uses CT as a solution to the paradox of material coincidence.  Counterpart theory compared to qua-theory and individual concepts  We assume that contingent identity is real. Then it is informative to compare CT with other theories about how to handle de re representations. Qua-theory Kit Fine (1982) and Alan Gibbard (1975) (according to Rea 1997) are defences of qua-theory. According to qua-theory we can talk about some of an object's modal properties. The theory is handy if we don't think it is possible for Socrates to be identical with a piece of bread or a stone. Socrates qua person is essentially a person. Individual concepts According to Rudolf Carnap, in modal contexts variables refer to individual concepts instead of individuals. An individual concept is then defined as a function of individuals in different possible worlds. Basically, individual concepts deliver semantic objects or abstract functions instead of real concrete entities as in CT.  Counterpart theory and epistemic possibility  Kripke accepts the necessity of identity but agrees with the feeling that it still seems that it is possible that Phospherus (the Morning Star) is not identical to Hespherus (the Evening Star). For all we know, it could be that they are different. He says: : What, then, does the intuition that the table might have turned out to have been made of ice or of anything else, that it might even have turned out not to be made of molecules, amount to? I think that it means simply that there might have been a table looking and feeling just like this one and placed in this very position in the room, which was in fact made of ice, In other words, I (or some conscious being) could have been qualitatively in the same epistemic situation that in fact obtains, I could have the same sensory evidence that I in fact have, about a table which was made of ice. The situation is thus akin to the one which inspired the counterpart theorists; when I speak of the possibility of the table turning out to be made of various things, I am speaking loosely. This table itself could not have had an origin different form the one it in fact had, but in a situation qualitatively identical to this one with respect to all evidence I had in advance, the room could have contained a table made of ice in place of this one. Something like counterpart theory is thus applicable to the situation, but it applies only because we are not interested in what might not be true of a table given certain evidence. It is precisely because it is not true that this table might have been made of ice from the Thames that we must turn here to qualitative descriptions and counterparts. To apply these notions to genuine de re modalities, is from the present standpoint, perverse. (Kripke 1980:142.) So to explain how the illusion of necessity is possible, according to Kripke, CT is an alternative. Therefore, CT forms an important part of our theory about the knowledge of modal intuitions. (For doubt about this strategy, see Della Roca, 2002. And for more about the knowledge of modal statements, see Gendler and Hawthorne, 2002.) == Arguments against counterpart theory == The most famous is Kripke's Humphrey objection. Because a counterpart is never identical to something in another possible world Kripke raised the following objection against CT: : Thus if we say \\"Humphrey might have won the election\\" (if only he had done such-and-such), we are not talking about something that might have happened to Humphrey but to someone else, a \\"counterpart\\". Probably, however, Humphrey could not care less whether someone else, no matter how much resembling him, would have been victorious in another possible world. Thus, Lewis's view seems to me even more bizarre than the usual notions of transworld identification that it replaces. (Kripke 1980:45 note 13.) One way to spell out the meaning of Kripke's claim is by the following imaginary dialogue: (Based on Sider MS) :Against: Kripke means that Humphrey himself doesn’t have the property of possibly winning the election, because it is only the counterpart that wins. :For: The property of possibly winning the election is the property of the counterpart. :Against: But they can't be the same property because Humphrey has different attitudes to them: he cares about he himself having the property of possibly winning the election. He doesn’t care about the counterpart having the property of possibly winning the election. :For: But properties don't work the same way as objects, our attitudes towards them can be different, because we have different descriptions – they are still the same properties. That lesson is taught by the paradox of analysis. CT is inadequate if it can't translate all modal sentences or intuitions. Fred Feldman mentioned two sentences (Feldman 1971): : (1) I could have been quite unlike what I in fact am. : (2) I could have been more like what you in fact are than like what I in fact am. At the same time, you could have been more like what I in fact am than what you in fact are. == See also == * Identity (philosophy) * Many- worlds interpretation ==Notes References == * Balashov, Yuri, 2007, \\"Defining endurance\\", Philosophical studies, 133:143-149. * Carnap, Rudolf, 1967, The Logical Structure of the World, trans.

The specific name minutus alludes to the small size of this species. It is endemic to Peninsular Malaysia and only known from four localities in the state of Pahang: two inside the Taman Negara National Park (including its type locality), one in the Krau Wildlife Reserve, and Gunung Senyum. It probably occurs more widely in central Peninsular Malaysia. ==Description== The type series consists of three specimens: two adult males measuring and one adult female measuring in snout–vent length. The body is rounded and roughly triangular in shape. The head is wider than it is long. The snout is obtusely pointed. The tympanum is distinct. The limbs are short. The fingers have pointed tips and are free of webbing. The toes are rounded and are partially webbed. The dorsum is granular with rounded warts and clay or yellowish-brown in colour. There are warm sepia or dark grey-brown markings. The flanks are slightly darker. ==Habitat and conservation== Glyphoglossus minutus occurs among the leaf litter in lowland dipterocarp forests, mainly in swampy areas. It has also been found at road sides. It feeds on ants. Breeding is explosive, during which time this species can be abundant. This species occurs in multiple, well-protected areas. Outside of the protected areas, however, it is threatened by habitat loss caused byu logging and agricultural expansion, in particularly related to oil palm plantations. ==References== minutus Category:Frogs of Asia Category:Amphibians of Malaysia Category:Endemic fauna of Malaysia Category:Amphibians described in 2004 Category:Taxonomy articles created by Polbot ","title":"Glyphoglossus minutus"},{"id":"12398207","text":"Sir Robert Salusbury Cotton, 5th Baronet (c. 1739 – 24 August 1809) was an English politician who sat in the House of Commons from 1780 to 1796. Sir Robert Salusbury Cotton of Lleweney ==Early life== Cotton was the eldest son of Sir Lynch Cotton. He was educated at Westminster School, Shrewsbury School, and then entered Trinity Hall, Cambridge, in 1756. He was one of the founders of the Tarporley Hunt Club in 1762.Egerton-Warburton RE. \\"A short account of the Tarporley Hunt Club, from its foundation in 1762 to the year 1869\\". In Hunting Songs (Henry Young & Sons; 1912) (accessed 11 May 2010) ==Domestic life== Cotton married Frances Stapleton, daughter and co-heiress of James Russel-Stapleton Esq in 1767. In 1774 they were visited at Llewenli Hall by Sir Robert's cousin, Hester Thrale, who was accompanied by the noted writer, Samuel Johnson; Frances \\"found Johnson, despite his rudeness, at times delightful, having a manner peculiar to himself in relating anecdotes that could not fail to attract old and young. Her impression was that Mrs. Thrale was very vexatious in wishing to engross all his attention, which annoyed him much\\". The Cottons later broke off relations with Hester following her 1784 marriage to an Italian music teacher. In 1774 he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society. On the death of his father on 14 August 1775 he succeeded to the baronetcy and inherited the old Salusbury family seat at Lleweni Hall. Soon after the birth of his second son he moved from Lleweni Hall to Combermere Abbey, the traditional seat of the heir apparent to the Baronetcy. He had to lease the family's former estate to the Hon Thomas FitzMaurice, a brother of Lord Shelburne's, because of the profligacy of his uncle, Sir Thomas. Nevertheless, Sir Robert kept a large hunting establishment and was known as a generous host. ==Parliamentary career== Cotton was returned unopposed as Member of Parliament (MP) for Cheshire at a by election on 1 March 1780 and at the succeeding 1780 general election. In 1784 he was a member of the St. Alban's Tavern group who tried to bring Fox and Pitt together. He was returned again unopposed in 1784 and 1790. Towards the end of that parliament he applied three times to Pitt for the position of collectorship of salt duties at Nantwich and was ignored. It was unexpected when he decided not to stand at the 1796. His brother writing later said it was through ill-health and that he had declined a peerage, but contemporary accounts claimed it was in annoyance at not being given the post. ==Later life and legacy== Cotton was a major in the Nantwich volunteers in 1797 and 1803. He had to sell his Welsh estates for about £390,000 as he was in debt through extravagance and bad management. He died aged 70 on 24 August 1809. Cotton and his wife Frances had the following children: * Robert-Salusbury (born 11 September 1768), died without issue * Stapleton (1773–1865), 6th baronet, elevated to the peerage as a Viscount and Baron Combermere * William (died 16 June 1853), took holy orders * Lynch, colonel in the army; died in the East Indies in 1799 * Frances (1 December 176926 November 1818), married Robert Needham, 11th Viscount Kilmorey (1746–1818) on 10 January 1792 * Penelope (31 December 1770 – 1786) * Hester-Maria (died 20 March 1845) * Sophia (died 24 May 1838), married Sir H.

The club gained promotion to the next higher division in his last year. He then joined TSF Ditzingen, first as their second team coach and then coaching the first team. Stuttgarter Kickers Dutt's success brought him into the limelight locally and he then went on to join former Bundesliga side Stuttgarter Kickers as their second team coach in summer 2002. The Kickers gave Dutt a chance as their first team coach on 28 October 2003 and he would guide the club well with a young team in the Regionalliga (third division) in difficult times as the club did not have the necessary funds. The highlight came in the 2006–07 season when the Kickers beat Bundesliga side Hamburger SV 4–3 in extra time in the DFB-Pokal. SC Freiburg Dutt decided to take up the job at 2. Bundesliga club SC Freiburg in summer 2007. It was the end of an era as previous coach Volker Finke had coached Freiburg for 16 years, a record in German professional football. The going initially was not easy for Dutt, but in year two he was able to win the 2. Bundesliga title and Freiburg was back in the Bundesliga after four years. The first season in Bundesliga with SC Freiburg saw Dutt escaping relegation. They finished four points ahead of the relegation playoff spot. The 2010–11 season proved to be Dutt's last season at SC Freiburg, the club managed to cling onto the respectable ninth position in the league table. Bayer Leverkusen Bayer Leverkusen The decision to take Dutt to succeed Bayern Munich bound Jupp Heynckes as coach of Bayer 04 Leverkusen was made in March 2011. \\"I didn’t come to Leverkusen to turn a second-placed team into a fourth- or fifth-placed team.

The females are larger than the males. The skin is densely warted and the colour is a mottling of various shades of brown and black. ==Distribution and habitat== Callulina kisiwamsitu is endemic to the West Usambara Mountains in Tanzania. Much of this area has been deforested and this species is found in the remains of the forested area around Lushoto including the Mazumbai Forest Reserve, Ambangula Forest Reserve and Shume-Mugambo Forest Reserve. It is found climbing in trees and on the ground in damp forests with thick undergrowth. ==Biology== Callulina kisiwamsitu is a predator and feeds on small invertebrates including bugs, grasshoppers and millipedes. Breeding takes place in the rainy season. The male Callulina kisiwamsitu calls from low vegetation to attract a mate. The eggs are laid on land under cover in damp places. It is believed that direct development of the young takes place with juvenile frogs hatching directly from the eggs. ==Status== The IUCN Red List of Threatened Species regards this species as \\"endangered\\" as its range is small (believed to be about ) and it only occurs in one location where its habitat is being lost.

The genus-level placement of this little known frog has changed many times, and it is still unclear whether it should be placed in some other genus. ==Etymology== The specific name boettgeri honours Oskar Boettger, a German zoologist. Boettger was the first to study the type specimen, which he identified as Phrynixalus montanus (=Cophixalus montanus). ==Description== The holotype (sex unspecified) measures about in snout–vent length. The eyes are large and protuberant. The tympanum is somewhat distinct. The fingers are long and bear relatively large discs. The toes discs are also well-developed but smaller than the finger ones. No webbing is present. The dorsal ground color is brown. There is a yellowish-white stripe running from snout to cloacal opening. Dark dorsal markings include a W-shaped mark in the scapular region and dark flecks on each side of the central light stripe. Large, rounded reddish-brown markings are present on the sides of the head and body. The ventral side is light brown, with chestnut-brown spots on the chin, throat, chest, and undersides of limbs. ==Habitat and conservation== The holotype was found under moss at the foot of a tree at an elevation of about above sea level. This species presumably lives in rainforest and breeds by direct development, (i.e, there is no free-living larval stage), as other Callulops (and asterophryinids in general).

The courthouse was added to the National Register on 1979-12-21. ==History== Ashland County was formed in 1846 from land taken from Richland, Wayne, Lorain and Huron counties. The county used a church for the purpose of a courthouse until a more permanent building could be constructed. This first courthouse dates from 1853 and was built with red brick and white painted wood trimming. Large Corinthian columns lined the front with Corinthian pilasters lining the sides. Large rectangular windows allowed abundant amounts of light into the interior and courtrooms. A tower rose gracefully above the sloped roof and ended in a small spire. The old county jail was built next door and was a simple stone structure. After this structure was destroyed, the current courthouse was built on its foundations. In the summer of 1927 the old courthouse was judged to be in need of extensive repairs. The three County Commissioners, D.V. Peterson, R.L. Kreiling, and J.W. Davidson, called a mass meeting of the citizens of the county, which decided that a bond issue to build a new Court House should be voted on at the November 1927 election. Cost estimates were over $325,000.00 for the building and required equipment. County Auditor, J.P. Hunter, stated that property taxes would need to be raised by an average of .348 mills to repay the bonds over twenty-four years. The bond issue passed by a 1201 majority.The Story of the Court House, Ashland County Commissioners The current courthouse was designed by Vernon Redding and showcases the popular Classical Revival style of the late 1920s, consisting of clean lines with flat smooth stone and few embellishments. The solid exterior facade consists of rectangular windows and is disrupted by a central projection with large pilasters lining the entrance. A small porch is located between the entrance and a flight of stairs leading to the sidewalk. The flat roof is framed by a balustrade which in turn hides a large skylight that illuminates the Great Chamber below. ==ReferencesFurther reading== *Thrane, Susan W.; County Courthouses of Ohio, Indiana University Press; Indianapolis, Indiana 2000 *Marzulli, Lawrence J.; The Development of Ohio's Counties and Their Historic Courthouses; Gray Printing Company; Fostoria, Ohio 1983 *Stebbins, Clair; Ohio's Court Houses; Ohio State Bar Association; Columbus, Ohio 1980 Category:Courthouses on the National Register of Historic Places in Ohio Category:County courthouses in Ohio Category:Buildings and structures in Ashland County, Ohio Category:National Register of Historic Places in Ashland County, Ohio Category:Neoclassical architecture in Ohio Category:Government buildings completed in 1929 ","title":"Ashland County Courthouse (Ohio)"},{"id":"12398273","text":"Callulops kopsteini is a species of frog in the family Microhylidae.

Described by The New York Times as \\"fiercely liberal\\", she was elected Speaker on January 8, 2014, succeeding Christine Quinn. ==Early life and education== Mark-Viverito was born in Bayamón, Puerto Rico, to Anthony Mark, a physician and founder of San Pablo Hospital, and Elizabeth Viverito. She grew up in Bayamón, where her mother still resides. At the age of eighteen, she moved to New York to attend Columbia University, from which she graduated in 1991 with a bachelor of arts degree. She received her Master of Public Administration from Baruch College in 1995. ==Career== Mark-Viverito served as a member of Manhattan Community Board 11, coordinator of the movement Todo Nueva York con Vieques, president of Mujeres del Barrio, and strategic organizer for Local 1199 of the Service Employees International Union (SEIU), an influential health care workers union. New York City Council After running unsuccessfully against Phil Reed for City Council in District 8 in 2003, Mark-Viverito was elected to the position when Reed reached his term limit in 2005. During her first four years in office, Mark-Viverito sponsored and passed several pieces of legislation regarding tenant harassment, building safety, greening buildings, and park conservancies. In January 2009, she criticized the voting record of newly appointed New York Senator Kirsten Gillibrand on immigration. During Mark- Viverito's second term in the Council, she served as chair of the Parks and Recreation Committee and as founding co-chair of the Progressive Caucus. In November 2013, she won re-election to her third term in the Council, and her close ally Bill de Blasio was elected mayor. Soon the New York Daily News cited Mark-Viverito as \\"the front-runner\\" for \\"New York City's second-most powerful political post — Speaker of the City Council.\\" A grassroots effort to boost her Speaker candidacy included social media, fliers, phone banking, and volunteer recruitment. Mark-Viverito was elected City Council Speaker on January 8, 2014, at age 44, becoming the first member of the Council's Black, Latino and Asian Caucus to hold this position. Her first \\"State of the City\\" speech emphasized reform of the criminal justice system. In January 2016, Mark-Viverito introduced a collection of eight bills known as the \\"Criminal Justice Reform Act\\" to reduce the penalty for acts such as violating park rules, littering and public urination from misdemeanors to the civil process. In addition, the Criminal Justice Reform Act also suspended enforcement for \\"excessive noise,\\" which resulted in a sudden spike in noise complaints around the five boroughs, according to data compiled by 311, New York City's complaint submission platform. Mark-Viverito sponsored the bills so that young people in communities of color could \\"fulfill their potential\\"New York City Is Set to Adopt New Approach on Policing Minor Offenses, New York Times, January 20, 2016 by incentivizing officers to give verbal warnings and fines but not remove the option of making arrests. In 2016, Mark-Viverito was alleged to have pressured the New York City Housing Authority to fire a black manager of a NYCHA housing project and replace her with a \\"Spanish Manager\\". As of 2018, the lawsuit is still pending and the City of New York's motion to dismiss the lawsuit was denied. In 2017, Mark-Viverito declined to boycott the Puerto Rican Day Parade, after organizers decided to honor Oscar López Rivera, a prominently incarcerated member of Fuerzas Armadas de Liberación Nacional Puertorriqueña (FALN). 2018 NYC Public Advocate election In 2018, Mark- Viverito announced her intention to run for the open seat of New York City Public Advocate, but lost to Jumaane Williams. ==Personal life== Mark-Viverito campaigned in solidarity with the Occupy Wall Street movement and identified herself as part of the \\"99%\\" of income earners despite having a net worth in the millions. She and her family inherited an estimated $6.7 million from her father, a doctor. Prior to her inheritance, she applied for a taxpayer- subsidized loan in 1998 when her property at the time was worth $310,000. As of 2014, the multi-story condominium property was worth around $1,300,000. Mark-Viverito rents out her properties, but did not report her rental income. Her spokesman claimed it to be an honest oversight on her part. In August 2014, Mark-Viverito publicly disclosed that she was infected with the most common STD, the human papillomavirus. ==Election history== {  style=\\"margin:0.5em ; font-size:95%\\" + New York City Council: District 8 !Election ! !Candidate !Party !Votes !Pct ! !Candidate !Party !Votes !Pct ! !Candidate !Party !Votes !Pct ! !Candidate !Party !Votes !Pct - 2005 Primary   Melissa Mark-Viverito  Dem  align=\\"right\\" 3,626  25.40%   Felipe Luciano  Dem  align=\\"right\\" 3,610  25.30%   Joyce Johnson  Dem  align=\\"right\\" 2,744  19.23%   Others (3)  Dem  align=\\"right\\" 4,255  30.06% - 2005 General   Melissa Mark-Viverito  Dem  align=\\"right\\" 16,743  99.98%                - 2009 Primary   Melissa Mark-Viverito  Dem  align=\\"right\\" 4,993  46.73%   Robert J.

Adham Khanjar () is a Lebanese shia revolutionist who participated in an attempt to assassinate General Gouraud, the French High Commissioner in Syria and Lebanon. ==Assassination Attempt== Khanjar joined a guerrilla band led by famous Syrian revolutionist Ahmed Mreywed. And on 23 June 1921, the band ambushed the car of General Henri Gouraud, the French High Commissioner in Syria and Lebanon, on its way from Damascus to Quneitra. The general survived the attempt, but Commandant Branet was killed, and the governor of Damascus was wounded in the attack.*Biographie de Henri Joseph Eugène Gouraud After the failed attempt, the band members fled to Transjordan. The military chauffeur was not killed, and succeeded in driving the car away from the Arab ambush—even with his tires shot, saving the day (he became a local bus driver after his military service in Roanne, France). ==The Adham Khanjar Incident== On July 7, 1922, Khanjar arrived at the village of Al-Qrayya in Jabal al-Druze. Two French soldiers recognized and captured him while he was trying to get water at a well. Khanjar was transferred to Suwayda immediately. From his prison there, he sent a message to Sultan Pasha al-Atrash asking for his help, as he was seeking refuge at his house Al-Qrayya. Upon receiving the message, Sultan, who was in nearby village at that time, considered Khanjar's capture as a breach of the Druze traditions of protecting the fugitive, and an attack on him personally. Thus he demanded the release of Khanjar in exchange with some of the captured French soldiers. The French agreed upon that but betrayed Sultan once they got hold of their soldiers. Instead of giving Khanjar to Sultan they took their soldiers and opened fire on Sultans people. A few days later, Sultan and his men attacked a French convoy they thought to transport Khanjar, who was sent to Damascus in another convoy. Sultan decided to burn his house, because he could not defend Khanjar. Sultan said \\"The house that does not keep its guests safe, is preferable to be burnt\\". Khanjar was put to trial and found guilty. He was executed the same year. The people of Jabal al-Druze consider this incident an example of defending their values of protecting the fugitives, as they fought the French for Khanjar, a man they did not know, who sought refuge in their territory. Khanjar's name is still mentioned today in the traditional songs of the area. ==Notes== Category:Year of birth missing Category:1923 deaths Category:20th-century executions by Lebanon Category:Executed Lebanese people Category:Lebanese Shia Muslims Category:Syrian Shia Muslims Category:People from South Lebanon Category:20th-century executions by France Category:People executed by the French Third Republic Category:People executed for attempted murder ","title":"Adham Khanjar"},{"id":"12398349","text":"Chiasmocleis carvalhoi is a species of frog in the family Microhylidae.

Molecular data suggest that it might belong to the genus Oreophryne. It is known from the vicinity of its type locality in Yapen island, Papua Province, Indonesia, as well as from the Hunstein Mountains (East Sepik Province) and Bewani and Torricelli Mountains (West Sepik Province) in Papua New Guinea. ==Etymology== The specific name balbus is Latin for \\"stuttering\\". This refers to its advertisement call: the first part of the call consists of single notes at relative longer intervals, followed by the second part where intervals are shorter and notes come in groups—this gives an impression of stuttering. ==Description== Cophixalus balbus are small frogs, though relatively large among Cophixalus: adult males measure in snout–vent length. Head is large and as wide as long. Ground colour is yellowish-brownish, with dorsal surfaces covered with small warts. There is a conspicuous, dark grey W-shaped mark in the scapular region. ==Habitat and conservation== Its natural habitat are patches of primary and secondary rainforest. The Yapen island records are from elevations of above sea level, with uncertain records from lower elevations. All specimens were found perched on fern fronds or on shrubs up to 3 m above the ground. The New Guinean records are from a.s.l.

He is a former Member of parliament, Lok Sabha (2009 to 2019) representing Barrackpore constituency of West Bengal. Prior to that he was Member of parliament, Rajya Sabha for two separate terms (1990-1996, 2002 to 2008). He is the former Union Minister for Railways and the former Union Minister of State for Health and Family Welfare under Manmohan Singh's cabinet. Trivedi was recipient of Outstanding Parliamentarian Award for 2016-2017 period and was felicitated at an event at the central hall of Parliament. He is also the Chairman of the Indo-European Union Parliamentary Forum (IEUPF), and other Parliamentary Forums. Ram Nath Kovind, the president of India presenting the Outstanding Parliamentarian Award for the year 2016 to Dinesh Trivedi, at a function, at Parliament House, New Delhi ==Early life== Trivedi is the youngest child of the Gujarati couple, Hiralal and Urmila, who migrated to India from Karachi during India's partition, where all his other siblings were born. His parents lived in a number of places before coming to New Delhi, where he was born. His father then started working for the Hindustan Construction Company in Kolkata. Trivedi attended boarding schools in Himachal Pradesh, before graduating in commerce from St. Xavier's College, Calcutta. He then took a loan of Rs. 20,000 and completed his MBA from The University of Texas at Austin. He also trained to be a pilot, a result of his childhood dream of flying for the Indian Air Force. He is a trained sitar player and enjoys classical music. He also applied to train as an actor at the Film Institute, Pune, but did not follow it up as he then believed it not to be a serious job, as reported by Rediff.com. He was also drawn towards a picture of Swami Vivekananda in an advertisement by the Ramkrishna Mission, and decided to be a monk, but did not do so due to strong advice by his family and a Swami in Chicago. He dons rings with sapphire, emerald and coral on his right hand to ward off the ill-effects of the mangal griha (planet Mars). ==Early career== After his MBA in 1974, he worked in Chicago for two years for the Detex Company, before returning to India, where he worked for a logistics provider Lee and Muirhead. In 1984, he quit the job to start his own air freight company based in Kolkata. He also started a consumer protection centre. ==Petitioner== Trivedi has filed many petitions. He says, \\"I was so fed up of corruption then. I thought I can't progress here. But, my father told me to learn to fight corruption, make your way.\\" Trivedi shot into prominence when he asked the Supreme Court to make the Vohra Report on the criminalisation of politics in India public. This petition gave a push to the Right to Information movement. ==Career as a politician== Trivedi joined the Congress party in the 1980s, but switched over to the Janata Dal in 1990. Later, in 1998 he joined Mamata Banerjee when she started the Trinamool Congress party and became its first general secretary. He was a member of the Upper House in the Indian Parliament during years 1990 - 1996 from Gujarat as Janata Dal candidate and during years 2002 - 2008 from West Bengal as AITC candidate. In the 2009 elections he contested for the Trinamool Congress party and won from Barrackpore to join the lower house in the Parliament. He joined the cabinet as the Minister of State for Health and Family Welfare in 2009. In 2011, he offered to resign as a minister in support of Anna Hazare. In 2011, after Mamata Banerjee quit as the railway minister to become the Chief Minister of West Bengal, he was elevated as the Cabinet Minister for Railways. Railway minister As the Railway minister, he has advocated instituting a rail regulator to fix rail fares, a policy that is diametrically opposite to the one by earlier railway ministers. He has also advocated de-politicizing the Railways and would like to restructure the Indian Railway Board, which lacked synergy before he joined. Trivedi believes that the Indian Railways can add 2% to India's GDP and is willing to go against his party's line of not hiking the fares. However, he believes the government must modernise the railways, for which a fare hike would not be able to generate adequate funds, and has publicly criticised the Prime Minister for not providing funds.. Trivedi is pushing for a national policy on railways, that would continue irrespective of political changes in the government. He has also said that the ministry is also open to the idea of privatisation, which would allow more funds to be allocated to help the system cope with capacity. He stepped down as the Railway Minister on 18 March 2012, a couple of days after presenting his first ever Railway Budget in which he increased passenger fare. This did not go down well with his political party, Trinamool Congress and in particular its head West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee. Trivedi also expressed his interest to start high speed passenger trains in India with Japanese help or French support. In 2011, the script of the James Bond film Skyfall, part of which was shot on trains in India, had to be changed when Trivedi insisted that people not be shown travelling on the roofs of trains, which is illegal. In August 2011, Mamata Banerjee's ministerial room in the Parliament, which has traditionally been allotted to the railway minister, was allotted to another minister as she was his senior colleague in the cabinet. However, before the formal orders could be issued, Trivedi involved the Prime Minister and Mamata Banerjee to get the room allotted to himself to avoid \\"utter humiliation of the Railway Ministry and 14 lakh Railway employees\\". According to The Tribune, his party also reminded the Prime Minister that the UPA owed this to its biggest ally, the AITC. Railway budget controversy On 14 March 2012, Trivedi announced the annual rail budget 2012 that included an all over hike in passenger fares, ranging from 2 paise to 30 paise per kilometre for reasons of safety along with network expansion and modernisation. The fare hike was opposed by his own party's leader, Mamata Banerjee. Senior TMC MPs Sudeep Bandyopadhyay and Derek O'Brien both expressed their disagreement. However, the budget received support from the general public, industry groups and all five Rail Unions. TMC chairperson and Chief Minister of West Bengal, Mamata Banerjee declared that she will not allow any hike in railway fares proposed in the Railway Budget. Banerjee denied being consulted by Railway Minister on the issue of fare hike. On the same day, Mamata Banerjee wrote to Prime Minister Manmohan Singh asking him to dismiss Dinesh Trivedi as Minister of Railways and give the portfolio to another AITMC member of parliament Mukul Roy. Initially, Trivedi requested a written confirmation from Mamata Banerjee before resigning, as he had received conflicting reports on the same from the Leader of the Trinamool Congress parliamentary party - Sudeep Bandyopadhyay and the chief whip of Trinamool Congress in Lok Sabha - Kalyan Banerjee. Finally, on 18 March 2012, Trivedi resigned after making a direct phone call to Mamata Banerjee for confirmation of the party position. Later, Trivedi explicitly clarified that he had resigned because Trinamool Congress and Mamata Banerjee asked him to resign, but that he had received \\"communication\\" that neither PM nor Congress would request for his resignation, with the result that \\"..if I had not resigned on that particular evening (last Sunday), I could have brought uncertainty to government itself and that is not my job\\". On forwarding the resignation to the President with recommendation of acceptance, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh praised the budget presented by Trivedi and expressed \\"regret\\" on his \\"departure\\". ==Personal life== Trivedi is married to Minal, who holds a PhD in genetics. They have a son. ==Positions held== {  - ! Position Held !

The earthquake measured 7.2 on the Moment magnitude scale, caused a huge landslide, resulted in over 28 fatalities and left US$11 million (equivalent to $ million in ) in damage. The slide blocked the flow of the Madison River, resulting in the creation of Quake Lake. Significant effects of the earthquake were also felt in nearby Idaho and Wyoming, and lesser effects as far away as Puerto Rico and Hawaii. The 1959 quake was the strongest and deadliest earthquake to hit Montana, the second being the 1935–36 Helena earthquakes that left four people dead. It also caused the worst landslides in the Northwestern United States since 1927. ==Earthquake== The earthquake occurred at 11:37 p.m. (MST) with a magnitude of 7.2 . The U.S. Weather Bureau reported that the quake lasted 30–40 seconds. During the earthquake the surrounding landscape dropped as much as and shockwaves caused numerous seiches to surge across Hebgen Lake for 12 hours. Water pushed by the seiches poured over the dam which did not collapse. Several aftershocks ranging from 5.8 to 6.3 were reported after the quake. The earthquake struck in Madison Canyon, an area to the west of Yellowstone National Park. Several nearby campgrounds were occupied by vacationing campers and tourists at the time. Highway 287 slumped into Hebgen Lake, 1959 image Although magnitude estimates for the 1959 earthquake vary (the United States Geological Survey recorded the quake at both 7.3 [Abridged from ] and 7.5, now calculated by the ISC as 7.2 ) the 1959 earthquake is comparable to the 1906 San Francisco earthquake as one of the strongest earthquakes in North America, behind the 1964 magnitude 9.2 Good Friday earthquake in Alaska and the 1811–1812 New Madrid earthquakes in Missouri. The 1959 earthquake is also the most severe earthquake in the Rocky Mountain area of the United States along with the 6.9 magnitude earthquake which struck Idaho in 1983. The landslide caused by this quake was the largest since an earthquake in Wyoming in 1925 caused a landslide amounting to of rock and debris that left 28 people dead. The death toll from the quake was also the highest since the 1925 earthquake and most recent for the Northwestern United States since an earthquake in 1927 that left seven people dead. The 1959 earthquake was also the most damaging earthquake to occur in Montana since the 1935–36 earthquakes that left four people dead. The Hebgen Lake area also experienced earthquakes again in 1964, 1974, 1977 and 1985. Effects The landslides caused by the quake carried of rock, mud and debris down into the valley and created hurricane-force winds strong enough to toss cars. In Madison Canyon, the landslide swept away a family of seven, five of whom perished. Two more fatalities were also reported in nearby Cliff Lake to the south. In Rock Creek, tourists camping there were caught off guard by the quake and landslide, which swept them into the creek. The earthquake caused a seiche which inundated trailers and tents, uprooted trees, and injured one additional person. House destruction from the earthquake, July 2009 New geysers and cracks sprouted up in nearby Yellowstone National Park. Near Old Faithful, the earthquake damaged the Old Faithful Inn, forcing guests there to evacuate. Landslides caused by the quake blocked a road between Mammoth and Old Faithful, damaging a bridge inside the park. There was one reported injury when a woman broke her wrist. The earthquake also created fault scarps as high as , causing extensive damage to roads, homes, and buildings. In Belgrade, Montana the earthquake damaged measuring equipment placed in a water well. The quake also knocked out telephone communications between Bozeman and Yellowstone, with the city of Bozeman itself suffering moderate quake damage to homes and buildings. Buildings at the Montana State University campus also sustained quake damage. In Butte, the quake caused a pendulum clock to stop at 12:42 a.m. (MST) and caused minor damage to homes. Areas around Hebgen Lake were also affected as the quake caused parts of the lake to rise . Roads and highways running along the shores of the lake collapsed into the water. In Ennis, most residents were evacuated due to concern Hebgen Lake might flood the town. The evacuation was subsequently called off when it became known the landslide had blocked the river's flow. In West Yellowstone, the earthquake damaged a courthouse and a railroad station. {  + Death toll from the 1959 Yellowstone earthquake - center;\\" ! State ! Reported deaths ! Confirmed deaths ! Unaccounted -  Montana  0  27  1 -  Idaho  8  0  0 } The earthquake also caused damage and fatalities outside of Montana. In Raynolds Pass in Eastern Idaho, a landslide killed eight more people. Seismic waves from the quake were reported in Boise and Macks Inn, Idaho, causing minor well and sewer damage. The final death toll from the earthquake was 28, although some newspaper reports suggested the death toll was high as 50–60. US$11 million (equivalent to $ million in ) in damage was caused. The quake was felt outside the region. In Salt Lake County, Utah, police officers at the local jail and officials at the Salt Lake Municipal Airport felt the effects of the earthquake. Water levels in wells were affected as far away as Hawaii, away, where water in wells fluctuated , and in Puerto Rico. Levels in nearby Idaho fluctuated as much as . Quake Lake The landslide caused by the quake blocked the flow of the Madison River. The blockage caused the water to rise and formed a new lake, which was later to be named Quake Lake (officially Earthquake Lake).. Fearing that the pressure caused by the rising water would result in a catastrophic flood, the Army Corps of Engineers began to cut a wide and deep channel into the slide. By September 10, water began to flow through the channel. To prevent more erosion by the flowing water, the Army Corps cut another channel which was completed on October 29. The construction of the two channels cost US$1.7 million (equivalent to $ million in ). ==Aftermath== Amateur radio operator K7ICM transmitted news of the quake at 11:43 p.m. (MST). At 11:50 p.m., another amateur in Idaho contacted the Idaho State Police who in turn contacted their headquarters in Boise. The Montana Highway Patrol, Montana State Civil Defense and the Montana Department of Fish, Wildlife and Parks also received word of the earthquake and its effects. The geography of the area plus the damage from the earthquake disrupted and/or obstructed radio communications, making broadcasting accurate information about the quakes effects difficult. The Yellowstone County Chapter of the American Red Cross, Salvation Army and various other local, national, and organizations from multiple states sent aid to the victims of the earthquake. The Red Cross also set up temporary housing in Bozeman and the Wyoming Department of Health sent 200 trailers to the Yellowstone area to be used as hospitals. Because the majority of the roads in and around the Yellowstone area were either damaged or blocked by the landslides and the quake, equipment and personnel from the United States Air Force and the U.S. Forest Service were brought in to transport the injured to nearby hospitals outside the quake zone and to perform search and rescue missions in Madison Canyon. 300 people trapped in the canyon were rescued. Rescuers found five to nine bodies in the earthquake zone. Residents from the town of Ennis, were evacuated to Virginia City and Butte. Road damage from the earthquake, 1959 image Senators and Representatives Frank Moss (D-Utah), John Baldwin (R-California), Harold Johnson (D-California), Lee Metcalf (D-Montana), Leroy Anderson (D-Montana), Tom Morris (D-New Mexico) and Gracie Pfost (D-Idaho) flew over and surveyed the disaster area. The Senate Interior and Insular Affairs Committee requested Montana Governor J. Hugo Aronson to declare the areas hardest hit by the quake a disaster area. Wyoming Governor John J. Hickey provided help and equipment in the aftermath of the quake. The Montana National Guard was called to the quake area to prevent looting of campsites left abandoned by the quake. The Idaho National Guard were also sent to the quake area. The Montana Highway Department began clearing roads of debris and mud. The work was slowed by aftershocks and smaller landslides. On August 19, US Highway 20 and US Highway 191 were reopened while Montana State Highway 1 remained closed. Three bridges in Duck Creek, Cougar Creek and Madison Canyon were repaired and reopened as well. Because of the threat of gasoline spilling into the Missouri River, a local pipeline company built an emergency pumping station. The Montana Power Company surveyed Hebgen Dam and found it sustained minimal damage. Hebgen Lake was completely drained for crewmen to make repairs and to rid it of dead or dying fish. Overall repairs to the Yellowstone National Park amounted to US$2.6 million (equivalent to $ million in ). Fifty people including police officers, members of the Red Cross and others held a memorial service a mile north of the slide in Madison Canyon for campers presumed buried under the quake-induced landslide. The services lasted for 15 minutes. After the quake, the U.S. Forest Service built the Quake Lake visitor center on top of the landslide which was completed in 1967. The U.S. Forest Service placed a plaque on one of the boulders that fell during the quake to honor the 19–21 people who were killed during the quake-induced landslide. ==See also== * List of earthquakes in 1959 * List of earthquakes in the United States * Yellowstone Caldera ==ReferencesExternal links== * The Night the Mountain Fell, Peeling Back the Bark, Forest History Society. * Hebgen Lake earthquake, 1959 Category:Yellowstone Caldera Hebgen Lake earthquake, 1959 Category:Earthquakes in Montana Category:Earthquakes in Idaho Category:Earthquakes in Wyoming Hebgen Lake earthquake, 1959 Category:1959 in Montana Category:1959 in Idaho Category:1959 in Wyoming Hebgen Lake earthquake ","title":"1959 Hebgen Lake earthquake"},{"id":"12398501","text":"The mountain-top nursery-frog (Cophixalus monticola) is a species of frog in the family Microhylidae.

The fingers and toes bear very small terminal discs; those of the toes are slightly larger than the finger ones. No webbing is present. Skin is smooth. Living animals are medium grayish-brown to fawn; some are irregularly mottled. The sides are darker. Many individuals have a narrow mid-dorsal stripe. There are black canthal and postpostorbital stripes. The undersurfaces are yellow with grey vermiculations on the throat and, in some individuals, extending to the abdomen. Preserved specimens are pale gray to dull brown above, apart from the tip of the snout, which is unpigmented. An elongate and slightly irregular black stripe extends from the postorbital to the scapular regions. The undersurfaces are pale cream, heavily suffused with brown under the jaws and on the limbs. ==Habitat and conservation== Copiula fistulans is found on forested hillsides at fairly low elevations, below . It lives in burrows in the forest floor and appears to avoid low-lying, flat areas where the soil is subject to inundation. It has also been found in burrows on abandoned logging roads and can tolerate some habitat modification. It has direct development (i.e., there is no free-living larval stage). Copiula fistulans is locally a very common species and is facing no known threats.

Tomato frogs live up to their name by possessing a vibrant, orange-red colour. Females are much larger than males and have brighter tones of red or orange on their back, with a pale undersurface. Some individuals also have black spots on the throat. It is thought that the brilliant colours of the tomato frog act as a warning to potential predators that these frogs are toxic; a white substance secreted from the skin acts as a glue to deter predators (such as colubrid snakes) and can produce an allergic reaction in humans. ==Habitat and distribution== Endemic to Madagascar, tomato frogs are found in the northeast of the island around Antongil Bay (from which they gain their specific name, antongilii), and south to Andevoranto. The exact distribution of this species is unclear however, due to confusion with the closely related D. guineti.Arkive profile . The tomato frog breeds in shallow pools, swamps and areas of slow-moving water. These frogs are found from sea level to elevations of around 200 metres. Its natural habitats are subtropical or tropical moist lowland forests, rivers, swamps, freshwater marshes, intermittent freshwater marshes, arable land, plantations, rural gardens, urban areas, heavily degraded former forest, ponds, and canals and ditches. ==Life cycle and ecology== Tomato Frog at Dählhölzli Animal Park Tomato frogs breed in February to March following heavy rainfall; the sounds of males calling to attract females can be heard around small water bodies in the dark Malagasy night. Following copulation, females will lay a clutch of 1,000 to 1,500 eggs on the surface of the water. Tadpoles hatch from these small black and white eggs about 36 hours later; they are only around six millimetres long and feed by filter-feeding. Tadpoles undergo metamorphosis into yellow juveniles and this stage is completed around 45 days after the eggs were laid. Ambushing potential prey, adult tomato frogs feed on small invertebrates, such as beetles, mosquitoes, and flies. When threatened, these frogs can inflate themselves, giving the appearance of greater size.Glaw, F. and Vences, M. (1992) A Field Guide to the Amphibians and Reptiles of Madagascar. M. Vences, Cologne. ==Threats and conservation== The tomato frog is classified as Near Threatened (NT) on the IUCN Red List,Dyscophus antongilii 2006 IUCN Red List of Threatened Species. Downloaded on 14 January 2011. and listed on Appendix I of CITES.CITES Appendices Numbers of the tomato frog have been declining as a result of habitat degradation and pollution and the over-collection of these brightly coloured amphibians for the pet trade. Collecting activity, and the associated decline in population, was predominately focused near to the town of Maroantsetra. The tomato frog was rapidly included on Appendix I of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) in response to this pressure. Research into captive breeding techniques for the tomato frog has been carried out by Baltimore Zoo in the United States in an effort to boost the currently small and genetically deprived captive population that exists in that country. A consortium of U.S. zoos that form the Madagascar Fauna Group (MFG) have established an exhibit at the Parc Zoologique Ivoloina, Madagascar in an attempt to help educate local people about this attractive member of their natural heritage. Very little is known about the tomato frog and further research into its distribution, behaviour and potential threats is urgently needed before effective conservation measures can be put into place. It is currently listed on Appendix I of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES), but this move has been criticised by some authors as an ineffective strategy and one that has undermined the status of the unlisted D. guineti.Andreone, F. and Luiselli, L.M. (2003) Conservation priorities and potential threats influencing the hyper-diverse amphibians of Madagascar. Italian Journal of Zoology, 70: 53-63.

Its common names include blunt-headed burrowing frog and balloon frog. ==Distribution and Habitat== It is found in Cambodia, Laos, Myanmar, Thailand, and Vietnam. Its natural habitats are subtropical or tropical dry forests, subtropical or tropical moist lowland forests, moist savanna, intermittent freshwater marshes, rural gardens, temporary ponds, and heavily degraded former forest. ==Breeding Biology== These large, burrowing frogs follow the general theme of microhylids that deposit aquatic eggs. There is explosive breeding activity in ephemeral water sources such as ponds and ditches. The frogs perform multiple amplectic dips to oviposit surface films of pigmented eggs. A portion of a clutch is released with each dip, with a dip lasting for about 6 seconds. 200-300 eggs are released per dip. The ova have a dark black animal pole and yellow vegetal pole.Zootaxa. 2014 Jun 4;(3811):381-6. doi: 10.11646/zootaxa.3811.3.9.

Genetic analysis suggests hidden diversity within the nominal species. ==Description== Adult males from Peru measure and adult females in snout–vent length; some populations might be smaller in body size. The body is moderately robust. The fingers and toes bear distinct terminal discs; lateral fringes and webbing are not present. The dorsum is tan with a large, brown mid-dorsal blotch. There is usually a faint, creamy white mid-dorsal stripe. The flanks, sides of the head, and concealed surfaces of the limbs are dark brown. Males have dark brown throat. The belly and ventral surfaces of the hind limbs are creamy white with brown spots or reticulations. The iris is pale bronze and has fine black reticulations. ==Habitat and conservation== These frogs are found in the leaf litter of primary and secondary tropical rainforests at elevations up to above sea level. They are nocturnal and feed on ants on the ground or on tree trunks and branches. Breeding takes place in ponds and flooded areas within forest after heavy rains. This species is widespread but uncommon in much of its range. No significant threats affecting this species have been identified. == Behavior == The frog has been spotted in close association with the Colombian lesserblack tarantula. It is possible that they have a mutualistic relationship in which the spider may protect the frog and its eggs from predators while the frog protects the spider's eggs from ants, as observed between frog Chiasmocleis ventrimaculata and the same species of tarantula. ==References== boliviana Category:Amphibians of Bolivia Category:Amphibians of Brazil Category:Amphibians of Colombia Category:Amphibians of Ecuador Category:Amphibians of French Guiana Category:Amphibians of Guyana Category:Amphibians of Peru Category:Amphibians of Suriname Category:Amphibians of Venezuela Category:Amphibians described in 1927 Category:Taxa named by Hampton Wildman Parker Category:Taxonomy articles created by Polbot ","title":"Hamptophryne boliviana"},{"id":"12398710","text":"Hamptophryne (common name: bleating frogs) is a small genus of microhylid frogs from South America.

After the holotype was collected in 1944, the species went unrecorded until a population was found in the Una Biological Reserve and its surroundings in 1999. It is now known from four locations. Common name Bahia yellow frog has been coined for it, perhaps in reference to the bright lemon yellow coloration of the holotype. It was the only species in the genus Hyophryne until 2012 when molecular data demonstrated that it is nested within Stereocyclops species. ==Description== Males measure and females in snout–vent length (SVL). The body is oval, and the head is wider than it is long, truncate in dorsal view and slightly protruding laterally. The eyes are small and the tympanum is indistinct. The fingers are short, robust, and without webbing. The toes are fringed and have webbing. Dorsal coloration is variable, yellow-lime, yellow, orange, green, beige or dark-brown. The venter is dark and has white rounded or elongated blotches. The iris is silver dorsally and black ventrally. The body surface is smooth; however, males larger than about SVL have dermal spines that in extreme cases cover the entire body. only gravid females have dermal spines in the pericloacal region. Two females, both measuring SVL, contained 590 and 1190 ovarian eggs measuring in diameter. ==Habitat and conservation== Its habitat is primary and secondary forest. Presumably it is an explosive breeder. It is locally abundant in the Una Biological Reserve, where it was inhabiting primary forest as well as the surrounding forest fragments, secondary forest, and cacao groves.

The Ministerial Council introduced the Murray-Darling Cap in response to the 1995 report titled \\"An Audit of Water Use in the Murray-Darling Basin\\". ==Role of the MDBA== Map of the Murray-Darling Basin With the creation of the MDBA in 2008, for the first time, a single inter-governmental body assumed responsibility for planning the integrated management of water resources of the Murray-Darling Basin. In addition to the Commission's former functions, the MDBA's role includes: * preparing, implementing and enforcing the Murray-Darling Basin Plan * advising the minister on the accreditation of state water resource plans * developing a water rights information service which facilitates water trading across the Murray-Darling basin * measuring and monitoring water resources in the basin * gathering information and undertaking research * educating and engaging the community in the management of the basin's resources. The Murray–Darling Basin Authority is an integral element of the Commonwealth Government's program Water for the Future which has four priorities; namely: # tackling climate change # supporting healthy rivers # using water wisely and # securing water supplies. The MDBA also commissions research into aquatic science and is a source of information on Australian freshwater biology. ==History== Since 1914, there have been various intergovernmental agreements relating to Murray‑Darling water resources. Prior to the formation of the Murray-Darling Basin Authority, institutional arrangements for water resources management lay with the five State and Territory governments in the Basin, with little co- ordination. In response to this problem, the Murray-Darling Basin Commission was established in January 1988 under the Murray-Darling Basin Agreement, with a charter to efficiently manage and equitably distribute River Murray water resources. Secondly, it was to protect and improve the water quality of the River Murray and its tributaries; and lastly to advise the Murray-Darling Ministerial Council on water, land and environmental management in the Basin. The controversial history of water allocation in the Basin and disputes between irrigators and environmentalists dates from the 1960s and is documented in the book, Cottoning On: Stories of Australian Cottongrowing by Siobhan McHugh (Hale and Iremonger 1996), which was shortlisted for the NSW Premier's History Prize in 1997.https://trove.nla.gov.au/work/14433026?selectedversion=NBD12442035 The Water Amendment Act 2008 was introduced in December 2008 to amend the Water Act 2007. This law transferred authority from the Murray-Darling Basin Commission to the Murray-Darling Basin Authority, creating an independent, expert-based body that would manage the Basin holistically for the first time. As at November 2016, the MDBA is four years into the implementation phase of the Basin Plan. The MDBA has published major bodies of work including: * Basin environmental watering strategy * Annual environmental watering priorities * Constraints management strategy * New water trade operating rules The MDBA also established a water trading scheme across Basin states to increase water use efficiency. In summer 2018-2019, there were substantial fish kill events in the Murray-Darling basin. A report released in January 2019 by the Productivity Commission found that the Murray-Darling Basin Authority should be broken up. ==Murray-Darling Basin Plan== On 8 October 2010, the MDBA released a major document entitled the Guide to the Proposed Murray-Darling Basin Plan outlining a plan to secure the long-term ecological health of the Murray-Darling Basin. The guide introduced cutting existing water allocations and increasing environmental flows. The proposed plan was the first part of a three-stage process to address the problems of the Murray-Darling Basin; namely, over-allocation, prolonged drought, natural climate variability and climate change, leading to deteroriation of rivers, wetlands, forests and floodplains in the basin. The MDBA was responsible for preparing the Murray- Darling Basin Plan, which was released in November 2011. The Plan proposes that 2,750 gigalitres per year be cut from water allocations over seven years. The Plan was signed off by Tony Burke, Minister for Sustainability, Environment, Water, Population and Communities on 22 November 2012, and passed the Australian Parliament on 29 November 2012. The MDBA is responsible for overseeing the legally enforceable management Plan. The main aim of the Basin Plan is to return around 2,750 gigalitres to the river system. The MDBA originally reported that the volume of water as high as 7,600 gigalitres per year would bring long-term sustainability and would be the best scenario for the ecosystems of the basin but \\"would not be socially or economically viable\\". The Basin Plan sets and enforces environmentally sustainable limits on the quantities of water that may be taken from Basin water resources. It has Basin-wide environmental, water quality and salinity objectives and aims to develop efficient water trading regimes across the Basin. The plan includes requirements for state water resource plans and aims to improve water security for all Basin users.Summary of Murrumbidgee Region From the Guide to the proposed Basin Plan The Basin Plan aims to achieve a balance between environmental, economic and social considerations. Objections After the release of the Guide to the Proposed Murray-Darling Basin Plan there were a significant number of protests and voiced concerns in rural towns that the MDBA visited to present the proposed plan at consultation meetings. In Renmark, more than 500 people attended the Authority's first public consultation meeting in the local hotel that accommodated only 250 people. The draft plan proposed water buybacks of up to 35% in the Riverland area, forcing job losses and reduced flows to angry irrigators. Over 5,000 people attended a meeting in Griffith where the local Mayor, Mike Neville, said the plan would \\"obliterate\\" Murrumbidgee valley communities. Other groups also echoed this feeling, such as the Victorian Farmers Federation and the Wine Group Growers' Australia. At the same time, there was also support for the draft plan by various groups, including the Australian Conservation Foundation, and Environment Victoria. In legal advice, dated 25 October 2010, from the Australian Government Solicitor, the Government's reading is that the draft plan must give equal weight to the environmental, social and economic impacts of proposed cuts to irrigation. Environmentalists and South Australian irrigators say the Authority should stick to its original figure. In October 2010, a parliamentary inquiry into the economic impacts of the plan was announced. While, in November 2010, the Authority announced that it might be forced to push back the release of its final plan for the river system until early 2012. Less than one month later, Mike Taylor, then Chair of MDBA, announced his decision to resign effective from the end of January 2011. In announcing his resignation, he cited his concerns that the Water Act made it difficult to balance the environmental and socio-economic impacts of cuts to water allocations aimed at rescuing rivers in the basin. Of crucial concern was Taylor's desire to not oversee a process that returned less than 3,000 GL to the basin. Both the Prime Minister, Julia Gillard, and the Water Minister, Tony Burke, rejected Taylor's concerns that the Water Act and the objectives of the Authority were compromised. In May 2011, the Wentworth Group of Concerned Scientists withdrew its support for the Basin Plan, and described the process as seriously flawed and a waste of taxpayers' money. The Wentworth Group said they could not support the Plan which they believed would cost billions and claimed that it would not fix the problems in the river system. The Wentworth Group wanted a minimum 4,000 gigalitres of water returned to the river system but the Group believed that it would not happen under the draft plan. Water buybacks In June 2011, a federal parliamentary committee (chaired by independent Tony Windsor) delivered its report to MDBA and its recommendations on water cutbacks in the basin. The committee was told river communities faced annihilation if 4,000 gigalitres was returned to the environment. The committee also reported that the health of the river system could be protected without the cuts. The Australian Conservation Foundation said it was disappointed by the report delivered by the inquiry into the Murray-Darling river system. The Foundation believed that buybacks were the most efficient way to save the basin. According to the Wentworth Group, the Commonwealth Government originally planned to start buying the 2,750 gigalitres of water and to increase groundwater extractions by 2,600 gigalitres at the same time in March 2011.Scientists want 'manipulated' Basin plan scrapped - ABC News, 19 January 2011. Much of the groundwater is linked to river systems, but the Plan does not count it in the models.:Wentworth Group Statement on the 2011 Draft Murray-Darling Basin Plan In late May 2012, a revision of the plan was forwarded to state water ministers for review. It did not alter the recommendation to return 2,750 gigalitres of water to the environment by cutting water entitlements. Following much negotiation between the Commonwealth and state governments and numerous submissions from interested stakeholders and the community, the Basin Plan finally became law in November 2012. == Royal Commission into compliance with plan == In 2017, after claims that upstream states had not been complying with the Murray- Darling Basin Plan, South Australian Premier Jay Weatherill requested that the Federal Government undertake a judicial enquiry or Royal Commission to determine who was to blame for \\"water theft\\" and whether upstream states had been complicit. When the Federal Government rejected the request, Weatherill then launched a South Australian Royal Commission in January 2018 to investigate.http://www.abc.net.au/news/2017-11-26/sa-to-launch-royal- commission-into-river-murray-theft/9194368 The Weatherill Ministry fell in 2019, and then the Federal Government barred Murray Darling Basin Authority officials from giving evidence to the Royal Commission. The Commissioner, Bret Walker SC, also wrote to the new South Australian Attorney-General Vickie Chapman of the Marshall Ministry asking for an extension, but this was rejected.https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/aug/13/murray- darling-inquiry-scramble-for-documents-after-sa-refuses-to-extend-deadline Subsequently other requests for an inquiry have been made, following mass fish deaths in the Darling River. ==See also== *Catchment Management Authority (New South Wales) *Catchment Management Authority (Victoria) *River Basin Management Plans ==ReferencesExternal links== * Official Murray-Darling Basin Authority website * Murray-Darling Basin Commission - archived website * An essay describing the MDBC's response to extreme drought conditions, Presented by Dr Wendy Craik in May 2008 * An essay which details the Murray- Darling Basin Authority's Living Murray Initiative, presented at the Australian Government Productivity Commission's Roundtable Proceedings \\"Promoting Better Environmental Outcomes\\" by Wendy Craik in August 2008 * The Basin Plan - Murray-Darling Basin Authority * Guide to the Proposed Basin Plan - Murray-Darling Basin Authority * Murray-Darling Basin Science - Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO) * Research to support Murray-Darling Basin industries and communities - CSIRO * Murray-Darling Basin Plan - Environment Victoria Murray-Darling Basin Authority Category:Commonwealth Government agencies of Australia Category:Water in Australia Category:2008 establishments in Australia Category:Government agencies established in 2008 Category:Water management authorities ","title":"Murray-Darling Basin Authority"},{"id":"12398790","text":"Kalophrynus minusculus is a species of frog in the family Microhylidae.

In 1970 the Sangkum Reastr Niyum came to a brutal end with the coup d'état led by General Lon Nol. Vann, who had been the Sangkum's longest serving Minister of Education, relocated to Switzerland with his family. He worked for the United Nations Human Settlements Programme for 10 years before eventually returning to Cambodia in 1991 where he served as President of the Council of Ministers, Minister of Culture, Fine Arts, Town and Country Planning. In 2008 he completed his doctoral thesis on the development and planning of Asian cities entitled Modern Khmer Cities. Many of his buildings are now under threat due to redevelopment and speculative land deals. His landmark National Theatre and the Council of Ministers building were demolished in 2008. The National Sports Complex was sold to a private developer in 2001 who has filled up its vital hydraulic system, consisting of moats and water treatment stations, with shoddy constructions, hence compromising its survival. == Works == From 1955 to 1970, Vann built nearly 100 projects.

The property contains a house completed in 1842 and several outbuildings. It is located at 5656 Burlington Pike (Kentucky Route 18), west of Burlington, Kentucky. ==Overview== In 1839, James and Martha Dinsmore purchased approximately in Boone County, Kentucky. He and his family, which included daughters, Isabella Dinsmore, Julia Dinsmore, and Susan Dinsmore, settled there, and with the help of slave labor, raised sheep and grew grapes and willows for a basket-making business that was overseen by German immigrants. The house is notable for containing all original artifacts that were purchased by the family primarily in Cincinnati, Ohio, and southern Indiana. Some of the stores they shopped at over the years included Shillito's, McAlpin's, Gest & Bruns, and Hunnewell, Hill & Co., all early Cincinnati establishments. The primary sources belonging to the Foundation allow docents to highlight the Dinsmore family's connections to people like: George Washington, Alexander Macomb, Silas Dinsmoor, James Bowie, John Bell, Samuel Bell, John Ross, Henry Clay, Andrew Jackson, General Alexander Macomb, Margaret Coxe, Mathew Brady, Nellie Taft, Enid Yandell, Tyrone Power, Sarah Gibson Humphreys, Benjamin F.

Dining table at the Dinsmore Homestead The Dinsmore family, who lived in the historic home from 1842 through 1926, were associated with many historical events and trends that help to inform an understanding of local, regional, national, and global history. Some of the interesting events members of the family were involved in and wrote about include: relations between the U. S. Government and the Cherokee and Choctaw, early Republic land speculations, (for example, Macomb's Purchase), the Texas Revolution of 1836, Early Republic politics, the Adams Express Company, the American Civil War, the Spanish–American War, the sinking of the Titanic, the sinking of the Lusitania, and World War I. ==Current use== In 1987, the Dinsmore Homestead Foundation purchased the home and approximately to preserve the site. A collection of nearly 90,000 pages of family letters, journals and business records have been preserved on microfilm for use at the Dinsmore Homestead. The home is open for guided tours and the grounds are open to the public. Significant focal points of the Homestead's history include, but are not limited to women's history, African American history, the history of slavery and Reconstruction, Native American history, agricultural history, and the histories of Mississippi, Louisiana, and Kentucky. ==ReferencesExternal links== * Dinsmore Homestead * Discover Northern Kentucky: Dinsmore Homestead Part I * Discover Northern Kentucky: Dinsmore Homestead Part II Category:National Register of Historic Places in Boone County, Kentucky Category:Houses completed in 1842 Category:Historic house museums in Kentucky Category:Museums in Boone County, Kentucky Category:Houses on the National Register of Historic Places in Kentucky Category:Houses in Boone County, Kentucky ","title":"Dinsmore Homestead"},{"id":"12398865","text":"Kaloula verrucosa, the verrucous digging frog or Chinese narrowmouth toad, is a species of frog in the family Microhylidae.

It is endemic to the Philippines, where it is found in the mountains of southeastern Luzon Island and Polillo Island. The specific name walteri honors , an American herpetologist. Common name Walter's narrow-mouthed frog has been proposed for it. Kaloula walteri is most closely related to Kaloula rigida. ==Description== Adult males measure and adult females, based on a single specimen only, in snout–vent length. The overall appearance is rotund. The head is small. The snout is slightly pointed. The tympanum is partially concealed by the supratympanic fold. The fingers have slightly expanded discs. The toes have barely evident fleshy basal webbing. Skin is smooth. Dorsal coloration is reddish brown, gray brown, dark lavender, or light gray. Most specimens have marbled dorsal pattern, but some are uniformly colored. The venter is light reddish to orange brown with pale yellowish to whitish spots, or rarely pale gray with cream spots. The throat is reddish brown in the female and very dark gray to black in males. ==Habitat and conservation== Kaloula walteri inhabits lower montane and lowland forests at elevations up to above sea level. It can occasionally be found in human-modified habitats beside such forests. Its preferred habitat are cool and unpolluted mountain streams and ephemeral pools, which are also its larval habitat. It is sometimes observed in dry stream beds too. It can be locally common in mountain streams. However, it is threatened by habitat loss caused by small-scale shifting agriculture, expanding human settlements, wood collection, and illegal logging. It is present in Mount Banahaw-San Cristobal Protected Landscape and Mount Isarog Natural Park. ==ReferencesExternal links== *Kaloula walteri – novataxa.blogspot.com walteri Category:Frogs of Asia Category:Amphibians of the Philippines Category:Endemic fauna of the Philippines Category:Amphibians described in 2002 Category:Taxa named by Angel Chua Alcala Category:Taxa named by Rafe M.

William Fitt Secondary Modern School moved from its temporary site (shared with Winns Avenus Junior School) in Elphinstone Road, to the new purpose built school building in Lloyds Park in September 1962. The Headteacher at the time was Mr G R Easton. The school's motto was \\"Semper Aptus\\" ('Always Fit' or 'Always Prepared') Notable ex-pupils include Cartrain, choreographer Matthew Bourne and footballers Teddy Sheringham, Colin Kazim-Richards and Chris Day. Aveling Park was created from the merging of William Fitt and Chapel End Senior School at the start of the 1986 school year. Although the two schools merged, the sites were retained and known as their respective previous names until the demolition of the old Victorian Chapel End school building some years later.

Frogs of the species that was eventually described as Microhyla nepenthicola had been known for at least 100 years prior to its description in 2010. However, scientists had always assumed that the frogs were juveniles of another species. Researchers and Alexander Haas recognized that they were actually adults when they heard the frogs calling in Kubah National Park, since only adult frogs make calls. Adult males call from the pitcher plants at dusk. However, in 2011 it was shown that Microhyla borneensis and Microhyla nepenthicola are the same species. What was until that point commonly known as Microhyla borneensis was another species, newly described as Microhyla malang. The smallest known Old World frog species prior to the description of Microhyla nepenthicola were Stumpffia pygmaea and Stumpffia tridactyla,Stumpffia pygmaea with a snout-vent length of 10–12.5 mmAbout Stumpffia pygmaea page192-193,Stumpffia tridactyla with a snout-vent length of 8.6–12 mm.About Stumpffia tridactyl PDF.page66-67(page336-337) ==Description== Microhyla borneensis is a very small species with a snout to vent length of about for females and around two thirds of this for males. It has a broadly triangular body that is flattened dorso-ventrally. The snout is obtusely pointed, the eyes are small and have round pupils and there are no visible tympani. The skin on the dorsal surface may be smooth or bear tubercles and that of the ventral surface is always smooth. The limbs are short. The hands are unwebbed and the outer digits are spatulate. The digits of the feet are partially webbed. The dorsal surface of this frog is reddish- brown, the throat is mottled brown and the ventral surface is pale. ==Distribution and habitat== Microhyla borneensis is known from the Matang Range in Sarawak, Borneo, but it is presumably widespread in suitable habitats in the lowlands of northern Borneo. M. borneensis is found near Mount Serapi in Kubah National Park, Sarawak, Borneo. It spends much of its life cycle in the traps of the pitcher plant Nepenthes ampullaria, after which it is named. It is therefore considered a nepenthebiont. This is not particularly unusual; in fact, it shares this environment with a species of crab spider, Misumenops nepenthicola, which is also commonly found in Nepenthes pitchers, and is similarly named for this reason. Microhyla nepenthicola has less webbing on its feet than most frogs, which may be beneficial when trying to climb the sides of the pitcher plants, which can be slippery. ==Biology== Microhyla borneensis breeds in the water-filled pitchers of Nepenthes ampullaria, a pitcher plant that is a feature of the floor of the Borneo rainforest. Multiple clutches may be laid in the same pitcher which may contain tadpoles of different ages. Metamorphosis takes place about a fortnight after the eggs are laid. ==Status== This frog is seldom seen, perhaps because of its small size and inconspicuous appearance. Its numbers are thought to be in slow decline but the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) rates it as being of \\"Least Concern\\" as it considers that the rate of decline is insufficient to justify listing it in a more threatened category. No particular threats to this species have been identified. ==See also== *Smallest amphibian ==References== borneensis Category:Amphibians described in 1928 Category:Taxa named by Hampton Wildman Parker Category:Nepenthes infauna Category:Endemic fauna of Borneo Category:Endemic fauna of Malaysia Category:Amphibians of Malaysia Category:Taxonomy articles created by Polbot ","title":"Microhyla borneensis"},{"id":"12398969","text":"The painted chorus frog (Microhyla butleri, also commonly known as Butler's narrow-mouthed toad, Butler's pigmy frog, Butler's rice frog, Butler's ricefrog, noisy frog, or tubercled pygmy frog) is a species of frog in the family Microhylidae.

It has a relatively small head with a rounded tubercle on its upper eyelid but apart from this its skin is smooth. Its digits have slightly enlarged tips and are partially webbed. The dorsal surface of this frog is pale greyish-brown with a central double arrowhead pattern of darker brown and dark, blackish sides. The tadpole is black with transparent fins on its tail which has a pointed end. Its eyes are located on the sides of its head and the spiracle is central and sheathed with a flap of skin. ==Distribution and habitat== This frog is known from several widely separated locations in Malaysia. These include the Batu Caves, the Taman Negara National Park, and the Sekayu waterfalls in Trengganu-Berry. It is also found in Sumatra, Nias, Java, Madura and Bali. Its distribution within Indonesia is fragmented. Its habitat is among grasses in marshy land at altitudes of up to and in forests and forest fringes. It breeds in slow- flowing streams and stagnant water. ==Status== This frog has a wide range and although the population seems to be declining, the IUCN rates it as being of \\"Least Concern\\" as it considers that the rate of decline is insufficient to justify listing it in a more threatened category.

The fingers have no webbing whereas the toes have basal webbing. The dorsum is yellowish brown to brown. Darker markings may be present. The ventrum is yellow to grayish white. The male advertisement call is \\"harsh\\" with rapidly repeated notes. Individual notes are not discernible to the human ear. The rate of repetition varies considerably between individuals, about 50–135 notes per second, but is more constant for individual frogs. ==Habitat and conservation== Oreophryne geislerorum occurs in rainforests, rural gardens, and urban areas at elevations up to about above sea level Active by night, males call from shrubs and trees, sometimes high up. They have been observed to lay eggs inside the stalk of a banana leaf near the main stem. Development is direct, without free-living tadpole stage. Oreophryne geislerorum is a very common, adaptable species that is not facing any known threats. Its range includes the Kamiali Wildlife Management Area. ==References== geislerorum Category:Amphibians of Papua New Guinea Category:Endemic fauna of Papua New Guinea Category:Taxa named by Oskar Boettger Category:Amphibians described in 1892 Category:Taxonomy articles created by Polbot ","title":"Oreophryne geislerorum"},{"id":"12399135","text":"Oreophryne geminus is a species of frog in the family Microhylidae.

Acriculturally induced eutrophication is also a threat. Omphiscola glabra has disappeared widely from urbanized areas such as London. Drawing of the shell. ==Shell description== The shell is strongly cylindrical, horny, often with a brownish or blackish surface, the apex is blunt, 7-8 moderately convex whorls, with last whorl being twice as high as the narrow aperture, and with aperture often with white lip. The height of the shell is 9–12 mm, up to 15 mm or up to 20 mm. The width of the shell is 3–4 mm, up to 5.5 mm. Jackiewicz M. (2000). Blotniarky Europy (Gastropoda: Pulmonata: Lymnaeidae). Wydawnictwo Kontekst, Poznań. 115 pp. shells of Omphiscola glabra ==Habitat== This snail lives in places such as swampy meadows and ditches. Omphiscola glabra is said to occur in small areas of standing water that have a lot of vegetation such as swamps, and also in standing forest waters with leaf litter, often in water with organic iron contents and low calcium contents. In Central France, the populations of Omphiscola glabra are currently declining because its habitat is threatened by modern agricultural practices. In Britain however, this species occurs in small standing waters that are low in nutrients, with poor aquatic flora, often in waters drying out periodically. They usually do not occur in habitats with high molluscan diversity, and usually in habitats on uncultivated land. They are calciphile and have a pH tolerance of 5.4-8.8. Reproduction begins in May. Juveniles hatch after 15–25 days. Omphiscola glabra has two generations per year. == Parasites == Omphiscola glabra can serve as an intermediate host for several digenean trematodes. In France, Omphiscola glabra is naturally infected with Fasciola hepatica, Calicophoron daubneyi, and Haplometra cylindracea.; in all, seven digenean species parasitize O. glabra in the Brenne Regional Natural Park, central France. Moreover, a report suggests that the species is also susceptible to Fascioloides magna infection. ==References== This article incorporates public domain text from the reference.\\"Species summary for Omphiscola glabra\\".

It was described as Oreophryne nana, but based on molecular data it was moved to Aphantophryne in 2017. Common names Camiguin cross frog, Camiguin narrow-mouthed frog, and volcano cross frog have been coined for the species. ==Description== Aphantophryne nana are small, moderately slender-bodied frogs. Adult females in the type series measure in snout–vent length; no males were collected. The head is broader than it is long. The snout is short and bluntly round–pointed. The canthus rostralis is rounded. The tympanum is distinct. The fingers and the toes are dilated into moderately large disks (with the exception of the first finger). Skin is smooth. Preserved specimens are dusky brown, apart from the blackish snout, upper eyelids, and axillary and loreal regions.

This species was formerly included in the genus Oreophryne, but was in 2017 moved to Aphantophryne based on molecular data. The specific name parkeri honours Hampton Wildman Parker, an English zoologist and herpetologist. Common name Parker's cross frog has been coined for it. ==Description== Adult males measure about and adult females in snout–vent length (each of these ranges is based on just two specimens). The head is relatively narrow. The snout bluntly rounded, approaching truncate, in dorsal view, and vertical in profile. The canthus rostralis is rounded. The tympanum is moderately distinct to indistinct. The fingers and the toes have well- developed terminal disks. The fingers have no webbing whereas the toes have moderate webbing. The dorsum is light brown and has irregular darker small spots interrupted by a sharply defined, dark W-like mark in the scapular area. There are abundant tiny white spots over all dorsal and lateral surfaces and limbs. The iris is dark brown. The male advertisement call is a train of 21–34 notes, with a dominant frequency of 2600–2900 Hz. The notes are uttered at a rate of 5 s−1, and the call lasts about 5 seconds. ==Habitat and conservation== Aphantophryne parkeri occurs in very disturbed forests and sago swamps in highly disturbed habitats at above sea level.

It is endemic to Papua New Guinea and only known from a single specimen collected from \\"Deutsch-Neu-Guinea\\", in what now is Madang Province. Common name Wolterstorff's cross frog has been coined for it. ==Etymology== The specific name wolterstorffi honours Willy Wolterstorff, German geologist and herpetologist. ==Discovery and distribution== The holotype was collected by Ernst Tappenbeck when he explored the areas west of Astrolabe Bay (south of Madang) in 1896 and along the river Ramu in 1898. It is not possible to specify where along his route of travel the specimen was collected. No other specimens are known. ==Description== The holotype is of unspecified sex and measures in snout–vent length. The snout is narrowly rounded seen from above but vertical in profile. The eyes are relatively large. The head is slightly narrower than the body. The canthus rostralis is rounded. The fingers and toes bear well-developed discs. The fingers have no webbing whereas the toes have some webbing. The colors of the specimen are now faded. The original species description, written few years after the specimen was collected, describes coloration as follows: > \\"Upperside brownish white, gray spotted. A dark brown stripe passes > horizontally from the posterior corner of the eye to above the eardrum, but > not beyond the head. Snout and face pale to between the eyes, posterior of > head dark brown, the two colors sharply separated from one another. Limbs > indistinctly flecked with brown.\\" (translated from Werner (1901), Ueber > Reptilien und Batrachier aus Ecuador und Neu Guinea, page 613) Oreophryne wolterstorffi is most similar to Oreophryne geislerorum, but the latter is smaller and has finger webbing.

A video game based on the board game was released for mobile and desktop platforms. ==Original board game== The player has sixty minutes to navigate a labyrinth composed of an abandoned urban slum in New York, represented by two decks of cards, locate the entity Darkness attempting to destroy the city and kill it. The slum contains hazards, zombies, mutants and other creatures affected by Darkness, who will attempt to kill the player or slow him down. Failure to kill Darkness, either by running out of time, dying of injuries, or succumbing to zombie venom/radiation poisoning, results in a loss for the player. The player has several attributes randomised by die roll at the start of the game, which affect hand-to-hand combat, marksmanship, ability to take damage and reaction time. There are also separate tracks to record the effects of zombie venom and radiation damage. At the start of the game, the player is equipped with a random assortment of weapons and items (which can include the eponymous chainsaw) and a critical item called the Laser Lance, which is the only weapon capable of destroying Darkness. Loss of the Laser Lance or running out of its ammunition requires the player to leave the slums for a replacement, suffering a time penalty. White Dwarf published a number of variant rules (such as being able to gain additional equipment before entering the slums in return for an expenditure of time) and additional weapon and equipment cards. The gameplay is a stylised version of solitaire in that the deck of cards is randomised, but certain items of equipment are required to defeat creatures found later in the game. ==Online version== An online version of the game was coded and designed by Peter Duncanson in 1999. In May 2008, Games Workshop announced it was no longer supporting the site, and it was closed. ==Desktop and mobile versions & sequel== On 22 July 2013, developer Auroch Digital (who had created Endgame:Syria and NarcoGuerra) announced that they were creating a new version of the game for mobile and desktop: \\"The seminal hit board game Chainsaw Warrior, made by Games Workshop back in 1987 is set to return this year in a digital form.

It is located just north of the northeast corner of Bayview Avenue and Major Mackenzie Drive in Richmond Hill, Ontario, Canada. Bayview S.S. was officially opened on March 10, 1960. Bayview S.S. is named after the street on which it is located. Its area used to be part of the Elliot farm. According to the Fraser Institute, the school ranked 9th in Ontario in a Fraser Institute ranking of all Ontario Secondary Schools in 2016-17. The school does not offer an AP program, though it does have a renowned IB program, only open to students who live in the school area. Bayview S.S. ranked second nationally in the 2011 Euclid mathematics contest for grade 12 students held by the University of Waterloo. Bayview also consistently ranks well in Computer Programming competitions such as the CCC or ECOO. Students of Bayview S.S. come from a variety of linguistic and cultural backgrounds. In 2005, in the neighbourhood around Bayview Secondary School, about 40% of residents were of Chinese ethnic origin, 8.1% were of East Indian origin, and 5.9% were of Iranian origin. ==Enrollment== Bayview S.S. had over 2000 students in September 2016. The York Region District School Board had not projected such a large enrollment at the beginning of the school year. The high enrollment was attributed to the 150 walk-in students at the beginning of the school year. Moreover, it was predicted that the student population would decrease that year because a new Catholic school was opened nearby, but enrollment went up instead of down. Many parents were concerned that Bayview's enrollment would keep rising in the near future because new condominium buildings would be completed at the Bayview and Major Mackenzie area in 2011. Prior to 2017, Bayview S.S. was the only secondary school in the York Region District School Board offering the International Baccalaureate (IB) Programme, resulting in the high enrollment of students. Since 2017, other schools in the school board have opened their own IB programmes, allowing the school to restrict enrollment to only schools within the school boundary. Since then, enrollment has dropped significantly as students are not allowed to attend the school if they live outside of the school boundary. ==IB Programme== The International Baccalaureate (IB) Programme at Bayview is a competitive entry program founded 30 years ago that consists of approximately 110 students per grade living in York Region, who are selected based on their performance in a three-part entrance exam (testing mathematics, English, and French, which was replaced by a collaborative intake activity in 2019), their grade 7 final report card and a letter of teacher reference (no longer required after 2014, required again in 2016 and on). This programme targets students who are well-rounded and high achievers in all aspects of school. The entrance exam is written in the November of the students' grade 8 year, and the candidates are picked by the IB coordinators and school administration by January. Students would first enter pre-IB and if they so choose, may take the IB Diploma Programme in their Grade 11 and 12 years. The IB Diploma Programme at Bayview S.S. includes the following: HL (Higher Level) English A Literature, SL (Standard Level) French B, HL History, HL Economics, SL Geography (no longer offered), HL Biology, HL Chemistry, SL Biology, SL Chemistry, SL Physics, SL Mathematics, SL Theatre, SL Visual Arts, CAS (Creativity, Action, Service), and the Extended Essay, which students begin writing in their Grade 11 year and finish in their Grade 12 year. The IB Diploma Programme also includes a TOK or Theory of Knowledge course. In order to convert their 7-point IB scale marks into the percentile system in the Ontario education system, IB students are offered a mathematical conversion system. The first two years in this programme are free, but the last two years require a $3000 non-refundable fee, not eligible for a tax receipt. The school does not provide transportation for students who do not live near the school. As of 2018, the school no longer accepts students into the IB Diploma Programme if they do not live within the school boundary. This is due to the increase of the IB Diploma Programme in nearby schools. Virtually 100% of graduating students from the IB programme follow on with a university education. University of Toronto, University of Waterloo, Queen's University and University of Western Ontario have been some of the most popular destinations, though some graduates choose to continue their education in elite American universities, such as the Ivy League schools. ==Sports== Athletic teams at Bayview S.S. include volleyball, swimming, soccer, basketball, ultimate frisbee, table tennis, dragon boat, badminton, and tennis. The structure of the sports teams are that grade 9/10 students are in the \\"junior\\" team, whereas grade 11/12 students are in the \\"senior\\" team. ==Extracurricular activities== Bayview S.S. is home to a variety of clubs, a Student Council and Prefect Organization, and music and drama programs. Other clubs include the Computer Club, Competitive Programming Club, Chinese Calligraphy Club, Debate Club, BAC (Bayview Art Club), Relay For Life Writer's Guild, Eco-Club, HOSA, DECA, STOP (Stop the Trafficking of People), CAP (Child Adoption Program), Reach for the Top, Free the Children, Model United Nations (MUN), GSA, Public Speaking, Yearbook Committee, BSS Press, Ukulele Club, Chess Club, and several bands which students can join. In spring 2012, an outdoor classroom was built using large rocks by the Eco Team. Bayview's DECA Club was recognized by York Region as one of the top chapters in Canada, and the club broke provincial records in terms of qualifiers for the International Conference for Developing Careers (ICDC). In 2016, DECA Ontario recognized the International trophy winners.http://www.yorkregion.com/community- story/6380644-richmond-hill-high-school-shatters-provincial-deca-record/ In 2017, DECA Ontario recognized the international trophy winners at ICDC, with Bayview winning a fourth of the total number of trophies the province had won with 9 trophies. ==Surrounding area== Bayview S.S. is located in Ward 3 of the Town of Richmond Hill. In 2005, Ward 3 had a population of 28,315. Single detached houses are the most common dwelling, comprising 79.93% of total housing in the area. Most common ethnic origins are Chinese (39.85%), East Indian (8.10%), Iranian (5.90%). Most common mother tongues are English (28.48%), Cantonese (21.47%). In 2006, 47.04% of residents of Ward 3 that were 15 years and older had some amount of university education. Most of the residents in this area are middle-class families. In 2005, 42.62% of Richmond Hill households earned $100,000 and above. Bayview S.S. has a York Region Transit bus stop directly in front of the school that takes students south to Finch Station (TTC) in Toronto in approximately 30 minutes. There is also a bus stop within a nearby plaza that takes students west to Vaughan Mills in roughly 40 minutes. ==Notable alumni== *Bryan Buchan *Trish Stratus, WrestlerRichmond Hill's Trish Stratus mat star *Craig Walker *Ammaar Ghadiyali, Olympianhttps://www.olympic.org/ammaar-ghadiyali ==Notable faculty== *Bryan Buchan (retired after 2010–2011 school year) *Glenn Clark – former National Lacrosse League player and coach ==Feeder schools== *Bayview Hill Elementary School *Crosby Heights Public School *Richmond Rose Public School *Silver Stream Public School *Walter Scott Public School *Sixteenth Avenue Public School *Beverley Acres Public School ==See also== *List of high schools in Ontario ==ReferencesExternal links== *Bayview Secondary School website Category:York Region District School Board Category:High schools in the Regional Municipality of York Category:International Baccalaureate schools in Ontario Category:Education in Richmond Hill, Ontario Category:Educational institutions established in 1960 Category:1960 establishments in Ontario ","title":"Bayview Secondary School"},{"id":"12399442","text":"Douglas da Costa Souza (born January 31, 1979 in Fortaleza), or simply Bilica, is a Brazilian footballer who plays as a defensive midfielder. ==Honours== ;Sport Club do Recife *Santa Catarina State League: 2007 ==Contract== *26 June 2007 to 31 December 2007 ==External links== * * *meusport Category:1979 births Category:Living people Category:Sportspeople from Fortaleza Category:Brazilian footballers Category:Associação Chapecoense de Futebol players Category:Maranhão Atlético Clube players Category:Moto Club de São Luís players Category:Sampaio Corrêa Futebol Clube players Category:Sport Club do Recife players Category:Vila Nova Futebol Clube players Category:Clube de Regatas Brasil players Category:Association football midfielders ","title":"Douglas da Costa Souza"},{"id":"12399443","text":"Plethodontohyla inguinalis is a species of frog in the family Microhylidae.

A working journalist for more than twenty years, he has served in all stages of the profession, from being a night shift reporter to editor in chief in various newspapers. ==Biography== He was born 1950 in Ankara, Turkey to the notable journalist and writer Çetin Altan as the first of two sons. His brother Mehmet Altan is also a journalist, writer and university professor of economy politics. ==Career== In addition to having written columns in several Turkish newspapers, including Hürriyet, Milliyet and Radikal, Altan has produced news programming for television. He was fired from Milliyet after writing a column on 17 April 1995 titled \\"Atakürt\\", which presented an alternate history of Turkey as a Kurdish state (\\"Kürdiye\\") in which ethnic Turks are oppressed and forced to assimilate.Hurriyet Daily News, 8 April 2013, Famous writer Ahmet Altan back with new book In 2007 he became the founding editor-in-chief and lead columnist of Taraf, a daily Turkish newspaper, and remained in the position until his resignation in December 2012. In September 2008 when Altan published an article titled \\"Oh, My Brother\\" dedicated to the victims of the Armenian Genocide, he was charged under Article 301 of the Turkish Penal Code for \\"denigrating Turkishness\\". The judicial claim was initiated by the far-right \\"Great Union Party.\\"A trial against the journalist who wrote about the Genocide , Azg daily, Sept. 2008. Altan, along with some of his Taraf associates, usually carried a firearm for self-protection. As the editor of Taraf, Altan was accused of working to silence allegations of the Gülen movement cheating in compulsory public servants’ examinations in Turkey to further their power in the state. On December 14, 2012, Ahmet Altan resigned his post as editor-in-chief of Taraf. With him stepped down his assistant editor Yasemin Çongar, and Neşe Tüzel. The next day, the three departing journalists were joined by columnist Hadi Uluengin. == Prosecution == Yasemin Çongar accepts the Geschwister Scholl Prize for Ahmet Altan. During Turkey's media purge after the failed July 2016 coup d'état on September 23, 2016, Altan, was arrested. He is accused of sending \\"subliminal messages\\" to encourage 2016 Turkish coup d'état attempt planners. In September 2017, while banned from written communications, Altan produced an essay The Writer's Paradox in which he says: 'I am writing these words from a prison cell ... But wait. Before you start playing the drums of mercy for me listen to what I will tell you ... They may have the power to imprison me but no one has the power to keep me in prison. I am a writer.' The essay was published on 18 September 2017, on the eve of Altan's trial: in English by The Society of Authors (translated by Yasemin Çongar) and in the original Turkish by English PEN.On eve of trial, Ahmet Altan writes how imagination sustains him in Turkish jail, The Guardian, Alison Flood, 18 September 2017 As the trial began, many authors spoke out in support of Altan. Neil Gaiman said \\"I hope that everyone who can read, whatever their politics, reads Ahmet Altan's response to his imprisonment. Repressive regimes hope that if they lock up writers they are also locking up ideas. This will always fail.\\" Joanne Harris said \\"Writers exist to question, to challenge, sometimes even to ridicule - the status quo. For a government to imprison a writer for doing this is to attack, not only freedom of speech, but freedom of the imagination. It is a backward, oppressive and ultimately futile gesture that can only lead to greater and more damaging social unrest.\\" On 16 February 2018, Ahmet, along with his brother Mehmet Altan, was sentenced to life imprisonment. From prison, he wrote notes he gave to his lawyers, and published his memoirs under the title I Will Never See the World Again, translated into English by Yasemin Çongar. The book was longlisted for the 2019 Baillie Gifford Prize for non-fiction. On 4 November 2019 Altan was sentenced to 10 years and 6 months imprisonment by the court of cassation, but then the court ordered his release on probation. On 12 November 2019 the police detained him again after a ruling reversing his release. On the 25 of November 2019, Altan was awarded the Geschwister Scholl Prize, a literary award of the Bavarian branch of the German Publishers and Booksellers Association. == Awards == * 1983, Akademi Bookstore Literature Awards, First Prize in the category of “Novel” * 1998, Yunus Nadi Literature Prize in the category of ‘’Novel’’ * 2011, International Hrant Dink Award * 2013, Turkish Publishers Association, Freedom of Thought and Expression Prize * 2017, Istanbul Human Rights Association Ayşe Nur Zarakolu Freedom of Thought and Expression Prize * 2019, Geschwister Scholl Preis == Bibliography ==  Memoirs  * I will never see the world again, (Other Press, 2019), translated by Yasemin Çongar 21 Books to Curl Up With This Fall , Newsweek, Novels * Kılıç Yarası Gibi (Like a Sword Wound) * Dört Mevsim Sonbahar (Four Seasons of Autumn) * Yalnızlığın Özel Tarihi (A Private History of Loneliness) * Sudaki İz (Trace on the Water) * Aldatmak (Cheating) * İsyan Günlerinde Aşk (Love in the Days of Rebellion) * En Uzun Gece (The Longest Night) * Tehlikeli Masallar (Dangerous Tales) * Son Oyun (Endgame), translated into English by Alexander Dawe, 2016 Collections of essays * Gece Yarısı Şarkıları (Midnight Songs) * İçimizde Bir Yer (Somewhere Inside Us) * Karanlıkta Sabah Kuşları (Morning Birds in Darkness) * Kristal Denizaltı (Crystal Submarine) * Ve Kırar Göğsüne Bastırırken (And He Breaks While Holding Down To His Chest) ==ReferencesExternal links== *Ahmet Altan'ın Eserlerinden örnekler, denemeleri, günlük fıkraları *Ahmet ALTAN Hakkında yazılan Polis Akademisi Bitirme Tezi *Gazetem Net'teki köşe yazıları * Hürriyet Gazetesindeki Köşe Yazıları * Biography of Ahmet Altan Category:Turkish novelists Category:1950 births Category:Living people Category:Turkish former Muslims Category:Turkish atheists Category:Turkish journalists Category:Turkish columnists Category:People from Ankara Category:Hürriyet people Category:Milliyet people Category:Taraf people Category:Robert College alumni Category:Middle East Technical University alumni Category:Istanbul University alumni Category:Vefa High School alumni Category:Turkish people of Crimean Tatar descent Category:Journalists imprisoned in Turkey ","title":"Ahmet Altan"},{"id":"12399465","text":"Plethodontohyla ocellata is a species of frog in the family Microhylidae.

However, it is possible that its range extends to adjacent Mozambique. This species has many common names: forest rain frog, highland primitive rain frog, highland rain frog, and Zimbabwe big-fingered frog. ==Description== Males grow to and females to in snout–vent length. The tympanum is clearly visible. Skin is densely granular but has no ridges nor larger warts. Males have looser gular skin than females. The cloacal opening in both sexes has an unusual, ventrally deflected position and is surrounded by deep skin folds; the functional significance of this remains unknown. ==Habitat and conservation== Its natural habitats are primary montane forests above . It is a terrestrial species that is usually found under rotten logs or under accumulations of leaf litter, formed, e.g., on the uphill side of logs. Eggs are laid terrestrially (in chamber in humus) and develop directly into froglets. This species is believed to be reasonably common, although its range is small and there are no recorded sightings since 1985. It is threatened by habitat loss, logging, and trampling. It is present in the Nyanga National Park, but the aforementioned threats are present in the park too. ==References== rhodesianus Category:Frogs of Africa Category:Amphibians of Zimbabwe Category:Endemic fauna of Zimbabwe Category:Amphibians described in 1967 Category:Taxa named by Donald George Broadley Category:Taxonomy articles created by Polbot ","title":"Probreviceps rhodesianus"},{"id":"12399492","text":"Probreviceps rungwensis is a species of frog in the family Brevicipitidae.

It was first described as a subspecies of Probreviceps macrodactylus, but is now considered a full species. Furthermore, genetic data suggest that the nominal species includes more than one species. ==Description== Adult males can grow to and adult females to in snout–vent length. The body is stout and the legs are short, reflecting its burrowing habits. The snout is pointed and protruding beyond the lower jaw. The tympanum is distinct and large, up to 1.5 times the eye diameter, but partly obscured by the supra-tympanic fold. The dorsum is brown and has no distinct markings. The flanks, arms, and legs are dark brown and bear white-tipped warts. ==Habitat and conservation== Probreviceps rungwensis lives in montane and submontane forests at elevations of about above sea level. It is a semi- fossorial forest-floor species. The eggs are deposited in burrows in the leaf litter and hatch directly into small froglets. Probreviceps rungwensis is an uncommon species that is only known from few locations; the overall population appears fragmented. Although it tolerates mild habitat disturbance, it is likely to be suffering from the ongoing forest loss, primarily caused by subsistence small-scale agriculture and pole cutting and logging.

It was founded in 1850 by Frances Dixon and John Merson after a move from their earlier (1842) factory at Thatto Heath near St Helens. In 1852, this factory was sold to the Pilkington Brothers and Frances Dixon then acquired a site at Ravenhead, building a new gas-powered glassworks. In 1913 the company merged with five other glass manufacturers, forming UGB (United Glass Bottle Manufacturers Limited). Until 1931 these companies were primarily bottle makers but they branched out into domestic tableware in the 1930s making bowls, jugs and drinking glasses, many of these showing Art Deco influences. From 1947, Alexander Hardie Williamson (1907–1994) was employed as consultant designer and during the 27 years he was with the company, he created over 1700 designs. Some of these were produced in their millions for public houses and restaurants and included the Paris goblet, the Nonik beer mugTwentieth century factory glass, Lesley Jackson, 2000, 66, 164 and the Babycham-style Champagne glass. He also designed a range of tableware, the Kilner jar and a collectable range of decorated tumblers. In 1972 Alexander Williamson retired. Up until 1972 the company had been called United Glass Tableware Ltd but in that year Ronald Andrew Murphy was recruited from BOC's Sparklets Division to develop and market the retail business. A marketer with strong brand and product design expertise, he initiated the company name change to The Ravenhead Company Ltd., and appointed McBain, Noel-Johnson design company to design the now familiar Ravenhead bird logo and its application on products and packaging. The new brand name was quite simply created from the works location in Ravenhead, St Helens. The outstretched Raven logo had a strong resemblance to a champagne glass, so the brand met the characteristics desirable in a strong brand - distinctive, memorable and product relevant. The retail range was rapidly expanded initially using John Clappison an existing freelance designer (John designed Barmasters, Elegance, White Fire, Topaz, Icelantic, Olympiad etc. and also refined and developed Hardie Williamson's Siesta range). Ronald Murphy also arranged the sponsoring and formation of The Glassshouse in Covent Garden in conjunction with the Royal College of Art, The Glasshouse was a place where talented graduates could develop their glass and ceramic designs. Notable was Annette Meech (who designed the RosyTumblers, Apollo and Solar range for Ravenhead). Design awards followed and several products were featured in the London Design Centre. Up until 1972 automatic soda lime glass had been largely sold through hardware stores. Ravenhead's new research programme indicated that ladies were responsible for 80% of purchases for the home, so marketing of the retail range was accelerated by packing glass in attractive boxes and marketing through supermarkets such as Tesco where its non-food division was still in relative infancy. Ad Graphics and Portland Studios were appointed to radically upgrade packaging design, Ravenhead started TV advertising targeted particularly at the Christmas gift market. In addition the tumbler ranges were used as give-aways in petrol station loyalty schemes. Within 3 years from formation of the Retail Division, it moved from a negligible retail market share to approximately 40% of the UK market with significant exports to markets as diverse as Scandinavia, Japan and Australia. Particularly notable products were the Siesta textured range and the White Fire bowl sets; one year, the latter achieved the remarkable levels of one in every two bowl sets sold in the UK. The assertive European development even had Finnish newspapers railing at Ravenhead's national advertising there, saying that their local producers such as Iitalla had to be protected against this foreign invader. The reality however was that Ravenhead had pioneered a catch-up of UK glass design to approach the standards that designers such as Tapio Wirkkala and Timo Sarpaneva had achieved earlier in the Scandinavian markets and allied this to mass marketing techniques. Strong market development continued and the company also grew its share of the UK Licensed Victualler business to circa 70% market share. However, in 1980 the United Glass Group decided to relocate its Ravenhead Head Office from its Sunbury/Staines base to its works in St Helens. Many of the Head Office staff left including Murphy who went to Cadbury Schweppes. Following a downturn in the company's fortunes (and various changes of ownership) in the late 1980s, it went into administration in 2001 and the factory closed. There followed an investigation by the Serious Fraud Office, following reference to it by Merseyside Police, but it was closed for lack of sufficient evidence.SFO Press Release, December 2006 In 2003 the Rayware Group of Liverpool, which bought the Ravenhead brand relaunched it, giving pint pots and other traditional glasses the Ravenhead name, placing the Ravenhead logo and its products in the Group's portfolio.The Rayware Group ==References== Category:Glassmaking companies of England Category:Defunct glassmaking companies Category:Glass trademarks and brands Category:Defunct companies of England Category:British companies established in 1850 Category:Manufacturing companies disestablished in 2001 Category:1850 establishments in England Category:2001 disestablishments in England Category:British companies disestablished in 2001 ","title":"Ravenhead Glass"},{"id":"12399497","text":"Probreviceps uluguruensis is a species of frog in the family Microhylidae.

It is endemic to Sri Lanka and is known from the Central, Sabaragamuwa, Southern, and Western Provinces. The specific name nagaoi honours Eijiro Nagao, president of Marusan Securities who, through the Nagao Environmental Foundation, has supported research on Sri Lankan amphibians. ==Description== Adult males measure and adult females in snout–vent length. The head is wider than it is long. The snout is truncate in dorsal view and rounded in lateral view. The tympanum is not externally visible but a tympanic ridge is present. The fingers have lateral dermal fringes and triangularly dilated tips. The toes have rudimentary webbing and slightly truncate or rounded, enlarged, fleshy and smooth tips. The colouration is dark brown. There are yellow spots near the eyes and on the upper lip. Reddish-orange patches are present on the snout, sides of the dorsum, abdomen, and around the vent and on the limbs. Males have an externally visible gular vocal sac. ==Habitat and conservation== Uperodon nagaoi are terrestrial and arboreal as adults and prefer lowland moist forest habitats. There are records from about above sea level. Breeding takes place in tree holes where the tadpoles also develop. It appears to be an obligate tree hole breeder. One female was found submerged in a tree hole, with an egg clutch adhering to the wall few centimeters above the water level. This suggests that parental care might be present. Uperodon nagaoi is known to occur in the Kanneliya Forest Reserve (its type locality) as well as in the Hiyare Forest Reserve. == Behavior == The frog is noted to have a possibly mutualistic relationship with tarantulas such as Poecilotheria ornata and Poecilotheria subfusca, sharing tree holes of which some were observed to contain eggs and/or juveniles from the spider, frog, or both. As observed between frog Chiasmocleis ventrimaculata and tarantula Xenesthis immanis, the spider may protect the frog from predators while the frog protects the spider's eggs from ants. ==References== nagaoi Category:Endemic fauna of Sri Lanka Category:Frogs of Sri Lanka Category:Amphibians described in 2001 Category:Taxonomy articles created by Polbot ","title":"Uperodon nagaoi"},{"id":"12399507","text":"Uperodon obscurus is a species of frog in the family Microhylidae.

It is currently estimated to include more than 23 species, but only 20 of these are currently described. The common name 'diamond frog' has been proposed and used for members of this genus. ==Taxonomy== The genus Rhombophryne was monotypic until 2005, containing just R. testudo Boettger, 1880. However, in 2005 Andreone et al. showed that the genus Plethodontohyla was paraphyletic with respect to this genus. Several species were therefore transferred to this genus by Frost et al. in 2006, Glaw and Vences in 2007, and Wollenberg et al. in 2008. In 2015/2016, Peloso et al. re-analysed the genetic relationships of the Microhylidae using partial genomic data. They proposed the synonymy of Stumpffia with Rhombophryne because these genera were found to be paraphyletic. However, in 2016 Scherz et al. re-analysed their data with new data—including osteology and external morphology. They found strong support for these groups being ecologically distinct, non-synonymous sister taxa. To accommodate this, however, they established a new genus, Anilany for a species that would otherwise have rendered Stumpffia paraphyletic. These findings were supported by a subsequent study on the phylogeny of the family Microhylidae. At present at least one species group is recognised: the Rhombophryne serratopalpebrosa species group, containing R. serratopalpebrosa, R. guentherpetersi, R. coronata, R. vaventy, R. tany, R. ornata, R. regalis, and R. diadema. This group is recognised due to the clearly synapomorphic superciliary spines (spines above the eyes) shared by all of its members, in addition to its consistent monophyly in various phylogenetic reconstructions. Other species groups have yet to be established. In early 2018, Bellati et al. moved the species Rhombophryne alluaudi to Plethodontohyla based on examination of the type material; specimens in phylogenetic analyses that had been referred to as R. alluaudi in fact belong to an undescribed species of Rhombophryne. ==Ecomorphology== Members of the genus Rhombophryne are ecologically and morphologically diverse. The type species, R. testudo shows many specialisations to burrowing, such as a short head, short limbs, and large metatarsal tubercles, as do its two closest relatives, R. matavy and R. coudreaui. Most other species have a stout body shape which may suggest partially burrowing habits as well. Rhombophryne minuta and R. longicrus by contrast have unusually long limbs, and it has been argued that they probably are more terrestrial and saltatorial than the other members of the genus. Rhombophryne proportionalis is a miniaturised species, attaining an adult body size of 11–12 mm. It was argued to be a proportional dwarf in its original description, based on its non-paedomorphic proportions compared to similarly sized Cophylinae frogs. ==Reproductive Ecology== The mating habits of most species of Rhombophryne are not known. It is likely that all members of this genus engage in parental care, which is common to most members of the Cophylinae. Two adult R. testudo individuals were found together with 18 putative offspring in a burrow by a stream at the edge of Lokobe Reserve on Nosy Be, at the end of the dry season. This is the only direct evidence of reproductive behaviour in this genus. So far, the advertisement calls of eight species have been published: R. botabota, R. minuta, R. mangabensis, R. matavy, R. testudo, R. nilevina, R. coronata, and R. proportionalis. Most of their calls are honking sounds emitted after quite long intervals, but R. minuta emits paired notes, and R. proportionalis emits series of 9–17 notes. ==Species== * Rhombophryne botabota Scherz, Glaw, Vences, Andreone & Crottini, 2016 * Rhombophryne coronata (Vences and Glaw, 2003) * Rhombophryne coudreaui (Angel, 1938) * Rhombophryne diadema Scherz, Hawlitschek, Andreone, Rakotoarison, Vences & Glaw, 2017 * Rhombophryne guentherpetersi (Guibé, 1974) * Rhombophryne laevipes (Mocquard, 1895) * Rhombophryne longicrus Scherz, Rakotoarison, Hawlitschek, Vences & Glaw, 2015 * Rhombophryne mangabensis Glaw, Köhler & Vences, 2010 * Rhombophryne matavy D'Cruze, Köhler, Vences & Glaw, 2010 * Rhombophryne minuta (Guibé, 1975) * Rhombophryne nilevina Lambert, Hutter & Scherz, 2017 * Rhombophryne ornata Scherz, Ruthensteiner, Vieites, Vences & Glaw, 2015 *Rhombophryne proportionalis Scherz, Hutter, Rakotoarison, Riemann, Rödel, Ndriantsoa, Glos, Roberts, Crottini, Vences & Glaw, 2019 * Rhombophryne regalis Scherz, Hawlitschek, Andreone, Rakotoarison, Vences & Glaw, 2017 * Rhombophryne savaka Scherz, Glaw, Vences, Andreone & Crottini, 2016 * Rhombophryne serratopalpebrosa (Guibé, 1975) * Rhombophryne tany Scherz, Ruthensteiner, Vieites, Vences & Glaw, 2015 * Rhombophryne testudo Boettger, 1880 * Rhombophryne vaventy Scherz, Ruthensteiner, Vences & Glaw, 2014 * Rhombophryne ellae Scherz, 2020 ==References== Category:Endemic frogs of Madagascar Category:Amphibian genera Category:Taxa named by Oskar Boettger Category:Taxonomy articles created by Polbot ","title":"Rhombophryne"},{"id":"12399528","text":"Utricularia cheiranthos is a terrestrial carnivorous plant that belongs to the genus Utricularia (family Lentibulariaceae).

It is commonly known as the green burrowing frog and the marbled rain frog. It is endemic to Madagascar. It is classified as \\"Vulnerable\\" by the IUCN as it is threatened by habitat loss. ==Taxonomy== A revision of the Scaphiophryne marmorata complex was undertaken in 2003 and as a result, Scaphiophryne spinosa was removed from synonymy with Scaphiophryne marmorata and a new species, Scaphiophryne boribory, was described. ==Description== The female green burrowing frog grows to a length of about but the male is smaller at . It is nearly globular in shape with a small, flattened head, short snout, prominent eyes and well muscled limbs. The skin of the back is mostly smooth but there are two symmetrical pairs of thorny tubercles on the upper back. The digits on both fore and hind limbs are elongated which helps the frog to clamber around in trees and bushes. There are expanded discs at the end of the fingers which is a distinctive feature of this species. The hind limbs are short with bony flanges on the heels to help with digging. The colour is a bright green liberally spotted with darker green and black patches. In the western part of its range the colour is more olive. The underside is often marbled with white. ==Distribution and habitat== The green burrowing frog is found in the rainforests of eastern Madagascar and in the drier western half of the island. It occurs up to above sea level. ==Biology== The green burrowing frog spends much of its time buried in dead leaves on the forest floor but when it emerges it often climbs into the branches of bushes and small trees to catch the insects on which it feeds. Little is known of the breeding habits of this frog but it is believed to be an \\"explosive\\" breeder, with all the frogs in an area coming together at one time to mate and spawn in temporary pools at the beginning of the rainy season. The tadpoles are likely to grow quickly so as to be mature enough to live independently when the pools dry up. ==Status== The green burrowing frog is listed as \\"Vulnerable\\" in the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species. This is because, though it is locally abundant, its range in Madagascar is small and fragmented, it is threatened by habitat loss and populations seem to be in decline. A small number of individuals are gathered for the pet trade but the possibility of captive breeding is being investigated which would ease this pressure. This frog has a secure environment in the several national parks in which it is found. ==References== Category:Scaphiophryne Category:Endemic frogs of Madagascar Category:Taxa named by George Albert Boulenger Category:Amphibians described in 1882 Category:Taxonomy articles created by Polbot ","title":"Scaphiophryne marmorata"},{"id":"12399550","text":"Scaphiophryne menabensis is a species of frog in the family Microhylidae.

It is endemic to eastern Brazil and is known from Pernambuco and Alagoas in the north and then southward through Bahia to Minas Gerais and Espírito Santo. Earlier records from São Paulo state are now recognized as Stereocyclops parkeri. Common name Brazilian dumpy frog has been coined for this species. ==Description== The holotype, an adult male, measures in snout–vent length (SVL). In a population in Linhares observed at the time of breeding, adult males measured and females in SVL. The body is very stout. The snout is short, rounded in dorsal view but more acute in profile. The eyes are small and the tympanum is indistinct. The fingers are fairly long and have no webbing. The toes are long and have basal webbing. Skin is smooth except for a few granules on the sides. ==Habitat and conservation== Its natural habitats are primary and secondary forests at elevations below . It is a nocturnal species living in leaf litter. They prey on a range of small invertebrates. The dominant prey items in Linhares were ants, followed by beetles and isopods. Breeding seems to be explosive. Breeding takes place in small, temporary ponds inside the forest; the species is not found in open habitat outside forest. Stereocyclops incrassatus can be very common at breeding sites. Habitat loss is the major threat to this species. It occurs in several protected areas, e.g., Rio Doce State Park. ==References== incrassatus Category:Amphibians of Brazil Category:Endemic fauna of Brazil Category:Taxa named by Edward Drinker Cope Category:Amphibians described in 1870 Category:Taxonomy articles created by Polbot ","title":"Stereocyclops incrassatus"},{"id":"12399587","text":"Stereocyclops parkeri is a species of frog in the family Microhylidae. It is endemic to southeastern Brazil and known from the southwestern part of the state of Rio de Janeiro and from Ilha de São Sebastião (\\"Ilhabela\\"), São Paulo state. For a period it was treated as a synonym of Stereocyclops incrassatus, but is now recognized as valid species. ==Etymology== The specific name parkeri honors Hampton Wildman Parker, an English zoologist and herpetologist. It is sometimes known with the common name the Parker's Brazilian dumpy frog. ==Description== Stereocyclops parkeri measure about in snout–vent length. The appearance is cryptic. ==Behavior== Stereocyclops parkeri show defensive behavior that may enhance its cryptic appearance, giving an impression of a casually dislodged leaf: when disturbed, the individual makes a short leap, landing with its legs stretched backwards. It will then remain still, sometimes as long as 30 minutes, although it may also move a little forward with a quick movement of the feet, resembling a flicked leaf. Similar behavior is observed in Proceratophrys belzebul (reported as Proceratophrys appendiculata, see Dias et al. (2013)) and, in somewhat lesser form, in Zachaenus parvulus. Similar behavior in distantly related frogs suggests convergent evolution. ==Habitat and conservation== Stereocyclops parkeri inhabit coastal restinga scrub forests, forest edges, and primary and secondary forests near sea level. They live in leaf litter. The locality in Ilhabela was a vacant lot in an urban area where males were having a chorus in flooded grass. Habitat loss caused by fire, tourism, and human settlement could be a threat to this species. ==References== parkeri Category:Endemic fauna of Brazil Category:Amphibians of Brazil Category:Amphibians described in 1934 Category:Taxa named by Otto von Wettstein Category:Taxonomy articles created by Polbot ","title":"Stereocyclops parkeri"},{"id":"12399588","text":"The following highways are numbered 316: ==Canada== *25px Nova Scotia Route 316 *20px Prince Edward Island Route 316 *20px Saskatchewan Highway 316 ==China== *25px China National Highway 316 ==Costa Rica== *25px National Route 316 ==India== *20px National Highway 316 (India) ==Japan== *25px Japan National Route 316 ==United States== * 25px Connecticut Route 316 * 25px Florida State Road 316 (former) * 25px Georgia State Route 316 * 25px Illinois Route 316 (former) * 25px Indiana State Road 316 (former) * 25px Iowa Highway 316 * 25px Kentucky Route 316 * 25px Louisiana Highway 316 * 25px Maryland Route 316 * 25px Minnesota State Highway 316 * 25px Mississippi Highway 316 * New York: ** 25px New York State Route 316 ** 25px County Route 316 (Erie County, New York) * 25px Ohio State Route 316 * 25px Pennsylvania Route 316 * 25px Puerto Rico Highway 316 * 25px Tennessee State Route 316 * 25px Texas State Highway 316 ** 25px Texas State Highway Spur 316 ** 25px Farm to Market Road 316 * 25px Utah State Route 316 * 25px Virginia State Route 316 * 25px Wyoming Highway 316 ","title":"List of highways numbered 316"},{"id":"12399590","text":"Stumpffia gimmeli is a species of frog in the family Microhylidae.

It is found in Brazil, Colombia, and Venezuela. Its natural habitats are subtropical or tropical moist lowland forests and freshwater springs. It is threatened by habitat loss. Synapturanus salseri are shy and spend almost all of their time in burrows beneath the forest floor. During the rainy season, males give off a brief whistle as a mating call. They mate only after periods of heavy precipitation. Mating takes place in burrows, since these frogs seldom venture out. Females lay a few large eggs into the burrow. The hatched tadpoles do not feed but live on the stored yolk until they undergo metamorphosis. The diet of adult S. salseri frogs consists of ants and spiders (Zweifel, 2003). The frog was originally discovered by Dr. William F. Pyburn (former head of the biology department of the University of Texas at Arlington) and J. K. Salser Jr., an amateur biologist. While collecting specimens in the Colombian rain forest near the village of Timbo on the Vaupes river, Dr. Pyburn heard the frog call. Using flashlights to triangulate the call the two determined where the call originated and began searching for the frog. After the leaf litter on the forest floor had been removed it became apparent that the frog was underground and it was captured after a careful excavation. ==References== * * CalPhotos Synapturanus salseri; Timbo Disc Frog (detail page) Category:Synapturanus Category:Amphibians of Brazil Category:Amphibians of Colombia Category:Amphibians of Venezuela Category:Amphibians described in 1975 Category:Taxonomy articles created by Polbot ","title":"Synapturanus salseri"},{"id":"12399643","text":"Chiasmocleis antenori is a species of frog in the family Microhylidae.

The body is stout. The head is moderately narrow but broader than it is long. The snout is pointed and projecting, with slightly warty point; skin is smooth elsewhere. The eyes are small. The tympanum is visible. The fingers have no discs but the toes are slightly dilated terminally and could be interpreted as having small discs. Colouration is brown above, with some patterning: a few darker markings on the back and legs, and some mottling in the upper lip. A light vertebral stripe may also be present. The ventral surfaces are mottled with dark and light brown. ==Habitat and conservation== There is little specific information about ecology of this species, but its natural habitat is presumably lowland rainforest where it lives on the forest floor, probably at elevations of no more than . The diet includes ants. Threats to this species are unknown.

Each set consists of reprints from early Magic sets that had yet to be released to Magic Online. To date, four incarnations of Master's Edition, as well as a spinoff have been released: *The original Masters Edition (in short \\"MED\\" or \\"ME1\\") was released on September 10, 2007. It features 195 cards printed before Mirage, 60 of each rarity and the 15 basic lands of Beta. * Masters Edition II (in short \\"ME2\\") was released on September 22, 2008. It features 245 cards, 80 of each rarity and the 5 snow-covered basic lands of Ice Age. *Masters Edition III (in short \\"ME3\\") was released on September 7, 2009. It consists of 230 cards, 70 rare, 70 uncommons, 75 commons, and 15 basic lands. * Masters Edition IV (in short \\"ME4\\") was released on January 10, 2011. It consists of 269 cards: 105 rares, 72 uncommons, 80 commons, and 12 special lands. * Vintage Masters (in short \\"VMA\\") was released on June 16, 2014. It consists of 325 cards: 9 specials (Power Nine), 30 mythic rares, 105 rares, 80 uncommons, 101 commons. Masters sets released in both \\"paper\\" and real-life began to be released in 2013 with the release of Modern Masters; these new Masters sets also consisted entirely of reprints, but with more of a focus on cards scarce in real-life as well as new drafting environments. ==Premise== Invasion was the first expansion released on Magic Online. Since then, the older expansions from Mirage forward have been retroactively released with accompanying draft and sealed queues. The sets before Mirage, however, were not built for limited play and did not present a fun or balanced draft environment. Because of the nature of the online environment, most cards enter the system through drafting. The Masters Edition series is Wizards of the Coast's solution to bring the game's earliest cards online in draftable sets. Beginning with Masters Edition III, cards from the Portal set were included in the Master's Editions. All cards in each Masters Edition set are available in regular and premium foil versions. As all of the cards were originally released before the foiling process was introduced to Magic and most have not been reprinted since, these cards are now available as premium foils for the first time and exclusively for Magic Online. Masters Editions II, III, IV have had tribal themes; the original Master's Edition did not. Similar concept were later used in the design of Modern Masters in paper format, as well as the Vintage Masters in Magic Online. == Masters Edition I == Masters Edition was originally meant to be drafted with 10th Edition but its popularity led Wizards to create Masters Edition-only drafts. The set heavily focused on nostalgia and included some of the most popular casual cards from the early sets. Notably, it missed powerful early cards like the Alpha, Beta, Unlimited, and Revised dual lands. == Masters Edition II == While Masters Edition was rather unspecifically designed to bring some older cards to Magic Online, Masters Edition II was designed to bring more specific cards to the environment. The second installment of the series was to bring the youngest, previously unreleased cards to Magic Online. It thus consists mainly of cards from Fallen Empires, Ice Age, Homelands, and Alliances. Unlike the first Masters Edition, this set was meant to be drafted on its own. However, as head designer Erik Lauer admits in an article, \\"Masters Edition II wasn't a fan favorite.\\" The limited environment was supposed to be slow and strategic, but often mistakes in drafting and playing were not apparent to players, thus leading to frustration as they could not make sense of the environment. Lauer also admitted that he made \\"a fair amount of mistakes\\" in the designing of the set. The Snow supertype was a major mechanic in Masters Edition II. It functions like a tag. It has no effect on gameplay on its own, but there are many cards in Masters Edition II that care whether a card is a snow card. Masters Edition II has a minor tribal theme. Fungus, Orc, and Soldiers appear in limited quantities. The number of cards synergistic with these creatures' tribes is also very limited, although there are a few cards like and that encourage playing tribal cards. == Masters Edition III == Masters Edition III consists mainly of cards from The Dark, Legends, and Portal Three Kingdoms. While The Dark and Legends reflect the era Masters Edition III cards should be mostly from, the Portal Three Kingdoms cards are arguably the most distinctive part of ME3 even though that set was released five years after Legends and The Dark. This is because one of the most widely used creature abilities in Magic, \\"Flying\\", is almost completely replaced by its Portal Three Kingdoms counterpart, \\"Horsemanship\\". The other mechanics employed in Masters Edition III are multicolored cards and Legendary Creatures. Masters Edition III has a minor tribal theme of Faeries, Kobolds, and Minotaurs. Masters Edition III also reprints six World Enchantments. == Masters Edition IV == The fourth installment of the series consists mainly of cards from Beta, Arabian Nights, Antiquities, and the Portal sets. While Beta, Arabian Nights, and Antiquities reflect the era Masters Edition IV cards should mostly be from, the Portal and Starter cards in the set were necessary to create an enjoyable limited environment. Otherwise the number of creatures with an acceptable power level would have been too small. The mechanics employed in Masters Edition IV focus on artifacts. Finally Birds, Zombies, Goblins, and Elephants are the tribes used in Masters Edition IV. The most prominent exception to this are the original dual lands, which had been previously printed across two sets, but here are reprinted in their entirety. == Vintage Masters == Vintage Masters was announced on October 21, 2013, and was released on June 16, 2014, with Prereleases starting on June 13, 2014. The set includes the Power Nine, along with new cards from Conspiracy (a recent set not released in Magic Online) and is designed to be usable for Booster Draft and Sealed Deck. == Notable cards == Notable cards from the original Masters set include the blue staple and black staple Notable cards from Masters Edition II include the allied dual lands (, , , and ) as well as the cards , , and .

The head tapers evenly to the smoothly pointed snout. The eyes are small. The tympanum is visible and relatively large but not very distinct. The fingers have no discs whereas the toes have very small, slightly grooved discs. The legs are relatively long. Skin is warty on the flanks but smooth or warty elsewhere, depending on the specimen. Dorsal colouration is variable, from light greyish or light brown to dark brown with vague dark mottling. The colouring becomes paler on the flanks. The ventral surfaces are white with dark brown and orange reticulation. The male advertisement call is a series of approximately 15 clear notes lasting about 0.06 seconds each, with pauses of 0.15 seconds. The call gives an overall impression of very clear, low-pitched piping. ==Habitat and conservation== Xenorhina subcrocea occurs beneath leaf-litter in rainforests at elevations below . All the males in the type series were located by their calling and then excavated from beneath the leaf litter from holes or open spaces among plant roots. The female type was found incidentally when searching below the leaf litter. Reproduction is through direct development (no free-living larval stage). The forest at the type locality has been destroyed by infrastructure development, but intact habitat remains nearby. This species might be able to adapt to degraded habitats.

The walls are decorated as well and show both the duties and the rewards of Mahu. The rewards appear on the front wall and on the northern half of the back wall. The inscriptions were not finished but the sketches indicate that there would have been a reward scene showing the king bestowing honors on Mahu at the Window of Appearance. Mahu was shown accompanied by his men, the Medjay. Another scene showed Mahu receiving honors not at the palace, but at a temple. He is shown inspecting the defences of the city with the king and queen. This scene seems to be uniquely designed for this tomb. The vizier and other officials are also present. In another scene Mahu is shown in his work policing the city, and is shown in a meeting with the vizier (probably Nakhtpaaten) and a lesser official named Heqanefer. Mahu is leading three prisoners before the vizier. Being in the reset without permission was apparently something one would be arrested for.Kemp, Barry, The City of Akhenaten and Nefertiti: Amarna and its People, Thames and Hudson, 2012 Scenes in the tomb show platforms with ramps manned by police.

It lies between Nîmes, Montpellier, the Cevennes and the Camargue and has a strong Protestant history. ==Geography== Calvisson is a commune in Gard west of Nîmes. It is in the northern foothills of the Vaunage, a fertile valley surrounded by a rim of limestone hills rising to 200 m. The most prominent hill is the Rock of Gachone, which was the site of an important oppidum, or a fortified town, under the Romans. The natural vegetation is classic garrigue; today the valley is used for vineyards and horticulture. A tiny stream, the Escattes, flows through the village . Calvisson also includes the hamlets of Sinsans and Bizac. ==History== The site is known to have been settled since the Chalcolithic transition (4300–3200 BC) In 1060, at the time of the domination of Counts de Toulouse, the name Calvisson appears for the first time. At the time, it was a fortified town surmounted by two towers which covered 2000 m². This fortified town controlled all of the Vaunage. In 1304 King Philip IV of France gave to Guillaume de Nogaretas a fiefdom. From the 16th century, with the beginnings of Reformation, Calvisson was divided by the wars of religion. The village becomes a centre of protestantism. In 1681, the Catholic King Louis XIV, used his troops to re-convert Protestants. On 30 June 1685, being Protestant became illegal in Nîmes. The religion moved underground, the paid pastor was replaced by the lay prophet. The wars slowly destroyed the castle which, by the middle of the 17th century is used as stone quarry. The Camisards operated throughout the mainly protestant Cévennes region which in the early years of the eighteenth century also included the Vaunage and the parts of the Camargue around Aigues Mortes. In 1701, the village was a protestant stronghold which was occupied and then, in 1704, used as a base for the royalist troops in the battle of Nages against the protestant forces of Jean Cavalier the prophet and military leader. In 1787, the Rock of Gachone which stands above the village is used as triangulation point by Jean-Dominique Cassini for mapping the area. ==PopulationSights== * The church of St Saturnin is 12th-century Romanesque and 15th-century Provençal Gothic * the Temple is 19th-century neo- classical. * the Rock of Gachone rises over the village to the west.

The annual event takes place around 20 July over a period of five days. There are four events, the Abrivado where over ten bulls are run together through the street guided by a group of twelve 'guardians' mounted on white Camargues horses, an Encierro where one bull is released outside the foyer and finds his own way back to the pen, the Bandido where one bull is run accompanied through the streets, and the Bandido de nuit which is the same thing but after dark.

He attended Sedbergh School and was tutored by John Dawson, a fellow Sedberghian and a surgeon and mathematician. He attended St. John's College, Cambridge from 1759 to 1766. Haygarth matriculated at the University of Edinburgh Medical School in 1762 studying medicine for three years and leaving without a degree in 1765. After a studying medicine briefly at the University of Leiden and in London, he took his MB degree from the University of Cambridge in 1766 after which he was appointed physician to Chester Infirmary in 1766. A decade later he married Sarah Vere Widdons on 23 January 1776; together they had four daughters and two sons. Haygarth's descendants now reside in Perth, Australia. Haygarth spent 30 years at Chester and became known as one of the best physicians of his time. Like William Cullen, James Currie and Thomas Percival, he was interested in a wide array of medical and social justice issues. He was particularly interested in the treatment of fever patients and the prevention of smallpox. Although he was an Anglican, Haygarth was supported by a network of Dissenting men of science and letters who helped spread his ideas. In 1774, as part of a census he administered in Chester, he asked residents about their medical history. From this information he concluded that fever patients should be separated from others and his discovery that only a tiny fraction of the population of Chester had never had smallpox led him to focus his energy on prevention. He wrote up these findings in a paper, Observations on the Population and Diseases of Chester. In 1778 Haygarth helped found the Smallpox Society of Chester; the group advocated inoculation, an unpopular position at the time, and tried to educate the populace so as to avoid casual contraction of the disease. Only four years after this effort began, Chester's smallpox mortality rate had been reduced by almost 50%. Soon other towns, such as Leeds and Liverpool, adopted the Society's methods. They were assisted by his Inquiry how to Prevent the Small Pox (1784) which included statistical calculations supported by John Dawson. The book was translated into French and German and made Haygarth an internationally-known figure. He further elaborated his ideas in Sketch of a plan to exterminate the casual small pox from Great Britain and to introduce general inoculation (1793). Unfortunately, his plan to inspect homes and provide general inoculation was resisted in the increasingly conservative 1790s. For his important work on smallpox, Haygarth was elected as a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1781. Haygarth did not abandon his research into fever patients, however. He performed several experiments and determined that separating fever patients within a hospital reduced mortality rates. When his plan was put into effect in Chester in 1783, the first fever wards in Britain, all except one of the 30 fever patients recovered. The following year, his precautions helped to stop the spread of typhus in the town. He was elected a Foreign Honorary Member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1789. In 1798 Haygarth moved to Bath and continued his research. After analyzing his records from Chester, he published a treatise on rheumatic fever and on gout. He continued publishing medical papers in the journal of the Royal Society, Philosophical Transactions. Haygarth also promoted free, universal education, a position he supported in his Letter to Bishop Porteous (1812). He also helped found banks that would allow people to save money more efficiently and safely. In 1799, Haygarth investigated the efficacy of medical instruments called \\"Perkins tractors\\". These were metal pointers which were supposedly able to \\"draw out\\" disease. They were sold at the extremely high price of five guineas, and Haygarth set out to show that the high cost was unnecessary. He did this by comparing the results from dummy wooden tractors with a set of allegedly \\"active\\" metal tractors, and published his findings in a book On the Imagination as a Cause & as a Cure of Disorders of the Body. Haygarth, J., Of the Imagination, as a Cause and as a Cure of Disorders of the Body; Exemplified by Fictitious Tractors, and Epidemical Convulsions , Crutwell, (Bath), 1800. The wooden pointers were just as useful as the expensive metal ones, showing \\"to a degree which has never been suspected, what powerful influence upon diseases is produced by mere imagination\\".Wootton, David. Bad Medicine: Doctors Doing Harm Since Hippocrates. Oxford University Press, 2006. While the word placebo had been used since 1772, this was the first real demonstration of the placebo effect. Haygarth recognised this is the reason why famous doctors are often more successful than unknowns. He even went on to suggest that much medicine of the day relied on the placebo effect. Haygarth died at Lambridge House near Bath on 10 June 1827, and was buried at Swainswick church. A ward at the Chester Infirmary was named after him and a Haygarth medal was established for the best nurse in the hospital.Harrison, Simon. \\"John Haygarth.\\" Oxford Dictionary of National Biography.

Probably elephant ivory. From Gurob, Fayum, Egypt. 18th Dynasty. The Petrie Museum of Egyptian Archaeology, London Ludwig. A clapper is a basic form of percussion instrument. It consists of two long solid pieces that are struck together producing sound. A straightforward instrument to produce and play, they exist in many forms in many different cultures around the world. Clappers can take a number of forms and be made of a wide variety of material. Wood is most common, but metal and ivory have also been used. The plastic thundersticks that have recently come to be popular at sporting events can be considered a form of inflated plastic clapper. Several specific forms of clapper have their own names, such as the Chinese guban, Japanese Hyoshigi, or the Korean bak. In the classical music of Thailand, a similar instrument is called krap. In India cooking tongs or चिमटा itself is often used to provide rhythm while singing religious hymns in many cultures (sometimes tongs made specifically for the purpose are also equipped with bells). In Vietnam, the coin clapper called sinh tiền is widely used. In medieval French music, clappers called tablettes or cliquettes were used. In the Western symphony orchestra, a clapper called the whip (also called slapstick) is occasionally used in the percussion section. == Whip/Slapstick== A whip being used in a marching band 200px In music, a whip or slapstick is a clapper (percussion instrument) consisting of two wooden boards joined by a hinge at one end. When the boards are brought together rapidly, the sound produces a sound reminiscent of the crack of a whip. It is often used in modern orchestras, bands, and percussion ensembles. There are two types of whips. The first has two planks of wood connected by a hinge, with a handle on each. The percussionist holds the instrument by the handles and hits the two pieces of wood together, creating a loud whip noise. The other type also has two planks of wood, one longer than the other, with one handle, connected with a spring hinge so it can be played with just one hand, though it cannot produce sounds as loud as a whip requiring both hands. This second type of whip is technically a separate instrument called a slapstick. ==Usage in classical music== The whip is sometimes indicated in scores by the native words for \\"whip\\" (French fouet, German Peitsche, or Italian frusta) or a term indicating the clapper construction (French claquette or German Holzklapper). This list is alphabetical, but is by no means exhaustive. ==See also== *Bamboo clapper *Paiban *Torres Strait Islanders ==ReferencesFurther reading== *\\"Clapper.\\" Encyclopædia Britannica. == External links == * Clappers (Polish folk musical instruments) Category:Plaque concussion idiophones Category:Hand percussion Category:Orchestral percussion Category:Unpitched percussion ","title":"Clapper (musical instrument)"},{"id":"12399910","text":"The babysitter and the man upstairs — also known as the babysitter or the sitter — is an urban legend that dates back to the 1960s about a teenage girl babysitting children who receives telephone calls from a stalker who continually asks her to \\"check the children\\". The basic story line has been adapted a number of times in movies. The 1950 murder of teenage babysitter Janett Christman is commonly cited as a source of the legend.https://truecrimearticles.com/2018/03/30/the-unsolved-murder-of-janett- christman/ https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/views-through-the- psychiatrist-s-lens/201812/12-slays-xmas-black- christmashttps://www.oxygen.com/martinis-murder/the-facts-and-fiction-behind- the-halloween-filmshttps://www.wattpad.com/141532078-urban-legends-the- babysitter-and-the-man- upstairshttps://aminoapps.com/c/paranormal/page/blog/babysitter-and-the-man- upstairs-and-the-truth-behind-it/7eLB_GNnIPuXWwezpo3Lm1RNZ7EEwnBgE3 == The Legend== A teenage girl is babysitting at night. The children have been put to bed upstairs and the babysitter is downstairs, watching television. The phone rings; the caller tells her to \\"Check the children.\\" The adolescent dismisses the call and goes back to watching television. The anonymous caller dials back several times. Eventually the babysitter calls the police, who inform her they will trace the next call. After the stranger calls again, the police return her call, advising her to leave immediately. She evacuates the home and the police meet her. They explain that the calls were coming from inside the house, and that the unidentified prowler was calling her after killing the children upstairs. Other versions Some variants of the story have one or more of these details: * The caller turns out to be either one of the children or an elder sibling who decided to scare the babysitter as a prank. But they get told off by the police. * The babysitter is also killed. * The babysitter manages to rescue the children and the prowler gets arrested by the police. * While being taken away by the police, the prowler whispers or says out loud \\"see you soon!\\" to the babysitter. * In some versions, when the prowler calls the babysitter, he just makes scary noises like giggling or heavy breathing. Also in this version, when the operator says that the calls have been coming from the same house, the phone goes quiet. And when the operator asks if the babysitter is still there, all they get is the same scary noises, meaning that the babysitter has already been killed. * The children are with the babysitter while watching the television. Then the prowler starts phoning them, saying that he'll be with them in a certain amount of time. Then after they get the news that the calls are coming from inside the house, they hear a door upstairs opening and then the sound of footsteps heading towards the room where they are. This version can be found in the Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark books. * Years later, the babysitter is now an adult and has a family of her own. One evening, she and her husband go to have dinner out while a babysitter looks after the children. The evening is going well until a waiter approaches their table and says that there is a phone call for her. She then answers the phone and hears \\"Did you check the children!\\". This is an ending that appears in some of the movie versions. *The police comes up to one of the children with a very grim look on his face and said “we found him under your bed he was holding a sharpened screwdriver.” This ending appears if someone is telling the story. *The babysitter does check on the children each time, with her noticing a creepy clown statue that she assumes was just a part of the decor, but ends up being the man in question. She learns this when she mentions it to the mother via phone call, who alerts her to the fact that they don’t have a clown statue. ==Use in film== *Foster's Release (1971)https://books.google.com/books?id=oeeoDwAAQBAJ&pg;=PA101 *Black Christmas (1974) *O Anjo da Noite (1974)http://www.fright.com/edge/OAnjoDaNoite.htm *The Sitter (1977)https://books.google.com/books?id=oeeoDwAAQBAJ&pg;=PA101Rockoff, Adam.

He was eventually cleared of the charges in part by the testimony of some of his political opponents. In politics he was a staunch Whig and opponent of James II.

(Brendan and Down, 2000). Through this Act, the rule intended to deliver two central priorities, i.e. the basic to rally skills and proliferate productivity in tell to compete productively in the universal economy, and the hardship to transpose apartheid imbalances and to generate a new inclusive and organized the world (Mpilo Mthethwa, 2014). ==Amendments== IMPLEMENTATION & AMENDMENTS - Update 2016 * Signed in: ACT NO. 97 - 20 October 1998 [Date of commencement of s. 1: 2 February, 1999] * Skills Development Amendment Act 31 of 2003 [with effect from 14 November 2003] * Skills Development Amendment Act 37 of 2008 [with effect from 6 April 2009] * Skills Development Amendment Published 3 December 2012 - Came into effect 1 April 2013 * ---BUSA (Business Unity South Africa) won Labour Court's judgment on Friday 21st of August 2015 declared both regulations to be invalid‚ and it set them aside with effect from March 31 2016. * ---The Court declared Regulations 3(11) and 4(4) of the 2012 Grant Regulations to be invalid, and it set them aside.

(Cancelling the previous amendment of 2012) ==Purposes of the Skills Development Act== In line with the overall government objectives set out above, the purposes of the Act are as follows (Sec. 2(1)): * to develop the skills of the South African workforce - to improve the quality of life of workers, their prospects of work and labour mobility; to improve productivity in the workplace and the competitiveness of employers; to promote self-employment; and to improve the delivery of social services; * to increase the levels of investment in education and training in the labour market and to increase the return on that investment; * to encourage employers - to use the workplace as an active learning environment; to provide employees with the opportunities to acquire new skills; to provide opportunities for new entrants to the labour market to gain work experience; to employ persons who find it difficult to be employed; * to encourage workers to participate in learning programmes; * to improve the employment prospects of persons previously disadvantaged by unfair discrimination and to redress those disadvantages through training and education; * to ensure the quality of learning in and for the workplace; * to assist - work-seekers to find work; retrenched workers to re-enter the labour market; employers to find qualified employees; * to provide and regulate employment services. The Republic of South Africa defines skills development as the following: To provide an institutional framework to devise and implement national, sector and workplace strategies to develop and improve the skills of the South African work force; to integrate those strategies within the National Qualifications Framework contemplated in the South African Qualifications Authority Act, 1995; to provide for: learnerships that lead to recognised occupational qualifications; to provide financing of skills development by means of a levy-grant scheme and a National Skills Fund; to provide for and regulate employment services; and to provide for matters connected therewith. ==Method==  Key Stakeholders and their roles To give effect to its transformational goals, the government created a platform for all stakeholders to give input in the implementation of the Act in order to protect their interests, while discharging their respective responsibilities to their constituencies. The government also created various key institutions as vehicles for the fulfillment of its goals. Finally, the government provided for the financing of the activities associated with skills development via the Skills Development Levies Act 9 of 1999. Key stakeholders in the successful implementation of the Act are: Government: Organized Labour Organised Labour participates at all three levels of implementation. At a strategic level, organised labour forms part of the National Skills Authority that advises the department of labour on policy and strategy formulation. At sector level, organized labour participates in the Sector Education Training Authorities (SETA) that design and implement sector specific skills plans. At company level, labour participates in the formulation of workplace skills plans and reports, which address both company and sector training needs. Organized labour secures the growth and employability of their members by participating in the various structures. Organised business Business mirrors the participation of organised labour at all three levels of implementation. In addition, however, organised business finance the implementation of skills plans through payment of levies. According to the CEO of the Forestry Sector Mr. Mkhwanazi, (July 20, 2007) 50% of the levies are paid to all participating companies on submission of the workplace skills plans and implementation reports. In addition as much as 20% of the levies are disbursed to those employers who implement learnerships and other skills programs identified as priority in each sector. 10% of the levies are used for the running of the SETAs. Improving current skills levels and creation of new skills through learnerships increases “productivity which is crucial to building internationally competitive industries and sustaining and expanding employment”. (Strong, 2000) Institutions Created by the Act The National Skills Authority (“NSA”) The NSA advises the Minister of Labour on the formulation and implementation of the national skills strategy and policy, implementation guidelines of the above, and allocation of subsidies from the National Skills Fund. The NSA also liaises with the SETAs and reports progress on implementation of skills plans to the Minister. Sector Education and Training Authorities (SETAs) SETAs receive 80% of the levies paid by companies. SETAs develop sector skills plan in line with the national skills development strategy. They approve the workplace skills plans submitted by organizations in their sectors. SETAs also promote and establish learnerships. Finally, SETAs disburse grants to participating companies, provided that those companies have submitted workplace skills plans and implementation reports to the SETA by 30 April every year. ==Conclusion== This legislation affords all key stakeholders the platform and opportunity to participate in a meaningful way in the rebuilding of our country. Through this legislation, transformation is “our business”. This is an attractive option because everybody wins it can be helping any situation for ever. ==Reference list== Legislation # The Skills Development Act (1998) Accessed 20 July 2007 Other references # Brendan, B., Down, N., (2000) \\"The Skills Development Act: transforming education and training for workers.\\" S A Labour Bulletin 24(2) p 6 – 11. # Erasmus, B.J.& van Dyk, P.S.

In reinterpreting the evidence for mines and counter-mines dug beneath the city's walls during the Sasanian Persian siege which finally destroyed Dura about AD 256, he concluded that the Sasanian attackers had used a Greek strategem on the Roman defenders: they asphyxiated about 20 of them with toxic smoke from burning bitumen and sulphur.

The species is not under any threat of extinction (IUCN Least Concern). Desert froglets occur mainly in dry or moist savanna habitats, principally from the mid-western border of Northern Territory, south-east into western Queensland and New South Wales and the north-east corner of South Australia. They can also be found along the Queensland coast where it has been recorded between Townsville and Cooktown, and as far south as Hervey Bay (300 km north of Brisbane). * Full listing of observations and specimens. == Taxonomy ==  General  The desert froglet is a member of the family Myobatrachidae. However debate exists about its scientific and common names. For instance, because comparative phylogeny studies of Crinia species are not comprehensive, there is debate over the taxonomic accuracy of its species groupings. One exception is the synonymisation of the genus Ranidella with Crinia based on morphological data and serum albumin similarities with R.signifera and C.signifera. In addition, although the term 'froglet' may seem suited as a general descriptor of smaller species, further taxonomic research of Crinia species, such as the desert froglet, is needed to clarify the relevancy of this term.  Genetic Records  Generally the belly of adults is granular (not blotchy pink like the Tasmanian froglet). The male belly is uniformly white or grey in colour, and possibly flecked grey. Whereas the female belly is either white, speckled or boldly blotched with black or grey. The throat of adults lack a median white line, unlike the Wallum froglet; with throats of breeding males white or grey and the chin completely dark. Spots are either inconspicuous or absent on the chest of both genders. Also, adults have distinct dermal fringes on their toes and the hind side of their thighs lack the pink or red coloration of the Quacking Frog. The tympanum is obscure but not hidden unlike the Remote froglet. The length of the adult snout-vent is usually less than 18 mm, which is shorter than the Eastern sign-bearing froglet, and is a pale brown colour or slightly patterned. Additional diagnostic descriptors include: bluntly rounded snout, evenly rounded canthus rostralis, outwardly sloping loreal region, bluntly pointed head (dorsal view), lacks supratympanic fold, elongated tongue, lacks vomerine teeth, toothed upper jaw, vocal sac with slit-like openings on the floor of the mouth. Distal segment of fingers are blunt, not expanded, with roundish sub-articular tubercles (one on 1st and 2nd fingers; two on 3rd and 4th fingers), supernumerary tubercles are present on each palm, two metacarpal tubercles are present, webbing is absent as is the nuptial pad, and subcutaneous glands are present on the base of the 1st finger. Hind limbs are robust with blunt digital segmentation of toes with broad fringes and rounded metatarsal tubercles, supernumerary tubercles are absent indicating the desert froglet does not burrow. Males mature at about 13.0–18.0 cm in length whereas females grow slightly larger to 13.0–18.0 cm.. == Distribution and habitat == * Distribution map. Desert froglets are found in arid regions, especially in areas of black soil, extending across the Australian continent from the Kimberley region to the north-west of New South Wales and much of Queensland. The species is often associated with static, temporary or permanent water bodies where it shelters under leaves. They have also been located within artificial habitats such as farm dams, and sheltering under corrugated iron and timber piles. == Reproduction ==  Advertisement call  The desert froglet is recognised by the 'melodious chirping' call of the adult male, which sounds similar to a House Sparrow. Each call consists of a repeating pattern: two pulses of 60 milliseconds each and 4000 hertz, which is immediately followed by two additional double pulses of decreasing energy and quickening rate, and a brief pause. Calls are distinct from the shorter creaking call of Sloane's froglet, stretched out call of the Eastern sign- bearing froglet, lower pitch of the Wallum froglet, and grating sounds of the Common eastern froglet. Calling males can be found either hiding under vegetation or exposed at water edges.  Life history  Spawns of small eggs are laid as submerged clumps either directly within the water or attached to submerged vegetation. Eggs are black at the animal pole and cream at the vegetal. Tadpole appearance is the same as the Eastern sign-bearing froglet and Common eastern froglet: dark brown in colour, a dextral anal opening, sinistral spiracle, blunt tail, labial papillar row interrupted on anterior and posterior portions, and a labial tooth row pattern of I, 1/1, II. == Threats == Although the desert froglet is not considered to be at threat of extinction, alterations to inland waters have potential to impact their populations, especially when water bodies are isolated and individuals cannot disperse to additional sources. Under these circumstances, any activity that negatively impacts these water bodies may cause species decline, including drinking, fouling and grazing by livestock and feral animals, road construction, non-native plants, groundwater extraction, pollution, tourism, mining, and long-term changes in weather patterns. ==ReferencesFurther reading == * Category:Crinia Category:Amphibians of Queensland Category:Amphibians of New South Wales Category:Amphibians of South Australia Category:Amphibians of the Northern Territory Category:Amphibians described in 1977 Category:Taxonomy articles created by Polbot Category:Frogs of Australia ","title":"Desert froglet"},{"id":"12399999","text":"The quacking frog (Crinia georgiana) also known as the red-thighed frogletBush, B et al. (1995) A Guide to the Reptiles and Frogs of the Perth region, Nedlands, WA University of Western Australia Press. p. 29 is a species of frog in the family Myobatrachidae. It is endemic to Australia. == Description == Crinia georgiana is a short or squat froglet that appears flattened and has a large head and short limbs. Characteristic of its family, this frog has long and unwebbed fingers and toes. The dorsal skin can be smooth, but it is usually bumpy or tubercular, while the underside is finely granular. The genus is polymorphic, however, meaning there is great variation in colour and texture of the skin within each species.Barker, J., Grigg, G. C., & Tyler, M. J. (1995). A field guide to Australian frogs. Chipping Norton, NSW: Surrey Beatty & Sons . In addition, some individuals may have a backside with skin folds, while others do not. Its colouring ranges from orange to brown to almost black on its back and may include brown marbling or brown stripes on either side of its back, which aid in camouflage. The belly of males is dirty-grey, while females have a bright white abdomen; both have a white spot at the base of each limb. The groin and anterior and posterior surfaces of the thigh are bright red and the upper eyelids are either red or golden. Its hands are pale in colour. These traits are characteristic of the quacking frog and make it easily distinguishable from other species. Tadpoles are golden in colour and their tail is transparent. == Size == Females are usually 30–36 mm, while males most often range from 24 to 32 mm, although the smallest calling males can be as small as 20 mm. Although the difference in size between males and females is not significant enough to constitute dimorphism, there is an unusually large variation in size of males in this species, which may be attributed to pressures of sexual selection. == Distribution == This froglet is endemic to Australia, and is found only in south west Western Australia from Gingin in the north, inland to Dumbleyung and east to Cape Le Grand. Most are distributed along the coast, with very few inland due to the necessity of water for survival, especially during breeding, which occurs in water.Davis, R. (1998). Quacking Frog – Crinia georgiana . westernwildlife.com.au It is estimated that there are more than 50,000 adults currently present in the species with the population size remaining stable or increasing slightly. Crinia georgiana is classified as a popular species.Cogger, H. Crinia georgiana' . frogsaustralia.net.au == Conservation status == The quacking frog is listed as \\"Least Concern\\" in terms of its conservation status based on its distribution and presumably large population. Its status is not currently determined to be threatened, though habitat loss due to human settlement and development along the coast of Western Australia may later pose a threat. Fortunately, much of its range is coincidentally located in protected areas, which may alleviate the effects of this threat. However, a certain fungus has been found in some specimens, so parasites may endanger their status in the future. == Habitat == Because water is essential to this species, it is confined to areas of the coastal plains and forests where water is abundant particularly in winter, when breeding occurs. It is often found in shallow water near sandstone settlements or in marshy bogs. In addition, the quaking frog is known to live amongst vegetation or in anthropogenic habitats (i.e., those that result from the activity of humans) such as agricultural lands and rural gardens where water is likely to be plentiful. ==Diet and feeding habits == In general, the diet of a frog is largely made up of insects, although mites, snails, earthworms, spiders, and other small animals are also consumed. Smaller frogs risk being eaten by larger frogs, as cannibalism is not uncommon. While larger frogs will sometimes feed on fish, it does not appear that this is prevalent among Crinia georgiana. Occasionally, grass, seeds, petals, and other vegetation will be found in the stomachs of frogs, but this is assumed to be accidental. In other words, the frog eats the plants only because other prey was resting on it. Most frogs catch their prey via a flick of their tongue. The tongue is coated in a sticky secretion, which allows for the adhesion of the prey to the tongue. The catch is then taken into the mouth and swallowed right away, as frogs do not chew their food and many do not even have teeth. Members of Crinia do have vomerine teeth, which are pairs of teeth-like plates on the roof of the mouth that slant inward, but they appear to be rather unimportant. Once the food is in the stomach, the stomach compresses and abdominal muscles aid in digestion and expulsion of waste.Tyler, M. J. (1976). Frogs. Sydney: Collins . == Call == The call of the quacking frog, just as its name suggests, is described as closely resembling the quack of a duck. There are usually 1–4 quacks in a sequence, but there can be up to 12 and males will respond to the calls of other males with the same amount of notes. The calls are used to attract females who are ready to mate. The call is distinct and loud,Example of the call (WMA file). frogsaustralia.net.au and these frogs will respond to imitations of their call. == Reproduction and development == Crinia georgiana breeds mainly in the winter months, from July to October, usually near granite outcrops, in shallow murky pools. Breeding has also been known to occur in puddles and wheel ruts. Amount of rainfall affects the timing of breeding, as this species usually breeds in temporary ponds that are only full after rain. Temperature can affect the rate of egg lying, which slows when ambient temperatures are very low. However, since water temperature is usually warmer than air temperature, it is unlikely that the water temperature will drop below 2 °C, the temperature necessary to significantly decrease breeding activity. Lunar phasing also affects mating, with higher rates occurring around the full moon. Although it is unclear why this is so, it can be inferred that the sexual activity of both males and females is synchronised by this variable. Fertilisation occurs via amplexus, which lasts about 23 minutes. Amplexus is a form of copulation in which the male grasps the female with his front legs while she lays her eggs and he simultaneously releases fluid containing sperm. Matings in this species are relatively unique in that quacking frogs are polyandrous; about half of all matings involve more than one male, and possibly up to nine, resulting in a brood of offspring with multiple paternities. Polyandrous mating is more likely among smaller males, as large males can monopolize and dominate the female during amplexus. This does not appear to be beneficial, as the efficiency of the sperm does not differ significantly in terms of sperm number, size, motility, and longevity between large and small males. Furthermore, when a single male mates with a female, there is a 90–95% chance that fertilization will be successful, while there is only a 64% chance of success when three to five males mate with one female. Often this drop is due to fights that arise when other males join in an existing act of copulation, reducing the likelihood of successful sperm transfer. Therefore, there is no benefit to polyandry in terms of offspring survival to offset the high cost of reduced fertilization success and occasional female mortality. It is thus unclear why polyandry is prevalent in this species, although it could possibly be due to males wanting to increase their chances of procreation with a limited number of females. When there is a high density of males in an area, they will fight over access to the females, with the larger males usually succeeding and gaining access to the female. Calling also decreases when densities are high, with larger males calling much more frequently than smaller males. Smaller males may refrain from calling in order to conserve energy. Energy is limited due to their size and would only be wasted by trying to compete with larger males. Females are more likely to mate with a calling male, so in order to increase the likelihood of mating success, smaller, non-calling males will often engage in \\"satellite\\" behaviour, especially at low densities. This involves associating themselves with a calling male, and when the female approaches and she and the larger male begin to mate, the smaller male will join and thus force group spawning. Group spawning also occurs at high densities when a male that has secured a calling site mates with a female and others then join in after. The larger, calling male will secure the preferred dorsal amplexus position, while inferior males are forces to take on ventral or dorsolateral positions. The mating, and thus the laying of eggs, occurs in seeps that are shallow and temporary and often dry up before tadpoles metamorphose (roughly 4–7 weeks). This results in unique adaptations, such as the development of Crinia Georgiana tadpoles in eggs that are very large relative to those of other species. This allows them to mature earlier and cope with unpredictable climates. Within the species, tadpoles with larger eggs are more likely to survive to the stage of metamorphosis. Females that lay smaller eggs also lay more of them; it is logical that since smaller eggs have a decreased chance of survival, a female would produce more to increase the chances of regenerating the species. Egg size and number of eggs laid varies unpredictably from female to female, so it is unclear why some lay large eggs while others lay small ones, but more of them. It has been determined that although tadpoles with limited foodstuff (i.e., a smaller egg) have a higher rate of mortality, those that do survive can still complete metamorphosis at the same rate as those that have plentiful food. In addition, if water levels drop, tadpoles can speed up development so as not to remain in such a fragile state while water, a critical resource, is limited. This indicates that the quacking frog has developed adaptations that allow for its survival in the dry climate of Western Australia. == References == Category:Crinia Category:Amphibians of Western Australia Category:Endemic fauna of Australia Category:Amphibians described in 1838 Category:Taxonomy articles created by Polbot Category:Frogs of Australia ","title":"Quacking frog"},{"id":"12400002","text":"The Birs (French: Birse) is a long river in Switzerland that flows through the Jura region and ends as a tributary to the Rhine between Basel and Birsfelden. It is the most important river of the Swiss Jura. ==Course== The Birs has its source in a spring near the Col de Pierre Pertuis at above sea level a little southwest of Tavannes in the Jura bernois. It starts as a proper river; the large amount of water is the product of an extended underground river system. The Birs runs through wider valleys (Vallée de Tavannes) and narrow gorges. Near Delémont, the capital of the canton of Jura, it joins the Sorne and the Scheulte. Between Soyhières and Liesberg, it leaves the French-speaking part of Switzerland, enters the canton of Basel-Landschaft and receives the Lützel from the left. In Laufen it forms a waterfall, which was the source of power and of the name of the city. At the gorge of Angenstein, the river runs into the Birseck, the lowland by Aesch. Between Aesch and Dornach, the Birs is rich in fresh-water crabs, the native species of which are now threatened by the American red crab. Earlier, the Birs was polluted and dammed, but it has largely been restored to its original state. The Reinacherheide is a wildlife preserve with 83 species of bird. The mouth of the Birs was hardly settled until the 18th century. Today, the city of Münchenstein stands there.

It is endemic to Australia and found in Tasmania, southwestern Victoria (including the Grampians), and the extreme southeast of South Australia. ==Description== These frogs measure about in snout–vent length. They are grey or brown above, with scattered, small reddish spots with black edges, sometimes also with irregular, darker markings. The underside is white or light grey and has darker brown or grey flecks or mottling. Males have a bright yellow throat. The skin is smooth or with scattered low warts above, and smooth below. ==Habitat and conservation== Geocrinia laevis live in dry sclerophyll and pine forests at low altitudes. They often occur in damp locations and areas flooded after rain. The larvae develop in egg capsules until the breeding site is flooded, after which they hatch and continue development as aquatic tadpoles. The tadpole phase takes about six months. This species is threatened by habitat clearing for agriculture and grazing, as well as logging in Tasmania. However, the overall population is considered stable, and the species occurs in several protected areas. ==ReferencesExternal links== * Category:Geocrinia Category:Amphibians of South Australia Category:Amphibians of Victoria (Australia) Category:Amphibians of Tasmania Category:Amphibians described in 1864 Category:Taxa named by Albert Günther Category:Taxonomy articles created by Polbot Category:Frogs of Australia ","title":"Geocrinia laevis"},{"id":"12400049","text":"Geocrinia leai, sometimes called Lea's frog, is a species in the taxonomic family, Myobatrachidae and is endemic to southwest Australia.

It is endemic to Southwest Australia. It is part of a complex of species, the Geocrinia roseate frogs, which were previously placed in the genus Crinia by Harrison. It is most easily distinguished from the 5 cogenors of the region by the rosy glow of the belly, given to us by the name. Geocrinia rosea is very similar in appearance to three other Geocrinia species; G. alba, G. lutea and G. vitellina. The usually discrete vomerine teeth of the species are evident in this species. Its colouring, largely brown, perhaps mottled, reveals another distinction between the species. The smooth skin of the creature, slightly tubercular on the upper parts, is a rosy pink below. This may also be flecked or mottled. The male has a dark to black throat, and the discrete darker markings are shared by both species. It is generally 25 mm long when adult. The frog is restricted to the higher rainfall region in around the Karri forest at the southwest tip of the continent. Streams flow into and by the Warren river, and the permanent moisture found there is the haven and restraint. The high rate of endemism in the result of the lack of motility in the species. But spring and summer bring drive to form amplexus, and the poorly travelled males will cry for a mate with four beats of the generic 'tk'. Here the frog remains amongst the depressions and recesses, the female leaving its eggs amidst the fallen timber and dense vegetation of the lush Warren region. The young will emerge from the degrading gelatinous spawn as complete froglets, never swimming in more than the damp floor of their abode. ==References == * Category:Geocrinia Category:Amphibians described in 1927 Category:Amphibians of Western Australia Category:Taxonomy articles created by Polbot Category:Frogs of Australia ","title":"Geocrinia rosea"},{"id":"12400066","text":"The eastern smooth frog (Geocrinia victoriana), or Victorian smooth froglet, is a species of frog in the family Myobatrachidae.
